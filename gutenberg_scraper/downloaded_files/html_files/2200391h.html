  The House In Bloomsbury</h2>
<p>There are some houses whereof the outward aspect is  sealed with the seal of respectability &mdash; houses which inspire confidence in the  minds of the most sceptical of butchers and bakers &mdash; houses at whose area-gates  the tradesman delivers his goods undoubtingly, and from whose spotless  door-steps the vagabond children of the neighbourhood recoil as from a shrine  too sacred for their gambols.</p>
<p>Such a house made its presence obvious, some years  ago, in one of the smaller streets of that west-central region which lies  between Holborn and St. Pancras Church. It is perhaps the nature of  ultra-respectability to be disagreeably conspicuous. The unsullied brightness  of No. 14 Fitzgeorge-street was a standing reproach to every other house in the  dingy thorough-fare. That one spot of cleanliness made the surrounding dirt  cruelly palpable. The muslin curtains in the parlour windows of No. 15 would  not have appeared of such a smoky yellow if the curtains of No. 14 had not been  of such a pharisaical whiteness. Mrs. Magson, at No. 13, was a humble letter of  lodgings, always more or less in arrear with the demands of quarter-day; and it  seemed a hard thing that her door-steps, whereon were expended much labour and  hearthstone &mdash; not to mention house-flannel, which was in itself no unimportant  item in the annual expenses &mdash; should be always thrown in the shade by the  surpassing purity of the steps before No. 14.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with being the very pink and pattern  of respectability, the objectionable house even aspired to a kind of  prettiness. It was as bright, and pleasant, and rural of aspect as any house  within earshot of the roar and rattle of Holborn can be. There were flowers in  the windows; gaudy scarlet geraniums, which seemed to enjoy an immunity from all  the ills to which geraniums are subject, so impossible was it to discover a  faded leaf amongst their greenness, or the presence of blight amidst their  wealth of blossom. There were birdcages within the shadow of the muslin  curtains, and the colouring of the newly-pointed brickwork was agreeably  relieved by the vivid green of Venetian blinds. The freshly-varnished  street-door bore a brass-plate, on which to look was to be dazzled; and the  effect produced by this combination of white door-step, scarlet geranium, green  blind, and brass-plate was obtrusively brilliant.</p>
<p>Those who had been so privileged as to behold the  interior of the house in Fitzgeorge-street brought away with them a sense of  admiration that was the next thing to envy. The pink and pattern of propriety  within, as it was the pink and pattern of propriety without, it excited in  every breast alike a wondering awe, as of a habitation tenanted by some  mysterious being, infinitely superior to the common order of householders.</p>
<p>The inscription on the brass-plate informed the  neighbourhood that No. 14 was occupied by Mr. Sheldon, surgeon-dentist; and the  dwellers in Fitzgeorge-street amused themselves in their leisure hours by  speculative discussions upon the character and pursuits, belongings and surroundings,  of this gentleman.</p>
<p>Of course he was eminently respectable. On that  question no Fitzgeorgian had ever hazarded a doubt. A householder with such a  door-step and such muslin curtains could not be other than the most correct of  mankind; for, if there is any external evidence by which a dissolute life or an  ill-regulated mind will infallibly betray itself, that evidence is to be found  in the yellowness and limpness of muslin window-curtains. The eyes are the  windows of the soul, says the poet; but if a man&rsquo;s eyes are not open to your  inspection, the windows of his house will help you to discover his character as  an individual, and his solidity as a citizen. At least such was the opinion  cherished in Fitzgeorge-street, Russell-square.</p>
<p>The person and habits of Mr. Sheldon were in  perfect harmony with the aspect of the house. The unsullied snow of the  door-step reproduced itself in the unsullied snow of his shirt-front; the  brilliancy of the brass-plate was reflected in the glittering brightness of his  gold-studs; the varnish on the door was equalled by the lustrous surface of his  black-satin waistcoat; the careful pointing of the brickwork was in a manner  imitated by the perfect order of his polished finger-nails and the  irreproachable neatness of his hair and whiskers. No dentist or medical  practitioner of any denomination had inhabited the house in Fitzgeorge-street  before the coming of Philip Sheldon. The house had been unoccupied for upwards  of a year, and was in the last stage of shabbiness and decay, when the bills  disappeared all at once from the windows, and busy painters and bricklayers set  their ladders against the dingy brickwork. Mr. Sheldon took the house on a long  lease, and spent two or three hundred pounds in the embellishment of it. Upon  the completion of all repairs and decorations, two great waggon-loads of  furniture, distinguished by that old fashioned clumsiness which is eminently  suggestive of respectability, arrived from the Euston-square terminus, while a  young man of meditative aspect might have been seen on his knees, now in one  empty chamber, anon in another, performing some species of indoor surveying,  with a three-foot rule, a loose little oblong memorandum-book, and the merest  stump of a square lead-pencil. This was an emissary from the carpet warehouse;  and before nightfall it was known to more than one inhabitant in  Fitzgeorge-street that the stranger was going to lay down new carpets. The  new-comer was evidently of an active and energetic temperament, for within  three days of his arrival the brass-plate on his street-door announced his  profession, while a neat little glass-case, on a level with the eye of the  passing pedestrian, exhibited specimens of his skill in mechanical dentistry,  and afforded instruction and amusement to the boys of the neighbourhood, who  criticised the glistening white teeth and impossibly red gums, displayed behind  the plate-glass, with a like vigour and freedom of language. Nor did Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s announcement of his profession confine itself to the brass-plate and  the glass-case. A shabby-genteel young man pervaded the neighbourhood for some  days after the surgeon-dentist&rsquo;s advent, knocking a postman&rsquo;s knock, which only  lacked the galvanic sharpness of the professional touch, and delivering  neatly-printed circulars to the effect that Mr. Sheldon, surgeon-dentist, of 14  Fitzgeorge-street, had invented some novel method of adjusting false teeth,  incomparably superior to any existing method, and that he had, further,  patented an improvement on nature in the way of coral gums, the name whereof  was an unpronounceable compound of Greek and Latin, calculated to awaken an  awful reverence in the unprofessional and unclassical mind.</p>
<p>The Fitzgeorgians shook their heads with prophetic  solemnity as they read these circulars. Struggling householders, who find it a  hard task to keep the two ends which never have met and never will meet from  growing farther and farther asunder every year, are apt to derive a dreary kind  of satisfaction from the contemplation of another man&rsquo;s impending ruin.  Fitzgeorge-street and its neighbourhood had existed without the services of a  dentist, but it was very doubtful that a dentist would be able to exist on the  custom to be obtained in Fitzgeorge-street. Mr. Sheldon may, perhaps, have  pitched his tent under the impression that wherever there was mankind there was  likely to be toothache, and that the healer of an ill so common to frail  humanity could scarcely fail to earn his bread, let him establish his abode of  horror where he might. For some time after his arrival people watched him and  wondered about him, and regarded him a little suspiciously, in spite of the  substantial clumsiness of his furniture and the unwinking brightness of his  windows. His neighbours asked one another how long all that outward semblance  of prosperity would last; and there was sinister meaning in the question.</p>
<p>The Fitzgeorgians were not a little surprised, and  were perhaps just a little disappointed, on finding that the newly-established  dentist did manage to hold his ground somehow or other, and that the muslin  curtains were renewed again and again in all their spotless purity; that the  supplies of rotten-stone and oil, hearthstone and house-flannel, were unfailing  as a perennial spring; and that the unsullied snow of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s  shirt-fronts retained its primeval whiteness. Wonderland suspicion gave place  to a half-envious respect. Whether much custom came to the dentist no one could  decide. There is no trade or profession in which the struggling man will not  receive some faint show of encouragement. Pedestrians of agonised aspect, with  handkerchiefs held convulsively before their mouths, were seen to rush wildly  towards the dentist&rsquo;s door, then pause for a moment, stricken by a sudden  terror, and anon feebly pull the handle of an inflexible bell. Cabs had been  heard to approach that fatal door &mdash; generally on wet days; for there seems to  be a kind of fitness in the choice of damp and dismal weather for the  extraction of teeth. Elderly ladies and gentlemen had been known to come many  times to the Fitzgeorgian mansion. There was a legend of an old lady who had  been seen to arrive in a brougham, especially weird and nut-crackery of aspect,  and to depart half an hour afterwards a beautified and renovated creature. One  half of the Fitzgeorgians declared that Mr. Sheldon had established a very nice  little practice, and was saving money; while the other half were still  despondent, and opined that the dentist had private property, and was eating up  his little capital. It transpired in course of time that Mr. Sheldon had left  his native town of Little Barlingford, in Yorkshire, where his father and  grandfather had been surgeon-dentists before him, to establish himself in  London. He had disposed advantageously of an excellent practice, and had  transferred his household goods &mdash; the ponderous chairs and tables, the wood  whereof had deepened and mellowed in tint under the indefatigable hand of his  grandmother &mdash; to the metropolis, speculating on the chance that his talents and  appearance, address and industry, could scarcely fail to achieve a position. It  was further known that he had a brother, an attorney in Gray&rsquo;s Inn, who visited  him very frequently; that he had few other friends or acquaintance; that he was  a shining example of steadiness and sobriety; that he was on the sunnier side  of thirty, a bachelor, and very good-looking; and that his household was  comprised of a grim-visaged active old woman imported from Barlingford, a girl  who ran errands, and a boy who opened the door, attended to the  consulting-room, and did some mysterious work at odd times with a file and  sundry queer lumps of plaster-of-paris, beeswax, and bone, in a dark little  shed abutting on the yard at the back of the house. This much had the  inhabitants of Fitzgeorge-street discovered respecting Mr. Sheldon when he had  been amongst them four years; but they had discovered no more. He had made no  local acquaintances, nor had he sought to make any. Those of his neighbours who  had seen the interior of his house had entered it as patients. They left it as  much pleased with Mr. Sheldon as one can be with a man at whose hands one has  just undergone martyrdom, and circulated a very flattering report of the  dentist&rsquo;s agreeable manners and delicate white handkerchief, fragrant with the  odour of eau-de-Cologne. For the rest, Philip Sheldon lived his own life, and  dreamed his own dreams. His opposite neighbours, who watched him on sultry  summer evenings as he lounged near an open window smoking his cigar, had no  more knowledge of his thoughts and fancies than they might have had if he had  been a Calmuck Tartar or an Abyssinian chief.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  Philip Sheldon Reads The &ldquo;Lancet&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Fitzgeorge-Street was chill and dreary of aspect,  under a gray March sky, when Mr. Sheldon returned to it after a week&rsquo;s absence  from London. He had been to Little Barlingford, and had spent his brief holiday  among old friends and acquaintance. The weather had not been in favour of that  driving hither and thither in dog-carts, or riding rakish horses long distances  to beat up old companions, which is accounted pleasure on such occasions. The  blustrous winds of an unusually bitter March had buffeted Mr. Sheldon in the  streets of his native town, and had almost blown him off the door-steps of his  kindred. So it is scarcely strange if he returned to town looking none the  better for his excursion. He looked considerably the worse for his week&rsquo;s  absence, the old Yorkshire-woman said, as she waited upon him while he ate a  chop and drank two large cups of very strong tea.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon made short work of his impromptu meal.  He seemed anxious to put an end to his housekeeper&rsquo;s affectionate interest in  himself and his health, and to get her out of the room. She had nursed him  nearly thirty years before, and the recollection that she had been very  familiar with him when he was a handsome black-eyed baby, with a tendency to  become suddenly stiff of body and crimson of visage without any obvious  provocation, inclined her to take occasional liberties now. She watched him  furtively as he sat in a big high-backed arm-chair staring moodily at the  struggling fire, and would fain have questioned him a little about Barlingford  and Barlingford people.</p>
<p>But Philip Sheldon was not a man with whom even a  superannuated nurse can venture to take many liberties. He was a good master,  paid his servants their wages with unfailing punctuality, and gave very little  trouble. But he was the last person in the world upon whom a garrulous woman  could venture to inflict her rambling discourse; as Nancy Woolper &mdash; by  courtesy, Mrs. Woolper &mdash; was fain to confess to her next-door neighbour, Mrs.  Magson, when her master was the subject of an afternoon gossip. The heads of a  household may inhabit a neighbourhood for years without becoming acquainted  even with the outward aspect of their neighbours; but in the lordly servants&rsquo;  halls of the West, or the modest kitchens of Bloomsbury, there will be  interchange of civilities and friendly &ldquo;droppings in&rdquo; to tea or supper, let the  master of the house be never so ungregarious a creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can take the tea-things, Nancy,&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon  said presently, arousing himself suddenly from that sombre reverie in which he  had been absorbed for the last ten minutes; &ldquo;I am going to be very busy  to-night, and I expect Mr. George in the course of the evening. Mind, I am not  at home to anybody but him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman arranged the tea-things on her tray,  but still kept a furtive watch on her master, who sat with his head a little  bent, and his bright black eyes fixed on the fire with that intensity of gaze  peculiar to eyes which see something far away from the object they seem to  contemplate. She was in the habit of watching Mr. Sheldon rather curiously at  all times, for she had never quite got over a difficulty in realising the fact  that the black-eyed baby with whom she had been so intimate <em>could</em> have developed into this  self-contained inflexible young man, whose thoughts were so very far away from  her. To-night she watched him more intently than she was accustomed to do, for  to-night there was some change in his face which she was trying in a dim way to  account for.</p>
<p>He looked up from the fire suddenly, and found her  eyes fixed upon him.
  It may be that he had been disturbed by a semi-consciousness of that
  curious gaze, for he looked at her angrily,&mdash;&ldquo;What are you staring at,
  Nancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not the first time he had encountered her  watchful eyes and asked the same impatient question. But Mrs. Woolper possessed  that north-country quickness of intellect which is generally equal to an emergency,  and was always ready with some question or suggestion which went to prove that  she had just fixed her eyes on her master, inspired by some anxiety about his  interests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just a-thinking, sir,&rdquo; she said, meeting his  stern glance unflinchingly with her little sharp gray eyes, &ldquo;I was just  a-thinking &mdash; you said not at home to <em>any  one</em>, except Mr. George. If it should be a person in a cab wanting their  teeth out sudden &mdash; and if anything could make toothache more general in this  neighbourhood it would be these March winds &mdash; if it should be a patient, sir,  in a cab &mdash; &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dentist interrupted her with a short bitter  laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither March winds nor April showers are likely  to bring me patients, Nancy, on foot or in cabs, and you ought to know it. If  it&rsquo;s a patient, ask him in, by all means, and give him last Saturday week&rsquo;s <em>Times</em> to read, while I rub the rust off  my forceps. There, that will do; take your tray &mdash; or, stop; I&rsquo;ve some news to  tell you.&rdquo; He rose, and stood with his back to the fire and his eyes bent upon  the hearthrug, while Mrs. Woolper waited by the table, with the tray packed  ready for removal. Her master kept her waiting so for some minutes, and then  turned his face half away from her, and contemplated himself absently in the  glass while he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember Mrs. Halliday?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think I did, sir; Miss Georgina Cradock  that was &mdash; Miss Georgy they called her; your first sweetheart. And how she  could ever marry that big awkward Halliday is more than I can make out. Poor  fondy! I suppose she was took with those great round blue eyes and red whiskers  of his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her mother and father were &lsquo;took&rsquo; by his  comfortable farmhouse and well-stocked farm, Nancy,&rdquo; answered Mr. Sheldon,  still contemplating himself in the glass. &ldquo;Georgy had very little to do with  it. She is one of those women who let other people think for them. However, Tom  is an excellent fellow, and Georgy was a lucky girl to catch such a husband.  Any little flirtation there may have been between her and me was over and done with  long before she married Tom. It never was more than a flirtation; and I&rsquo;ve  flirted with a good many Barlingford girls in my time, as you know, Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not often that Mr. Sheldon condescended to  be so communicative to his housekeeper. The old woman nodded and chuckled,  delighted by her master&rsquo;s unwonted friendliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I drove over to Hyley while I was at home, Nancy,&rdquo;  continued the dentist &mdash; he called Barlingford home still, though he had broken  most of the links that had bound him to it&mdash; &ldquo;and dined with the Hallidays.  Georgy is as pretty as ever, and she and Tom get on capitally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any children, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One girl,&rdquo; answered Mr. Sheldon carelessly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s  at school in Scarborough, and I didn&rsquo;t see her; but I hear she&rsquo;s a fine  bouncing lass. I had a very pleasant day with the Hallidays. Tom has sold his  farm; that part of the world doesn&rsquo;t suit him, it seems &mdash; too cold and bleak  for him. He&rsquo;s one of those big burly-looking men who seem as if they could  knock you down with a little finger, and who shiver at every puff of wind. I  don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll make old bones, Nancy. But that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. I  daresay he&rsquo;s good for another ten years; or I&rsquo;m sure I hope so, on Georgy&rsquo;s  account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was right down soft of him to sell Hyley Farm,  though,&rdquo; said Nancy reflectively; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard tell as it&rsquo;s the best land for  forty mile round Barlingford. But he got a rare good price for it, I&rsquo;ll lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, yes; he sold the property uncommonly well, he  tells me. You know if a north-countryman gets the chance of making a profit, he  never lets it slip through his fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Woolper received this compliment to her  countrymen with a gratified grin, and Mr. Sheldon went on talking, still  looking at the reflection of his handsome face in the glass, and pulling his  whiskers meditatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now as Tom was made for a farmer and nothing but a  farmer, he must find land somewhere in a climate that does suit him; so his  friends have advised him to try a place in Devonshire or Cornwall, where he may  train his myrtles and roses over his roof, and grow green peas for the London  markets as late as November. There are such places to be had if he bides his  time, and he&rsquo;s coming to town next week to look about him. So, as Georgy and he  would be about as capable of taking care of themselves in London as a couple of  children, I have recommended them to take up their quarters here. They&rsquo;ll have  their lodgings for nothing, and we shall chum together on the Yorkshire system;  for of course I can&rsquo;t afford to keep a couple of visitors for a month at a  stretch. Do you think you shall be able to manage for us, Nancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, yes, I&rsquo;ll manage well enough. I&rsquo;m not one of  your lazy London lasses that take half an hour to wipe a teacup. I&rsquo;ll manage  easy enough. Mr. and Mrs. Halliday will be having your room, I&rsquo;ll lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; give them the best room, by all means. I can  sleep anywhere. And now go downstairs and think it over, Nancy. I must get to  my work. I&rsquo;ve some letters that must be written to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Woolper departed with her tray, gratified by  her master&rsquo;s unwonted familiarity, and not ill pleased by the thought of  visitors. They would cause a great deal of trouble, certainly; but the monotony  of Nancy&rsquo;s easy life had grown so oppressive to her as to render the idea of  any variety pleasing. And then there would be the pleasure of making that  iniquitous creature the London lass bestir herself, and there would be  furthermore the advantage of certain little perquisites which a clever manager  always secures to herself in a house where there is much eating and drinking.  Mr. Sheldon himself had lived like a modern anchorite for the last four years;  and Mrs. Woolper, who was pretty well acquainted with the state of his  finances, had pinched and contrived for his benefit, or rather for the benefit  of the black-eyed baby she had nursed nine-and-twenty years before. For his  sake she had been careful and honest, willing to forego all the small profits  to which she held herself entitled; but if well-to-do people were going to  share her master&rsquo;s expenses, there would be no longer need for such scrupulous  integrity; and if things were rightly managed, Thomas Halliday might be made to  bear the entire cost of the household during his month&rsquo;s visit on the Yorkshire  system.</p>
<p>While Mrs. Woolper meditated upon her domestic  duties, the master of the domicile abandoned himself to reflections which were  apparently of a very serious character. He brought a leathern desk from a  side-table, unlocked it, and took out a quire of paper; but he made no further  advance towards the writing of those letters on account of which he had  dismissed his housekeeper. He sat, with his elbows on the table, nibbling the  end of a wooden penholder, and staring at the opposite wall. His face looked  pale and haggard in the light of the gas, and the eyes, fixed in that vacant  stare, had a feverish brightness.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon was a handsome man &mdash; eminently  handsome, according to the popular notion of masculine beauty; and if the  popular ideal has been a little vulgarised by the waxen gentlemen on whose  finely-moulded foreheads the wig-maker is wont to display the specimens of his  art, that is no discredit to Mr. Sheldon. His features were regular; the nose a  handsome aquiline; the mouth firm and well modelled; the chin and jaw rather  heavier than in the waxen ideal of the hair-dresser; the forehead very  prominent in the region of the perceptives, but obviously wanting in the higher  faculties. The eye of the phrenologist, unaided by his fingers, must have  failed to discover the secrets of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s organisation; for one of the  dentist&rsquo;s strong points was his hair, which was very luxuriant, and which he  wore in artfully-arranged masses that passed for curls, but which owed their  undulating grace rather to a skilful manipulation than to any natural tendency.  It has been said that the rulers of the world are straight-haired men; and Mr.  Sheldon might have been a Napoleon III. so far as regards this special  attribute. His hair was of a dense black, and his whiskers of the same sombre  hue. These carefully-arranged whiskers were another of the dentist&rsquo;s strong  points; and the third strong point was his teeth, the perfection whereof was a  fine advertisement when considered in a professional light. The teeth were  rather too large and square for a painter&rsquo;s or a poet&rsquo;s notion of beauty, and  were apt to suggest an unpleasant image of some sleek brindled creature  crunching human bones in an Indian jungle. But they were handsome teeth  notwithstanding, and their flashing whiteness made an effective contrast to the  clear sallow tint of the dentist&rsquo;s complexion.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon was a man of industrious habits, &mdash; fond  indeed of work, and distinguished by a persistent activity in the carrying out  of any labour he had planned for himself. He was not prone to the indulgence of  idle reveries or agreeable day-dreams. Thought with him was labour; it was the  &ldquo;thinking out&rdquo; of future work to be done, and it was an operation as precise  and mathematical as the actual labour that resulted therefrom. The contents of  his brain were as well kept as a careful trader&rsquo;s ledger. He had his thoughts  docketed and indexed, and rarely wasted the smallest portion of his time in  searching for an idea. Tonight he sat thinking until he was interrupted by a  loud double knock, which was evidently familiar to him, for he muttered  &ldquo;George!&rdquo; pushed aside his desk, and took up his stand upon the hearthrug,  ready to receive the expected visitor.</p>
<p>There was the sound of a man&rsquo;s voice below, &mdash; very  like Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s own voice; then a quick firm tread on the stairs; and  then the door was opened, and a man, who himself was very like Philip Sheldon,  came into the room. This was the dentist&rsquo;s brother George, two years his  junior. The likeness between the two men was in no way marvellous, but it was  nevertheless very obvious. You could scarcely have mistaken one man for the  other, but you could hardly have failed to perceive that the two men were  brothers. They resembled each other more closely in form than in face. They  were of the same height &mdash; both tall and strongly built. Both had black eyes  with a hard brightness in them, black whiskers, black hair, sinewy hands with  prominent knuckles, square finger-tops, and bony wrists. Each man seemed the  personification of savage health and vigour, smoothed and shapened in accordance  with the prejudices of civilised life. Looking at these two men for the first  time, you might approve or disapprove their appearance; they might impress you  favourably or unfavourably; but you could scarcely fail to be reminded vaguely  of strong, bright-eyed, savage creatures, beautiful and graceful after their  kind, but dangerous and fatal to man.</p>
<p>The brothers greeted each other with a friendly  nod. They were a great deal too practical to indulge in any sentimental display  of fraternal affection. They liked each other very well, and were useful to  each other, and took their pleasure together on those rare occasions when they  were weak enough to waste time upon unprofitable pleasure; but neither of them  would have comprehended the possibility of anything beyond this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old fellow,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re  back again. You&rsquo;re looking rather seedy, though. I suppose you knocked about a  good deal down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a night or two of it with Halliday and the  old set. He&rsquo;s going it rather fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Sheldon the younger; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a  pity he doesn&rsquo;t go it a little faster, and go off the hooks altogether, so that  you might marry Georgy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know that Georgy would have me, if he did  leave her a widow?&rdquo; asked Philip dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, she&rsquo;d have you fast enough. She used to be very  sweet upon you before she married Tom; and even if she has forgotten all that,  she&rsquo;d have you if you asked her. She&rsquo;d be afraid to say no. She was always more  or less afraid of you, you know, Phil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. She was a nice little  thing enough; but she knew how to drop a poor sweetheart and take up with a  rich one, in spite of her simplicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, that was the old parties&rsquo; doing. Georgy would  have jumped into a cauldron of boiling oil if her mother and father had told  her she must do it. Don&rsquo;t you remember when we were children together how  afraid she used to be of spoiling her frocks? I don&rsquo;t believe she married Tom  Halliday of her own free will, any more than she stood in the corner of her own  free will after she&rsquo;d torn her frock, as I&rsquo;ve seen her stand twenty times. She  stood in the corner because they told her she must; and she married Tom for the  same reason, and I don&rsquo;t suppose she&rsquo;s been particularly happy with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s her look-out,&rdquo; answered Philip  gloomily; &ldquo;I know I want a rich wife badly enough. Things are about as bad with  me as they can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they <em>are</em> rather piscatorial. The elderly dowagers don&rsquo;t come up to time, eh? Very few  orders for the complete set at ten-pound-ten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took about seventy pounds last year,&rdquo; said the  dentist, &ldquo;and my expenses are something like five pounds a week. I&rsquo;ve been  making up the deficiency out of the money I got for the Barlingford business,  thinking I should be able to stand out and make a connection; but the  connection gets more disconnected every year. I suppose people came to me at  first for the novelty of the thing, for I had a sprinkling of decent patients  for the first twelve months or so. But now I might as well throw my money into  the gutter as spend it on circulars or advertisements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a young woman with twenty thousand pounds and  something amiss with her jaw hasn&rsquo;t turned up yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, nor an old woman either. I wouldn&rsquo;t stick at  the age, if the money was all right,&rdquo; answered Mr. Sheldon bitterly.</p>
<p>The younger brother shrugged his shoulders and  plunged his hands into his trousers-pockets with a gesture of seriocomic  despair. He was the livelier of the two, and affected a slanginess of dress and  talk and manner, a certain &ldquo;horsey&rdquo; style, very different from his elder  brother&rsquo;s studied respectability of costume and bearing. His clothes were of a  loose sporting cut, and always odorous with stale tobacco. He wore a good deal  of finery in the shape of studs and pins and dangling lockets and fusee-boxes;  his whiskers were more obtrusive than his brother&rsquo;s, and he wore a moustache in  addition &mdash; a thick ragged black moustache, which would have become a guerilla  chieftain rather than a dweller amidst the quiet courts and squares of Gray&rsquo;s  Inn. His position as a lawyer was not much better than that of Philip as a  dentist; but he had his own plans for making a fortune, and hoped to win for  himself a larger fortune than is often made in the law. He was a hunter of  genealogies, a grubber-up of forgotten facts, a joiner of broken links, a kind  of legal resurrectionist, a digger in the dust and ashes of the past; and he  expected in due time to dig up a treasure rich enough to reward the labour and  patience of half a lifetime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can afford to wait till I&rsquo;m forty for my good  luck,&rdquo; he said to his brother sometimes in moments of expansion; &ldquo;and then I  shall have ten years in which to enjoy myself, and twenty more in which I shall  have life enough left to eat good dinners and drink good wine, and grumble  about the degeneracy of things in general, after the manner of elderly human  nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men stood one on each side of the hearth;  George looking at his brother, Philip looking down at the fire, with his eyes  shaded by their thick black lashes. The fire had become dull and hollow. George  bent down presently and stirred the coals impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one thing I hate more than, another &mdash;  and I hate a good many things &mdash; it&rsquo;s a bad fire,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Barlingford &mdash;  lively as ever, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much livelier than it was when we left it.  Things have gone amiss with me in London, and I&rsquo;ve been more than once sorely  tempted to make an end of my difficulties with a razor or a few drops of  prussic acid; but when I saw the dull gray streets and the square gray houses,  and the empty market-place, and the Baptist chapel, and the Unitarian chapel,  and the big stony church, and heard the dreary bells ding-donging for evening  service, I wondered how I could ever have existed a week in such a place. I had  rather sweep a crossing in London than occupy the best house in Barlingford,  and I told Tom Halliday so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Tom is coming to London I understand by your  letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has sold Hyley, and wants to find a place  in the west of England. The north doesn&rsquo;t suit his chest. He and Georgy are  coming up to town for a few weeks, so I&rsquo;ve asked them to stay here. I may as  well make some use of the house, for it&rsquo;s very little good in a professional  sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; muttered George; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see your  motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no particular motive. Tom&rsquo;s a good fellow,  and his company will be better than an empty house. The visit won&rsquo;t cost me  anything &mdash; Halliday is to go shares in the housekeeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you may find it answer that way,&rdquo; replied  Mr. Sheldon the younger, who considered that every action of a man&rsquo;s life ought  to be made to &ldquo;answer&rdquo; in some way. &ldquo;But I should think you would be rather  bored by the arrangement: Tom&rsquo;s a very good fellow in his way, and a great  friend of mine, but he&rsquo;s rather an empty-headed animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject dropped here, and the brothers went on  talking of Barlingford and Barlingford people &mdash; the few remaining kindred whose  existence made a kind of link between the two men and their native town, and  the boon companions of their early manhood. The dentist produced the remnant of  a bottle of whisky from the sideboard, and rang for hot water and sugar,  wherewith to brew grog, for his own and his brother&rsquo;s refreshment; but the  conversation flagged nevertheless. Philip Sheldon was dull and absent, answering  his companion at random every now and then, much to that gentleman&rsquo;s  aggravation; and he owned at last to being thoroughly tired and worn out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The journey from Barlingford in a slow train is no  joke, you know, George, and I couldn&rsquo;t afford the express,&rdquo; he said  apologetically, when his brother upbraided him for his distraction of manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I should think you&rsquo;d better go to bed,&rdquo;  answered Mr. Sheldon the younger, who had smoked a couple of cigars, and  consumed the contents of the whisky-bottle; &ldquo;so I&rsquo;ll take myself off. I told  you how uncommonly seedy you were looking when I first came in. When do you  expect Tom and his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So soon! Well, good-night, old fellow; I shall see  you before they come, I daresay. You might as well drop in upon me at my place  to-morrow night. I&rsquo;m hard at work on a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your old kind of work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, yes. I don&rsquo;t get much work of any other kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll never get much good out of  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. A man who sits down to whist may  have a run of ill-luck before he gets a decent hand; but the good cards are  sure to come if he only sits long enough. Every man has his chance, depend upon  it, Phil, if he knows how to watch for it; but there are so many men who get  tired and go to sleep before their chances come to them. I&rsquo;ve wasted a good  deal of time, and a good deal of labour; but the ace of trumps is in the pack,  and it must turn up sooner or later. Ta-ta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Sheldon nodded and departed, whistling gaily  as he walked away from his brother&rsquo;s door. Philip heard him, and turned his  chair to the fire with a movement of impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be uncommonly clever, my dear George,&rdquo;  soliloquised the dentist, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll never make a fortune by reading wills and  hunting in parish-registers for heirs-at-law. A big lump of money is not very  likely to go a-begging while any one who can fudge up the faintest pretence of  a claim to it is above ground. No, no, my lad, you must find a better way than  that before you&rsquo;ll make your fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire had burnt low again, and Mr. Sheldon sat  staring gloomily at the blackening coals. Things were very bad with him &mdash; he  had not cared to confess how bad they were, when he had discussed his affairs  with his brother. Those neighbours and passers-by who admired the trim  brightness of the dentist&rsquo;s abode had no suspicion that the master of that  respectable house was in the hands of the Jews, and that the hearthstone which  whitened his door-step was paid for out of Israelitish coffers. The dentist&rsquo;s philosophy  was all of this world, and he knew that the soldier of fortune, who would fain  be a conqueror in the great battle, must needs keep his plumage undrabbled and  the golden facings of his uniform untarnished, let his wounds be never so  desperate.</p>
<p>Having found his attempt to establish a practice in  Fitzgeorge-street a failure, the only course open to Mr. Sheldon, as a man of  the world, was to transfer his failure to somebody else, with more or less  profit to himself. To this end he preserved the spotless purity of his muslin  curtains, though the starch that stiffened them and the bleaching-powder that  whitened them were bought with money for which he was to pay sixty per cent. To  this end he nursed that wan shadow of a practice, and sustained that appearance  of respectability which, in a world where appearance stands for so much, is in  itself a kind of capital. It certainly was dull dreary work to hold the citadel  of No. 14 Fitzgeorge-street, against the besieger Poverty; but the dentist  stood his ground pertinaciously, knowing that if he only waited long enough,  the dupe who was to be his victim would come, and knowing also that there might  arrive a day when it would be very useful for him to be able to refer to four  years&rsquo; unblemished respectability as a Bloomsbury householder. He had his lines  set in several shady places for that unhappy fish with a small capital, and he  had been tantalised by more than one nibble; but he made no open show of his  desire to sell his business &mdash; since a business that is obviously in the market  seems scarcely worth any man&rsquo;s purchase.</p>
<p>Things had of late grown worse with him every day;  for every interval of twenty-four hours sinks a man so much the deeper in the  mire when renewed accommodation-bills with his name upon them are ripening in  the iron safes of Judah. Philip Sheldon found himself sinking gradually and  almost imperceptibly into that bottomless pit of difficulty in whose black  depths the demon Insolvency holds his dreary court. While his little capital  lasted he had kept himself clear of debt, but that being exhausted, and his  practice growing worse day by day, he had been fain to seek assistance from  money-lenders; and now even the money-lenders were tired of him. The chair in  which he sat, the poker which he swung slowly to and fro as he bent over his  hearth, were not his own. One of his Jewish creditors had a bill of sale on his  furniture, and he might come home any day to find the auctioneer&rsquo;s bills  plastered against the wall of his house, and the auctioneer&rsquo;s clerk busy with  the catalogue of his possessions. If the expected victim came now to buy his  practice, the sacrifice would be made too late to serve his interest. The men  who had lent him the money would be the sole gainers by the bargain.</p>
<p>Seldom does a man find himself face to face with a  blacker prospect than that which lay before Philip Sheldon; and yet his manner  to-night was not the dull blank apathy of despair. It was the manner of a man  whose brain is occupied by busy thoughts; who has some elaborate scheme to map  out and arrange before he is called upon to carry his plans into action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a good business for me,&rdquo; he muttered,  &ldquo;if I had pluck enough to carry it through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fire went out as he sat swinging the poker  backwards and forwards. The clocks of Bloomsbury and St. Pancras struck twelve,  and still Philip Sheldon pondered and plotted by that dreary hearth. The  servants had retired at eleven, after a good deal of blundering with bars and  shutters, and unnecessary banging of doors. That unearthly silence peculiar to  houses after midnight reigned in Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s domicile, and he could hear the  voices of distant roisterers, and the miauling of neighbouring cats, with a  painful distinctness as he sat brooding in his silent room. The fact that a  mahogany chiffonier in a corner gave utterance to a faint groan occasionally,  as of some feeble creature in pain, afforded him no annoyance. He was superior  to superstitious fancies, and all the rappings and scratchings of spirit-land  would have failed to disturb his equanimity. He was a strictly practical man &mdash;  one of those men who are always ready, with a stump of lead-pencil and the back  of a letter, to reduce everything in creation to figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had better read up that business before they  come,&rdquo; he said, when he had to all appearance &ldquo;thought out&rdquo; the subject of his  reverie. &ldquo;No time so good as this for doing it quietly. One never knows who is  spying about in the daytime.&rdquo; He looked at his watch, and then went to a  cupboard, where there were bundles of wood and matches and old newspapers, &mdash;  for it was his habit to light his own fire occasionally when he worked  unusually late at night or early in the morning. He relighted his fire now as  cleverly as any housemaid in Bloomsbury, and stood watching it till it burned  briskly. Then he lit a taper, and went downstairs to the professional  torture-chamber. The tall horsehair chair looked unutterably awful in the dim  glimmer of the taper, and a nervous person could almost have fancied it  occupied by the ghost of some patient who had expired under the agony of the  forceps. Mr. Sheldon lighted the gas in a movable branch which he was in the  habit of turning almost into the mouths of the patients who consulted him at  night. There was a cupboard on each side of the mantelpiece, and it was in  these two cupboards that the dentist kept his professional library. His books  did not form a very valuable collection, but he kept the cupboards constantly  locked nevertheless.</p>
<p>He took the key from his waistcoat-pocket, opened  one of the cupboards, and selected a book from a row of dingy-looking volumes.  He carried the book to the room above, where he seated himself under the gas,  and opened the volume at a place in which there was a scrap of paper, evidently  left there as a mark. The book was a volume of the <em>Lancet</em>, and in this book he read with close attention until the  Bloomsbury clocks struck three.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  Mr. And Mrs. Halliday</h2>
<p>Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s visitors arrived in due course. They  were provincial people of the middle class, accounted monstrously genteel in  their own neighbourhood, but in nowise resembling Londoners of the same rank.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Halliday was a big, loud-spoken,  good-tempered Yorkshireman, who had inherited a comfortable little estate from  a plodding, money-making father, and for whom life had been very easy. He was a  farmer, and nothing but a farmer; a man for whom the supremest pleasure of  existence was a cattle-show or a country horse-fair. The farm upon which he had  been born and brought up was situated about six miles from Barlingford, and all  the delights of his boyhood and youth were associated with that small market  town. He and the two Sheldons had been schoolfellows, and afterwards boon  companions, taking such pleasure as was obtainable in Barlingford together;  flirting with the same provincial beauties at prim tea-parties in the winter,  and getting up friendly picnics in the summer &mdash; picnics at which eating and  drinking were the leading features of the day&rsquo;s entertainment. Mr. Halliday had  always regarded George and Philip Sheldon with that reverential admiration  which a stupid man, who is conscious of his own mental inferiority, generally  feels for a clever friend and companion. But he was also fully aware of the  advantage which a rich man possesses over a poor one, and would not have  exchanged the fertile acres of Hyley for the intellectual gifts of his  schoolfellows. He had found the substantial value of his comfortably furnished  house and well-stocked farm when he and his friend Philip Sheldon became suitors  for the hand of Georgina Cradock, youngest daughter of a Barlingford attorney,  who lived next door to the Barlingford dentist, Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s father. Philip  and the girl had been playfellows in the long-walled gardens behind the two  houses, and there had been a brotherly and sisterly intimacy between the  juvenile members of the two families. But when Philip and Georgina met at the  Barlingford tea-parties in later years, the parental powers frowned upon any  renewal of that childish friendship. Miss Cradock had no portion, and the  worthy solicitor her father was a prudent man, who was apt to look for the  promise of domestic happiness in the plate-basket and the linen-press, rather  than for such superficial qualifications as black whiskers and white teeth. So  poor Philip was &ldquo;thrown over the bridge,&rdquo; as he said himself, and Georgy  Cradock married Mr. Halliday, with all attendant ceremony and splendour,  according to the &ldquo;lights&rdquo; of Barlingford gentry.</p>
<p>But this provincial bride&rsquo;s story was no passionate  record of anguish and tears. The Barlingford Juliet had liked Romeo as much as  she was capable of liking any one; but when Papa Capulet insisted on her union  with Paris, she accepted her destiny with decent resignation, and, in the  absence of any sympathetic father confessor, was fain to seek consolation from  a more mundane individual in the person of the Barlingford milliner. Nor did  Philip Sheldon give evidence of any extravagant despair. His father was  something of a doctor as well as a dentist; and there were plenty of dark  little phials lurking on the shelves of his surgery in which the young man  could have found &ldquo;mortal drugs&rdquo; without the aid of the apothecary, had he been  so minded. Happily no such desperate idea ever occurred to him in connection  with his grief. He held himself sulkily aloof from Mr. and Mrs. Halliday for  some time after their marriage, and allowed people to see that he considered  himself very hardly used; but Prudence, which had always been Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s  counsellor, proved herself also his consoler in this crisis of his life. A  careful consideration of his own interests led him to perceive that the  successful result of his love-suit would have been about the worst thing that  could have happened to him.</p>
<p>Georgina had no money. All was said in that. As the  young dentist&rsquo;s worldly wisdom ripened with experience, he discovered that the  worldly ease of the best man in Barlingford was something like that of a  canary-bird who inhabits a clean cage and is supplied with abundant seed and  water. The cage is eminently comfortable, and the sleepy, respectable, elderly  bird sighs for no better abiding-place, no wider prospect than that patch of  the universe which he sees between the bars. But now and then there is hatched  a wild young fledgeling, which beats its wings against the inexorable wires,  and would fain soar away into that wide outer world, to prosper or perish in  its freedom.</p>
<p>Before Georgy had been married a year, her sometime  lover had fully resigned himself to the existing state of things, and was on  the best possible terms with his friend Tom. He could eat his dinner in the  comfortable house at Hyley with an excellent appetite; for there was a gulf  between him and his old love far wider than any that had been dug by that  ceremonial in the parish church of Barlingford. Philip Sheldon had awakened to  the consciousness that life in his native town was little more than a kind of  animal vegetation &mdash; the life of some pulpy invertebrate creature, which sprawls  helplessly upon the sands whereon the wave has deposited it, and may be cloven  in half without feeling itself noticeably worse for the operation. He had  awakened to the knowledge that there was a wider and more agreeable world  beyond that little provincial borough, and that a handsome face and figure and  a vigorous intellect were commodities for which there must be some kind of  market.</p>
<p>Once convinced of the utter worthlessness of his  prospects in Barlingford, Mr. Sheldon turned his eyes Londonwards; and his  father happening at the same time very conveniently to depart this life,  Philip, the son and heir, disposed of the business to an aspiring young  practitioner, and came to the metropolis, where he made that futile attempt to  establish himself which has been described.</p>
<p>The dentist had wasted four years in London, and  ten years had gone by since Georgy&rsquo;s wedding; and now for the first time he had  an opportunity of witnessing the domestic happiness or the domestic misery of  the woman who had jilted him, and the man who had been his successful rival. He  set himself to watch them with the cool deliberation of a social anatomist, and  he experienced very little difficulty in the performance of this moral  dissection. They were established under his roof, his companions at every meal;  and they were a kind of people who discuss their grievances and indulge in  their &ldquo;little differences&rdquo; with perfect freedom in the presence of a third, or  a fourth, or even a fifth party.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon was wise enough to preserve a strict  neutrality. He would take up a newspaper at the beginning of a little  difference, and lay it down when the little difference was finished, with the  most perfect assumption of unconsciousness; but it is doubtful whether the  matrimonial disputants were sufficiently appreciative of this good breeding.  They would have liked to have had Mr. Sheldon for a court of appeal; and a  little interference from him would have given zest to their quarrels. Meanwhile  Philip watched them slyly from the covert of his newspaper, and formed his own  conclusions about them. If he was pleased to see that his false love&rsquo;s path was  not entirely rose-bestrewn, or if he rejoiced at beholding the occasional  annoyance of his rival, he allowed no evidence of his pleasure to appear in his  face or manner.</p>
<p>Georgina Cradock&rsquo;s rather insipid prettiness had  developed into matronly comeliness. Her fair complexion and pink cheeks had  lost none of their freshness. Her smooth auburn hair was as soft and bright as  it had been when she had braided it preparatory to a Barlingford tea-party in  the days of her spinsterhood. She was a pretty, weak little woman, whose  education had never gone beyond the routine of a provincial boarding-school,  and who believed that she had attained all necessary wisdom in having mastered  Pinnock&rsquo;s abridgments of Goldsmith&rsquo;s histories and the rudiments of the French  language. She was a woman who thought that the perfection of feminine costume  was a moire-antique dress and a conspicuous gold chain. She was a woman who  considered a well-furnished house and a horse and gig the highest form of  earthly splendour or prosperity.</p>
<p>This was the shallow commonplace creature whom  Philip Sheldon had once admired and wooed. He looked at her now, and wondered  how he could ever have felt even as much as he had felt on her account. But he  had little leisure to devote to any such abstract and useless consideration. He  had his own affairs to think about, and they were very desperate.</p>
<p>In the meantime Mr. and Mrs. Halliday occupied  themselves in the pursuit of pleasure or business, as the case might be. They  were eager for amusement: went to exhibitions in the day and to theatres at  night, and came home to cozy little suppers in Fitzgeorge-street, after which  Mr. Halliday was wont to waste the small hours in friendly conversation with his  quondam companion, and in the consumption of much brandy-and-water.</p>
<p>Unhappily for Georgy, these halcyon days were  broken by intervals of storm and cloud. The weak little woman was afflicted  with that intermittent fever called jealousy; and the stalwart Thomas was one  of those men who can scarcely give the time of day to a feminine acquaintance  without some ornate and loud-spoken gallantry. Having no intellectual resources  wherewith to beguile the tedium of his idle prosperous life, he was fain to  seek pleasure in the companionship of other men; and had thus become a haunter  of tavern parlours and small racecourses, being always ready for any amusement  his friends proposed to him. It followed, therefore, that he was very often  absent from his commonplace substantial home, and his pretty weak-minded wife.  And poor Georgy had ample food for her jealous fears and suspicions; for where  might a man not be who was so seldom at home? She had never been particularly  fond of her husband, but that was no reason why she should not be particularly  jealous about him; and her jealousy betrayed itself in a peevish worrying  fashion, which was harder to bear than the vengeful ferocity of a Clytemnestra.  It was in vain that Thomas Halliday and those jolly good fellows his friends  and companions attested the Arcadian innocence of racecourses, and the perfect  purity of that smoky atmosphere peculiar to tavern parlours. Georgy&rsquo;s  suspicions were too vague for refutation; but they were nevertheless sufficient  ground for all the alternations of temper &mdash; from stolid sulkiness to peevish  whining, from murmured lamentations to loud hysterics &mdash; to which the female  temperament is liable.</p>
<p>In the meantime poor honest, loud-spoken Tom did  all in his power to demonstrate his truth and devotion. He bought his wife as  many stiff silk gowns and gaudy Barlingford bonnets as she chose to sigh for.  He made a will, in which she was sole legatee, and insured his life in  different offices to the amount of five thousand pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the sort of fellow that&rsquo;s likely to go off the  hooks suddenly, you know, Georgy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and your poor dad was always  anxious I should make things square for you. I don&rsquo;t suppose you&rsquo;re likely to  marry again, my lass, so I&rsquo;ve no need to tie up Lottie&rsquo;s little fortune. I must  trust some one, and I&rsquo;d better confide in my little wife than in some canting  methodistical fellow of a trustee, who would speculate my daughter&rsquo;s money upon  some Stock-Exchange hazard, and levant to Australia when it was all swamped. If  you can&rsquo;t trust me, Georgy, I&rsquo;ll let you see that I can trust you&rdquo;, added Tom  reproachfully.</p>
<p>Whereupon poor weak little Mrs. Halliday murmured  plaintively that she did not want fortunes or life insurances, but that she  wanted her husband to stay at home, content with the calm and rather sleepy  delights of his own fireside. Poor Tom was wont to promise amendment, and would  keep his promise faithfully so long as no supreme temptation, in the shape of a  visit from some friend of the jolly-good-fellow species, arose to vanquish his  good resolutions. But a good-tempered, generous-hearted young man who farms his  own land, has three or four good horses in his stable, a decent cellar of  honest port and sherry&mdash; &ldquo;none of your wishy-washy sour stuff in the way of hock  or claret,&rdquo; cried Tom Halliday &mdash; and a very comfortable balance at his  banker&rsquo;s, finds it no easy matter to shake off friends of the jolly-good-fellow  fraternity.</p>
<p>In London Mr. Halliday found the spirit of  jolly-dog-ism rampant. George Sheldon had always been his favourite of these  two brothers; and it was George who lured him from the safe shelter of  Fitzgeorge-street and took him to mysterious haunts, whence he returned long  after midnight, boisterous of manner and unsteady of gait, and with garments  reeking of stale tobacco-smoke.</p>
<p>He was always good-tempered, even after these  diabolical orgies on some unknown Brocken, and protested indistinctly that  there was no harm,&mdash; &ldquo;&rsquo;pon m&rsquo; wor&rsquo;, ye know, ol&rsquo; gur&rsquo;! Geor&rsquo; an&rsquo; me &mdash; half-doz&rsquo;  oyst&rsquo;r &mdash; c&rsquo;gar &mdash; botl&rsquo; p&rsquo;l ale &mdash; str&rsquo;t home,&rdquo; and much more to the same effect.  When did any married man ever take more than half a dozen oysters &mdash; or take any  undomestic pleasure for his own satisfaction? It is always those incorrigible  bachelors, Thomas, Richard, or Henry, who hinder the unwilling Benedick from  returning to his sacred Lares and Penates.</p>
<p>Poor Georgy was not to be pacified by protestations  about oysters and cigars from the lips of a husband who was thick of utterance,  and who betrayed a general imbecility of mind and unsteadiness of body. This  London excursion, which had begun in sunshine, threatened to end in storm and  darkness. George Sheldon and his set had taken possession of the young farmer;  and Georgy had no better amusement in the long blustrous March evenings than to  sit at her work under the flaming gas in Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s drawing-room, while that  gentleman &mdash; who rarely joined in the dissipations of his friend and his brother  &mdash; occupied himself with mechanical dentistry in the chamber of torture below.</p>
<p>Fitzgeorge-street in general, always on the watch  to discover evidences of impecuniosity or doubtful morality on the part of any  one citizen in particular, could find no food for scandal in the visit of Mr.  and Mrs. Halliday to their friend and countryman. It had been noised abroad, through  the agency of Mrs. Woolper, that Mr. Sheldon had been a suitor for the lady&rsquo;s  hand, and had been jilted by her. The Fitzgeorgians had been, therefore,  especially on the alert to detect any sign of backsliding in the dentist. There  would have been much pleasant discussion in kitchens and back-parlours if Mr.  Sheldon had been particularly attentive to his fair guest; but it speedily  became known, always by the agency of Mrs. Woolper and that phenomenon of  idleness and iniquity, the London &ldquo;girl,&rdquo; that Mr. Sheldon was not by any means  attentive to the pretty young woman from Yorkshire; but that he suffered her to  sit alone hour after hour in her husband&rsquo;s absence, with no amusement but her  needlework wherewith to &ldquo;pass the time,&rdquo; while he scraped and filed and  polished those fragments of bone which were to assist in the renovation of  decayed beauty.</p>
<p>The third week of Mr. and Mrs. Halliday&rsquo;s visit was  near its close, and as yet the young farmer had arrived at no decision as to  the subject which had brought him to London. The sale of Hyley Farm was an  accomplished fact, and the purchase-money duly bestowed at Tom&rsquo;s banker&rsquo;s; but  very little had been done towards finding the new property which was to be a  substitute for the estate his father and grandfather had farmed before him. He  had seen auctioneers, and had brought home plans of estates in Herefordshire  and Devonshire, Cornwall and Somersetshire, all of which seemed to be, in their  way, the most perfect things imaginable &mdash; land of such fertility as one would  scarcely expect to find out of Arcadia &mdash; live stock which seemed beyond all  price, to be taken at a valuation. &mdash; roads and surrounding neighbourhood  unparalleled in beauty and convenience &mdash; outbuildings that must have been the  very archetypes of barns and stables &mdash; a house which to inhabit would be to  adore. But as yet he had seen none of these peerless domains. He was waiting  for decent weather in which to run down to the West and &ldquo;look about him,&rdquo; as he  said to himself. In the meantime the blustrous March weather, which was so  unsuited to long railroad journeys, and all that waiting about at junctions and  at little windy stations on branch lines, incidental to the inspection of  estates scattered over a large area of country, served very well for &ldquo;jolly-dog-ism;&rdquo;  and what with a hand at cards in George Sheldon&rsquo;s chambers, and another hand at  cards in somebody else&rsquo;s chambers, and a run down to an early meeting at  Newmarket, and an evening at some rooms where there was something to be seen  which was as near prize-fighting as the law allowed, and other evenings in  unknown regions, Mr. Halliday found time slipping by him, and his domestic  peace vanishing away.</p>
<p>It was on an evening at the end of this third week  that Mr. Sheldon abandoned his mechanical dentistry for once in a way, and  ascended to the drawing-room where poor Georgy sat busy with that eternal  needlework, but for which melancholy madness would surely overtake many  desolate matrons in houses whose common place comfort and respectable dulness  are more dismal than the picturesque dreariness of a moated grange amid the  Lincolnshire fens. To the masculine mind this needlework seems nothing more  than a purposeless stabbing and sewing of strips of calico; but to lonely  womanhood it is the prison-flower of the captive, it is the spider of Latude.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon brought his guest an evening newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an account of the opening of Parliament,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;which you may perhaps like to see. I wish I had a piano, or some  female acquaintances to drop in upon you. I am afraid you must be dull in these  long evenings when Tom is out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am indeed dull,&rdquo; Mrs. Halliday answered  peevishly; &ldquo;and if Tom cared for me, he wouldn&rsquo;t leave me like this evening  after evening. But he doesn&rsquo;t care for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Sheldon laid down the newspaper, and seated  himself opposite his guest. He sat for a few minutes in silence, beating time  to some imaginary air with the tips of his fingers on the old-fashioned  mahogany table. Then he said, with a half-smile upon his face, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely Tom is the best of husbands! He has  been a little wild since his coming to London, I know; but then you see he  doesn&rsquo;t often come to town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s just as bad in Yorkshire,&rdquo; Georgy answered  gloomily; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s always going to Barlingford with somebody or other, or to meet  some of his old friends. I&rsquo;m sure, if I had known what he was, I would never  have married him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought he was such a good husband. He was  telling me only a few days ago how he had made a will leaving you every  sixpence he possesses, without reservation, and how he has insured his life for  five thousand pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, I know that; but I don&rsquo;t call <em>that</em> being a good husband. I don&rsquo;t want  him to leave me his money. I don&rsquo;t want him to die. I want him to stay at  home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Tom! I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s not the sort of man for  that kind of thing. He likes change and amusement. You married a rich man, Mrs.  Halliday; you made your choice, you know, without regard to the feelings of any  one else. You sacrificed truth and honour to your own inclination, or your own  interest, I do not know, and do not ask which. If the bargain has turned out a  bad one, that&rsquo;s your look-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip Sheldon sat with his folded arms resting on  the little table and his eyes fixed on Georgy&rsquo;s face. They could be very stern  and hard and cruel, those bright black eyes, and Mrs. Halliday grew first red  and then pale under their searching gaze. She had seen Mr. Sheldon very often  during the years of her married life, but this was the first time he had ever  said anything to her that sounded like a reproach. The dentist&rsquo;s eyes softened  a little as he watched her, not with any special tenderness, but with an  expression of half-disdainful compassion &mdash; such as a strong stern man might  feel for a foolish child. He could see that this woman was afraid of him, and  it served his interests that she should fear him. He had a purpose in  everything he did, and his purpose to-night was to test the strength of his  influence over Georgina Halliday. In the old time before her marriage that  influence had been very strong. It was for him to discover now whether it still  endured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You made your choice, Mrs. Halliday,&rdquo; he went on  presently, &ldquo;and it was a choice which all prudent people must have approved.  What chance had a man, who was only heir to a practice worth four or five  hundred pounds, against the inheritor of Hyley Farm with its two hundred and  fifty acres, and three thousand pounds&rsquo; worth of live stock, plant, and working  capital? When do the prudent people ever stop to consider truth and honour, or  old promises, or an affection that dates from childhood? They calculate  everything by pounds, shillings, and pence; and according to their mode of  reckoning you were in the right when you jilted me to marry Tom Halliday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Georgy laid down her work and took out her  handkerchief. She was one of those women who take refuge in tears when they  find themselves at a disadvantage. Tears had always melted honest Tom, was his  wrath never so dire, and tears would no doubt subdue Philip Sheldon.</p>
<p>But Georgy had to discover that the dentist was  made of a stuff very different from that softer clay which composed the  rollicking good-tempered farmer. Mr. Sheldon watched her tears with the  cold-blooded deliberation of a scientific experimentalist. He was glad to find  that he could make her cry. She was a necessary instrument in the working out  of certain plans that he had made for himself, and he was anxious to discover  whether she was likely to be a plastic instrument. He knew that her love for  him had never been worth much at its best, and that the poor little flickering  flame had been utterly extinguished by nine years of commonplace domesticity  and petty jealousy. But his purpose was one that would be served as well by her  fear as by her love, and he had set himself to-night to gauge his power in  relation to this poor weak creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very unkind of you to say such dreadful  things, Mr. Sheldon,&rdquo; she whimpered presently; &ldquo;you know very well that my  marriage with Tom was pa&rsquo;s doing, and not mine. I&rsquo;m sure if I&rsquo;d known how he  would stay out night after night, and come home in such dreadful states time  after time, I never would have consented to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you? &mdash; O yes, you would. If you were a  widow to-morrow, and free to marry again, you would choose just such another  man as Tom &mdash; a man who laughs loud, and pays flourishing compliments, and  drives a gig with a high-stepping horse. That&rsquo;s the sort of man women like, and  that&rsquo;s the sort of man you&rsquo;d marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I shouldn&rsquo;t marry at all,&rdquo; answered Mrs.  Halliday, in a voice that was broken by little gasping sobs. &ldquo;I have seen  enough of the misery of married life. But I don&rsquo;t want Tom to die, unkind as he  is to me. People are always saying that he won&rsquo;t make old bones &mdash; how horrid it  is to talk of a person&rsquo;s bones! &mdash; and I&rsquo;m sure I sometimes make myself wretched  about him, as he knows, though he doesn&rsquo;t thank me for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And here Mrs Halliday&rsquo;s sobs got the better of her  utterance, and Mr.<br>
  Sheldon was fain to say something of a consolatory nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tease you any more.  That&rsquo;s against the laws of hospitality, isn&rsquo;t it? &mdash; only there are some things  which you can&rsquo;t expect a man to forget, you know. However, let bygones be  bygones. As for poor old Tom, I daresay he&rsquo;ll live to be a hale, hearty old  man, in spite of the croakers. People always will croak about something; and  it&rsquo;s a kind of fashion to say that a big, hearty, six-foot man is a fragile  blossom likely to be nipped by any wintry blast. Come, come, Mrs. Halliday,  your husband mustn&rsquo;t discover that I&rsquo;ve been making you cry when he comes home.  He may be home early this evening, perhaps; and if he is, we&rsquo;ll have an oyster  supper, and a chat about old times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Halliday shook her head dolefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s past ten o&rsquo;clock already,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I  don&rsquo;t suppose Tom will be home till after twelve. He doesn&rsquo;t like my sitting up  for him; but I wonder <em>what</em> time he  would come home if I didn&rsquo;t sit up for him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hope for the best,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Sheldon  cheerfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see about the oysters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get them for me, or for Tom,&rdquo; protested Mrs.  Halliday; &ldquo;he will have had his supper when he comes home, you may be sure, and  I couldn&rsquo;t eat a morsel of anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this resolution Mrs. Halliday adhered; so the  dentist was fain to abandon all jovial ideas in relation to oysters and pale  ale. But he did not go back to his mechanical dentistry. He sat opposite his  visitor, and watched her, silently and thoughtfully, for some time as she  worked. She had brushed away her tears, but she looked very peevish and  miserable, and took out her watch several times in an hour. Mr. Sheldon made  two or three feeble attempts at conversation, but the talk languished and  expired on each occasion, and they sat on in silence.</p>
<p>Little by little the dentist&rsquo;s attention seemed to  wander away from his guest. He wheeled his chair round, and sat looking at the  fire with the same fixed gloom upon his face which had darkened it on the night  of his return from Yorkshire. Things had been so desperate with him of late,  that he had lost his old orderly habit of thinking out a business at one  sitting, and making an end of all deliberation and hesitation about it. There  were subjects that forced themselves upon his thoughts, and certain ideas which  repeated themselves with a stupid persistence. He was such an eminently  practical man, that this disorder of his brain troubled him more even than the  thoughts that made the disorder. He sat in the same attitude for a long while,  scarcely conscious of Mrs. Halliday&rsquo;s presence, not at all conscious of the  progress of time. Georgy had been right in her gloomy forebodings of bad  behaviour on the part of Mr. Halliday. It was nearly one o&rsquo;clock when a loud  double knock announced that gentleman&rsquo;s return. The wind had been howling  drearily, and a sharp, slanting rain had been pattering against the windows for  the last half-hour, while Mrs. Halliday&rsquo;s breast had been racked by the  contending emotions of anxiety and indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he couldn&rsquo;t get a cab,&rdquo; she exclaimed,  as the knock startled her from her listening attitude &mdash; for however intently a  midnight watcher may be listening for the returning wanderer&rsquo;s knock, it is not  the less startling when it comes. &ldquo;And he has walked home through the wet, and  now he&rsquo;ll have a violent cold, I daresay,&rdquo; added Georgy peevishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s lucky for him he&rsquo;s in a doctor&rsquo;s house,&rdquo;  answered Mr. Sheldon, with a smile. He was a handsome man, no doubt, according  to the popular idea of masculine perfection, but he had not a pleasant smile.  &ldquo;I went through the regular routine, you know, and am as well able to see a  patient safely through a cold or fever as I am to make him a set of teeth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Halliday burst into the room at this moment,  singing a fragment of the &ldquo;Chough and Crow&rdquo; chorus, very much out of tune. He  was in boisterously high spirits, and very little the worse for liquor. He had  only walked from Covent Garden, he said, and had taken nothing but a tankard of  stout and a Welsh rarebit. He had been hearing the divinest singing &mdash; boys with  the voices of angels &mdash; and had been taking his supper in a place which  duchesses themselves did not disdain to peep at from the sacred recesses of a  loge grillee, George Sheldon had told him. But poor country-bred Georgina  Halliday would not believe in the duchesses, or the angelic singing boys, or  the primitive simplicity of Welsh rarebits. She had a vision of beautiful  women, and halls of dazzling light, where there was the mad music of perpetual  Post-horn Galops, with a riotous accompaniment of huzzas and the popping of  champagne corks &mdash; where the sheen of satin and the glitter of gems bewildered  the eye of the beholder. She had seen such a picture once on the stage, and had  vaguely associated it with all Tom&rsquo;s midnight roisterings ever afterwards.</p>
<p>The roisterer&rsquo;s garments were very wet, and it was  in vain that his wife and Philip Sheldon entreated him to change them for dry  ones, or to go to bed immediately. He stood before the fire relating his  innocent adventures, and trying to dispel the cloud from Georgy&rsquo;s fair young  brow; and, when he did at last consent to go to his room, the dentist shook his  head ominously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a severe cold to-morrow, depend upon  it, Tom, and you&rsquo;ll have yourself to thank for it,&rdquo; he said, as he bade the good-tempered  reprobate good night. &ldquo;Never mind, old fellow,&rdquo; answered Tom; &ldquo;if I am ill, you  shall nurse me. If one is doomed to die by doctors&rsquo; stuff, it&rsquo;s better to have  a doctor one does know than a doctor one doesn&rsquo;t know for one&rsquo;s executioner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After which graceful piece of humour Mr. Halliday  went blundering up the staircase, followed by his aggrieved wife.</p>
<p>Philip Sheldon stood on the landing looking after  his visitors for some minutes. Then he went slowly back to the sitting-room,  where he replenished the fire, and seated himself before it with a newspaper in  his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of going to bed, if I can&rsquo;t sleep?&rdquo;  he muttered, in a discontented tone.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  A Perplexing Illness</h2>
<p>Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s prophecy was fully realised. Tom  Halliday awoke the next day with a violent cold in his head. Like most big  boisterous men of herculean build, he was the veriest craven in the hour of  physical ailment; so he succumbed at once to the malady which a man obliged to  face the world and fight for his daily bread must needs have made light of.</p>
<p>The dentist rallied his invalid friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your bed, if you like, Tom,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but  there&rsquo;s no necessity for any such coddling. As your hands are hot, and your  tongue rather queer, I may as well give you a saline draught. You&rsquo;ll be all  right by dinner-time, and I&rsquo;ll get George to look round in the evening for a  hand at cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom obeyed his professional friend &mdash; took his  medicine, read the paper, and slept away the best part of the dull March day.  At half-past five he got up and dressed for dinner, and the evening passed very  pleasantly &mdash; so pleasantly, indeed, that Georgy was half inclined to wish that  her husband might be afflicted with chronic influenza, whereby he would be  compelled to stop at home. She sighed when Philip Sheldon slapped his friend&rsquo;s  broad shoulder, and told him cheerily that he would be &ldquo;all right to-morrow.&rdquo;  He would be well again, and there would be more midnight roistering, and she  would be again tormented by that vision of lighted halls and beautiful  diabolical creatures revolving madly to the music of the Post-horn Galop.</p>
<p>It seemed, however, that poor jealous Mrs. Halliday  was to be spared her nightly agony for some time to come. Tom&rsquo;s cold lasted  longer than he had expected, and the cold was succeeded by a low fever &mdash; a  bilious fever, Mr. Sheldon said. There was not the least occasion for alarm, of  course. The invalid and the invalid&rsquo;s wife trusted implicitly in the friendly  doctor who assured them both that Tom&rsquo;s attack was the most ordinary kind of  thing; a little wearing, no doubt, but entirely without danger. He had to  repeat this assurance very often to Georgy, whose angry feelings had given  place to extreme tenderness and affection now that Tom was an invalid, quite  unfitted for the society of jolly good fellows, and willing to receive basins  of beef-tea and arrow-root meekly from his wife&rsquo;s hands, instead of those  edibles of iniquity, oysters and toasted cheese.</p>
<p>Mr. Halliday&rsquo;s illness was very tiresome. It was  one of those perplexing complaints which keep the patient himself, and the  patient&rsquo;s friends and attendants, in perpetual uncertainty. A little worse one  day and a shade better the next; now gaining a little strength, now losing a  trifle more than he had gained. The patient declined in so imperceptible a  manner that he had been ill three weeks, and was no longer able to leave his  bed, and had lost alike his appetite and his spirits, before Georgy awoke to  the fact that this illness, hitherto considered so lightly, must be very  serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think if &mdash; if you have no objection, I should  like to see another doctor, Mr. Sheldon,&rdquo; she said one day, with considerable  embarrassment of manner. She feared to offend her host by any doubt of his  skill. &ldquo;You see &mdash; you &mdash; you are so much employed with teeth &mdash; and &mdash; of course  you know I am quite assured of your talent &mdash; but don&rsquo;t you think that a doctor  who had more experience in fever cases might bring Tom round quicker? He has  been ill so long now; and really he doesn&rsquo;t seem to get any better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip Sheldon shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please, my dear Mrs. Halliday,&rdquo; he said  carelessly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to press my services upon you. It is quite a matter  of friendship, you know, and I shall not profit sixpence by my attendance on  poor old Tom. Call in another doctor, by all means, if you think fit to do so;  but, of course, in that event, I must withdraw from the case. The man you call  in may be clever, or he may be stupid and ignorant. It&rsquo;s all a chance, when one  doesn&rsquo;t know one&rsquo;s man; and I really can&rsquo;t advise you upon that point, for I  know nothing of the London profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Georgy looked alarmed. This was a new view of the  subject. She had fancied that all regular practitioners were clever, and had  only doubted Mr. Sheldon because he was not a regular practitioner. But how if  she were to withdraw her husband from the hands of a clever man to deliver him  into the care of an ignorant pretender, simply because she was over-anxious for  his recovery?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always am foolishly anxious about things,&rdquo; she  thought.</p>
<p>And then she looked piteously at Mr. Sheldon, and  said, &ldquo;What do you think I ought to do? Pray tell me. He has eaten no breakfast  again this morning; and even the cup of tea which I persuaded him to take  seemed to disagree with him. And then there is that dreadful sore throat which  torments him so. What ought I to do, Mr. Sheldon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever seems best to yourself, Mrs. Halliday,&rdquo;  answered the dentist earnestly. &ldquo;It is a subject upon, which I cannot pretend  to advise you. It is a matter of feeling rather than of reason, and it is a  matter which you yourself must determine. If I knew any man whom I could  honestly recommend to you, it would be another affair; but I don&rsquo;t. Tom&rsquo;s  illness is the simplest thing in the world, and I feel myself quite competent to  pull him through it, without fuss or bother; but if you think otherwise, pray  put me out of the question. There&rsquo;s one fact, however, of which I&rsquo;m bound to  remind you. Like many fine big stalwart fellows of his stamp, your husband is  as nervous as a hysterical woman; and if you call in a strange doctor, who will  pull long faces, and put on the professional solemnity, the chances are that  he&rsquo;ll take alarm, and do himself more mischief in a few hours than your new  adviser can undo in as many weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little pause after this. Georgy&rsquo;s  opinions, and suspicions, and anxieties were alike vague; and this last  suggestion of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s put things in a new and alarming light. She was  really anxious about her husband, but she had been accustomed all her life to  accept the opinion of other people in preference to her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really think that Tom will soon be well and  strong again?&rdquo; she asked presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I thought otherwise, I should be the first to  advise other measures. However, my dear Mrs. Halliday, call in some one else,  for your own satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Georgy, sighing plaintively, &ldquo;it might  frighten Tom. You are quite right, Mr. Sheldon; he is very nervous, and the  idea that I was alarmed might alarm him. I&rsquo;ll trust in you. Pray try to bring  him round again. You will try, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked, in the childish pleading  way which was peculiar to her.</p>
<p>The dentist was searching for something in the  drawer of a table, and his back was turned on the anxious questioner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may depend upon it, I&rsquo;ll do my best, Mrs.  Halliday,&rdquo; he answered, still busy at the drawer. Mr. Sheldon the younger had  paid many visits to Fitzgeorge-street during Tom Halliday&rsquo;s illness. George and  Tom had been the Damon and Pythias of Barlingford; and George seemed really distressed  when he found his friend changed for the worse. The changes in the invalid were  so puzzling, the alternations from better to worse and from worse to better so  frequent, that fear could take no hold upon the minds of the patient&rsquo;s friends.  It seemed such a very slight affair this low fever, though sufficiently  inconvenient to the patient himself, who suffered a good deal from thirst and  sickness, and showed an extreme disinclination for food, all which symptoms Mr.  Sheldon said were the commonest and simplest features of a very mild attack of  bilious fever, which would leave Tom a better man than it had found him.</p>
<p>There had been several pleasant little card-parties  during the earlier stages of Mr. Halliday&rsquo;s illness; but within the last week  the patient had been too low and weak for cards &mdash; too weak to read the  newspaper, or even to bear having it read to him. When George came to look at  his old friend&mdash; &ldquo;to cheer you up a little, old fellow, you know,&rdquo; and so on &mdash; he  found Tom, for the time being, past all capability of being cheered, even by  the genial society of his favourite jolly good fellow, or by tidings of a  steeplechase in Yorkshire, in which a neighbour had gone to grief over a double  fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That chap upstairs seems rather queerish,&rdquo; George had  said to his brother, after finding Tom lower and weaker than usual. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a  bad way, isn&rsquo;t he, Phil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; there&rsquo;s nothing serious the matter with him.  He&rsquo;s rather low to-night, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather low!&rdquo; echoed George Sheldon. &ldquo;He seems to  me so very low, that he can&rsquo;t sink much lower without going to the bottom of  his grave. I&rsquo;d call some one in, if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dentist shrugged his shoulders, and made a  little contemptuous noise with his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you knew as much of doctors as I do, you wouldn&rsquo;t  be in any hurry to trust a friend to the mercy of one,&rdquo; he said carelessly.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you alarm yourself about Tom. He&rsquo;s right enough. He&rsquo;s been in a state of  chronic over-eating and over-drinking for the last ten years, and this bilious  fever will be the making of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will it?&rdquo; said George doubtfully; and then there  followed a little pause, during which the brothers happened to look at each  other furtively, and happened to surprise each other in the act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about over-eating or drinking,&rdquo; said  George presently; &ldquo;but something has disagreed with Tom Halliday, that&rsquo;s very  evident.&rdquo;</p>

  The Letter From The &ldquo;Alliance&rdquo; Office</h2>
<p>Upon the evening of the day on which Mrs. Halliday  and the dentist had discussed the propriety of calling in a strange doctor,  George Sheldon came again to see his sick friend. He was quicker to perceive  the changes in the invalid than the members of the household, who saw him daily  and hourly, and he perceived a striking change for the worse to-night.</p>
<p>He took care, however, to suffer no evidence of  alarm or surprise to appear in the sick chamber. He talked to his friend in the  usual cheery way; sat by the bedside for half an hour; did his best to arouse  Tom from a kind of stupid lethargy, and to encourage Mrs. Halliday, who shared  the task of nursing her husband with brisk Nancy Woolper, an invaluable  creature in a sick-room. But he failed in both attempts; the dull apathy of the  invalid was not to be dispelled by the most genial companionship, and Georgy&rsquo;s  spirits had been sinking lower and lower all day as her fears increased.</p>
<p>She would fain have called in a strange doctor &mdash;  she would fain have sought for comfort and consolation from some new quarter.  But she was afraid of offending Philip Sheldon; and she was afraid of alarming  her husband. So she waited, and watched, and struggled against that  ever-increasing anxiety. Had not Mr. Sheldon made light of his friend&rsquo;s malady,  and what motive could he have for deceiving her?</p>
<p>A breakfast-cup full of beef-tea stood on the little  table by the bedside, and had been standing there for hours untouched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did take such pains to make it strong and  clear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Woolper regretfully, as she came to the little table during a  tidying process, &ldquo;and poor dear Mr. Halliday hasn&rsquo;t taken so much as a  spoonful. It won&rsquo;t be fit for him to-morrow, so as I haven&rsquo;t eaten a morsel of  dinner, what with the hurry and anxiety and one thing and another, I&rsquo;ll warm up  the beef-tea for my supper. There&rsquo;s not a blessed thing in the house; for you  don&rsquo;t eat nothing, Mrs. Halliday; and as to cooking a dinner for Mr. Sheldon,  you&rsquo;d a deal better go and throw your victuals out into the gutter, for then  there&rsquo;d be a chance of stray dogs profiting by &rsquo;em, at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phil is off his feed, then; eh, Nancy?&rdquo; said  George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should rather think he is, Mr. George. I roasted  a chicken yesterday for him and Mrs. Halliday, and I don&rsquo;t think they eat an  ounce between them; and such a lovely tender young thing as it was too &mdash; done  to a turn &mdash; with bread sauce and a little bit of sea-kale. One invalid makes  another, that&rsquo;s certain. I never saw your brother so upset as he is now, Mr.  George, in all his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; answered George Sheldon thoughtfully; &ldquo;Phil  isn&rsquo;t generally one of your sensitive sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The invalid was sleeping heavily during this  conversation. George stood by the bed for some minutes looking down at the  altered face, and then turned to leave the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Mrs. Halliday,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I hope I  shall find poor old Tom a shade better when I look round to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I hope so,&rdquo; Georgy answered mournfully.</p>
<p>She was sitting by the window looking out at the  darkening western sky, in which the last lurid glimmer of a stormy sunset was  fading against a background of iron gray.</p>
<p>This quiet figure by the window, the stormy sky,  and ragged hurrying clouds without, the dusky chamber with all its dismally  significant litter of medicine-bottles, made a gloomy picture &mdash; a picture which  the man who looked upon it carried in his mind for many years after that night.</p>
<p>George Sheldon and Nancy Woolper left the room  together, the Yorkshirewoman carrying a tray of empty phials and glasses, and  amongst them the cup of beef-tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems in a bad way to-night, Nancy,&rdquo; said  George, with a backward jerk of his head towards the sick-chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is in a bad way, Mr. George,&rdquo; answered the  woman gravely, &ldquo;let Mr. Philip think what he will. I don&rsquo;t want to say a word  against your brother&rsquo;s knowledge, for such a steady studious gentleman as he is  had need be clever; and if I was ill myself, I&rsquo;d trust my life to him freely;  for I have heard Barlingford folks say that my master&rsquo;s advice is as good as  any regular doctor&rsquo;s, and that there&rsquo;s very little your regular doctors know  that he doesn&rsquo;t know as well or better. But for all that, Mr. George, I don&rsquo;t  think he understands Mr. Halliday&rsquo;s case quite as clear as he might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think Tom&rsquo;s in any danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say that, Mr. George; but I think he gets  worse instead of getting better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; muttered George; &ldquo;if Halliday were to go  off the hooks, Phil would have a good chance of getting a rich wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Mr. George,&rdquo; exclaimed the  Yorkshirewoman reproachfully; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t even think of such a thing while that poor  man lies at death&rsquo;s door. I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Sheldon hasn&rsquo;t any thoughts of that  kind. He told me before Mr. and Mrs. Halliday came to town that he and Miss  Georgy had forgotten all about past times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, if Phil said so, that alters the case. Phil is  one of your blunt outspoken fellows, and always says what he means,&rdquo; said  George Sheldon. And then he went downstairs, leaving Nancy to follow him at her  leisure with the tray of jingling cups and glasses. He went down through the  dusk, smiling to himself, as if he had just given utterance to some piece of  intense humour. He went to look for his brother, whom he found in the  torture-chamber, busied with some mysterious process in connection with a lump  of plaster-of-paris, which seemed to be the model of ruined battlements in the  Gothic style. The dentist looked up as George entered the room, and did not  appear particularly delighted by the appearance of that gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon the younger, &ldquo;busy as  usual? Patients seem to be looking up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patients be &mdash;&mdash; toothless to the end of time!&rdquo;  cried Philip, with a savage laugh. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not working to order; I&rsquo;m only  experimentalising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re rather fond of experiments, I think, Phil,&rdquo;  said George, seating himself near the table at which his brother was working  under the glare of the gas. The dentist looked very pale and haggard in the  gas-light, and his eyes had the dull sunken appearance induced by prolonged  sleeplessness. George sat watching his brother thoughtfully for some time, and  then produced his cigar-case. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind my smoke here?&rdquo; he asked, as he  lighted a cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. You are very welcome to sit here, if  it amuses you to see me working at the cast of a lower jaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s a lower jaw, is it? It looks like the  fragment of some castle-keep. No, Phil, I don&rsquo;t care about watching you work. I  want to talk to you seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About that fellow upstairs &mdash; poor old Tom. He and  I were great cronies, you know, at home. He&rsquo;s in a very bad way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he? You seem to be turning physician all at  once, George. I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought your grubbing among county histories,  and tattered old pedigrees, and parish registers had given you so deep an  insight into the science of medicine!&rdquo; said the dentist in a sneering tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything of medicine; but I know  enough to be sure that Tom Halliday is about as bad as he can be. What  mystifies me is, that he doesn&rsquo;t seem to have had anything particular the  matter with him. There he lies, getting worse and worse every day, without any  specific ailment. It&rsquo;s a strange illness, Philip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything strange in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you? Don&rsquo;t you think the surrounding  circumstances are strange? Here is this man comes to your house hale and  hearty; and all of a sudden he falls ill, and gets lower and lower every day,  without anybody being able to say why or wherefore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true, George. Everybody in this house  knows the cause of Tom Halliday&rsquo;s illness. He came home in wet clothes, and  insisted on keeping them on. He caught a cold; which resulted in low fever.  There is the whole history and mystery of the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s simple enough, certainly. But if I were  you, Phil, I&rsquo;d call in another doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Mrs. Halliday&rsquo;s business,&rdquo; answered the  dentist coolly; &ldquo;if she doubts my skill, she is free to call in whom she  pleases. And now you may as well drop the subject, George. I&rsquo;ve had enough  anxiety about this man&rsquo;s illness, and I don&rsquo;t want to be worried by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this there was a little conversation upon  general matters, but the talk dragged and languished drearily, and George  Sheldon rose to depart directly he had finished his cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Philip!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;if ever you get a  stroke of good luck,<br>
  I hope you&rsquo;ll stand something handsome to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This remark had no particular relevance to anything  that had been said that night by the two men; yet Philip Sheldon seemed in  nowise astonished by it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If things ever <em>do</em> take a turn for the better with me, you&rsquo;ll find me a good friend, George,&rdquo; he  said gravely; and then Mr. Sheldon the younger bade him good night, and went  out into Fitzgeorge-street.</p>
<p>He paused for a moment at the corner of the street  to look back at his brother&rsquo;s house. He could see the lighted windows of the  invalid&rsquo;s chamber, and it was at those he looked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Tom,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;poor Tom! We were  great cronies in the old times, and have had many a pleasant evening together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon the dentist sat up till the small hours  that night, as he had done for many nights lately. He finished his work in the  torture-chamber, and went up to the common sitting-room, or drawing-room as it  was called by courtesy, a little before midnight. The servants had gone to bed,  for there was no regular nightly watch in the apartment of the invalid. Mrs.  Halliday lay on a sofa in her husband&rsquo;s room, and Nancy Woolper slept in an  adjoining apartment, always wakeful and ready if help of any kind should be  wanted.</p>
<p>The house was very quiet just now. Philip Sheldon  walked up and down the room, thinking; and the creaking of his boots sounded  unpleasantly loud to his ears. He stopped before the fireplace, after having  walked to and fro some time, and began to examine some letters that lay upon  the mantelpiece. They were addressed to Mr. Halliday, and had been forwarded  from Yorkshire. The dentist took them up, one by one, and deliberately examined  them. They were all business letters, and most of them bore country post-marks.  But there was one which had been, in the first instance, posted from London and  this letter Mr. Sheldon examined with especial attention.</p>
<p>It was a big, official-looking document, and  embossed upon the adhesive envelope appeared the crest and motto of the  Alliance Insurance Office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether that&rsquo;s all square,&rdquo; thought Mr.  Sheldon, as he turned the envelope about in his hands, staring at it absently.  &ldquo;I ought to make sure of that. The London postmark is nearly three weeks old.&rdquo;  He pondered for some moments, and then went to the cupboard in which he kept  the materials wherewith to replenish or to make a fire. Here he found a little  tin tea-kettle, in which he was in the habit of boiling water for occasional  friendly glasses of grog. He poured some water from a bottle on the sideboard  into this kettle, set fire to a bundle of wood, and put the kettle on the  blazing sticks. After having done this he searched for a tea-cup, succeeded in  finding one, and then stood watching for the boiling of the water. He had not  long to wait; the water boiled furiously before the wood was burned out, and  Mr. Sheldon filled the tea-cup standing on the table. Then he put the  insurance-letter over the cup, with the seal downwards, and left it so while he  resumed his walk. After walking up and down for about ten minutes he went back  to the table and took up the letter. The adhesive envelope opened easily, and  Mr. Sheldon, by this ingenious stratagem, made himself master of his friend&rsquo;s  business.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Alliance&rdquo; letter was nothing more than a  notice to the effect that the half-yearly premium for insuring the sum of three  thousand pounds on the life of Thomas Halliday would be due on such a day,  after which there would be twenty-one days&rsquo; grace, at the end of which time the  policy would become void, unless the premium had been duly paid.</p>
<p>Mr. Halliday&rsquo;s letters had been suffered to  accumulate during the last fortnight. The letters forwarded from Yorkshire had  been detained some time, as they had been sent first to Hyley Farm, now in the  possession of the new owner, and then to Barlingford, to the house of Georgy&rsquo;s  mother, who had kept them upwards of a week, in daily expectation of her  son-in-law&rsquo;s return. It was only on the receipt of a letter from Georgy,  containing the tidings of her husband&rsquo;s illness, that Mr. Halliday&rsquo;s letters  had been sent to London. Thus it came about that the twenty-one days of grace  were within four-and-twenty hours of expiring when Philip Sheldon opened his  friend&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is serious,&rdquo; muttered the dentist, as he  stood deliberating with the open letter in his hand; &ldquo;there are three thousand  pounds depending on that man&rsquo;s power to write a check!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few minutes&rsquo; reflection, he folded the  letter and resealed it very carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do to press the matter upon him  to-night,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;I must wait till to-morrow morning, come what may.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
  Mr. Burkham&rsquo;s Uncertainties</h2>
<p>The next morning dawned gray and pale and chill,  after the manner of early spring mornings, let them ripen into never such balmy  days; and with the dawn Nancy Woolper came into the invalid&rsquo;s chamber, more wan  and sickly of aspect than the morning itself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Halliday started from an uneasy slumber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Nancy?&rdquo; she asked with  considerable alarm. She had known the woman ever since her childhood, and she  was startled this morning by some indefinable change in her manner and  appearance. The hearty old woman, whose face had been like a hard rosy apple  shrivelled and wrinkled by long keeping, had now a white and ghastly look which  struck terror to Georgy&rsquo;s breast. She who was usually so brisk of manner and  sharp of speech, had this morning a strange subdued tone and an unnatural  calmness of demeanour. &ldquo;What is the matter, Nancy?&rdquo; Mrs. Halliday repeated,  getting up from her sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Miss Georgy,&rdquo; answered the  old woman, who was apt to forget that Tom Halliday&rsquo;s wife had ever ceased to be  Georgy Cradock; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be frightened, my dear. I haven&rsquo;t been very well all  night, &mdash; and &mdash; and &mdash; I&rsquo;ve been worrying myself about Mr. Halliday. If I were  you, I&rsquo;d call in another doctor. Never mind what Mr. Philip says. He may be  mistaken, you know, clever as he is. There&rsquo;s no telling. Take my advice, Miss  Georgy, and call in another doctor &mdash; directly &mdash; directly,&rdquo; repeated the old  woman, seizing Mrs. Halliday&rsquo;s wrist with a passionate energy, as if to give  emphasis to her words. Poor timid Georgy shrank from her with terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You frighten me, Nancy,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;do you  think that Tom is so much worse? You have not been with him all night; and he  has been sleeping very quietly. What makes you so anxious this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that, Miss Georgy. You get another  doctor, that&rsquo;s all; get another doctor at once. Mr. Sheldon is a light sleeper.  I&rsquo;ll go to his room and tell him you&rsquo;ve set your heart upon having fresh  advice; if you&rsquo;ll only bear me out afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; go by all means,&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.  Halliday, only too ready to take alarm under the influence of a stronger mind,  and eager to act when supported by another person.</p>
<p>Nancy Woolper went to her master&rsquo;s room. He must  have been sleeping very lightly, if he was sleeping at all; for he was broad  awake the next minute after his housekeeper&rsquo;s light knock had sounded on the  door. In less than five minutes he came out of his room half-dressed. Nancy had  told him that Mrs. Halliday had taken fresh alarm about her husband, and wished  for further advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sent you to tell me that?&rdquo; asked Philip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when does she want this new doctor called in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately, if possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was seven o&rsquo;clock by this time, and the morning  was brightening a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon; &ldquo;her wishes shall be  attended to directly. Heaven forbid that I should stand between my old friend  and any chance of his speedy recovery! If a stranger can bring him round  quicker than I can, let the stranger come.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon was not slow to obey Mrs. Halliday&rsquo;s  behest. He was departing on his quest breakfastless, when Nancy Woolper met him  in the hall with a cup of tea. He accepted the cup almost mechanically from her  hand, and took it into the parlour, whither Nancy followed him. Then for the  first time he perceived that change in his housekeeper&rsquo;s face which had so  startled Georgina Halliday. The change was somewhat modified now; but still the  Nancy Woolper of to-day was not the Nancy Woolper of yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re looking very queer, Nancy,&rdquo; said the  dentist, gravely scrutinising the woman&rsquo;s face with his bright penetrating  eyes. &ldquo;Are you ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Philip, I have been rather queer all  night, &mdash; sickish and faintish-like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ve been over-fatiguing yourself in the  sick-room, I daresay.<br>
  Take care you don&rsquo;t knock yourself up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s not that, Mr. Philip. There&rsquo;s not many  can stand hard work better than I can. It&rsquo;s not <em>that</em> as made me ill. I took something last night that disagreed  with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More fool you,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon curtly; &ldquo;you  ought to know better than to ill-use your digestive powers at your age. What  was it? Hard cold meat and preternaturally green pickles, I suppose; or  something of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; it was only a drop of beef-tea that I  made for poor Mr. Halliday. And that oughtn&rsquo;t to have disagreed with a baby, you  know, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oughtn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; cried the dentist disdainfully.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a little bit of vulgar ignorance, Mrs. Woolper. I suppose it was stuff  that had been taken up to Mr. Halliday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Philip; you took it up with your own  hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, to be sure; so I did. Very well, then, Mrs.  Woolper, if you knew as much about atmospheric influences as I do, you&rsquo;d know  that food which has been standing for hours in the pestilential air of a  fever-patient&rsquo;s room isn&rsquo;t fit for anybody to eat. The stuff made you sick, I  suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; sick to my very heart,&rdquo; answered the  Yorkshirewoman, with a strange mournfulness in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let that be a warning to you, then. Don&rsquo;t take  anything more that comes down from the sick-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;ll be any chance of my doing  that long, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy Mr. Halliday is long for this  world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you women are always ravens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless the strange doctor can do something to cure  him. O, pray bring a clever man who will be able to cure that poor helpless  creature upstairs. Think, Mr. Philip, how you and him used to be friends and  playfellows, &mdash; brothers almost, &mdash; when you was both bits of boys. Think how bad  it might seem to evil-minded folks if he died under your roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dentist had been standing near the door  drinking his tea during this conversation; and now for the first time he looked  at his housekeeper with an expression of unmitigated astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, in the name of all that&rsquo;s ridiculous, do you  mean, Nancy?&rdquo; he asked impatiently. &ldquo;What has my roof to do with Tom Halliday&rsquo;s  illness &mdash; or his death, if it came to that? And what on earth can people have  to say about it if he should die here instead of anywhere else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you see, sir, you being his friend, and Miss  Georgy&rsquo;s sweetheart that was, and him having no other doctor, folks might take  it into their heads he wasn&rsquo;t attended properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m his friend? That&rsquo;s very good logic!  I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Mrs. Woolper; if any woman upon earth, except the  woman who nursed me when I was a baby, had presumed to talk to me as you have  been talking to me just this minute, I should open the door yonder and tell her  to walk out of my house. Let that serve as a hint for you, Nancy; and don&rsquo;t you  go out of your way a second time to advise me how I should treat my friend and  my patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed her the empty cup, and walked out of the  house. There had been no passion in his tone. His accent had been only that of  a man who has occasion to reprove an old and trusted servant for an unwarrantable  impertinence. Nancy Woolper stood at the street-door watching him as he walked  away, and then went slowly back to her duties in the lower regions of the  house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be true,&rdquo; she muttered to herself; &ldquo;it  can&rsquo;t be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The dentist returned to Fitzgeorge-street in less  than an hour, bringing with him a surgeon from the neighbourhood, who saw the  patient, discussed the treatment, spoke hopefully to Mrs. Halliday, and  departed, after promising to send a saline draught. Poor Georgy&rsquo;s spirits,  which had revived a little under the influence of the stranger&rsquo;s hopeful words,  sank again when she discovered that the utmost the new doctor could do was to  order a saline draught. Her husband had taken so many saline draughts, and had  been getting daily worse under their influence.</p>
<p>She watched the stranger wistfully as he lingered  on the threshold to say a few words to Mr. Sheldon. He was a very young man,  with a frank boyish face and a rosy colour in his cheeks. He looked like some  fresh young neophyte in the awful mysteries of medical science, and by no means  the sort of man to whom one would have imagined Philip Sheldon appealing for  help, when he found his own skill at fault. But then it must be remembered that  Mr. Sheldon had only summoned the stranger in compliance with what he  considered a womanish whim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks very young,&rdquo; Georgina said regretfully,  after the doctor&rsquo;s departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better, my dear Mrs. Halliday,&rdquo;  answered the dentist cheerfully; &ldquo;medical science is eminently progressive, and  the youngest men are the best-educated men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Georgy did not understand this; but it sounded  convincing, and she was in the habit of believing what people told her; so she  accepted Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s opinion. How could she doubt that he was wiser than  herself in all matters connected with the medical profession?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom seems a little better this morning,&rdquo; she said  presently.</p>
<p>The invalid was asleep, shrouded by the curtain of  the heavy old-fashioned four-post bedstead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is better,&rdquo; answered the dentist; &ldquo;so much  better, that I shall venture to give him a few business letters that have been  waiting for him some time, as soon as he wakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seated himself by the head of the bed, and  waited quietly for the awakening of the patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your breakfast is ready for you downstairs, Mrs.  Halliday,&rdquo; he said presently; &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t you better go down and take it, while I  keep watch here? It&rsquo;s nearly ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about any breakfast,&rdquo; Georgina  answered piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you&rsquo;d better eat something. You&rsquo;ll make  yourself an invalid, if you are not careful; and then you won&rsquo;t be able to  attend upon Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This argument prevailed immediately. Georgy went  downstairs to the drawing-room, and tried bravely to eat and drink, in order  that she might be sustained in her attendance upon her husband. She had  forgotten all the throes and tortures of jealousy which she had endured on his  account. She had forgotten his late hours and unholy roisterings. She had  forgotten everything except that he had been very tender and kind throughout  the prosperous years of their married life, and that he was lying in the  darkened room upstairs sick to death.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon waited with all outward show of  patience for the awakening of the invalid. But he looked at his watch twice  during that half-hour of waiting; and once he rose and moved softly about the  room, searching for writing materials. He found a little portfolio of  Georgina&rsquo;s, and a frivolous-minded inkstand, after the semblance of an apple,  with a gilt stalk and leaflet. The dentist took the trouble to ascertain that  there was a decent supply of ink in the green-glass apple, and that the pens  were in working order. Then he went quietly back to his seat by the bedside and  waited.</p>
<p>The invalid opened his eyes presently, and  recognised his friend with a feeble smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Tom, old fellow, how do you feel to-day? &mdash; a  little better I hear from Mrs. H.,&rdquo; said the dentist cheerily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I am a shade better. But, you see,  the deuce of it is I never get more than a shade better. It always stops at  that. The little woman can&rsquo;t complain of me now, can she, Sheldon? No more late  hours, or oyster suppers, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, not just yet. You&rsquo;ll have to take care of  yourself for a week or two when you get about again.&rdquo; Mr. Halliday smiled  faintly as his friend said this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very careful of myself if I ever do get  about again, you may depend upon it, old fellow. But do you know I sometimes  fancy I have spent my last jolly evening, and eaten my last oyster supper, on  this earth? I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s time for me to begin to think seriously of a good  many things. The little woman is all right, thank God. I made my will upwards  of a year ago, and insured my life pretty heavily soon after my marriage. Old  Cradock never let me rest till that was done. So Georgy will be all safe. But  when a man has led a careless, godless kind of a life, &mdash; doing very little  harm, perhaps, but doing no particular good, &mdash; he ought to set about making up  his account somehow for a better world, when he feels himself slipping out of  this. I asked Georgy for her Bible yesterday, and the poor dear loving little  thing was frightened out of her wits. &lsquo;O, don&rsquo;t talk like that, Tom,&rsquo; she  cried; &lsquo;Mr. Sheldon says you are getting better every hour,&rsquo; &mdash; by which you may  guess what a rare thing it is for me to read my Bible. No, Phil, old fellow,  you&rsquo;ve done your best for me, I know; but I&rsquo;m not made of a very tough  material, and all the physic you can pour down this poor sore throat of mine  won&rsquo;t put any strength into me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, dear boy; that&rsquo;s just what a man who has  not been accustomed to illness is sure to think directly he is laid up for a  day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been laid up for three weeks,&rdquo; murmured Mr.  Halliday rather fretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, perhaps this Mr. Burkham will bring  you round in three days, and then you&rsquo;ll say that your friend Sheldon was an  ignoramus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I shan&rsquo;t, old fellow; I&rsquo;m not such a fool  as that. I&rsquo;m not going to blame you when it&rsquo;s my own constitution that&rsquo;s in  fault. As to that young man you brought here just now, to please Georgy, I  don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;ll be able to do any more for me than you have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll contrive to bring you round between us,  never fear, Tom,&rdquo; answered Philip Sheldon in his most hopeful tone. &ldquo;Why, you  are looking almost your old self this morning. You are so much improved that I  may venture to talk to you about business. There have been some letters lying  about for the last few days. I didn&rsquo;t like to bore you while you were so very  low. But they look like business letters; and perhaps it would be as well for  you to open them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sick man contemplated the little packet which  the dentist had taken from his breast-pocket; and then shook his head wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not up to the mark, Sheldon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the  letters must keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, come, come, old fellow! That&rsquo;s giving way, you  know. The letters may be important; and it will do you good if you make an  effort to rouse yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you it isn&rsquo;t in me to do it, Philip  Sheldon. I&rsquo;m past making efforts. Can&rsquo;t you see that, man? Open the letters  yourself, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Halliday, I won&rsquo;t do that. Here&rsquo;s one with  the seal of the<br>
  Alliance Insurance Office. I suppose your premium is all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom Halliday lifted himself on his elbow for a  moment, startled into new life; but he sank back on the pillows again  immediately, with a feeble groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; he said anxiously;  &ldquo;you&rsquo;d better look to that, Phil, for the little woman&rsquo;s sake. A man is apt to  think that his insurance is settled and done with, when he has been pommelled  about by the doctors and approved by the board. He forgets there&rsquo;s that little  matter of the premium. You&rsquo;d better open the letter, Phil. I never was a good  hand at remembering dates, and this illness has thrown me altogether out of  gear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon tore open that official document,  which, in his benevolent regard for his friend&rsquo;s interest, he had manipulated  so cleverly on the previous evening, and read the letter with all show of  deliberation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Tom,&rdquo; he exclaimed presently. &ldquo;The  twenty-one days&rsquo; grace expire to-day. You&rsquo;d better write me a check at once,  and I&rsquo;ll send it on to the office by hand. Where&rsquo;s your check-book?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the pocket of that coat hanging up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip Sheldon found the check-book, and brought it  to his friend, with Georgy&rsquo;s portfolio, and the frivolous little green-glass  inkstand in the shape of an apple. He adjusted the writing materials for the  sick man&rsquo;s use with womanly gentleness. His arm supported the wasted frame, as  Tom Halliday slowly and laboriously filled in the check; and when the signature  was duly appended to that document, he drew a long breath, which seemed to  express infinite relief of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sure it goes on to the Alliance Office,  eh, old fellow?&rdquo; asked Tom, as he tore out the oblong slip of paper and handed  it to his friend. &ldquo;It was kind of you to jog my memory about this business. I&rsquo;m  such a fellow for procrastinating matters. And I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve been a little  off my load during the last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Tom; not you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, I have. I&rsquo;ve had all sorts of queer  fancies. Did you come into this room the night before last, when Georgy was  asleep?&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon reflected for a moment before answering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not the night before last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I thought as much,&rdquo; murmured the invalid. &ldquo;I  was off my head that night then, Phil, for I fancied I saw you; and I fancied I  heard the bottles and glasses jingling on the little table behind the curtain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were dreaming, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no, I wasn&rsquo;t dreaming. I was very restless and  wakeful that night. However, that&rsquo;s neither here nor there. I lie in a stupid  state sometimes for hours and hours, and I feel as weak as a rat, bodily and  mentally; so while I have my wits about me, I&rsquo;d better say what I&rsquo;ve been  wanting to say ever so long. You&rsquo;ve been a good and kind friend to me all  through this illness, Phil, and I&rsquo;m not ungrateful for your kindness. If it  does come to the worst with me &mdash; as I believe it will &mdash; Georgy shall give you a  handsome mourning ring, or fifty pounds to buy one, if you like it better. And  now let me shake hands with you, Philip Sheldon, and say thank you heartily,  old fellow, for once and for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The invalid stretched out a poor feeble attenuated  hand, and, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, Philip Sheldon clasped it in his own  muscular fingers. He did hesitate for just one instant before taking that hand.</p>
<p>He was no student of the gospel; but when he had  left the sick-chamber there arose before him suddenly, as if written in letters  of fire on the wall opposite to him, one sentence which had been familiar to  him in his school-days at Barlingford:</p>
<p><em>And as soon  as he was come, he goeth straightway to him, and saith, Master, master; and  kissed him.</em> </p>
<p>The new doctor came twice a day to see his patient.  He seemed rather anxious about the case, and just a little puzzled by the  symptoms. Georgy had sufficient penetration to perceive that this new adviser  was in some manner at fault; and she began to think that Philip Sheldon was  right, and that regular practitioners were very stupid creatures. She  communicated her doubts to Mr. Sheldon, and suggested the expediency of calling  in some grave elderly doctor, to supersede Mr. Burkham. But against this the  dentist protested very strongly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You asked me to call in a stranger, Mrs. Halliday,  and I have done so,&rdquo; he said, with the dignity of an offended man. &ldquo;You must  now abide by his treatment, and content yourself with his advice, unless he  chooses to summon further assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Georgy was fain to submit. She gave a little  plaintive sigh, and went back to her husband&rsquo;s room, where she sat and wept  silently behind the bed-curtains. There was a double watch kept in the  sick-chamber now; for Nancy Woolper rarely left it, and rarely closed her eyes.  It was altogether a sad time in the dentist&rsquo;s house; and Tom Halliday  apologised to his friend more than once for the trouble he had brought upon  him. If he had been familiar with the details of modern history, he would have  quoted Charles Stuart, and begged pardon for being so long a-dying.</p>
<p>But anon there came a gleam of hope. The patient  seemed decidedly better; and Georgy was prepared to revere Mr. Burkham, the  Bloomsbury surgeon, as the greatest and ablest of men. Those shadows of doubt  and perplexity which had at first obscured Mr. Burkham&rsquo;s brow cleared away, and  he spoke very cheerfully of the invalid.</p>
<p>Unhappily this state of things did not last long.  The young surgeon came one morning, and was obviously alarmed by the appearance  of his patient. He told Philip Sheldon as much; but that gentleman made very  light of his fears. As the two men discussed the case, it was very evident that  the irregular practitioner was quite a match for the regular one. Mr. Burkham  listened deferentially, but departed only half convinced. He walked briskly  away from the house, but came to a dead stop directly after turning out of  Fitzgeorge-street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What ought I to do?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;What  course ought I to take? If I am right, I should be a villain to let things go  on. If I am wrong, anything like interference would ruin me for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had finished his morning round, but he did not  go straight home. He lingered at the corners of quiet streets, and walked up  and down the unfrequented side of a gloomy square. Once he turned and retraced  his steps in the direction of Fitzgeorge-street. But after all this hesitation  he walked home, and ate his dinner very thoughtfully, answering his young wife  at random when she talked to him. He was a struggling man, who had invested his  small fortune in the purchase of a practice which had turned out a very poor  one, and he had the battle of life before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something on your mind to-day, I&rsquo;m sure,  Harry,&rdquo; his wife said before the meal was ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, dear,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve rather a  difficult case in<br>
  Fitzgeorge-street, and I&rsquo;m anxious about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The industrious little wife disappeared after  dinner, and the young surgeon walked up and down the room alone, brooding over  that difficult case in Fitzgeorge-street. After spending nearly an hour thus,  he snatched his hat suddenly from the table on which he had set it down, and  hurried from the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have advice and assistance, come what may,&rdquo;  he said to himself, as he walked rapidly in the direction of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s  house. &ldquo;The case may be straight enough &mdash; I certainly can&rsquo;t see that the man  has any motive &mdash; but I&rsquo;ll have advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at the dentist&rsquo;s spotless dwelling as  he crossed the street. The blinds were all down, and the fact that they were so  sent a sudden chill to his heart. But the April sunshine was full upon that  side of the street, and there might lie no significance in those closely-drawn  blinds. The door was opened by a sleepy-looking boy, and in the passage Mr.  Burkham met Philip Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been rather anxious about my patient since  this morning, Mr.
  Sheldon,&rdquo; said the surgeon; &ldquo;and I have come to the conclusion that I
  ought to confer with a man of higher standing than myself. Do you think
Mrs. Halliday will object to such a course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure she would not have objected to it,&rdquo; the  dentist answered very gravely, &ldquo;if you had suggested it sooner. I am sorry to  say the suggestion comes too late. My poor friend breathed his last half an  hour ago.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  A Golden Temple</h2>
<p>In the very midst of the Belgian iron country,  under the shadow of tall sheltering ridges of pine-clad mountain-land, nestles  the fashionable little watering-place called For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne. Two or three  handsome hotels; a bright white new pile of building, with vast windows of  shining plate-glass, and a stately quadrangular courtyard; a tiny street, which  looks as if a fragment of English Brighton had been dropped into this Belgian  valley; a stunted semi-classic temple, which is at once a post-office and a  shrine whereat invalids perform their worship of Hygeia by the consumption of  unspeakably disagreeable mineral waters; a few tall white villas scattered here  and there upon the slopes of pine-clad hills; and a very uncomfortable  railway-station &mdash; constitute the chief features of For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne. But right and  left of that little cluster of shops and hotels there stretch deep sombre  avenues of oak, that look like sheltered ways to Paradise &mdash; and the deep, deep  blue of the August sky, and the pure breath of the warm soft air, and the  tender green of the young pine-woods that clothe the sandy hills, and the  delicious tranquillity that pervades the sleepy little town and bathes the hot  landscape in a languorous mist, are charms that render For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne a pleasant  oasis amid the lurid woods and mountains of the iron country.</p>
<p>Only at stated intervals the quiet of this sleepy  hollow is broken by the rolling of wheels, the jingling of bells, the cracking  of whips, the ejaculations of drivers, and supplications of touters: only when  the railroad carries away departing visitors, or brings fresh ones, is there  anything like riot or confusion in the little town under the pine-clad hills &mdash;  and even then the riot and confusion are of a very mild order, and create but a  transient discord amongst the harmonies of nature.</p>
<p>And yet, despite the Arcadian tranquillity of the  landscape, the drowsy quiet of the pine-groves, the deep and solemn shade of  those dark avenues, where one might fondly hope to find some Druidess lingering  beneath the shelter of the oaks, there is excitement of no common order to be  found in the miniature watering-place of For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne; and the reflective and  observant traveller, on a modern sentimental journey, has only to enter the  stately white building with the glittering plate-glass windows in order to  behold the master-passions of the human breast unveiled for his pleasure and  edification.</p>
<p>The ignorant traveller, impelled by curiosity,  finds no bar to his entrance. The doors are as wide open as if the mansion were  an hotel; and yet it is not an hotel, though a placard which he passes informs  the traveller that he may have ices and sorbets, if he will; nor is the bright  fresh-looking building a theatre, for another placard informs the visitor that  there are dramatic performances to be witnessed every evening in a building on  one side of the quadrangle, which is a mere subsidiary attachment to the vast  white mansion. The traveller, passing on his way unhindered, save by a man in  livery, who deprives him of his cane, ascends a splendid staircase and  traverses a handsome antechamber, from which a pair of plate-glass doors open  into a spacious saloon, where, in the warm August sunlight, a circle of men and  women are gathered round a great green table, gambling.</p>
<p>The ignorant traveller, unaccustomed to the  amusements of a Continental watering-place, may perhaps feel a little sense of  surprise &mdash; a something almost akin to shame &mdash; as he contemplates that silent  crowd, whose occupation seems so much the more strange to him because of their  silence. There is no lively bustle, none of that animation which generally  attends every kind of amusement, none of the clamour of the betting-ring or the  exchange. The gamblers at For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne are terribly in earnest: and the  ignorant visitor unconsciously adapts himself to the solemn hush of the place,  and steps softly as he approaches the table round which they are clustered &mdash; as  many sitting as can find room round the green-cloth-covered board; while behind  the sitters there are people standing two or three rows deep, the hindermost  watching the table over the shoulders of their neighbours. A placard upon the  wall informs visitors that only constant players are permitted to remain seated  at that sacred table. Perhaps a third of the players and a third of the  lookers-on are women. And if there are lips more tightly contracted than other  lips, and eyes with a harder, greedier light in them than other eyes, those  lips and those eyes belong to the women. The ungloved feminine hands have a  claw-like aspect as they scrape the glittering pieces of silver over the green  cloth; the feminine throats look weird and scraggy as they crane themselves  over masculine shoulders; the feminine eyes have something demoniac in their  steely glare as they keep watch upon the rapid progress of the game.</p>
<p>Half a dozen moderate fortunes seem to be lost and  won while the traveller looks on from the background, unnoticed and unseen; for  if those plate-glass doors swung suddenly open to admit the seven angels of the  Apocalypse, carrying the seven golden vials filled with the wrath of God, it is  doubtful whether the splendour of their awful glory, or the trumpet-notes that  heralded their coming, would have power to arouse the players from their  profound abstraction.</p>
<p>Half a dozen comfortable little patrimonies seem to  have changed hands while the traveller has been looking on; and yet he has only  watched the table for about ten minutes; and this splendid <em>salon</em> is but an outer chamber, where one may stake as shabby a sum  as two francs, if one is shabby enough to wish to do so, and where playing for  half an hour or so on a pleasant summer morning one could scarcely lose more  than fifty or sixty pounds. Another pair of plate-glass doors open into an  inner chamber, where the silence is still more profound, and where around a  larger table sit one row of players; while only here and there a little group  of outsiders stand behind their chairs. There is more gilding on the walls and  ceiling of this chamber; the frescoes are more delicate; the crystal  chandeliers are adorned with rich clusters of sparkling drops, that twinkle  like diamonds in the sun. This is the temple of gold; and in this splendid  chamber one may hazard no smaller stake than half a napoleon. There are women  here; but not so many women as in the outer saloon; and the women here are  younger and prettier and more carefully dressed than those who stake only  silver.</p>
<p>The prettiest and the youngest woman in this golden  chamber on one particular August afternoon, nine years after the death of Tom  Halliday, was a girl who stood behind the chair of a military-looking  Englishman, an old man whose handsome face was a little disfigured by those  traces which late hours and dissipated habits are supposed to leave behind  them.</p>
<p>The girl held a card in one hand and a pin in the  other, and was occupied in some mysterious process, by which she kept note of  the Englishman&rsquo;s play. She was very young, with a delicate face, in whose  softer lines there was a refined likeness to the features of the man whose play  she watched. But while his eyes were hard and cold and gray, hers were of that  dense black in which there seems such an unfathomable and mysterious depth. As  she was the handsomest, so she was also the worst-dressed woman in the room.  Her flimsy silk mantle had faded from black to rusty brown; the straw hat which  shaded her face was sunburnt; the ribbons had lost their brightness; but there  was an air of attempted fashion in the puffings and trimmings of her alpaca  skirt; and there was evidence of a struggle with poverty in the tight-fitting lavender  gloves, whose streaky lines bore witness to the imperfection of the cleaner&rsquo;s  art. Elegant Parisians and the select of Brussels glanced at the military  Englishman and his handsome daughter with some slight touch of supercilious  surprise &mdash; one has no right to find shabbily-dressed young women in the golden  temple &mdash; and it is scarcely necessary to state that it was from her own  countrywomen the young person in alpaca received the most chilling glances. But  those Parthian arrows shot from feminine eyes had little power to wound their  object just now. The girl looked up from her perforated card very seldom; and  when she raised her eyes, it was always to look in one direction &mdash; towards the  great glass doors opening from the outer saloon. Loungers came and went; the  doors swung open and closed again as noiselessly as it is possible for  well-regulated doors to open and shut; footsteps sounded on the polished  floors; and sometimes when the young person in alpaca lifted her eyes, a  passing shadow of disappointment darkened her face. A modern Laurence Sterne,  on a new Sentimental Journey, might have derived some interest from the study  of the girl&rsquo;s countenance; but the reflective and observant traveller is not to  be encountered very often in this age of excursionists; and Maria and her goat  may roam the highways and byways for a long time before she will find any  dreamy loiterer with a mind attuned to sympathy.</p>
<p>The shabbily-dressed girl was looking for some one.  She watched her father&rsquo;s play carefully &mdash; she marked her card with unfailing  precision; but she performed these duties with a mechanical air; and it was  only when she lifted her eyes to the great shining plate-glass doors which  opened into this dangerous Paradise, that any ray of feeling animated her countenance.  She was looking for some one, and the person watched for was so long coming.  Ah, how difficult for the arithmetician to number the crushing disappointments,  the bitter agonies that one woman can endure in a single half-hour! This girl  was so young &mdash; so young; and already she had learnt to suffer.</p>
<p>The man played with the concentrated attention and  the impassible countenance of an experienced gamester, rarely lifting his eyes  from the green cloth, never looking back at the girl who stood behind him. He  was winning to-day, and he accepted his good fortune as quietly as he had often  accepted evil fortune at the same table. He seemed to be playing on some system  of his own; and neighbouring players looked at him with envious eyes, as they  saw the pile of gold grow larger under his thin nervous hands. Ignorant  gamesters, who stood aloof after having lost two or three napoleons,  contemplated the lucky Englishman and wondered about him, while some touch of  pity leavened the envy excited by his wonderful fortune. He looked like a  decayed gentleman &mdash; a man who had been a military dandy in the days that were  gone, and who had all the old pretensions still, without the power to support  them &mdash; a Brummel languishing at Caen; a Nash wasting slowly at Bath.</p>
<p>At last the girl&rsquo;s face brightened suddenly as she  glanced upwards; and it would have been very easy for the observant traveller &mdash;  if any such person had existed &mdash; to construe aright that bright change in her  countenance. The some one she had been watching for had arrived.</p>
<p>The doors swung open to admit a man of about  five-and-twenty, whose darkly-handsome face and careless costume had something  of that air which was once wont to be associated with the person and the poetry  of George Gordon Lord Byron. The new-comer was just one of those men whom very  young women are apt to admire, and whom worldly-minded people are prone to  distrust. There was a perfume of Bohemianism, a flavour of the Quartier Latin,  about the loosely-tied cravat, the wide trousers, and black-velvet morning  coat, with which the young man outraged the opinions of respectable visitors at  For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne. There was a semi-poetic vagabondism in the half-indifferent,  half-contemptuous expression of his face, with its fierce moustache, and  strongly-marked eyebrows overshadowing sleepy gray eyes &mdash; eyes that were half  hidden, by their long dark lashes; as still pools of blue water lie sometimes  hidden among the rushes that nourish round them.</p>
<p>He was handsome, and he knew that he was handsome;  but he affected to despise the beauty of his proud dark face, as he affected to  despise all the brightest and most beautiful things upon earth: and yet there  was a vagabondish kind of foppery in his costume that contrasted sharply with  the gentlemanly dandyism of the shabby gamester sitting at the table. There was  a distance of nearly half a century between the style of the Regency dandy and  the Quartier-Latin lion.</p>
<p>The girl watched the new-comer with sad earnest  eyes as he walked slowly towards the table, and a faint blush kindled in her  cheeks as he came nearer to the spot where she stood. He went by her presently,  carrying an atmosphere of stale tobacco with him as he went; and he gave her a  friendly nod as he passed, and a &ldquo;Good morning, Diana;&rdquo; but that was all. The  faint blush faded and left her very pale: but she resumed her weary task with  the card and the pin; and if she had endured any disappointment within those  few moments, it seemed to be a kind of disappointment that she was accustomed  to suffer.</p>
<p>The young man walked round the table till he came  to the only vacant chair, in which he seated himself, and after watching the  game for a few minutes, began to play. From the moment in which he dropped into  that vacant seat to the moment in which he rose to leave the table, three hours  afterwards, he never lifted his eyes from the green cloth, or seemed to be  conscious of anything that was going on around or about him. The girl watched  him furtively for some little time after he had taken his place at the table;  but the stony mask of the professed gambler is a profitless object for a  woman&rsquo;s earnest scrutiny.</p>
<p>She sighed presently, and laid her hand heavily on  the chair behind which she was standing. The action aroused the man who sat in  it, and he turned and looked at her for the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are tired, Diana?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa, I am very tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your card, then, and go away,&rdquo; the  gamester answered peevishly; &ldquo;girls are always tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him the mysteriously-perforated card, and  left her post behind his chair; and then, after roaming about the great saloon  with a weary listless air, and wandering from one open window to another to  look into the sunny quadrangle, where well-dressed people were sitting at  little tables eating ices or drinking lemonade, she went away altogether, and  roamed into another chamber where some children were dancing to the sound of a  feeble violin. She sat upon a velvet-covered bench, and watched the children&rsquo;s  lesson for some minutes, and then rose and wandered to another open window that  overlooked the same quadrangle, where the well-dressed people were enjoying  themselves in the hot August sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How extravagantly everybody dresses!&rdquo; she thought,  &ldquo;and what a shabby poverty-stricken creature one feels amongst them! And yet if  I ask papa to give me a couple of napoleons out of the money he won to-day, he  will only look at me from head to foot, and tell me I have a gown and a cloak  and a bonnet, and ask me what more I can want, in the name of all that is  unreasonable? And I see girls here whose fathers are so fond of them and so  proud of them &mdash; ugly girls, decked out in silks and muslins and ribbons that  have cost a small fortune &mdash; clumsy awkward girls, who look at <em>me</em> as if I were some new kind of wild  animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The saloons at For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne were rich in monster  sheets of looking-glass; and in wandering discontentedly about the room Diana  Paget saw herself reflected many times in all her shabbiness. It was only very  lately she had discovered that she had some pretension to good looks; for her father,  who could not or would not educate her decently or clothe her creditably, took  a very high tone of morality in his paternal teaching, and, in the fear that  she might one day grow vain of her beauty, had taken care to impress upon her  at an early age that she was the very incarnation of all that is lean and  sallow and awkward.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  The Easy Descent</h2>
<p>Amongst the many imprudences of which Horatio Paget  &mdash; once a cornet in a crack cavalry regiment, always a captain in his  intercourse with the world &mdash; had been guilty during the course of a long  career, there was none for which he so bitterly reproached himself as for a  certain foolish marriage which he had made late in his life. It was when he had  thrown away the last chance that an indulgent destiny had given him, that the  ruined fop of the Regency, the sometime member of the Beef-steak Club, the man  who in his earliest youth had worn a silver gridiron at his button-hole, and  played piquet in the gilded saloons of Georgina of Devonshire, found himself laid  on a bed of sickness in dingy London lodgings, and nearer death than he had  ever been in the course of his brief military career; so nearly gliding from  life&rsquo;s swift-flowing river into eternity&rsquo;s trackless ocean, that the warmest  thrill of gratitude which ever stirred the slow pulses of his cold heart  quickened its beating as he clasped the hand that had held him back from the  unknown region whose icy breath had chilled him with an awful fear. Such men as  Horatio Paget are apt to feel a strange terror when the black night drops  suddenly down upon them, and the &ldquo;Gray Boatman&rsquo;s&rdquo; voice sounds hollow and  mysterious in the darkness, announcing that the ocean is near. The hand that  held the ruined spendthrift back when the current swept so swiftly oceanward was  a woman&rsquo;s tender hand; and Heaven only knows what patient watchfulness, what  careful administration of medicines and unwearying preparation of broths and  jellies and sagos and gruels, what untiring and devoted slavery, had been  necessary to save the faded rake who looked out upon the world once more, a  ghastly shadow of his former self, a penniless helpless burden for any one who  might choose to support him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank <em>me</em>,&rdquo;  said the doctor, when his feeble patient whimpered flourishing protestations of  his gratitude, unabashed by the consciousness that such grateful protestations  were the sole coin with which the medical man would be paid for his services;  &ldquo;thank that young woman, if you want to thank anybody; for if it had not been  for her you wouldn&rsquo;t be here to talk about gratitude. And if ever you get such  another attack of inflammation on the lungs, you had better pray for such  another nurse, though I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re likely to find one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this exordium, the rough-and-ready surgeon  took his departure, leaving Horatio Paget alone with the woman who had saved  his life.</p>
<p>She was only his landlady&rsquo;s daughter; and his  landlady was no prosperous householder in Mayfair, thriving on the extravagance  of wealthy bachelors, but an honest widow, living in an obscure little street  leading out of the Old Kent-road, and letting a meagrely-furnished little  parlour and a still more meagrely-furnished little bedroom to any single  gentleman whom reverse of fortune might lead into such a locality. Captain  Paget had sunk very low in the world when he took possession of that wretched  parlour and laid himself down to rest on the widow&rsquo;s flock-bed.</p>
<p>There is apt to be a dreary interval in the life of  such a man &mdash; a blank dismal interregnum, which divides the day in which he  spends his last shilling from the hour in which he begins to prey deliberately  upon the purses of other people. It was in that hopeless interval that Horatio  Paget established himself in the widow&rsquo;s parlour. But though he slept in the  Old Kent-road, he had not yet brought himself to endure existence on that  Surrey side of the water. He emerged from his lodging every morning to hasten  westward, resplendent in clean linen and exquisitely-fitting gloves, and  unquestionable overcoat, and varnished boots.</p>
<p>The wardrobe has its Indian summer; and the glory  of a first-rate tailor&rsquo;s coat is like the splendour of a tropical sun &mdash; it is  glorious to the last, and sinks in a moment. Captain Paget&rsquo;s wardrobe was in  its Indian summer in these days; and when he felt how fatally near the  Bond-street pavement was to the soles of his feet, he could not refrain from a  fond admiration of the boots that were so beautiful in decay.</p>
<p>He walked the West-end for many weary hours every  day during this period of his decadence. He tried to live in an honest  gentlemanly way, by borrowing money of his friends, or discounting an  accommodation-bill obtained from some innocent acquaintance who was deluded by  his brilliant appearance and specious tongue into a belief in the transient nature  of his difficulties. He spent his days in hanging about the halls and  waiting-rooms of clubs &mdash; of some of which he had once been a member; he walked  weary miles between St James&rsquo;s and Mayfair, Kensington Gore and Notting Hill,  leaving little notes for men who were not at home, or writing a little note in  one room while the man to whom he was writing hushed his breath in an adjoining  chamber. People who had once been Captain Paget&rsquo;s fast friends seemed to have  simultaneously decided upon spending their existence out of doors, as it  appeared to the impecunious Captain. The servants of his friends were afflicted  with a strange uncertainty as to their masters&rsquo; movements. At whatever  hall-door Horatio Paget presented himself, it seemed equally doubtful whether the  proprietor of the mansion would be home to dinner that day, or whether he would  be at home any time next day, or the day after that, or at the end of the week,  or indeed whether he would ever come home again. Sometimes the Captain, calling  in the evening dusk, in the faint hope of gaining admittance to some friendly  dwelling, saw the glimmer of light under a dining-room door, and heard the  clooping of corks and the pleasant jingling of glass and silver in the  innermost recesses of a butler&rsquo;s pantry; but still the answer was &mdash; not at  home, and not likely to be home. All the respectable world was to be out  henceforth for Horatio Paget. But now and then at the clubs he met some young  man, who had no wife at home to keep watch upon his purse and to wail piteously  over a five-pound note ill-bestowed, and who took compassion on the fallen  spendthrift, and believed, or pretended to believe, his story of temporary  embarrassment; and then the Captain dined sumptuously at a little French  restaurant in Castle-street, Leicester-square, and took a half-bottle of  chablis with his oysters, and warmed himself with chambertin that was brought  to him in a dusty cobweb-shrouded bottle reposing in a wicker-basket.</p>
<p>But in these latter days such glimpses of sunshine  very rarely illumined the dull stream of the Captain&rsquo;s life. Failure and  disappointment had become the rule of his existence &mdash; success the rare  exception. Crossing the river now on his way westward, he was wont to loiter a  little on Waterloo Bridge, and to look dreamily down at the water, wondering  whether the time was near at hand when, under cover of the evening dusk, he  would pay his last halfpenny to the toll-keeper, and never again know the need  of an earthly coin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a fellow in the Morgue one day, &mdash; a poor wretch  who had drowned himself a week or two before. Great God, how horrible he  looked! If there was any certainty they would find one immediately, and bury  one decently, there&rsquo;d be no particular horror in that kind of death. But to be  found <em>like that</em>, and to lie in some  riverside deadhouse down by Wapping, with a ghastly placard rotting on the  rotting door, and nothing but ooze and slime and rottenness round about one &mdash;  waiting to be identified! And who knows, after all, whether a dead man doesn&rsquo;t <em>feel</em> that sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was after such musings as these had begun to be  very common with Horatio Paget that he caught the chill which resulted in a  very dangerous illness of many weeks. The late autumn was wet and cold and  dreary; but Captain Paget, although remarkably clever after a certain fashion,  had never been a lover of intellectual pursuits, and imprisonment in Mrs.  Kepp&rsquo;s shabby parlour was odious to him. When he had read every page of the  borrowed newspaper, and pished and pshawed over the leaders, and groaned aloud  at the announcement of some wealthy marriage made by one of his quondam  friends, or chuckled at the record of another quondam friend&rsquo;s insolvency &mdash;  when he had poked the fire savagely half a dozen times in an hour, cursing the  pinched grate and the bad coals during every repetition of the operation &mdash; when  he had smoked his last cigar, and varnished his favourite boots, and looked out  of the window, and contemplated himself gloomily in the wretched little glass  over the narrow chimney-piece, &mdash; Captain Paget&rsquo;s intellectual resources were  exhausted, and an angry impatience took possession of him. Then, in defiance of  the pelting rain or the lowering sky, he flung his slippers into the farthest  corner &mdash; and the farthest corner of Mrs. Kepp&rsquo;s parlour was not very remote  from the Captain&rsquo;s arm-chair &mdash; he drew on the stoutest of his varnished boots &mdash;  and there were none of them very stout now &mdash; buttoned his perfect overcoat,  adjusted his hat before the looking-glass, and sallied forth, umbrella in hand,  to make his way westward. Westward always, through storm and shower, back to  the haunts of his youth, went the wanderer and outcast, to see the red glow of  cheery fires reflected on the plate-glass windows of his favourite clubs; to  see the lamps in spacious reading-rooms lit early in the autumn dusk, and to  watch the soft light glimmering on the rich bindings of the books, and losing  itself in the sombre depths of crimson draperies. To this poor worldly creature  the agony of banishment from those palaces of Pall Mall or St. James&rsquo;s-street  was as bitter as the pain of a fallen angel. It was the dullest, deadest time  of the year, and there were not many loungers in those sumptuous reading-rooms,  where the shaded lamps shed their subdued light on the chaste splendour of the  sanctuary; so Captain Paget could haunt the scene of his departed youth without  much fear of recognition: but his wanderings in the West grew more hopeless and  purposeless every day. He began to understand how it was that people were never  at home when he assailed their doors with his fashionable knock. He could no  longer endure the humiliation of such repulses, for he began to understand that  the servants knew his errand as well as their masters, and had their answers  ready, let him present himself before them when he would: so he besieged the  doors of St. James&rsquo;s and Mayfair, Kensington Gore and Netting Hill, no longer.  He knew that the bubble of his poor foolish life had burst, and that there was  nothing left for him but to die.</p>
<p>It seemed about this time as if the end of all was  very near. Captain Paget caught a chill one miserable evening on which he  returned to his lodging with his garments dripping, and his beautiful varnished  boots reduced to a kind of pulp; and the chill resulted in a violent  inflammation of the lungs. Then it was that a woman&rsquo;s hand was held out to save  him, and a woman&rsquo;s divine tenderness cared for him in his dire extremity.</p>
<p>The ministering angel who comforted this helpless  and broken-down wayfarer was only a low-born ignorant girl called Mary Anne  Kepp &mdash; a girl who had waited upon the Captain during his residence in her  mother&rsquo;s house, but of whom he had taken about as much notice as he had been  wont to take of the coloured servants who tended him when he was with his  regiment in India. Horatio Paget had been a night-brawler and a gamester, a  duellist and a reprobate, in the glorious days that were gone; but he had never  been a profligate; and he did not know that the girl who brought him his  breakfast and staggered under the weight of his coal-scuttle was one of the  most beautiful women he had ever looked upon.</p>
<p>The Captain was so essentially a creature of the  West-end, that Beauty without her glitter of diamonds and splendour of apparel  was scarcely Beauty for him. He waited for the groom of the chambers to  announce her name, and the low hum of well-bred approval to accompany her  entrance, before he bowed the knee and acknowledged her perfection. The  Beauties whom he remembered had received their patent from the Prince Regent,  and had graduated in the houses of Devonshire and Hertford. How should the  faded bachelor know that this girl, in a shabby cotton gown, with unkempt hair  dragged off her pale face, and with grimy smears from the handles of saucepans  and fire-irons imprinted upon her cheeks &mdash; how should he know that she was  beautiful? It was only during the slow monotonous hours of his convalescence,  when he lay upon the poor faded little sofa in Mrs. Kepp&rsquo;s parlour &mdash; the sofa  that was scarcely less faded and feeble than himself &mdash; it was then, and then  only, that he discovered the loveliness of the face which had been so often  bent over him during his delirious wanderings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have mistaken you for all manner of people, my  dear,&rdquo; he said to his landlady&rsquo;s daughter, who sat by the little Pembroke-table  working, while her mother dozed in a corner with a worsted stocking drawn over  her arm and a pair of spectacles resting upon her elderly nose. Mrs. Kepp and  her daughter were wont to spend their evenings in the lodger&rsquo;s apartment now;  for the invalid complained bitterly of &ldquo;the horrors&rdquo; when they left him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have taken you for all sorts of people, Mary  Anne,&rdquo; pursued the Captain dreamily. &ldquo;Sometimes I have fancied you were the  Countess of Jersey, and I could see her smile as she looked at me when I was  first presented to her. I was very young in the beautiful Jersey&rsquo;s time; and  then there was the other one &mdash; whom I used to drink tea with at Brighton. Ah  me! what a dull world it seems nowadays! The King gone, and everything changed  &mdash; everything &mdash; everything! I am a very old man, Mary Anne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was fifty-two years of age; he felt quite an old  man. He had spent all his money, he had outlived the best friends of his youth;  for it had been his fate to adorn a declining era, and he had been a youngster  among elderly patrons and associates. His patrons were dead and gone, and the  men he had patronised shut their doors upon him in the day of his poverty. As  for his relations, he had turned his back upon them long ago, when first he  followed in the shining wake of that gorgeous vessel, the Royal George. In this  hour of his penniless decline there was none to help him. To have outlived  every affection and every pleasure is the chief bitterness of old age; and this  bitterness Horatio Paget suffered in all its fulness, though his years were but  fifty-two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a very old man, Mary Anne,&rdquo; he repeated  plaintively. But Mary Anne Kepp could not think him old. To her eyes he must  for ever appear the incarnation of all that is elegant and distinguished. He  was the first gentleman she had ever seen. Mrs. Kepp had given shelter to other  lodgers who had called themselves gentlemen, and who had been pompous and  grandiose of manner in their intercourse with the widow and her daughter; but  O, what pitiful lacquered counterfeits, what Brummagem paste they had been,  compared to the real gem! Mary Anne Kepp had seen varnished boots before the  humble flooring of her mother&rsquo;s dwelling was honoured by the tread of Horatio  Paget, but what clumsy vulgar boots, and what awkward plebeian feet had worn  them! The lodger&rsquo;s slim white hands and arched instep, the patrician curve of  his aquiline nose, the perfect grace of his apparel, the high-bred modulation  of his courteous accents, &mdash; all these had impressed Mary Anne&rsquo;s tender little  heart so much the more because of his poverty and loneliness. That such a man  should be forgotten and deserted &mdash; that such a man should be poor and lonely,  seemed so cruel a chance to the simple maiden: and then when illness overtook him,  and invested him with a supreme claim upon her tenderness and pity, &mdash; then the  innocent girl lavished all the treasures of a compassionate heart upon the  ruined gentleman. She had no thought of fee or reward; she knew that her  mother&rsquo;s lodger was miserably poor, and that his payments had become more and  more irregular week by week and month by month. She had no consciousness of the  depth of feeling that rendered her so gentle a nurse; for her life was a busy  one, and she had neither time nor inclination for any morbid brooding upon her  own feelings.</p>
<p>She protested warmly against the Captain&rsquo;s  lamentation respecting his age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idear of any gentleman calling hisself old at  fifty!&rdquo; she said &mdash; and Horatio shuddered at the supererogatory &ldquo;r&rdquo; and the  &ldquo;hisself,&rdquo; though they proceeded from the lips of his consoler;&mdash; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got  many, many years before you yet, sir, please God,&rdquo; she added piously; &ldquo;and  there&rsquo;s good friends will come forward yet to help you, I make no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Paget shook his head peevishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk as if you were telling my fortune with a  pack of cards,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No, my girl, I shall have only one friend to rely  upon, if ever I am well enough to go outside this house; and that friend is  myself. I have spent the fortune my father left me; I have spent the price of  my commission; and I have parted with every object of any value that I ever  possessed &mdash; in vulgar parlance, I am cleaned out, Mary Anne. But other men have  spent every sixpence belonging to them, and have contrived to live pleasantly  enough for half a century afterwards; and I daresay I can do as they have done.  If the wind is tempered to the shorn lamb, I suppose the hawks and vultures  take care of themselves. I have tried my luck as a shorn lamb, and the tempest  has been very bitter for me; so I have no alternative but to join the  vultures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Anne Kepp stared wonderingly at her mother&rsquo;s  lodger. She had some notion that he had been saying something wicked and  blasphemous; but she was too ignorant and too innocent to follow his meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, pray don&rsquo;t talk in that wild way, sir,&rdquo; she  entreated. &ldquo;It makes me so unhappy to hear you go on like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why should anything that I say make you  unhappy, Mary Anne?&rdquo; asked the lodger earnestly.</p>
<p>There was something in his tone that set her pale  face on fire with unwonted crimson, and she bent very low over her work to hide  those painful blushes. She did not know that the Captain&rsquo;s tone presaged a  serious address; she did not know that the grand crisis of her life was close  upon her.</p>
<p>Horatio Paget had determined upon making a  sacrifice. The doctor had told him that he owed his life to this devoted girl;  and he would have been something less than man if he had not been moved with  some grateful emotion. He was grateful; and in the dreary hours of his slow  recovery he had ample leisure for the contemplation of the woman to whom he  owed so much, if his poor worthless life could indeed be much. He saw that she  was devoted to him; that she loved him more truly than he had ever been  conscious of being loved before. He saw too that she was beautiful. To an ugly  woman Captain Paget might have felt extremely grateful; but he could never have  thought of an ugly woman as he thought of Mary Anne Kepp. The end of his  contemplation and his deliberation came to this: She was beautiful, and she  loved him, and his life was utterly wretched and lonely; so he determined on  proving his gratitude by a sublime sacrifice. Before the girl had lifted her  face from the needlework over which she had bent to hide her blushes, Horatio  Paget had asked her to be his wife. Her emotion almost overpowered her as she  tried to answer him; but she struggled against it bravely, and came to the sofa  on which he lay and dropped upon her knees by his side. The beggar-maid who was  wooed by a king could have felt no deeper sense of her lover&rsquo;s condescension  than that which filled the heart of this poor simple girl as she knelt by her  mother&rsquo;s gentleman lodger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &mdash; to be your wife!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;O, surely,  sir, you cannot mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do mean it, with all my heart and soul, my  dear,&rdquo; answered the Captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not offering you any grand chance, Mary Anne;  for I&rsquo;m about as low down in the world as a man can be. But I don&rsquo;t mean to be  poor all my life. Come, my dear, don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; he exclaimed, just a little  impatiently &mdash; for the girl had covered her face with her hands, and tears were  dropping between the poor hard-working fingers&mdash; &ldquo;but lift up your head and tell  me whether you will take a faded old bachelor for your husband or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horatio Paget had admired many women in the bright  years of his youth, and had fancied himself desperately in love more than once  in his life; but it is doubtful whether the mighty passion had ever really  possessed the Captain&rsquo;s heart, which was naturally cold and sluggish, rarely  fluttered by any emotion that was not engendered of selfishness. Horatio had  set up an idol and had invented a religion for himself very early in life; and  that idol was fashioned after his own image, and that religion had its beginning  and end in his own pleasure. He might have been flattered and pleased by Miss  Kepp&rsquo;s agitation; but he was ill and peevish; and having all his life been  subject to a profound antipathy to feminine tearfulness, the girl&rsquo;s display of  emotion annoyed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it to be yes, or no, my dear?&rdquo; he asked, with,  some vexation in his tone.</p>
<p>Mary Anne looked up at him with tearful, frightened  eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, yes, sir, if I can be of any use to you, and  nurse you when you are ill, and work for you till I work my fingers to the  bone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clenched her hands spasmodically as she spoke.  In imagination she was already toiling and striving for the god of her idolatry  &mdash; the GENTLEMAN whose varnished boots had been to her as a glimpse of another  and a fairer world than that represented by Tulliver&rsquo;s-terrace, Old Kent-road.  But Captain Paget checked her enthusiasm by a gentle gesture of his attenuated  hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, my dear,&rdquo; he murmured languidly;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very strong yet, and anything in the way of fuss is inexpressibly  painful to me. Ah, my poor child,&rdquo; he exclaimed, pityingly, &ldquo;if you could have  seen a dinner at the Marquis of Hertford&rsquo;s, you would have understood how much  can be achieved without fuss. But I am talking of things you don&rsquo;t understand.  You will be my wife; and a very good, kind, obedient little wife, I have no  doubt. That is all settled. As for working for me, my love, it would be about  as much as these poor little hands could do to earn me a cigar a day &mdash; and I  seldom smoke less than half a dozen cigars; so, you see, that is all so much  affectionate nonsense. And now you may wake your mother, my dear; for I want to  take a little nap, and I can&rsquo;t close my eyes while that good soul is snoring so  intolerably; but not a word about our little arrangement, Mary Anne, till you  and your mother are alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And hereupon the Captain spread a handkerchief over  his face and subsided into a gentle slumber. The little scene had fatigued him;  though it had been so quietly enacted, that Mrs. Kepp had slept on undisturbed  by the brief fragment of domestic drama performed within a few yards of her  uneasy arm-chair. Her daughter awoke her presently, and she resumed her  needlework, while Mary Anne made some tea for the beloved sleeper. The cups and  saucers made more noise to-night than they were wont to make in the girl&rsquo;s  careful hands. The fluttering of her heart seemed to communicate itself to the  tips of her fingers, and the jingling of the crockery-ware betrayed the  intensity of her emotion. He was to be her husband! She was to have a gentleman  for a husband; and such a gentleman! Out of such base trifles as a West-end  tailor&rsquo;s coat and a West-end workman&rsquo;s boots may be engendered the purest  blossom of womanly love and devotion. Wisely may the modern philosopher cry  that the history of the world is only a story of old clothes. Mary Anne had  begun by admiring the graces of Stultz and Hoby, and now she was ready to lay  down her life for the man who wore the perishing garments.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Miss Kepp obeyed her lover&rsquo;s behest; and it was  only on the following day, when she and her mother were alone together in the  dingy little kitchen below Captain Paget&rsquo;s apartments, that she informed that  worthy woman of the honour which had been vouchsafed to her. And thereupon Mary  Anne endured the first of the long series of disappointments which were to  arise out of her affection for the penniless Captain. The widow was a woman of  the world, and was obstinately blind to the advantages of a union with a ruined  gentleman of fifty. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s he to keep you, I should like to know,&rdquo; Mrs. Kepp  exclaimed, as the girl stood blushing before her after having told her story;  &ldquo;if he can&rsquo;t pay me regular? &mdash; and you know the difficulty I have had to get  his money, Mary Anne. If he can&rsquo;t keep hisself, how&rsquo;s he to keep you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that, mother,&rdquo; cried the girl,  wincing under her parent&rsquo;s practical arguments; &ldquo;you go on as if all I cared  for was being fed and clothed. Besides, Captain Paget is not going to be poor  always. He told me so last night, when he &mdash; &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>He</em> told  you so!&rdquo; echoed the honest widow with unmitigated scorn; &ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t he told me  times and often that I should have my rent regular after this week, and regular  after that week, and have I <em>ever</em> had  it regular? And ain&rsquo;t I keeping him out of charity now? &mdash; a poor widow-woman  like me &mdash; which I may be wanting charity myself before long: and if it wasn&rsquo;t  for your whimpering and going on he&rsquo;d have been out of the house three weeks  ago, when the doctor said he was well enough to be moved; for I ast him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;d have turned him out to die in the  streets, mother!&rdquo; cried
  Mary; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you was so &rsquo;artless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this time there was ill-feeling between Mrs.  Kepp and her daughter, who had been hitherto one of the most patient and  obedient of children. The fanatic can never forgive the wretch who disbelieves  in the divinity of his god; and women who love as blindly and foolishly as Mary  Anne Kepp are the most bigoted of worshippers. The girl could not forgive her  mother&rsquo;s disparagement of her idol, &mdash; the mother had no mercy upon her  daughter&rsquo;s folly; and after much wearisome contention and domestic misery &mdash;  carefully hidden from the penniless sybarite in the parlour &mdash; after many tears  and heart-burnings, and wakeful nights and prayerful watches, Mary Anne Kepp  consented to leave the house quietly one morning with the gentleman lodger  while the widow had gone to market. Miss Kepp left a piteous little note for  her mother, rather ungrammatical, but very womanly and tender, imploring pardon  for her want of duty; and, &ldquo;O, mother, if you knew how good and nobel he is,  you coudent be angery with me for luving him has I do, and we shall come back  to you after oure marige, wich you will be pade up honourabel to the last  farthin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After writing this epistle in the kitchen, with  more deliberation and more smudging than Captain Paget would have cared to  behold in the bride of his choice, Mary Anne attired herself in her Sabbath-day  raiment, and left Tulliver&rsquo;s-terrace with the Captain in a cab. She would fain  have taken a little lavender paper-covered box that contained the remainder of  her wardrobe, but after surveying it with a shudder, Captain Paget told her  that such a box would condemn them <em>anywhere</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may get on sometimes without luggage, my  dear,&rdquo; he said sententiously; &ldquo;but with such luggage as <em>that</em>, never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl obeyed without comprehending. It was not  often that she understood her lover&rsquo;s meaning, nor did he particularly care  that she should understand him. He talked to her rather in the same spirit in  which one talks to a faithful canine companion &mdash; as Napoleon III. may talk to  his favourite Nero; &ldquo;I have great plans yet unfulfilled, my honest Nero, though  you may not be wise enough to guess their nature. And we must have another  Boulevard, old fellow; and we must settle that little dispute about Venetia;  and we must do something for those unfortunate Poles, eh &mdash; good dog?&rdquo; and so  on.</p>
<p>Captain Paget drove straight to a registrar&rsquo;s  office, where the new Marriage Act enabled him to unite himself to Miss Kepp <em>sans fa&ccedil;on</em>, in presence of the cabman  and a woman who had been cleaning the door-step. The Captain went through the  brief ceremonial as coolly as if it had been the settlement of a water-rate,  and was angered by the tears that poor Mary Anne shed under her cheap black  veil. He had forgotten the poetic superstition in favour of a wedding-ring, but  he slipped a little onyx ring off his own finger, and put it on the clumsier  finger of his bride. It was the last of his jewels &mdash; the rejected of the pawnbrokers,  who, not being learned in antique intaglios, had condemned the ring as  trumpery. There is always something a little ominous in the bridegroom&rsquo;s  forgetfulness of that simple golden circle which typifies an eternal union; and  a superstitious person might have drawn a sinister augury from the subject of  Captain Paget&rsquo;s intaglio, which was a head of Nero &mdash; an emperor whose wife was  by no means the happiest of women. But as neither Mary Anne nor the registrar,  neither the cabman nor the charwoman who had been cleaning the door-step, had  ever heard of Nero, and as Horatio Paget was much too indifferent to be  superstitious, there was no one to draw evil inferences: and Mary Anne went  away with her gentleman husband, proud and happy, with a happiness that was only  disturbed now and then by the image of an infuriated mother.</p>
<p>Captain Paget took his bride to some charming  apartments in Halfmoon-street, Mayfair; and she was surprised to hear him tell  the landlady that he and his wife had just arrived from Devonshire, and that  they meant to stay a week or so in London, <em>en  passant</em>, before starting for the Continent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife has spent the best part of her life in the  country,&rdquo; said the Captain, &ldquo;so I suppose I must show her some of the sights of  London in spite of the abominable weather. But the deuce of it is, that my  servant has misunderstood my directions, and gone on to Paris with the luggage.  However, we can set that all straight to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing could be more courteously acquiescent than  the manner of the landlady; for Captain Paget had offered her references, and  the people to whom he referred were among the magnates of the land. The Captain  knew enough of human nature to know that if references are only sufficiently  imposing, they are very unlikely to be verified. The swindler who refers his  dupe to the Duke of Sutherland and Baring Brothers has a very good chance of  getting his respectability accepted without inquiry, on the mere strength of  those sacred names.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>From this time until the day of her death Mary Anne  Paget very seldom heard her husband make any statement which she did not know  to be false. He had joined the ranks of the vultures. He had lain down upon his  bed of sickness a gentlemanly beggar; he arose from that couch of pain and  weariness a swindler.</p>
<p>Now began those petty shifts and miserable  falsifications whereby the birds of prey thrive on the flesh and blood of  hapless pigeons. Now the dovecotes were fluttered by a new destroyer &mdash; a  gentlemanly vulture, whose suave accents and perfect manners were fatal to the  unwary. Henceforth Horatio Cromie Nugent Paget flourished and fattened upon the  folly of his fellow-men. As promoter of joint-stock companies that never saw  the light; as treasurer of loan-offices where money was never lent; as a gentleman  with capital about to introduce a novel article of manufacture from the sale of  which a profit of five thousand a year would infallibly be realized, and  desirous to meet with another gentleman of equal capital; as the mysterious  X.Y.Z. who will &mdash; for so small a recompense as thirty postage-stamps &mdash; impart  the secret of an elegant and pleasing employment, whereby seven-pound-ten  a-week may be made by any individual, male or female; &mdash; under every flimsy  disguise with which the swindler hides his execrable form, Captain Paget plied  his cruel trade, and still contrived to find fresh dupes. Of course there were  occasions when the pigeons were slow to flutter into the fascinating snare, and  when the vulture had a bad time of it; and it was a common thing for the  Captain to sink from the splendour of Mayfair or St. James&rsquo;s-street into some  dingy transpontine hiding-place. But he never went back to Tulliver&rsquo;s-terrace,  though Mary Anne pleaded piteously for the payment of her poor mother&rsquo;s debt.  When her husband was in funds, he patted her head affectionately, and told her  that he would see about it &mdash; i.e. the payment of Mrs. Kepp&rsquo;s bill; while, if  she ventured to mention the subject to him when his purse was scantily  furnished, he would ask her fiercely how he was to satisfy her mother&rsquo;s  extortionate claims when he had not so much as a sixpence for his own use.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kepp&rsquo;s bill was never paid, and Mary Anne  never saw her mother&rsquo;s face again. Mrs. Paget was one of those meek loving  creatures who are essentially cowardly. She could not bring herself to  encounter her mother without the money owed by the Captain; she could not bring  herself to endure the widow&rsquo;s reproaches, the questioning that would be so  horribly painful to answer, the taunts that would torture her poor sorrowful  heart.</p>
<p>Alas for her brief dream of love and happiness!  Alas for her foolish worship of the gentleman lodger! She knew now that her  mother had been wiser than herself, and that it would have been better for her  if she had renounced the shadowy glory of an alliance with Horatio Cromie  Nugent Paget, whose string of high-sounding names, written on the cover of an  old wine-book, had not been without its influence on the ignorant girl. The  widow&rsquo;s daughter knew very little happiness during the few years of her wedded  life. To be hurried from place to place; to dine in Mayfair to-day, and to eat  your dinner at a shilling ordinary in Whitecross-street to-morrow; to wear fine  clothes that have not been paid for, and to take them off your back at a moment&rsquo;s  notice when they are required for the security of the friendly pawnbroker; to  know that your life is a falsehood and a snare, and that to leave a place is to  leave contempt and execration behind you, &mdash; these things constitute the burden  of a woman whose husband lives by his wits. And over and above these miseries,  Mrs. Paget had to endure all the variations of temper to which the schemer is  subject. If the pigeons dropped readily into the snare, and if their plumage  proved well worth the picking, the Captain was very kind to his wife, after his  own fashion; that is to say, he took her out with him, and after lecturing her  angrily because of the shabbiness of her bonnet, bought her a new one, and gave  her a dinner that made her ill, and then sent her home in a cab, while he  finished the evening in more congenial society. But if the times were bad for  the vulture tribe &mdash; O, then, what a gloomy companion for the domestic hearth  was the elegant Horatio! After smiling his false smile all day, while rage and  disappointment were gnawing at his heart, it was a kind of relief to the  Captain to be moody and savage by his own fireside. The human vulture has  something of the ferocity of his feathered prototype. The man who lives upon  his fellow-men has need to harden his heart; for one sentiment of compassion,  one touch of human pity, would shatter his finest scheme in the hour of its  fruition. Horatio Paget and compassion parted fellowship very early in the  course of his unscrupulous career. What if the pigeon has a widowed mother  dependent on his prosperity, or half a dozen children who will be involved in  his ruin? Is the hawk to forego his natural prey for any such paltry  consideration as a vulgar old woman or a brood of squalling brats?</p>
<p>Captain Paget was not guilty of any persistent  unkindness towards the woman whose fate he had deigned to link with his own.  The consciousness that he had conferred a supreme honour on Mary Anne Kepp by  offering her his hand, and a share of his difficulties, never deserted him. He  made no attempt to elevate the ignorant girl into companionship with himself.  He shuddered when she misplaced her h&rsquo;s and turned from her peevishly, with a  muttered oath, when she was more than usually ungrammatical: but though he  found it disagreeable to hear her, he would have found it troublesome to set  her right; and trouble was a thing which Horatio Paget held in gentlemanly  aversion. The idea that the mode of his existence could be repulsive to his  wife &mdash; that this low-born and low-bred girl could have scruples that he never  felt, and might suffer agonies of remorse and shame of which his coarser nature  was incapable &mdash; never entered the Captain&rsquo;s mind. It would have been too great  an absurdity for the daughter of plebeian Kepps to affect a tenderness of  conscience unknown to the scion of Pagets and Cromies and Nugents. Mary Anne  was afraid of her elegant husband; and she worshipped and waited upon him in  meek silence, keeping the secret of her own sorrows, and keeping it so well  that he never guessed the manifold sources of that pallor of countenance and  hollow brightness of eye which had of late annoyed him when he looked at his  wife. She had borne him a child &mdash; a sweet girl baby, with those great black  eyes that always have rather a weird look in the face of infancy; and she would  fain have clung to the infant as the hope and consolation of her joyless life.  But the vulture is not a domestic bird, and a baby would have been an  impediment in the rapid hegiras which Captain Paget and his wife were wont to  make. The Captain put an advertisement in a daily paper before the child was a  week old; and in less than a fortnight after Mary Anne had looked at the baby  face for the first time, she was called upon to surrender her treasure to an  elderly woman of fat and greasy aspect, who had agreed to bring the infant up  &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; in a miserable little street in a remote and dreary district lying  between Vauxhall and Battersea.</p>
<p>Mary Anne gave up the child uncomplainingly, as  meekly as she would have surrendered herself if the Captain had brought a  masked executioner to her bedside, and had told her a block was prepared for  her in the adjoining chamber. She had no idea of resistance to the will of her  husband. She endured her existence for nearly five years after the birth of her  child, and during those miserable years the one effort of her life was to  secure the miserable stipend paid for the little girl&rsquo;s maintenance; but before  the child&rsquo;s fifth birthday the mother faded off the face of the earth. She died  in a miserable lodging not very far from Tulliver&rsquo;s-terrace, expiring in the  arms of a landlady who had comforted her in her hour of need, as she had  comforted the ruined gentleman. Captain Paget was a prisoner in  Whitecross-street at the time of his wife&rsquo;s death, and was much surprised when  he missed her morning visits, and the little luxuries she had been wont to  bring him.</p>
<p>He had missed her for more than a week, and had  written to her twice &mdash; rather angrily on the second occasion &mdash; when a rough  unkempt boy in corduroy waited upon him in the dreary ward, where he and half a  dozen other depressed and melancholy men sat at little tables writing letters,  or pretending to read newspapers, and looking at one another furtively every  now and then. There is no prisoner so distracted by his own cares that he will  not find time to wonder what his neighbour is &ldquo;in for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy had received instructions to be careful how  he imparted his dismal tidings to the &ldquo;poor dear gentleman;&rdquo; but the lad grew  nervous and bewildered at sight of the Captain&rsquo;s fierce hook-nose and  scrutinising gray eyes, and blurted out his news without any dismal note of  warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady died at two o&rsquo;clock this morning, please,  sir; and mother said I was to come and tell you, please, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Paget staggered under the blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he cried, as he dropped upon a rickety  Windsor chair, that creaked under his weight; &ldquo;and I did not even know that she  was ill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still less did he know that all her married life  had been one long heart-sickness &mdash; one monotonous agony of remorse and shame.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  &ldquo;Heart Bare, Heart Hungry, Very Poor&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Diana Paget left the Kursaal, and walked slowly  along the pretty rustic street; now dawdling before a little print-shop, whose  contents she knew by heart, now looking back at the great windows of that  temple of pleasure which she had just quitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they care what becomes of me?&rdquo; she  thought, as she looked up at the blank vacant windows for the last time before  she left the main street of For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne, and turned into a straggling  side-street, whose rugged pavement sloped upward towards the pine-clad hills.  The house in which Captain Paget had taken up his abode was a tall white  habitation, situated in the narrowest of the narrow by-ways that intersect the  main street of the pretty Belgian watering-place; a lane in which the  inhabitants of opposite houses may shake hands with one another out of the  window, and where the odour of the cabbages and onions so liberally employed in  the <em>cuisine</em> of the native offends the  nose of the foreigner from sunrise to sunset.</p>
<p>Diana paused for a moment at the entrance to this  lane, but, after a brief deliberation, walked onwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use of my going home?&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;<em>they</em> won&rsquo;t be home for hours to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked slowly along the hilly street, and from  the street into a narrow pathway winding upward through the pine-wood. Here she  was quite alone, and the stillness of the place soothed her. She took off her  hat, and slung the faded ribbons across her arm; and the warm breeze lifted the  loose hair from her forehead as she wandered upwards. It was a very beautiful  face from which that loose dark hair was lifted by the summer wind. Diana Paget  inherited something of the soft loveliness of Mary Anne Kepp, and a little of  the patrician beauty of the Pagets. The eyes were like those which had watched  Horatio Paget on his bed of sickness in Tulliver&rsquo;s-terrace. The resolute curve  of the thin flexible lips, and the fine modelling of the chin, were hereditary  attributes of the Nugent Pagets; and a resemblance to the lower part of Miss  Paget&rsquo;s face might have been traced in many a sombre portrait of dame and  cavalier at Thorpehaven Manor, where a Nugent Paget, who acknowledged no  kindred with the disreputable Captain, was now master.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s reflections as she slowly climbed the  hill were not pleasant. The thoughts of youth should be very beautiful; but  youth that has been spent in the companionship of reprobates and tricksters is  something worse than age; for experience has taught it to be bitter, while time  has not taught it to be patient. For Diana Paget, childhood had been joyless,  and girlhood lonely. That blank and desolate region, that dreary flat of fenny  waste ground between Vauxhall and Battersea, on which the child&rsquo;s eyes had  first looked, had been typical of her loveless childhood. With her mother&rsquo;s  death faded the one ray of light that had illumined her desolation. She was  shifted from one nurse to another; and bar nurses were not allowed to love her,  for she remained with them as an encumbrance and a burden. It was so difficult  for the Captain to pay the pitiful sum demanded for his daughter&rsquo;s support &mdash; or  rather it was so much easier for him not to pay it. So there always came a time  when Diana was delivered at her father&rsquo;s lodgings like a parcel, by an  indignant nurse, who proclaimed the story of her wrongs in shrill feminine  treble, and who was politely informed by the Captain that her claim was a  common debt, and that she had the remedy in her own hands, but that the same  code of laws which provided her with that remedy, forbade any obnoxious  demonstration of her anger in a gentleman&rsquo;s apartment. And then Miss Paget,  after hearing all the tumult and discussion, would be left alone with her  father, and would speedily perceive that her presence was disagreeable to him.</p>
<p>When she outgrew the age of humble foster-mothers  and cottages in the dreariest of the outlying suburbs, the Captain sent his  daughter to school: and on this occasion he determined on patronising a person  whom he had once been too proud to remember among the list of his kindred.  There are poor and straggling branches upon every family tree; and the Pagets  of Thorpehaven had needy cousins who, in the mighty battle of life, were  compelled to fight amongst the rank and file. One of these poor cousins was a  Miss Priscilla Paget, who at an early age had exhibited that affection for  intellectual pursuits and that carelessness as to the duties of the toilet  which are supposed to distinguish the predestined blue-stocking. Left quite  alone in the world, Priscilla put her educational capital to good use; and  after holding the position of principal governess for nearly twenty years in a  prosperous boarding-school at Brompton, she followed her late employer to her  grave with unaffected sorrow, and within a month of the funeral invested her  savings in the purchase of the business, and established herself as mistress of  the mansion. To this lady Captain Paget confided his daughter&rsquo;s education; and  in Priscilla Paget&rsquo;s house Diana found a shelter that was almost like a home,  until her kinswoman became weary of promises that were never kept, and pitiful  sums paid on account of a debt that grew bigger every day &mdash; very weary likewise  of conciliatory hampers of game and barrels of oysters, and all the flimsy  devices of a debtor who is practised in the varied arts of the gentlemanly  swindler.</p>
<p>The day came when Miss Paget resolved to be rid of  her profitless charge; and once more Diana found herself delivered like a  parcel of unordered goods at the door of her father&rsquo;s lodging. Those are  precocious children who learn their first lessons in the school of poverty; and  the girl had been vaguely conscious of the degradation involved in this process  at the age of five. How much more keenly did she feel the shame at the age of  fifteen! Priscilla did her best to lessen the pain of her pupil&rsquo;s departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that I&rsquo;ve any fault to find with you,  Diana, though you must remember that I have heard some complaints of your  temper,&rdquo; she said, with gentle gravity; &ldquo;but your father is too trying. If he  didn&rsquo;t make me any promises, I should think better of him. If he told me  frankly that he couldn&rsquo;t pay me, and asked me to keep you out of charity,&rdquo; &mdash;  Diana drew herself up with a little shiver at this word,&mdash; &ldquo;why, I might turn it  over in my mind, and see if it could be done. But to be deceived time after  time, as I&rsquo;ve been deceived &mdash; you know the solemn language your father has  used, Diana, for you have heard him &mdash; and to rely on a sum of money on a certain  date, as I have relied again and again, after Horatio&rsquo;s assurance that I might  depend upon him &mdash; it&rsquo;s too bad, Diana; it&rsquo;s more than any one can endure. If  you were two or three years older, and further advanced in your education, I  might manage to do something for you by making you useful with the little ones;  but I can&rsquo;t afford to keep you and clothe you during the next three years for  nothing, and so I have no alternative but to send you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;home&rdquo; to which Diana Paget was taken upon this  occasion was a lodging over a toyshop in the Westminster-road, where the  Captain lived in considerable comfort on the proceeds of a Friendly and  Philanthropic Loan Society.</p>
<p>But no very cordial welcome awaited Diana in the  gaudily-furnished drawing-room over the toyshop. She found her father sleeping  placidly in his easy-chair, while a young man, who was a stranger to her, sat  at a table near the window writing letters. It was a dull November day &mdash; a very  dreary day on which to find one&rsquo;s self thrown suddenly on a still drearier  world; and in the Westminster-bridge-road the lamps were already making yellow  patches of sickly light amidst the afternoon fog.</p>
<p>The Captain twitched his silk handkerchief off his  face with an impatient gesture as Diana entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, what is it?&rdquo; he asked peevishly,  without looking at the intruder.</p>
<p>He recognised her in the next moment; but that  first impatient salutation was about as warm a welcome as any which Miss Paget  received from her father. In sad and bitter truth, he did not care for her. His  marriage with Mary Anne Kepp had been the one grateful impulse of his life; and  even the sentiment which had prompted that marriage had been by no means free  from the taint of selfishness. But he had been quite unprepared to find that  this grand sacrifice of his life should involve another sacrifice in the  maintenance of a daughter he did not want; and he was very much inclined to  quarrel with the destiny that had given him this burden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had been a boy, I might have made you  useful to me sooner or later,&rdquo; the Captain said to his daughter when he found  himself alone with her late on the night of her return; &ldquo;but what on earth am I  to do with a daughter, in the unsettled life I lead? However, since that old  harridan has sent you back, you must manage in the best way you can,&rdquo; concluded  Captain Paget with a discontented sigh.</p>
<p>From this time Diana Paget had inhabited the nest  of the vultures, and every day had brought its new lesson of trickery and  falsehood. There are men &mdash; and bad men too &mdash; who would have tried to keep the  secret of their shifts and meannesses hidden from an only child; but Horatio  Paget believed himself the victim of man&rsquo;s ingratitude, and his misdoings the  necessity of an evil destiny. It is not easy for the unsophisticated intellect  to gauge those moral depths to which the man who lives by his wits must sink  before his career is finished, or to understand how, with every step in the  swindler&rsquo;s downward road, the conscience grows tougher, the perception of shame  blunter, the savage selfishness of the animal nature stronger. Diana Paget had  discovered some of her father&rsquo;s weaknesses during her miserable childhood; and  in the days of her unpaid-for schooling she had known that his most solemn  promises were no more to be relied on than the capricious breath of a summer  breeze. So the revelations which awaited her under the paternal roof were not  utterly strange or entirely unexpected. Day by day she grew more accustomed to  that atmosphere of fraud and falsehood. The sense of shame never left her; for  there is a pride that thrives amidst poverty and degradation, and of such pride  Diana Paget possessed no small share. She writhed under the consciousness that  she was the daughter of a man who had forfeited all right to the esteem of his  fellow-men. She valued the good opinion of others, and would fain have been  beloved and admired, trusted and respected; for she was ambitious: and the  thought that she might one day do something which should lift her above the  vulgar level was the day-dream that had consoled her in many an hour of  humiliation and discomfort. Diana Paget felt the Captain&rsquo;s shame as keenly as  her mother had felt it; but the remorse which had agonised gentle Mary Anne,  the tender compassion for others which had wrung that fond and faithful heart,  had no place in the breast of the Captain&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>Diana felt so much compassion for herself, that she  had none left to bestow upon other people. Her father&rsquo;s victims might be  miserable, but was not she infinitely more wretched? The landlady who found her  apartments suddenly tenantless and her rent unpaid might complain of the  hardness of her fortune; but was it not harder for Diana, with the sensitive  feelings and keen pride of the Pagets, to endure all the degradation involved  in the stealthy carrying away of luggage and a secret departure under cover of  night?</p>
<p>At first Miss Paget had been inclined to feel  aggrieved by the presence of the young man whom she had seen writing letters in  the gloomy dusk of the November afternoon; but in due time she came to accept  him as a companion, and to feel that her joyless life would have been drearier  without him. He was the secretary of the Friendly and Philanthropic Loan  Society, and of any other society organised by the Captain. He was Captain  Paget&rsquo;s amanuensis and representative &mdash; Captain Paget&rsquo;s tool, but not Captain  Paget&rsquo;s dupe; for Valentine Hawkehurst was not of that stuff of which dupes are  made.</p>
<p>The man who lives by his wits has need of a  faithful friend and follower. The chief of the vultures must not be approached  too easily. There must be a preparatory ordeal, an outer chamber to be passed,  before the victim is introduced to the sanctuary which is irradiated by the  silver veil of the prophet. Captain Paget found an able coadjutor in Valentine  Hawkehurst, who answered one of those tempting advertisements in which A. B.C.  or X. Y. Z. was wont to offer a salary of three hundred a year to any  gentlemanly person capable of performing the duties of secretary to a newly-established  company. It was only after responding to this promising offer that the  applicant was informed that he must possess one indispensable qualification in  the shape of a capital of five hundred pounds. Mr Hawkehurst laughed aloud when  the Captain imparted this condition with that suave and yet dignified manner  which was peculiar to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to have known it was a dodge of that  kind,&rdquo; said the young man coolly. &ldquo;Those very good things &mdash; duties light and  easy, hours from twelve till four, speedy advancement certain for a  conscientious and gentlemanly person, and so on &mdash; are always of the genus <em>do</em>. Your advertisement is very cleverly  worded, my dear sir; only it&rsquo;s like the rest of them, rather <em>too</em> clever. It is so difficult for a  clever man not to be too clever. The prevailing weakness of the human intellect  seems to me to be exaggeration. However, as I haven&rsquo;t a five-pound note in the  world, or the chance of getting one, I&rsquo;ll wish you good morning, Captain  Paget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are people whose blood would have been turned  to ice by the stony glare of indignation with which Horatio Paget regarded the  man who had dared to question his probity. But Mr. Hawkehurst had done with  strong impressions long before he met the Captain; and he listened to that  gentleman&rsquo;s freezing reproof with an admiring smile. Out of this very  unpromising beginning there arose a kind of friendship between the two men.  Horatio Paget had for some time been in need of a clever tool; and in the young  man whose cool insolence rose superior to his own dignity he perceived the very  individual whom he had long been seeking. The young man who was unabashed by  the indignation of a scion of Nugents and Cromies and Pagets must be utterly  impervious to the sense of awe; and it was just such an impervious young man  that the Captain wanted as his coadjutor. Thus arose the alliance, which grew  stronger every day, until Valentine took up his abode under the roof of his  employer and patron, and made himself more thoroughly at home there than the  unwelcome daughter of the house.</p>
<p>The history of Valentine Hawkehurst&rsquo;s past  existence was tolerably well known to the Captain; but the only history of the  young man&rsquo;s early life ever heard by Diana was rather vague and fragmentary.  She discovered, little by little, that he was the son of a spendthrift <em>litt&eacute;rateur</em>, who had passed the greater  part of his career within the rules of the King&rsquo;s Bench; that he had run away  from home at the age of fifteen, and had tried his fortune in all those  professions which require no educational ordeal, and which seem to offer  themselves invitingly to the scapegrace and adventurer. At fifteen Valentine  Hawkehurst had been errand-boy in a newspaper office; at seventeen a  penny-a-liner, whose flimsy was pretty sure of admission in the lower class of  Sunday papers. In the course of a very brief career he had been a provincial  actor, a <em>man&egrave;ge</em> rider in a circus, a  billiard-marker, and a betting agent. It was after having exhausted these  liberal professions that he encountered Captain Paget.</p>
<p>Such was the man whom Horatio Paget admitted to  companionship with his only daughter. It can scarcely be pleaded in excuse for  the Captain that he might have admitted a worse man than Valentine Hawkehurst  to his family circle, for the Captain had never taken the trouble to sound the  depths of his coadjutor&rsquo;s nature. There is nothing so short-sighted as  selfishness; and beyond the narrow circle immediately surrounding himself,  there was no man more blind than Horatio Paget.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It was dusk when Diana grew tired of the lonely  pathways among the hills, where the harmonies of a band stationed in the valley  were wafted in gusts of music by the fitful summer breeze. The loneliness of  the place soothed the girl&rsquo;s feverish spirits; and, seated in a little classic  temple upon the summit of a hill, she looked pensively downward through the  purple mists at the newly-lighted lamps twinkling faintly in the valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One does not feel the sting of one&rsquo;s shabbiness  here,&rdquo; thought Miss
  Paget: &ldquo;the trees are all dressed alike. Nature makes no distinction.
  It is only Fortune who treats her children unfairly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain&rsquo;s daughter walked slowly back to the  little town in the deepening dusk. The lodging occupied by Horatio Paget and  his household consisted of four roomy chambers on the second story of a big  rambling house. The rooms were meanly furnished, and decorated with the tawdry  ornamentation dear to the continental mind; but there were long wide windows  and an iron balcony, on which Diana Paget was often pleased to sit.</p>
<p>She found the sitting-room dark and empty. No  dinner had been prepared; for on lucky days the Captain and his <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em> were wont to dine at the <em>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</em> of one of the hotels, or to  feast sumptuously <em>&agrave; la carte</em>, while  on unlucky days they did not dine at all. Diana found a roll and some cream  cheese in a roomy old cupboard that was flavoured with mice; and after making a  very indifferent meal in the dusky chamber, she went out upon the balcony, and  sat there looking down upon the lighted town.</p>
<p>She had been sitting there for nearly an hour in  the same attitude, when the door of the sitting-room was opened, and a footstep  sounded behind her. She knew the step; and although she did not lift her head,  her eyes took a new brightness in the summer dusk, and the listless grace of  her attitude changed to a statuesque rigidity, though there was no change in  the attitude itself.</p>
<p>She did not stir till a hand was laid softly on her  shoulder, and a voice said,&mdash; &ldquo;Diana!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker was Valentine Hawkehurst, the young man  whose entrance to the golden temple had been so closely watched by Captain  Paget&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>She rose as he spoke, and turned to him. &ldquo;You have  been losing, I suppose, Mr. Hawkehurst,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or you would not have come  home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am compelled to admit that you are right in your  premise, Miss Paget, and your deduction is scarcely worth discussion. I <em>have</em> been losing &mdash; confoundedly; and as  they don&rsquo;t give credit at the board of green cloth yonder, there was no excuse  for my staying. Your father has not been holding his own within the last hour  or two; but when I left the rooms he was going to the Hotel d&rsquo;Orange with some  French fellows for a quiet game of <em>&eacute;cart&eacute;</em>.  Our friend the Captain is a great card, Miss Paget, and has a delightful talent  for picking up distinguished acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are few daughters who would have cared to  hear a father spoken of in this free-and-easy manner; but Diana Paget was quite  unmoved. She had resumed her old attitude, and sat looking towards the lighted  windows of the Kursaal, while Mr. Hawkehurst lounged against the angle of the  window with his hands in his pockets and a cigar in his mouth.</p>
<p>For three years Valentine Hawkehurst had lived in  constant companionship with the Captain&rsquo;s daughter; and in that time his manner  to her had undergone considerable variation. Of late it had been something in  the manner of an elder brother, whose fraternal breast is impervious to the  influence of a sister&rsquo;s loveliness or a sister&rsquo;s fascination. If Diana Paget  had been a snub-nosed young person with red hair and white eyelashes, Mr.  Hawkehurst could scarcely have treated her with a more friendly indifference, a  more brotherly familiarity.</p>
<p>Unhappily this line of conduct, which is perhaps  the wisest and most honourable plan that a man can pursue when he finds himself  thrown into a dangerously familiar association with a beautiful and unprotected  woman, is the very line of proceeding which a beautiful woman can never bring  herself to forgive. A chivalrous stiffness, a melancholy dignity, a frozen  frigidity, which suggest the fiery bubbling of the lava flood beneath the icy  surface, &mdash; these are delightful to the female mind. But friendly indifference  and fraternal cordiality constitute the worst insult that can be offered to her  beauty, the most bitter outrage upon the majesty of her sex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it will be midnight before papa comes  home, Mr. Hawkehurst,&rdquo; Diana said abruptly, when her companion had finished his  cigar, and had thrown the end of it over the balcony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Past midnight more likely, Miss Paget. May I ask  how I have become Mr. Hawkehurst all of a sudden, when for the last three years  I have been usually known as Valentine &mdash; or Val?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned her head with a gesture in which  the carelessness of his own manner was imitated. She stole a rapid look at him  as she answered, &ldquo;What does it matter whether I call you by one name or  another?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does anything matter? I believe Mr. Toots was  an unconscious philosopher. There is nothing in the world of any consequence,  except money. Go and look at those poor devils yonder, and you will see what  that is worth,&rdquo; he cried, pointing to the lighted Kursaal; &ldquo;there you behold  the one great truth of the universe in action. There is nothing but money, and  men are the slaves of money, and life is only another name for the pursuit of  money. Go and look at beauty yonder fading in the light and heat; at youth that  changes to age before your eyes; at friendship which turns to hate when the  chances of the game are with my friend and against me. The Kursaal is the world  in little, Diana; and this great globe of ours is nothing but a gigantic  gaming-table &mdash; a mighty temple for the worship of the golden calf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you imitate those people yonder, if you  despise them so heartily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am like them and of them. I tell you  that money is the beginning and end of all things. Why am I here, and why is my  life made up of baseness and lies? Because my father was an improvident  scoundrel, and did not leave me five hundred a year. I wonder what I should have  been like, by the bye, if I had been blest with five hundred a year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest and happy,&rdquo; answered the girl earnestly.  She forgot her simulated indifference, and looked at him with sad earnest eyes.  He met the glance, and the expression of his own face changed from its cynical  smile to a thoughtful sadness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest perhaps; and yet I almost doubt if anything  under five thousand a year would have kept me honest. Decidedly not happy; the  men who can be happy on five hundred a year are made of a duller stuff than the  clay which serves for a Hawkehurst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk about not being happy with five hundred a  year!&rdquo; Diana exclaimed impatiently. &ldquo;Surely any decent existence would be  happiness to you compared to the miserable life you lead, &mdash; the shameful,  degraded life which shuts you out of the society of respectable people and  reduces you to the level of a thief. If you had any pride, Valentine, you would  feel it as bitterly as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t any pride. As for my life, &mdash; well, I  suppose it is shameful and degraded, and I know that it&rsquo;s often miserable; but  it suits me better than jog-trot respectability, I can dine one day on truffled  turkey and champagne, another day upon bread and cheese and small beer; but I  couldn&rsquo;t eat beef and mutton always. That&rsquo;s what kills people of my  temperament. There are born scamps in the world, Diana, and I am one of them.  My name is Robert Macaire, and I was created for the life I lead. Keep clear of  me if you have any hankering after better things; but don&rsquo;t try to change my nature,  for it is wasted labour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine, it is so cruel of you to talk like  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cruel to whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To &mdash; those &mdash; who care for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was quite dark now; but even in the darkness  Diana Paget&rsquo;s head drooped a little as she said this. Mr. Hawkehurst laughed  aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those who care for me!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;no such people  ever lived. My father was a drunken scoundrel, who suffered his children to  grow up about him as he would have suffered a litter of puppies to sprawl upon  his hearth, only because there was less trouble in letting them lie there than  in kicking them out. My mother was a good woman in the beginning, I know; but  she must have been something more than a mortal woman if she had not lost some  of her goodness in twelve years of such a life as she led with my father. I  believe she was fond of me, poor soul; but she died six months before I ran  away from a lodging in the Rules, which it is the bitterest irony to speak of  as my home. Since then I have been Robert Macaire, and have about as many  friends as such a man usually has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can scarcely wonder if you have few friends,&rdquo;  said Miss Paget, &ldquo;since there is no one in the world whom you love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She watched him through the darkness after saying  this, watched him closely, though it was too dark for her to see the expression  of his face, and any emotion to which her words might have given rise could be  betrayed only by some gesture or change of attitude. She watched him in vain,  for he did not stir. But after a pause of some minutes he said slowly, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a man as I cannot afford to love any one.  What have I to offer to the woman I might pretend to love? Truth, or honour, or  honesty, or constancy? Those are commodities I have never dealt in. If I know  what they are, and that I have never possessed them, it is about as much as I  do know of them. If I have any redeeming grace, Diana Paget, it lies in the  fact that I know what a worthless wretch I am. Your father thinks he is a great  man, a noble suffering creature, and that the world has ill-used him. I know  that I am a scoundrel, and that let my fellow-men treat me as badly as they  please, they can never give me worse usage than I deserve. And am I a man to  talk about love, or to ask a woman to share my life? Good God, what a noble  partner I should offer her! what a happy existence I could assure her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the woman loved you, she would only love  you better for being unfortunate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if she was very young and foolish and  romantic. But don&rsquo;t you think I should be a villain if I traded on her girlish  folly? She would love me for a year or two perhaps, and bear all the changes of  my temper; but the day would come when she would awake from her delusion, and  know that she had been cheated. She would see other women &mdash; less gifted than  herself, probably &mdash; and would see the market they had made of their charms;  would see them rich and honoured and happy, and would stand aside in the muddy  streets to be splashed by the dirt from their carriage-wheels. And then she  would consider the price for which she had bartered her youth and her beauty,  and would hate the man who had cheated her. No, Diana, I am not such a villain  as the world may think me. I am down in the dirt myself, and I&rsquo;m used to it. I  won&rsquo;t drag a woman into the gutter just because I may happen to love her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a long silence after this &mdash; a silence  during which Diana Paget sat looking down at the twinkling lights of the  Kursaal. Valentine lighted a second cigar and smoked it out, still in silence.  The clocks struck eleven as he threw the end of his cigar away; a tiny,  luminous speck, which shot through the misty atmosphere below the balcony like  a falling star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may as well go and see how your father is  getting on yonder,&rdquo; he said, as the spark of light vanished in the darkness  below. &ldquo;Good night, Diana. Don&rsquo;t sit too long in the cold night air; and don&rsquo;t  sit up for your father &mdash; there&rsquo;s no knowing when he may be home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did not answer him. She listened to the  shutting of the door as it closed behind him, and then folded her arms upon the  iron rail of the balcony, laid her head upon them, and wept silently. Her life  was very dreary, and it seemed to her as if the last hope which had sustained  her against an unnatural despair had been taken away from her to-night.</p>
<p>Twelve o&rsquo;clock sounded with a feeble little <em>carillon</em> from one of the steeples, and  still she sat with her head resting upon her folded arms. Her eyes were quite  dry by this time, for with her tears were very rare, and the passion which  occasioned them must needs be intense. The night air grew chill and damp; but  although she shivered now and then beneath that creeping, penetrating cold  which is peculiar to night air, she did not stir from her place in the balcony  till she was startled by the opening of the door in the room behind her.</p>
<p>All was dark within, but Diana Paget was very  familiar with the footstep that sounded on the carpetless floor. It was  Valentine Hawkehurst, and not her father, whose step her quick ear  distinguished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana,&rdquo; he called; and then he muttered in a tone  of surprise, &ldquo;all dark still. Ah! she has gone to bed, I suppose. That&rsquo;s a  pity!&rdquo; The figure in the balcony caught his eye at this moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in goodness&rsquo; name has kept you out there all  this time?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;do you want to catch your death of cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was standing by the mantelpiece lighting a  candle as he asked this unceremonious question. The light of the candle shone  full upon his face when Diana came into the room, and she could see that he was  paler than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything the matter?&rdquo; she asked  anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; there is a great deal the matter. You will  have to leave For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne by the earliest train to-morrow morning, on the  first stage of your journey to England. Look here, my girl! I can give you just  about the money that will carry you safely to London; and when you are once  there, Providence must do the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine, what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, that you cannot get away from this place &mdash;  you cannot dissever yourself from the people you have been living with, too  soon. Come, come, don&rsquo;t shiver, child. Take a few drops of this cognac, and let  me see the colour come back to your face before I say any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He poured the dregs of a bottle of brandy into a  glass, and made her drink the spirit. He was obliged to force the rim of the  glass between her set teeth before he could succeed in this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Diana,&rdquo; he said, after she had drunk, &ldquo;you  have been a pupil in the school of adversity so long, that you ought to be able  to take misfortunes pretty quietly. There&rsquo;s a balance struck, somehow or other,  depend upon it, my girl; and the prosperous people who pay their debts have to  suffer, as well as the Macaire family. I&rsquo;m a scamp and a scoundrel, but I&rsquo;m  your true friend nevertheless, Diana; and you must promise to take my advice.  Tell me that you will trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no one else to trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one else in this place. But in England you have  your old friend, &mdash; the woman with whom you were at school. Do you think she  would refuse to give you a temporary home if you sued to her <em>in form&acirc; pauperis?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think she would refuse. She was very  good to me. But why am I to go back to London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because to stay here would be ruin and disgrace to  you; because the tie that links you to Horatio Paget must be cut at any  hazard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the best or worst of reasons. Your father has  been trying a trick to-night which has been hitherto so infallible, that I  suppose he had grown careless as to his execution of it. Or perhaps he took a  false measure of the man he was playing with. In any case, he has been found  out, and has been arrested by the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrested, for cheating at cards!&rdquo; exclaimed the  girl, with a look of unspeakable disgust and horror. Valentine&rsquo;s arm was ready  to support her, if she had shown any symptom of fainting; but she did not. She  stood erect before him, very pale but firm as a rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want me to go away?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I want you to disappear from this place  before you become notorious as your father&rsquo;s daughter. That would be about the  worst reputation which you could carry through life. Believe me that I wish you  well, Diana, and be ruled by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; she answered, with a kind of despairing  resignation. &ldquo;It seems very dreary to go back to England to face the world all  alone. But I will do as you tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not express any sympathy for her father,  then languishing under arrest, whereby she proved herself very wicked and  unwomanly, no doubt. But neither womanly virtues nor Christian graces are wont  to flourish in the school in which Diana Paget had been reared. She obeyed  Valentine Hawkehurst to the letter, without any sentimental lamentations  whatever. Her scanty possessions were collected, and neatly packed, in little  more than an hour. At three o&rsquo;clock she lay down in her tawdry little  bed-chamber to take what rest she might in the space of two hours. At six she  stood by Valentine Hawkehurst on the platform of the railway station, with her  face hidden by a brown gauze veil, waiting till the train was made ready to  start.</p>
<p>It was after she was seated in the carriage that  she spoke for the first time of her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it likely to go very hard with him?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not. We must try to pull him through it as  well as we can. The charge may break down at the first examination. Good bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good bye, Valentine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had just time to shake hands before the train  moved off. Another moment and Miss Paget and her fellow-passengers were  speeding towards Li&eacute;ge.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst drew his hat over his eyes as he  walked away from the station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world will seem very dull and empty to me  without her,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I have done an unselfish thing for once in  my life. I wonder whether the recording angel will carry that up to my credit,  and whether the other fellow will blot out any of the old score in consideration  of this one little bit of self-sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  A Fortunate Marriage</h2>
<p>Eleven years had passed lightly enough over the  glossy raven locks of Mr. Philip Sheldon. There are some men with whom Time  deals gently, and he was one of them. The hard black eyes had lost none of  their fierce brightness; the white teeth flashed with all their old brilliancy;  the complexion, which had always been dusky of hue, was perhaps a shade or two  darker; and the fierce black eyes seemed all the blacker by reason of the  purple tinge beneath them. But the Philip Sheldon of to-day was, taken  altogether, a handsomer man than the Philip Sheldon of eleven years ago.</p>
<p>Within those eleven years the Bloomsbury dentist  had acquired a higher style of dress and bearing, and a certain improvement of  tone and manner. He was still an eminently respectable man, and a man whose  chief claim to the esteem of his fellows lay in the fact of his unimpeachable  respectability; but his respectability of to-day, as compared with that of  eleven years before, was as the respectability of Tyburnia when contrasted with  that of St. Pancras. He was not an aristocratic-looking man, or an elegant man;  but you felt, as you contemplated him, that the bulwarks of the citadel of  English respectability are defended by such as he.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon no longer experimentalised with lumps  of beeswax and plaster-of-paris. All the appalling paraphernalia of his cruel  art had long since been handed over to an aspiring young dentist, together with  the respectable house in Fitzgeorge-street, the furniture, and &mdash; the connexion.  And thus had ended Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s career as a surgeon-dentist. Within a year  of Tom Halliday&rsquo;s death his disconsolate widow had given her hand to her first  sweetheart, not forgetful of her dead husband or ungrateful for much kindness  and affection experienced at his hands, but yielding rather to Philip&rsquo;s suit  because she was unable to advance any fair show of reason whereby she might  reject him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, she&rsquo;d be afraid to refuse you,&rdquo; said  George Sheldon, when the dentist came home from Barlingford, where Tom  Halliday&rsquo;s widow was living with her mother.</p>
<p>Philip had answered his brother&rsquo;s questions rather  ambiguously at first, but in the end had been fain to confess that he had asked  Mrs. Halliday to marry him, and that his suit had prospered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That way of putting it is not very complimentary  to me,&rdquo; he said, drawing himself up rather stiffly. &ldquo;Georgy and I were attached  to each other long ago, and it is scarcely strange if &mdash; &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you should make a match of it, Tom being gone.  Poor old Tom! He and I were such cronies. I&rsquo;ve always had an idea that neither  you nor the other fellow quite understood that low fever of his. You did your  best, no doubt; but I think you ought to have pulled him through somehow.  However, that&rsquo;s not a pleasant subject to talk of just now; so I&rsquo;ll drop it,  and wish you joy, Phil. It&rsquo;ll be rather a good match for you, I fancy,&rdquo; added  George, contemplating his brother with a nervous twitching of his lips, which  suggested that his mouth watered as he thought of Philip&rsquo;s good fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very nice thing you drop into, old fellow,  isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked presently, seeing that his brother was rather disinclined  to discuss the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the state of my affairs well enough to be  sure that I couldn&rsquo;t afford to marry a poor woman,&rdquo; answered Philip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that it has been for a long time a vital  necessity with you to marry a rich one,&rdquo; interjected his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Georgy will have a few hundreds, and &mdash; &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few thousands, you mean, Phil,&rdquo; cried Sheldon  the younger with agreeable briskness; &ldquo;shall I tot it up for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was always eager to &ldquo;tot&rdquo; things up, and would  scarcely have shrunk from setting down the stars of heaven in trim double  columns of figures, had it seemed to his profit to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us put it in figures, Phil,&rdquo; he said, getting  his finger-tips in order for the fray. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the money for Hyley Farm &mdash;  twelve thousand three hundred and fifty, I had it from poor Tom&rsquo;s own lips.  Then there&rsquo;s that little property on Sheepfield Common &mdash; say seven-fifty, eh? &mdash;  well, say seven hundred, if you like to leave a margin; and then there are the  insurances &mdash; three thou&rsquo; in the Alliance, fifteen hundred in the Phoenix, five  hundred in the Suffolk Friendly; the total of which, my dear boy, is eighteen  thousand five hundred pounds; and a very nice thing for you to drop into, just  as affairs were looking about as black as they could look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Sheldon the elder, who appeared  by no means to relish this &ldquo;totting-up&rdquo; of his future wife&rsquo;s fortune; &ldquo;I have  no doubt I ought to consider myself a very lucky man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Barlingford folks will say when they hear of  the business. And now I hope you&rsquo;re not going to forget your promise to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That if you ever did get a stroke of luck, I  should have a share of it &mdash; eh, Phil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon caressed his chin, and looked  thoughtfully at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my wife lets me have the handling of any of her  money, you may depend upon it I&rsquo;ll do what I can for you,&rdquo; he said, after a  pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Phil,&rdquo; remonstrated George. &ldquo;When  a man says he&rsquo;ll do what he can for you, it&rsquo;s a sure sign he means to do  nothing. Friendship and brotherly feeling are at an end when it comes to a  question of &lsquo;ifs&rsquo; and &lsquo;cans.&rsquo; <em>If</em> your  wife lets you have the handling of any of her money!&rdquo; cried the lawyer, with  unspeakable derision; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s too good a joke for you to indulge in with me. Do  you think I believe you will let that poor little woman keep custody of her  money a day after she is your wife, or that you will let her friends tie it up  for her before she marries you? No, Phil, you didn&rsquo;t lay your plans for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by my laying plans?&rdquo; asked the  dentist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a point we won&rsquo;t discuss, Philip,&rdquo; answered  the lawyer coolly. &ldquo;You and I understand each other very well without entering  into unpleasant details. You promised me a year ago &mdash; before Tom Halliday&rsquo;s  death &mdash; that if you ever came into a good thing, I should share in it. You have  come into an uncommonly good thing, and I shall expect you to keep your  promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says I am going to break it?&rdquo; demanded Philip  Sheldon with an injured air. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be in such a hurry to cry out,  George. You take the tone of a social Dick Turpin, and might as well hold a  pistol to my head while you&rsquo;re about it. Don&rsquo;t alarm yourself. I have told you  I will do what I can for you. I cannot, and I shall not, say more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other. They were in the  habit of taking the measure of all creation in their own eminently practical way,  and each took the other&rsquo;s measure now. After having done which, they parted  with all cordial expressions of good-will and brotherly feeling. George went  back to his dusty chambers in Gray&rsquo;s Inn, and Philip prepared for his return to  Barlingford and his marriage with Georgina Halliday.</p>
<p>For ten years Georgy had been Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s  wife, and she had found no reason to complain of her second choice. The current  of her life had flowed smoothly enough since her first lover had become her  husband. She still wore moire-antique dresses and gold chains; and if the  dresses were of more simple fashion, and the chains were less obtrusively  displayed, she had to thank Mr. Sheldon for the refinement in her taste. Her  views of life in general had expanded under Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s influence. She no  longer thought a high-wheeled dog-cart and a skittish mare the acme of earthly  splendour; for she had a carriage and pair at her service, and a smart little  page-boy to leap off the box in attendance on her when she paid visits or went  shopping. Instead of the big comfortable old-fashioned farmhouse at Hyley, with  its mysterious passages and impenetrable obscurities in the way of cupboards,  she occupied an intensely new detached villa in Bayswater, in which the eye  that might chance to grow weary of sunshine and glitter would have sought in  vain for a dark corner wherein to repose itself.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s fortunes had prospered since his  marriage with his friend&rsquo;s widow. For a man of his practical mind and energetic  temperament, eighteen thousand pounds was a strong starting-point. His first  step was to clear off all old engagements with Jews and Gentiles, and to turn  his back on the respectable house in Fitzgeorge-street. The earlier months of  his married life he devoted to a pleasant tour on the Continent; not wasting  time in picturesque by-ways, or dawdling among inaccessible mountains, or  mooning about drowsy old cathedrals, where there were pictures with curtains  hanging before them, and prowling vergers who expected money for drawing aside  the curtains; but rattling at the highest continental speed from one big  commercial city to another, and rubbing off the rust of Bloomsbury in the  exchanges and on the quays of the busiest places in Europe. The time which Mr.  Sheldon forbore to squander in shadowy gothic aisles and under the shelter of  Alpine heights, he accounted well bestowed in crowded caf&eacute;s, and at the public  tables of noted hotels, where commercial men were wont to congregate; and as  Georgy had no aspirings for the sublimity of Vandyke and Raphael, or the  gigantic splendours of Alpine scenery, she was very well pleased to see  continental life with the eyes of Philip Sheldon. How could a half-educated  little woman, whose worldly experience was bounded by the suburbs of Barlingford,  be otherwise than delighted by the glare and glitter of foreign cities? Georgy  was childishly enraptured with everything she saw, from the sham diamonds and  rubies of the Palais Royal, to the fantastical bonbons of Berlin.</p>
<p>Her husband was very kind to her &mdash; after his own  particular fashion, which was very different from blustering Tom Halliday&rsquo;s  weak indulgence. He allotted and regulated her life to suit his own  convenience, it is true; but he bought her handsome dresses, and took her with  him in hired carriages when he drove about the strange cities. He was apt to  leave Georgy and the hired carriage at the corner of some street, or before the  door of some cafe, for an hour at a time, in the course of his peregrinations;  but she speedily became accustomed to this, and provided herself with the  Tauchnitz edition of a novel, wherewith to beguile the tedium of these  intervals in the day&rsquo;s amusement. If Tom Halliday had left her for an hour at a  street-corner, or before the door of a caf&eacute;, she would have tortured herself  and him by all manner of jealous suspicions and vague imaginings. But there was  a stern gravity in Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s character which precluded the possibility of  any such shadowy fancies. Every action of his life seemed to involve such  serious motives, the whole tenor of his existence was so orderly and  business-like, that his wife was fain to submit to him, as she would have  submitted to some ponderous infallible machine, some monster of modern  ingenuity and steam power, which cut asunder so many bars of iron, or punched  holes in so many paving-stones in a given number of seconds, and was likely to  go on dividing iron or piercing paving-stones for ever and ever.</p>
<p>She obeyed him, and was content to fashion her life  according to his will, chiefly because she had a vague consciousness that to  argue with him, or to seek to influence him, would be to attempt the  impossible. Perhaps there was something more than this in her mind &mdash; some  half-consciousness that there was a shapeless and invertebrate skeleton lurking  in the shadowy background of her new life, a dusky and impalpable creature  which it would not be well for her to examine or understand. She was a cowardly  little woman, and finding herself tolerably happy in the present, she did not  care to pierce the veil of the future, or to cast anxious glances backward to  the past. She thought it just possible that there might be people in the world  base enough to hint that Philip Sheldon had married her for love of her  eighteen thousand pounds, rather than from pure devotion to herself. She knew  that certain prudent friends and kindred in Barlingford had elevated their  hands and eyebrows in speechless horror when they discovered that she had  married her second husband without a settlement; while one grim and elderly  uncle had asked her whether she did not expect her father to turn in his grave  by reason of her folly.</p>
<p>Georgy had shrugged her shoulders peevishly when  her Barlingford friends remonstrated with her, and had declared that people  were very cruel to her, and that it was a hard thing she could not choose for  herself for once in her life. As to the settlements that people talked of, she  protested indignantly that she was not so mean as to fancy her future husband a  thief, and that to tie up her money in all sorts of ways would be to imply as  much. And then, as it was only a year since poor dear Tom&rsquo;s death, she had been  anxious to marry without fuss or parade. In fact, there were a hundred reasons  against legal interference, and legal tying-up of the money, with all that  dreadful jargon about &ldquo;whereas,&rdquo; and &ldquo;hereinafter,&rdquo; and &ldquo;provided always,&rdquo; and  &ldquo;nothing herein contained,&rdquo; which seems to hedge round a sum of money so  closely, that it is doubtful whether the actual owner will ever be free to  spend a sixpence of it after the execution of that formidable document intended  to protect it from possible marauders.</p>
<p>George Sheldon had said something very near the  truth when he had told Philip that Mrs. Halliday would be afraid to refuse him.  The fair-haired, fair-faced little woman did in some manner fear the first  lover of her girlhood. She had become his wife, and so far all things had gone  well with her; but if misery and despair had been the necessary consequences of  her union with him, she must have married him all the same, so dominant was the  influence by which he ruled her. Of course Georgy was not herself aware of her  own dependence. She accepted all things as they were presented to her by a  stronger mind than her own. She wore her handsome silk dresses, and was  especially particular as to the adjustment of her bonnet-strings, knowing that  the smallest impropriety of attire was obnoxious to the well-ordered mind of  her second husband. She obeyed him very much as a child obeys a strict but not  unkind schoolmaster. When he took her to a theatre or a racecourse, she sat by  his side meekly, and felt like a child who has been good and is reaping the  reward of goodness. And this state of things was in nowise disagreeable to her.  She was perhaps quite as happy as it was in her nature to be; for she had no  exalted capacity for happiness or misery. She felt that it was pleasant to have  a handsome man, whose costume was always irreproachable, for her husband. Her  only notion of a bad husband was a man who stayed out late, and came home under  the influence of strong liquors consumed in unknown localities and amongst  unknown people. So, as Mr. Sheldon rarely went out after dinner, and was on all  occasions the most temperate of men, she naturally considered her second husband  the very model of conjugal perfection. Thus it was that domestic life had  passed smoothly enough for Mr. Sheldon and his wife during the ten years which  had elapsed since their marriage.</p>
<p>As to the eighteen thousand pounds which she had  brought Philip Sheldon, Georgy asked no questions. She knew that she enjoyed  luxuries and splendours which had never been hers in Tom Halliday&rsquo;s lifetime,  and she was content to accept the goods which her second husband provided. Mr.  Sheldon had become a stockbroker, and occupied an office in some dusky court  within a few hundred yards of the Stock Exchange. He had, according to his own  account, trebled Georgy&rsquo;s thousands since they had been in his hands. How the  unsuccessful surgeon-dentist had blossomed all at once into a fortunate  speculator was a problem too profound for Georgy&rsquo;s consideration. She knew that  her husband had allied himself to a certain established firm of stockbrokers,  and that the alliance had cost him some thousands of Tom Halliday&rsquo;s money. She  had heard of preliminary steps to be taken to secure his admission as a member  of some mysterious confraternity vaguely spoken of as &ldquo;the House;&rdquo; and she knew  that Tom Halliday&rsquo;s thousands had been the seed from which had sprung other  thousands, and that her husband had been altogether triumphant and successful.</p>
<p>It may be that it is easier to rig the market than  to induce a given number of people to resort to a certain dull street in  Bloomsbury for the purpose of having teeth extracted by an unknown  practitioner. It is possible that the stockbroker is like the poet, a creature  who is born, and not made; a gifted and inspired being, not to be perfected by  any specific education; a child of spontaneous instincts and untutored  faculties. Certain it is that the divine afflatus from the nostrils of the god  Plutus seemed to have descended upon Philip Sheldon; for he had entered the  Stock Exchange an inexperienced stranger, and he held his place there amongst  men whose boyhood had been spent in the offices of Capel-court, and whose  youthful strength had been nourished in the chop-houses of Pinch-lane and  Thread-needle-street.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheldon was satisfied with the general  knowledge that Mr. Sheldon had been fortunate, and had never sought any more  precise knowledge of her husband&rsquo;s affairs. Nor did she seek such knowledge  even now, when her daughter was approaching womanhood, and might ere long need  some dower out of her mother&rsquo;s fortune. Poor Tom, trusting implicitly in the  wife he loved, and making his will only as a precautionary measure, at a time  when he seemed good for fifty years of life and strength, had not troubled  himself about remote contingencies, and had in no wise foreseen the probability  of a second husband for Georgy and a stepfather for his child.</p>
<p>Two children had been born to Mr. Sheldon since his  marriage, and both had died in infancy. The loss of these children had fallen  very heavily on the strong hard man, though he had never shed a tear or uttered  a lamentation, or wasted an hour of his business-like existence by reason of  his sorrow. Georgy had just sufficient penetration to perceive that her husband  was bitterly disappointed when no more baby-strangers came to replace those  poor frail little lives which had withered away and vanished in spite of his  anxiety to hold them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems as if there was a blight upon <em>my</em> children,&rdquo; he once said bitterly; and  this was the only occasion on which his wife heard him complain of his evil  fortune.</p>
<p>But one day, when he had been particularly lucky in  some speculation, when he had succeeded in achieving what his brother George  spoke of as the &ldquo;biggest line he had ever done,&rdquo; Philip Sheldon came home to  the Bayswater villa in a particularly bad humour, and for the first time since  her marriage Georgy heard him quote a line of Scripture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaping up riches,&rdquo; he muttered, as he paced up  and down the room; &ldquo;heaping up riches, and ye cannot tell who shall gather  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife knew then that he was thinking of his  children. During the brief lives of those two fragile boy-babies the  stockbroker had been wont to talk much of future successes in the way of  money-making to be achieved by him for the enrichment and exaltation of these  children. They were gone now, and no more came to replace them. And though  Philip Sheldon still devoted himself to the sublime art of money-making, and  still took delight in successful time-bargains and all the scientific  combinations of the money-market, the salt of life had lost something of its  savour, and the chink of gold had lost somewhat of its music.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  Charlotte</h2>
<p>The little villa at Bayswater was looking its  brightest on a resplendent midsummer afternoon, one year after Diana Paget&rsquo;s  hurried hegira from For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne. If the poor dentist&rsquo;s house in dingy  Bloomsbury had been fresh and brilliant of aspect, how much more brilliant was  the western home of the rich stockbroker, whose gate was within five minutes&rsquo;  walk of that aristocratic Eden, Kensington Gardens! Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s small domain  was called The Lawn, and consisted of something over half an acre of  flower-garden and shrubbery, a two-stall stable and coach-house, a conservatory  and fernery, and a moderate-sized house in the gothic or medi&aelig;val style, with  mullioned windows in the dining-room and oriels in the best bedroom, and with a  great deal of unnecessary stone-work and wooden excrescence in every direction.</p>
<p>The interior of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s dwelling bore no  trace of that solid old-fashioned clumsiness which had distinguished his house  in Fitzgeorge-street. Having surrendered his ancestral chairs and tables in  liquidation of his liabilities, Philip Sheldon was free to go with the times,  and had furnished his gothic villa in the most approved modern style, but  without any attempt at artistic grace or adornment. All was bright, and  handsome, and neat, and trim; but the brightness and the neatness savoured just  a little of furnished apartments at the seaside, and the eye sought in vain for  the graceful disorder of an elegant home. The dining-room was gorgeous with all  the splendour of new mahogany and crimson morocco; the drawing-room was  glorified by big looking-glasses, and the virginal freshness of gilt frames on  which the feet of agile house-fly or clumsy blue-bottle had never rested. The  crimsons, and blues, and greens, and drabs of the Brussels carpets retained the  vivid brightness of the loom. The drops of the chandeliers twinkled like little  stars in the sunshine; the brass birdcages were undimmed by any shadow of  dulness. To Georgy&rsquo;s mind the gothic villa was the very perfection of a dwelling-place.  The Barlingford housekeepers were wont to render their homes intolerable by  extreme neatness. Georgy still believed in the infallibility of her native  town, and the primness of Barlingford reigned supreme in the gothic villa.  There were no books scattered on the polished walnut-wood tables in the  drawing-room, no cabinets crammed with scraps of old china, no pictures, no  queer old Indian feather-screens, no marvels of Chinese carving in discoloured  ivory; none of those traces which the footsteps of the &ldquo;collector&rdquo; leave behind  him. Mr. Sheldon had no leisure for collecting; and Georgy preferred the gaudy  pink-and-blue vases of a Regent-street china-shop to all the dingy <em>chefs-d&rsquo;oeuvre</em> of a Wedgwood, or the  quaint shepherds and shepherdesses of Chelsea. As for books, were there not  four or five resplendent volumes primly disposed on one of the tables; an  illustrated edition of Cowper&rsquo;s lively and thrilling poems; a volume of Rambles  in Scotland, with copper-plate engravings of &ldquo;Melrose by night,&rdquo; and Glasgow  Cathedral, and Ben Nevis, and other scenic and architectural glories of North  Britain; a couple of volumes of <em>Punch</em>,  and an illustrated &ldquo;Vicar of Wakefield;&rdquo; and what more could elevated taste  demand in the way of literature? Nobody ever read the books; but Mrs. Sheldon&rsquo;s  visitors were sometimes glad to take refuge in the Scottish scenery and the  pictorial Vicar during that interval of dulness and indigestion which succeeds  a middle-class dinner. Georgy read a great many books; but they were all novels,  procured from the Bayswater branch of a fashionable circulating library, and  were condemned unread by Mr. Sheldon, who considered all works of fiction  perfectly equal in demerit, and stigmatised them, in a general way, as  &ldquo;senseless trash.&rdquo; He had tried to read novels in the dreary days of his  Bloomsbury probation; but he had found that the heroes of them were  impracticable beings, who were always talking of honour and chivalry, and  always sacrificing their own interests in an utterly preposterous manner; and  he had thrown aside story after story in disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a book that is something like life, and  I&rsquo;ll read it,&rdquo; he exclaimed impatiently; &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t swallow the high-flown  prosings of impossibly virtuous inanities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day, indeed, he had been struck by the power of  a book, a book written by a certain Frenchman called Balzac. He had been  riveted by the hideous cynicism, the supreme power of penetration into the  vilest corners of wicked hearts; and he flung the book from him at last with an  expression of unmitigated admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man knows his fellows,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and is not  hypocrite enough to conceal his knowledge, or to trick out his puppets in the  tinsel and rags of false sentiment in order that critics and public may cry,  &lsquo;See, what noble instincts, what generous impulses, what unbounded sympathy for  his fellow-creatures this man has!&rsquo; This Frenchman is an artist, and is not  afraid to face the difficulties of his art. What a scoundrel this Philippe  Bridau is! And after wallowing in the gutter, he lives to bespatter his  virtuous brother with the mire from his carriage wheels. That is <em>real</em> life. Your English novelist would  have made his villain hang himself with the string of his waistcoat in a  condemned cell, while his amiable hero was declared heir to a dukedom and forty  thousand a year. But this fellow Balzac knows better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The days had passed when Mr. Sheldon had leisure to  read Balzac. He read nothing but the newspapers now, and in the newspapers he  read very little more than the money articles and such political news as seemed  likely to affect the money-market. There is no such soul-absorbing pursuit as  the race which men run whose goal is the glittering Temple of Plutus. The  golden apples which tempted Atalanta to slacken her pace are always rolling <em>before</em> the modern runner, and the greed  of gain lends the wings of Hermes to his feet. Mr. Sheldon had sighed for  pleasures sometimes in the days of his Bloomsbury martyrdom. He had sat by his  open window on sultry summer evenings, smoking his solitary cigar, and thinking  moodily of all the pleasant resting-places from which other men were looking  out at that golden western sky, deepening into crimson and melting into purples  which even the London smoke could not obscure. He had sat alone, thinking of  jovial parties lounging in the bow-windows of Greenwich taverns, with cool  green hock-glasses and pale amber wine, and a litter of fruit and flowers on  the table before them, while the broad river flowed past them with all the  glory of the sunset on the rippling water, and one black brig standing sharply  out against the yellow sky. He had thought of Richmond, and the dashing young  men who drive there every summer in drags, with steel chain and bar clanking  and glittering in front of the team, and two solemn grooms with folded arms  seated stiff and statue-like behind. He had thought of Epsom, and the great  Derby mob; and all of those golden goblets of pleasure which prosperous manhood  drains to the very dregs. He had fancied the enjoyments which would be his if  ever he were rich enough to pay for them. And now he was able to afford all  such pleasures he cared nothing for them; for the ecstasy of making money  seemed better than any masculine dissipation or delight. He did sometimes dine  at Greenwich. He knew the <em>menus</em> of  the different taverns by heart, and had discovered that they were all alike  vanity and indigestion; but he never seated himself at one of those glistening  little tables, or deliberated with an obsequious waiter over the mysteries of  the wine <em>carte</em>, without a settled  purpose to be served by the eating of the dinner, and a definite good to be  achieved by the wine he ordered. He gave many such entertainments at home and  abroad; but they were all given to men who were likely to be useful to him &mdash; to  rich men, or the toadies and hangers-on of rich men, the grand viziers of the  sultans of the money-market. Such a thing as pleasure or hospitality pure and  simple had no place in the plan of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s life. The race in which he was  running was not to be won by a loiterer. The golden apples were always rolling  on before the runner; and woe be to him who turned away from the course to  dally with the flowers or loiter by the cool streams that beautified the  wayside.</p>
<p>Thus it was that Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s existence grew day  by day more completely absorbed by business pursuits and business interests.  Poor Georgy complained peevishly of her husband&rsquo;s neglect; but she did not dare  to pour her lamentations into the ear of the offender. It was a kind of relief  to grumble about his busy life to servants and humble female friends and  confidantes; but what could she say to Philip Sheldon himself? What ground had  she for complaint? He very seldom stayed out late; he never came home tipsy. He  was quite as cool and clear-headed and business-like, and as well able to &ldquo;tot  up&rdquo; any given figures upon the back of an envelope after one of those  diplomatic little Greenwich dinners as he was the first thing after breakfast.  It had been an easy thing to tyrannise over poor Tom Halliday; but this man was  a grave inscrutable creature, a domestic enigma which Georgy was always giving  up in despair. But so completely did Mr. Sheldon rule his wife, that when he  informed her inferentially that she was a very happy woman, she accepted his  view of the subject, and was content to believe herself blest.</p>
<p>In spite of those occasional grumblings to servants  and female friends, Mrs. Sheldon did think herself happy. Those occasional  complaints were the minor notes in the harmony of her life, and only served to  make the harmony complete. She read her novels, and fed a colony of little  feeble twittering birds that occupied a big wire cage in the breakfast-parlour.  She executed a good deal of fancy-work with beads and Berlin-wool; she dusted  and arranged the splendours of the drawing-room with her own hands; and she  took occasional walks in Kensington Gardens.</p>
<p>This was the ordinary course of her existence, now  and then interrupted by such thrilling events as a dinner given to some  important acquaintance of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s, or a visit to the school at which  Charlotte Halliday was completing her education.</p>
<p>That young lady had been removed from the  Scarborough boarding-school to a highly respectable establishment at Brompton,  within a few months of her mother&rsquo;s marriage with Mr. Sheldon. She had been a  rosy-cheeked young damsel in pinafores at the time of that event, too young to  express any strong feeling upon the subject of her mother&rsquo;s second choice; but  not too young to feel the loss of her father very deeply. Tom Halliday had been  fondly attached to that bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked damsel of nine years&rsquo; growth,  and the girl had fully reciprocated his affection. How often they had talked  together of the future, which was to be so delightful for them both; the new  farm, which was to be such a paradise in comparison to Hyley; the pony that  Charlotte was to ride when she should be old enough to wear a habit like a  lady, and to go about with her father to market-towns and corn-exchanges! The  little girl had remembered all this, and had most bitterly lamented the loss of  that dear and loving father.</p>
<p>She remembered it all to this day; she regretted  her loss to this day, though she was nearly of age, and on the point of leaving  school for ever, after having prolonged her school-days considerably beyond the  usual period, at the express wish of her stepfather. To say that she disliked  Mr. Sheldon is only to admit that she was subject to the natural prejudices of  humanity. He had usurped the place of a beloved father, and he was in every way  the opposite of that father. He had come between Charlotte Halliday and her  mother, and had so absorbed the weak little woman into himself, as to leave  Charlotte quite alone in the world. And yet he did his duty as few stepfathers  do it. Charlotte admitted that he was very kind to her, that he was an  excellent husband, and altogether the most conscientious and respectable of  mankind; but she admitted with equal candour that she had never been able to  like him. &ldquo;I daresay it is very wicked of me not to be fond of him, when he is  so good and generous to me,&rdquo; she said to her chosen friend and companion; &ldquo;but  I never can feel quite at home with him. I try to think of him as a father  sometimes, but I never can get over the &lsquo;step.&rsquo; Do you know I have dreamed of  him sometimes? and though he is so kind to me in reality, I always fancy him  cruel to me in my dreams. I suppose it is on account of his black eyes and  black whiskers,&rdquo; added Miss Halliday, in a meditative tone. &ldquo;It is certainly a  misfortune for a person to have blacker eyes and whiskers than the rest of the  world; for there seems something stern and hard, and almost murderous, in such  excessive blackness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte Halliday was a very different creature  from the mother whom Mr. Sheldon had absorbed into himself. Georgy was one of  the women who have &ldquo;no characters at all,&rdquo; but Georgy&rsquo;s daughter was open to  the charge of eccentricity rather than of inanity. She was a creature of  fancies and impulses. She had written wild verses in the secrecy of her own  chamber at midnight, and had torn her poetic effusions into a thousand  fragments the morning after their composition. She played and sang very  sweetly, and danced admirably, and did everything in a wild way of her own,  which was infinitely more charming than the commonplace perfection of other  women. She was not a beauty according to those established rules which  everybody believes in until they meet a woman who sins against them all and yet  is beautiful. Miss Halliday had thick black eyebrows, and large gray eyes which  people were apt to mistake for black. She had a composite nose, and one of the  sweetest mouths that ever smiled upon enraptured mankind. Nature had given her  just a little more chin than a Greek sculptor would have allowed her; but, by  way of make-weight, the same careless Nature had bestowed upon her a throat  which Phidias himself might have sought in vain to improve upon. And Nature had  planted this young lady&rsquo;s head upon her shoulders with a grace so rare that it  must needs be a happy accident in the workmanship of that immortal artist.  Indeed it seemed as if Charlotte Halliday owed her charms to a series of happy  accidents. The black eyebrows which made her face so piquant might have been  destruction to another woman. The round column-like throat needed a fine frank  face to surmount it, and the fine frank face was rendered gracious and womanly  by the wealth of waving dark hair which framed it. The girl was one of those  bright happy creatures whom men worship and women love, and whom envy can  scarcely dislike. She was so infinitely superior to both father and mother,  that a believer in hereditary attributes was fain to invent some mythical  great-grandmother from whom the girl&rsquo;s graces might have been derived. But she  had something of her father&rsquo;s easy good-nature and imprudent generosity; and  was altogether one of those impulsive creatures whose lives are perpetual  difficulties and dilemmas. More lectures had been delivered for her edification  than for any other young lady in the Brompton boarding-school, and yet she had  been the favourite and delight of everybody in the establishment, from the  mistress of the mansion down to the iniquitous boy who cleaned the boots, and  who was hounded and hunted, and abused and execrated, from dewy morn to dusky  eve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I allus puts plenty of elbow-grease on your boots,  Miss &rsquo;Allundale, though cook does heave saucepan-lids at my &rsquo;ed and call me a  lazy wiper,&rdquo; this incorrigible imp protested to Charlotte one morning, when she  had surprised him in tears and had consoled his woes by a donation of pence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All things love thee, so do I,&rdquo; says the lover to  his mistress; and it is almost impossible not to adore a young lady who is  universally beloved, for the simple reason that this general affection is very  rarely accorded to any but a loving nature. There is an instinct in these  things. From all the ruck of Cheapside a vagrant dog will select the man who  has most toleration for the canine species, and is most likely to give him  shelter. A little child coming suddenly into a circle of strangers knows in  which lap it may find a haven, on which bosom it may discover safety and  comfort. If mistress and schoolfellows, servants and shoeblack, dogs and cats,  were fond of Charlotte Halliday, their affection had been engendered by her own  sweet smiles and loving words, and helping hands always ready to give  substantial succour or to aid by active service.</p>
<p>She had been at the Brompton gyn&aelig;ceum nearly eleven  years &mdash; only leaving it for her holidays &mdash; and now her education was finished,  and Mr. Sheldon could find no excuse for leaving her at school any longer, so  her departure had been finally agreed upon.</p>
<p>To most damsels of twenty-one this would have been  a subject for rejoicing; but it was not so with Charlotte. She did not like her  stepfather; and her mother, though very affectionate and gentle, was a person  whose society was apt to become wearisome any time after the first half-hour of  social intercourse. At Hyde Lodge Charlotte had a great deal more of Lingard  and condensed and expurgated Gibbon than was quite agreeable; she had to get up  at a preternatural hour in the morning and to devote herself to &ldquo;studies of  velocity,&rdquo; whose monotony became wearing as the drip, drip, drip of water on  the skull of the tortured criminal. She was very tired of all the Hyde-Lodge  lessons and accomplishments, the irregular French verbs &mdash; the &ldquo;braires&rdquo; and  &ldquo;traires&rdquo; which were so difficult to remember, and which nobody ever could want  to use in polite conversation; the ruined castles and dilapidated windmills,  the perpetual stumpy pieces of fallen timber and jagged posts, executed with a  BBB pencil; the chalky expanse of sky, with that inevitable flight of crows  scudding across it: &mdash; why must there be always crows scudding across a  drawing-master&rsquo;s sky, and why so many jagged posts in a drawing-master&rsquo;s ideal  of rural beauty? Charlotte was inexpressibly weary of all the stereotyped  studies; but she liked Hyde Lodge better than the gothic villa. She liked the  friendly schoolfellows with their loud talk and boisterous manners, the girls  who called her &ldquo;Halliday,&rdquo; and who were always borrowing her reels of  crochet-cotton and her pencils, her collars and pocket-handkerchiefs. She liked  the free-and-easy schoolgirl talk better than her mother&rsquo;s tame discourse; she  preferred the homely litter of the spacious schoolroom to the prim splendours  of Georgy&rsquo;s state chambers; and the cool lawn and shrubberies of Hyde Lodge  were a hundred-fold more pleasant to her than the stiff little parterre at  Bayswater, wherein scarlet geraniums and calceolarias flourished with an  excruciating luxuriance of growth and an aggravating brilliancy of colour. She  liked any place better than the hearth by which Philip Sheldon brooded with a  dark thoughtful face, and a mind absorbed by the mysteries and complications of  the Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>On this bright June afternoon other girls were  chattering gaily about the fun of the breaking-up ball and the coming delights  of the holidays, but Charlotte sighed when they reminded her that the end of  her last half was close at hand.</p>
<p>She sat under a group of trees on the lawn, with a  crochet antimacassar lying in her lap, and with her friend and favourite, Diana  Paget, sitting by her side.</p>
<p>Hyde Lodge was that very establishment over which  Priscilla Paget had reigned supreme for the last seventeen years of her life,  and among all the pupils in a school of some forty or fifty girls, Diana was  the one whom Charlotte Halliday had chosen for her dearest companion and  confidante, clinging to her with a constancy not to be shaken by ill-fortune or  absence. The girl knew very well that Diana Paget was a poor relation and  dependant; that her bills had never been paid; that all those incalculable and  mysterious &ldquo;extras,&rdquo; which are the martyrdom of parents and the delight of  schoolmistresses, were a dead letter so far as Diana was concerned. She knew  that &ldquo;poor Di&rdquo; had been taken home suddenly one day, not in compliance with any  behest of her father&rsquo;s, but for the simple reason that her kinswoman&rsquo;s patience  had been worn out by the Captain&rsquo;s dishonesty. It is doubtful whether Priscilla  Paget had ever communicated these facts in any set phrase, but in a  boarding-school such things make themselves known, and the girls had discussed  the delinquencies of that dreadful creature, Captain Paget, very freely in the  security of their dormitories.</p>
<p>Charlotte knew that her dearest friend was not a  person whom it was advantageous to know. She had seen Diana depart  ignominiously, and return mysteriously after an absence of some years, very  shabby, very poor, very sombre and melancholy, and with no inclination to talk  of those years of absence. Miss Halliday had known all this, and had asked no  questions. She took the returned wanderer to her heart, and cherished her with  an affection which was far beyond the average measure of sisterly love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I should never see you again, dear,&rdquo; she  cried when she and Diana had retired to a corner of the schoolroom to talk  confidentially on the morning of Miss Paget&rsquo;s return; &ldquo;and I missed you so  cruelly. Other girls are very nice and very kind to me. There is a new girl,  Miss Spencer &mdash; that girl with flaxen hair, standing by the big Canterbury &mdash;  whom I get on with delightfully; but there is no one in the world like you, Di.  And where have you been all this time? With your papa, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Miss Paget gloomily; &ldquo;I have been  with my father. Don&rsquo;t ask me anything about the last three years, Lotta. I have  been utterly wretched and miserable, and I can&rsquo;t bear to talk about my misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you shan&rsquo;t talk of it, darling,&rdquo; cried  Charlotte, pursing up her mouth for a kiss in a manner which might have been  distraction to a masculine mind of average susceptibility. &ldquo;You shan&rsquo;t talk of  anything or think of anything the least, least, least bit unpleasant; and you  shall have my gold pencil-case,&rdquo; added Miss Halliday, wrenching that trinket  suddenly from the ribbon by which it hung at her side. Perhaps there was just  the least touch of Georgy&rsquo;s childishness in this impulsive habit of giving away  all her small possessions, for which Lotta was distinguished. &ldquo;Yes, you must,  dear,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Mamma gave it me last half; but I don&rsquo;t want it; I don&rsquo;t  like it; in point of fact, I have had it so long that I positively loathe it.  And I know it&rsquo;s a poor trumpery thing, though mamma gave two guineas for it;  but you know she is always imposed upon in shops. Do, do, do take it, darling,  just to oblige me. And now, tell me, dear, &mdash; you&rsquo;re going to stop here for ever  and ever, now you&rsquo;ve come back&rdquo; asked Charlotte, after having thrust the gold  pencil-case into Diana&rsquo;s unwilling hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about for ever and ever, dear,&rdquo; Miss  Paget replied presently; &ldquo;but I daresay I shall stay here till I&rsquo;m tired of the  place and everybody about it. You won&rsquo;t be here very long, you know, Lotta; for  you&rsquo;ll be twenty next birthday, and I suppose you&rsquo;ll be leaving school before  you&rsquo;re twenty-one. Most of the girls leave at eighteen or nineteen at latest;  and you&rsquo;ve been here so long, and are so much farther advanced than others are.  I am not going to be a pupil again &mdash; that&rsquo;s out of the question; for I&rsquo;m just  twenty-two, as you know. But Priscilla has been good enough to let me stay as a  kind of second teacher for the little ones. It will be dull work going through  the stupid abridgments of history and geography, and the scrappy bits of botany  and conchology, with those incorrigible little ones; but of course I am very  grateful to my cousin for giving me a home under any conditions, after papa&rsquo;s  dishonourable conduct. If it were not for her, Lotta, I should have no home.  What a happy girl you are, to have a respectable man for your father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte&rsquo;s brow darkened a little as her friend  said this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not my own father, you know,&rdquo; she said  gravely, &ldquo;and I should be a great deal happier if mamma and I were alone in the  world. We could live in some dear little cottage on wide open downs near the  sea, and I could have a linsey habit, and a pony, and ride about all day, and  read and play to mamma at night. Of course Mr. Sheldon is very respectable, and  I daresay it&rsquo;s very wicked of me; but O, Diana, I think I should like him  better if he were not <em>quite</em> so  respectable. I saw your papa once when he came to call, and I thought him nicer  than my stepfather. But then I&rsquo;m such a frivolous creature, Di, and am always  thinking what I ought not to think.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Nearly a year had passed since Diana&rsquo;s return, and  the girl&rsquo;s life had been very monotonous during that time. She had stuck  bravely to the abridgments and the juvenile scraps of &mdash; ologies, and had been  altogether a model of propriety, sewing on such a number of strings and buttons  during the period as can only be compassed by the maternal mind. Her existence  had been by no means as joyless or desolate as such an existence is generally  represented by the writer of fiction. There was plenty of life and bustle in  the big prosperous boarding-school, if there was not much variety. There were  small scandals and small intrigues; departures and arrivals; wonderful hampers  of cake and wine to be divided among the elect of a fashionable dormitory &mdash; for  there is as wide a difference between the tone and status of the bedrooms in a  ladies&rsquo;-school as between the squares of Berkeley and Bedford. There were breaking-up  parties, and the free-and-easy idleness of the holidays, when a few  dark-complexioned girls from the colonies, a yellow-haired damsel from the  remote north of Scotland, and Miss Diana Paget, were wont to cluster round the  fire in the smaller of the schoolrooms to tell ghost-stories or talk scandal in  the gloaming.</p>
<p>It was a life which, taken with all its small  hardships and petty annoyances, should have been as the life of Paradise  compared to that which Diana had led with her father and Mr. Hawkehurst.  Whether the girl fully appreciated the change from the Bohemianism of her late  existence to the respectability of Hyde Lodge was a question which no one had  asked of her. She had fits of despondency now and then, even in the midst of  her duties, and was apt to fall into a sombre reverie over one of the  abridgments, whereby she was neglectful of her pupils&rsquo; aspirates, and allowed  Henry the Second to be made the poorer by the loss of an H, or Heliogabalus to  be described by a name which that individual himself would have failed to  recognise.</p>
<p>There were times when, in the midst of that shrill  Babel, the schoolroom, Diana Paget heard the summer winds sighing in the  pine-woods above For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne, and fancied herself standing once more in that  classic temple on whose plastered wall Valentine had once cut her initials with  his penknife in a fantastical monogram, surmounted by a death&rsquo;s-head and  encircled by a serpent. She thought of that familiar companion very often, in  spite of her juvenile pupils and the sewing-on of tapes and buttons. He had  seemed to her a perpetual enigma and mystery when she was with him; and now  that she was far away from him, he was more than ever an inscrutable creature.  Was he altogether vile, she wondered, or was there some redeeming virtue in his  nature? He had taken trouble to secure her escape from shame and disgrace, and  in doing this he surely had performed a good action; but was it not just  possible that he had taken this opportunity of getting rid of her because her  presence was alike wearisome and inconvenient? She thought very bitterly of her  fellow Bohemian when this view of his conduct presented itself to her; how  heartlessly he had shuffled her off, &mdash; how cruelly he had sent her out into the  hard pitiless world, to find a shelter as best she might!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would have become of me if Priscilla had  refused to take me in?&rdquo; she asked herself. &ldquo;I wonder whether Mr. Hawkehurst  ever considered that.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>More than one letter had come to Diana from her old  companion since her flight from the little Belgian watering-place. The first  letter told her that her father had &ldquo;tided over <em>that</em> business, and was in better feather than before the burst-up  at the H&ocirc;tel d&rsquo;Orange.&rdquo; The letter was dated from Paris, but gave no  information as to the present arrangements or future plans of the writer and  his companion. Another letter, dated from the same place, but not from the same  address, came to her six months afterwards, and anon another; and it was such a  wonderful thing for Captain Paget to inhabit the same city for twelve months  together, that Diana began to cherish faint hopes of some amendment in the  scheme of her father&rsquo;s life and of Valentine&rsquo;s, since any improvement in her  father&rsquo;s position would involve an improvement in that of his <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em>.</p>
<p>Miss Paget&rsquo;s regard for her father was by no means  an absorbing affection. The Captain had never cared to conceal his indifference  for his only child, or pretended to think her anything but a nuisance and an  encumbrance &mdash; a superfluous piece of luggage more difficult to dispose of than  any other luggage, and altogether a stumbling-block in the stony path of a man  who has to live by his wits. So perhaps it is scarcely strange that Diana did  not think of her absent father with any passionate tenderness or sad yearning  love. She thought of him very often; but her thoughts of him were painful and  bitter. She thought still more often of his companion; and her thoughts of him  were even more bitter.</p>
<p>The experiences of Diana Paget are not the  experiences which make a pure or perfect woman. There are trials which chasten  the heart and elevate the mind; but it is doubtful whether it can be for the  welfare of any helpless, childish creature to be familiar with falsehood and  chicanery, with debt and dishonour, from the earliest awakening of the  intellect; to feel, from the age of six or seven, all the shame of a creature  who is always eating food that will not be paid for, and lying on a bed out of  which she may be turned at any moment with shrill reproaches and upbraidings;  to hear her father abused and vilified by vulgar gossips over a tea-table, and  to be reminded every day and every hour that she is an unprofitable  encumbrance, a consumer of the bread of other people&rsquo;s children, an intruder in  the household of poverty, a child whose heritage is shame and dishonour. These  things had hardened the heart of Captain Paget&rsquo;s daughter. There had been no  counteracting influence &mdash; no fond, foolish loving creature near at hand to save  the girl from that perdition into which the child or woman who has never known  what it is to be loved is apt to fall. For thirteen years of Diana&rsquo;s life all  love and tenderness, endearing words, caressing touches, fond admiring looks,  had been utterly unknown to her. To sit in a room with a father who was busy  writing letters, and who was wont to knit his brows peevishly if she stirred,  or to mutter an oath if she spoke; to be sent to a pawnbroker&rsquo;s in the gloaming  with her father&rsquo;s watch, and to be scolded and sworn at on her return if the money-lender  had advanced a less sum than was expected on that security &mdash; do not compose the  most delightful or improving experiences of a home life. But Diana could  remember little of a more pleasant character respecting her existence during  those brief periods when she was flung back upon her father&rsquo;s hands, and while  that gentleman was casting about for some new victim on whom to plant her.</p>
<p>At Hyde Lodge, for the first time, the girl knew  what it was to be loved. Bright, impulsive Charlotte Halliday took a fancy to  her, as the schoolgirl phrase goes, and clung to her with a fond confiding  affection. It may be that the softening influence came too late, or that there  was some touch of natural hardness and bitterness in Diana&rsquo;s mind; for it is  certain that Charlotte&rsquo;s affection did not soften the girl&rsquo;s heart or lessen  her bitter consciousness of the wide difference between her own fortunes and  those of the happier daughters whose fathers paid their debts. The very  contrast between Charlotte&rsquo;s position and her own may have counteracted the  good influence. It was very easy for Charlotte to be generous and amiable. <em>She</em> had never been hounded from pillar  to post by shrewish matrons who had no words too bitter for their unprofitable  charge. <em>She</em> had never known what it  was to rise up in the morning uncertain where she should lie down at night, or  whether there would be any shelter at all for her hapless head; for who could  tell that her father would be found at the lodging where he had last been heard  of, and how should she obtain even workhouse hospitality, whose original parish  was unknown to herself or her protector? To Charlotte these shameful  experiences would have been as incomprehensible as the most abstruse theories  of a metaphysician. Was it any wonder, then, if Charlotte was bright and  womanly, and fond and tender &mdash; Charlotte, who had never been humiliated by the  shabbiness of her clothes, and to whom the daily promenade had never been a  shame and a degradation by reason of obvious decay in the heels of her boots?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your father would dress you decently, and  supply you with proper boots, I could almost bring myself to keep you for  nothing,&rdquo; Priscilla had said to her reprobate kinsman&rsquo;s daughter; &ldquo;but the more  one does for that man the less he will do himself; so the long and the short of  it is, that you will have to go back to him, for I cannot consent to have such  an expensive establishment as mine degraded by the shabbiness of a relation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana had been obliged to listen to such speeches  as this very often during her first residence at Hyde Lodge, and then, perhaps,  within a few minutes after Priscilla&rsquo;s lecture was concluded, Charlotte  Halliday would bound into the room, looking as fresh and bright as the morning,  and dressed in silk that rustled with newness and richness. Keenly as Diana  felt the difference between her friend&rsquo;s fortune and her own, she did  nevertheless in some manner return Charlotte&rsquo;s affection. Her character was not  to be altered all at once by this new atmosphere of love and tenderness; but  she loved her generous friend and companion after her own fitful fashion, and  defended her with passionate indignation if any other girl dared to hint the  faintest disparagement of her graces or her virtues. She envied and loved her  at the same time. She would accept Charlotte&rsquo;s affection one day with  unconcealed pleasure, and revolt against it on the next day as a species of  patronage which stung her proud heart to the quick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your pity for people who ask you for it,&rdquo; she  had exclaimed once to poor bewildered Charlotte; &ldquo;I am tired of being consoled  and petted. Go and talk to your prosperous friends, Miss Halliday; I am sick to  death of hearing about your new frocks, and your holidays, and the presents  your mamma is always bringing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then when Charlotte looked at her friend with a  sad perplexed face, Diana relented, and declared that she was a wicked  discontented creature, unworthy of either pity or affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had so much misery in my life, that I am  very often inclined to quarrel with happy people without rhyme or reason, or  only because they are happy,&rdquo; she said in explanation of her impatient temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who knows what happiness may be waiting for  you in the future, Di?&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Halliday. &ldquo;You will marry some rich man  by-and-by, and forget that you ever knew what poverty was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where the rich man is to come from who  will marry Captain Paget&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo; Diana asked contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind  where he comes from; he will come, depend upon it. The handsome young prince  with the palace by the Lake of Como will come to fall in love with my beautiful  Diana, and then she will go and live at Como; and desert her faithful  Charlotte, and live happy ever afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, Lotta,&rdquo; cried Miss Paget.  &ldquo;You know what kind of fate lies before me as well as I do. I looked at myself  this morning, as I was plaiting my hair before the glass &mdash; you know how seldom  one gets a turn at the glass in the blue room &mdash; and I saw a dark, ugly,  evil-minded-looking creature, whose face frightened me. I have been getting  wicked and ugly ever since I was a child. An aquiline nose and black eyes will  not make a woman a beauty; she wants happiness, and hope, and love, and all  manner of things that I have never known, before she can be pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen a beautiful woman sweeping a  crossing,&rdquo; said Charlotte doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what sort of beauty was it? &mdash; a beauty  that made you shudder. Don&rsquo;t talk about these things, Charlotte; you only  encourage me to be bitter and discontented. I daresay I ought to be very happy,  when I remember that I have dinner every day, and shoes and stockings, and a  bed to lie down upon at night; and I am happier, now that I work for my living,  than I was in the old time, when my cousin was always grumbling about her  unpaid bills. But my life is very dreary and empty; and when I look forward to  the future, it seems like looking out upon some level plain that leads nowhere,  but across which I must tramp on for ever and ever, until I drop down and die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was something in this fashion that Miss Paget  talked, as she sat in the garden with Charlotte Halliday at the close of the  half-year. She was going to lose her faithful friend &mdash; the girl who, so much  richer, and happier, and more amiable than herself, had yet clung to her so  fondly; she was going to lose this tender companion, and she was more sorry for  the loss than she cared to express.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come and see us very often,&rdquo; Charlotte  said for the hundredth time; &ldquo;mamma will be so glad to have you, for my sake;  and my stepfather never interferes with our arrangements. O, Di, how I wish you  would come and live with us altogether! Would you come, if I could manage to  arrange it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I come? What Quixotic nonsense you talk,  Lotta!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, dear; you could come as a sort of  companion for me, or a sort of companion for mamma. What does it matter how you  come, if I can only have you? My life will be so dreary in that dreadful  new-looking house, unless I have a companion I love. Will you come, Di? &mdash; only  tell me you will come! I am sure Mr. Sheldon would not refuse, if I asked him  to let you live with us. Will you come, dear? &mdash; yes or no. You would be glad to  come, if you loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I do love you, Lotta, with all my heart,&rdquo;  answered Miss Paget, with unusual fervour; &ldquo;but then the whole of my heart is  not much. As to coming to live with you, of course it would be a hundred  thousand times pleasanter than the life I lead here; but it is not to be  supposed that Mr. Sheldon will consent to have a stranger in his house just  because his impulsive stepdaughter chooses to take a fancy to a schoolfellow  who isn&rsquo;t worthy of half her affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me be the judge of that. As to my stepfather,  I am almost sure of his consent. You don&rsquo;t know how indulgent he is to me;  which shows what a wicked creature I must be not to like him. You shall come to  us, Diana, and be my sister; and we will play and sing our pet duets together,  and be as happy as two birds in a cage, or a good deal happier &mdash; for I never  could quite understand the ecstatic delight of perpetual hempseed and an  occasional peck at a dirty lump of sugar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this there came all the bustle of packing and  preparation for departure, and a kind of saturnalia prevailed at Hyde Lodge &mdash; a  saturnalia which terminated with the breaking-up ball: and who among the crowd  of fair young dancers so bright as Charlotte Halliday, dressed in the  schoolgirl&rsquo;s festal robes of cloud-like muslin, and with her white throat set  off by a black ribbon and a gold locket?</p>
<p>Diana sat in a corner of the schoolroom towards the  close of the evening, very weary of her share in the festival, and watched her  friend, half in sadness, half in envy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps if I were like her, <em>he</em> would love me,&rdquo; she thought.</p>

  George Sheldon&rsquo;s Prospects</h2>
<p>For George Sheldon the passing years had brought  very little improvement of fortune. He occupied his old dingy chambers in  Gray&rsquo;s Inn, which had grown more dingy under the hand of Time; and he was wont  to sit in his second-floor window on sultry summer Sundays, smoking his  solitary cigar, and listening to the cawing of the rooks in the gardens beneath  him, mingled with the voices of rebellious children, and shrill mothers  threatening to &ldquo;do for them,&rdquo; or to &ldquo;flay them alive,&rdquo; in Somebody&rsquo;s Rents  below. The lawyer used to be quite meditative on those Sunday afternoons, and  would wonder what sort of a fellow Lord Bacon was, and how he contrived to get  into a mess about taking bribes, when so many other fellows had done it quietly  enough before the Lord of Verulam&rsquo;s day, and even yet more quietly since &mdash;  agreeably instigated thereto by the casuistry of Escobar.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s prospects were by no means promising.  From afar off he beheld his brother&rsquo;s star shining steadily in the commercial  firmament; but, except for an occasional dinner, he was very little the better  for the stockbroker&rsquo;s existence. He had reminded his brother very often, and  very persistently, of that vague promise which the dentist had made in the hour  of his adversity &mdash; the promise to help his brother if ever he did &ldquo;drop into a  good thing.&rdquo; But as it is difficult to prevent a man who is disposed to shuffle  from shuffling out of the closest agreement that was ever made between Jones of  the one part, and Smith of the other part, duly signed, and witnessed, and  stamped with the sixpenny seal of infallibility, so is it still more difficult  to obtain the performance of loosely-worded promises, uttered in the  confidential intercourse of kinsmen.</p>
<p>In the first year of his married life Philip  Sheldon gave his brother a hundred pounds for the carrying out of some grand  scheme which the lawyer was then engaged in, and which, if successful, would  secure for him a much larger fortune than Georgy&rsquo;s thousands. Unhappily the  grand scheme was a failure; and the hundred pounds being gone, George applied  again to his brother, reminding him once more of that promise made in  Bloomsbury. But on this occasion Mr. Sheldon plainly told his kinsman that he  could do no more for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must fight your own battle, George,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;as I have fought mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Philip,&rdquo; said the younger brother; &ldquo;I  would rather fight it any other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the two men looked at each other, as they  were in the habit of doing sometimes, with a singularly intent gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very close-fisted with Tom Halliday&rsquo;s  money,&rdquo; George said presently. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;d asked poor old Tom himself, I&rsquo;m sure he  wouldn&rsquo;t have refused to lend me two or three hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s a pity you didn&rsquo;t ask him,&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon  answered, with supreme coolness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have done so fast enough, if I had  thought he was going to die so suddenly. It was a bad day for me, and for him  too, when he came to Fitzgeorge-street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sheldon  sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can pretty well guess my meaning, I should  think,&rdquo; George answered in a sulky tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t; and what&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t mean to try.  I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Master George; you&rsquo;ve been treating me to a good many  hints and innuendoes lately; and you must know very little of me if you don&rsquo;t  know that I&rsquo;m the last kind of man to stand that sort of thing from you, or  from any one else. You have tried to take the tone of a man who has some kind  of hold upon another. You had better understand at once that such a tone won&rsquo;t  answer with me. If you had any hold upon me, or any power over me, you&rsquo;d be  quick enough to use it; and you ought to be aware that I know that, and can see  to the bottom of such a shallow little game as yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon the younger looked at his brother with  an expression of surprise that was not entirely unmingled with admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you <em>are</em> a cool hand, Phil!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Here the conversation ended. The two brothers were  very good friends after this, and George presented himself at the gothic villa  whenever he received an invitation to dine there. The dinners were good, and  the men who ate them were men of solidity and standing in the commercial world;  and George was very glad to eat good dinners, and to meet eligible men; but he  never again asked his brother for the loan of odd hundreds.</p>
<p>He grubbed on, as best he might, in the dingy  Gray&rsquo;s-Inn chambers. He had a little business &mdash; business which lay chiefly  amongst men who wanted to borrow money, or whose halting footsteps required  guidance through the quagmire of the Bankruptcy Court. He just contrived to  keep his head above water, and his name in the Law-list, by means of such  business; but the great scheme of his life remained as yet unripened, an  undeveloped shadow to which he had in vain attempted to give a substance.</p>
<p>The leading idea of George Sheldon&rsquo;s life was the  idea that there were great fortunes in the world waiting for claimants; and  that a share of some such fortune was to be obtained by any man who had the  talent to dig it out of the obscurity in which it was hidden. He was a student  of old county histories, and a searcher of old newspapers; and his studies in  that line had made him familiar with many strange stories &mdash; stories of  field-labourers called away from the plough to be told they were the rightful owners  of forty thousand a year; stories of old white-haired men starving to death in  miserable garrets about Bethnal-green or Spitalfields, who could have claimed  lands and riches immeasurable, had they known how to claim them; stories of  half-crazy old women, who had wandered about the world with reticules of  discoloured papers clamorously asserting their rights and wrongs unheeded and  unbelieved, until they encountered sharp-witted lawyers who took up their  claims, and carried them triumphantly into the ownership of illimitable wealth.</p>
<p>George Sheldon had read of these things until it  had seemed to him that there must be some such chance for any man who would  have patience to watch and wait for it. He had taken up several cases, and had  fitted link after link together with extreme labour, and had hunted in parish  registers until the cold mouldy atmosphere of vestries was as familiar to him  as the air of Gray&rsquo;s Inn. But the cases had all broken down at more or less  advanced stages; and after infinite patience and trouble, a good deal of money  spent upon travelling and small fees to all manner of small people, and an  incalculable number of hours wasted in listening to the rambling discourse of  parish-clerks and oldest inhabitants, Mr. Sheldon had been compelled to abandon  his hopes time after time, until a man with less firmly rooted ideas would have  given up the hunting of registers and grubbing up of genealogies as a delusion  and a snare.</p>
<p>George Sheldon&rsquo;s ideas were very firmly rooted, and  he stuck to them with that dogged persistency which so often achieves great  ends, that it seems a kind of genius. He saw his brother&rsquo;s success, and  contemplated the grandeurs of the gothic villa in a cynical rather than an  envious spirit. How long would it all last? How long would the stockbroker  float triumphantly onward upon that wonderful tide which is constituted by the  rise and fall of the money-market?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sort of thing is all very well while a man  keeps his head cool and clear,&rdquo; thought George; &ldquo;but somehow or other men  always seem to lose their heads on the Stock Exchange before they have done  with it, and I daresay my wise brother will drop into a nice mess sooner or  later. Setting aside all other considerations, I think I would rather have my  chances than his; for I speculate very little more than my time and trouble,  and I stand in to win a bigger sum than he will ever get in his line, let  stocks rise and fall as they may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During that summer in which Miss Halliday bade  farewell to Hyde Lodge and her school-days, George Sheldon was occupied with  the early steps in a search which he hoped would end in the discovery of a  prize rich enough to reward him for all his wasted time and labour.</p>
<p>Very early in the previous year there had appeared  the following brief notice in the <em>Observer</em>:  &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rev. John Haygarth, late vicar of Tilford  Haven, Kent, died lately, without a will, or relation to claim his property,  100,000 pounds. The Crown therefore claimed it. And last court-day the  Prerogative Court of Canterbury decreed letters of Administration to Mr. Paul,  the nominee of the Crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some months after this an advertisement had been  inserted in the <em>Times</em> newspaper to  the following effect: &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;NEXT OF KIN. &mdash; If the relatives or next of kin of  the Rev. John Haygarth, late vicar of Tilford Haven, in the county of Kent,  clerk, deceased, who has left property of the value of one hundred thousand  pounds, will apply, either personally or by letter, to Stephen Paul, Esq.,  solicitor for the affairs of Her Majesty&rsquo;s Treasury, at the Treasury Chambers,  Whitehall, London, they may hear of something to their advantage. The late Rev.  John Haygarth is supposed to have been the son of Matthew Haygarth, late of the  parish of St. Judith, Ullerton, and Rebecca his wife, formerly Rebecca Caulfield,  spinster, late of the same parish; both long since deceased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon the strength of this advertisement George  Sheldon began his search. His theory was that there always existed an  heir-at-law somewhere, if people would only have the patience to hunt him or  her out; and he attributed his past failures rather to a want of endurance on  his own part than to the breaking down of his pet theory.</p>
<p>On this occasion he began his work with more than  usual determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the biggest chance I&rsquo;ve ever had,&rdquo; he said  to himself, &ldquo;and I should be something worse than a fool if I let it slip  through my fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work was very dry and dreary, involving  interminable hunting of registers, and questioning of oldest inhabitants. And  the oldest inhabitants were so stupid, and the records of the registers so  bewildering. One after another Mr. Sheldon set himself to examine the lines of  the intestate&rsquo;s kindred and ancestors; his father&rsquo;s only sister, his  grandfather&rsquo;s brothers and sisters, and even to the brothers and sisters of his  great-grandfather. At that point the Haygarth family melted away into the  impenetrable darkness of the past. They were no high and haughty race of  soldiers and scholars, churchmen and lawyers, or the tracing of them would have  been a much easier matter. Burke would have told of them. There would have been  old country houses filled with portraits, and garrulous old housekeepers  learned in the traditions of the past. There would have been mouldering tombs  and tarnished brasses in quiet country churches, with descriptive epitaphs, and  many escutcheons. There would have been crumbling parchments recording the  prowess of Sir Reginald, knight, or the learning of Sir Rupert, counsellor and  judge. The Haygarths were a race of provincial tradesmen, and had left no  better record of their jog-trot journey through this world than the registry of  births, marriages, and deaths in obscure churches, or an occasional entry in  the fly-leaf of a family Bible.</p>
<p>At present Mr. Sheldon was only at the beginning of  his work. The father and grandfather and uncle and great-uncles, the  great-grandfather and great-great-uncles, with all their progenies, lay before  him in a maze of entanglement which it would be his business to unravel. And as  he was obliged to keep his limited legal connection together while he devoted  himself to this task, the work promised to extend over months, or indeed years;  and in the meanwhile there was always the fear that some one else, as  quick-witted and indefatigable as himself, would take up the same tangled skein  and succeed in the unravelment of it. Looking this fact full in the face, Mr.  Sheldon decided that he must have an able and reliable coadjutor; but to find  such a coadjutor, to find a man who would help him, on the chance of success, and  not claim too large a share of the prize if success came, was more than the  speculative attorney could hope. In the meantime his work progressed very  slowly; and he was tormented by perpetual terror of that other sharp  practitioner who might be following up the same clue, and whose agents might  watch him in and out of parish churches, and listen at street-corners when he  was hunting an oldest inhabitant.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13<br>
  Diana Finds A New Home</h2>
<p>The holidays at Hyde Lodge brought at least repose  for Diana Paget. The little ones had gone home, with the exception of two or  three young colonists, and even they had perpetual liberty from lessons; so  Diana had nothing to do but sit in the shady garden, reading or thinking, in  the drowsy summer afternoons. Priscilla Paget had departed with the chief of  the teachers for a seaside holiday; other governesses had gone to their homes;  and but for the presence of an elderly Frenchwoman, who slept through one half  of the day, and wrote letters to her kindred during the other half, Diana would  have been the only responsible person in the deserted habitation.</p>
<p>She did not complain of her loneliness, or envy the  delights of those who had departed. She was very glad to be quite alone, free  to think her own thoughts, free to brood over those unforgotten years in which  she had wandered over the face of the earth with her father and Valentine  Hawkehurst. The few elder girls remaining at the Lodge thought Miss Paget  unsociable because she preferred a lonely corner in the gardens and some battered  old book of namby-pamby stories to the delights of their society, and  criticised her very severely as they walked listlessly to and fro upon the lawn  with big garden-hats, and arms entwined about each other&rsquo;s waists.</p>
<p>Alas for Diana, the battered book was only an  excuse for solitude, and for a morbid indulgence in her own sad thoughts! She  had lived the life of unblemished respectability for a year, and looking back  now at the Bohemian wanderings, she regretted those days of humiliation and  misery, and sighed for the rare delights of that disreputable past! Yes, she  had revolted against the degraded existence; and now she was sorry for having  lost its uncertain pleasures, its fitful glimpses of sunshine. Was that true  which Valentine had said, that no man can eat beef and mutton every day of his  life; that it is better to be unutterly miserable one day and uproariously  happy the next, than to tread one level path of dull content? Miss Paget began  to think that there had been some reason in her old comrade&rsquo;s philosophy; for  she found the level path very dreary. She let her thoughts wander whither they  would in this quiet holiday idleness, and they went back to the years which she  had spent with her father. She thought of winter evenings in London when Valentine  had taken her the round of the theatres, and they had sat together in stifling  upper boxes, &mdash; she pleased, he critical, and with so much to say to each other  in the pauses of the performance. How kind he had been to her; how good, how  brotherly! And then the pleasant walk home, through crowded noisy  thoroughfares, and anon by long lines of quiet streets, in which they used to  look up at the lighted windows of houses where parties were being given, and  sometimes stop to listen to the music and watch the figures of the dancers  flitting across the blinds. She thought of the journeys she had travelled with  her father and Valentine by land and sea; the lonely moonlight watches on the  decks of steamers; the long chill nights in railway-carriages under the feeble  glimmer of an oil-lamp, and how she and Valentine had beguiled the tedious  hours with wild purposeless talk while Captain Paget slept. She remembered the  strange cities which she and her father&rsquo;s <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em> had looked at side by side; he with a calm listlessness of manner, which might  either be real or assumed, but which never varied; she with an inward tremor of  excitement and surprise. They had been very happy together, this lonely  unprotected girl and the reckless adventurer. If his manner to her had been  fitful, it had been sometimes dangerously, fatally kind. She looked back now,  and remembered the days which she had spent with him, and knew that all the  pleasures possible in a prosperous and successful life could never bring for  her such delight as she had known in the midst of her wanderings; though shame  and danger lurked at every corner, and poverty, disguised in that tawdry  masquerade habit in which the swindler dresses it, accompanied her wherever she  went.</p>
<p>She had been happy with him because she had loved  him. That close companionship, sisterly and brotherly though it had seemed, had  been fatal for the lonely and friendless daughter of Horatio Paget. In her  desolation she had clung to the one creature who was kind to her, who did not  advertise his disdain for herself and her sex, or openly avow that she was a  nuisance and an encumbrance. Every slight put upon her by her father had  strengthened the chain that bound her to Valentine Hawkehurst; and as the  friendship between them grew closer day by day, until all her thoughts and  fancies took their colour from his, it seemed a matter of course that he should  love her, and she never doubted his feelings or questioned her own. There had  been much in his conduct to justify her belief that she was beloved; so this  inexperienced, untutored girl may surely be forgiven if she rested her faith in  that fancied affection, and looked forward to some shadowy future in which she  and Valentine would be man and wife, all in all to each other, free from the  trammels of Captain Paget&rsquo;s elaborate schemes, and living honestly, somehow or  other, by means of literature, or music, or pen-and-ink caricatures, or some of  those liberal arts which have always been dear to the children of Bohemia. They  would have lodgings in some street near the Thames, and go to a theatre or a  concert every evening, and spend long summer days in suburban parks or on  suburban commons, he lying on the grass smoking, she talking to him or reading  to him, as his fancy might dictate. Before her twentieth birthday, the proudest  woman is apt to regard the man she loves as a grand and superior creature; and  there had been a certain amount of reverential awe mingled with Diana&rsquo;s regard  for Mr. Hawkehurst, scapegrace and adventurer though he was.</p>
<p>Little by little that bright girlish dream had  faded away. Fancy&rsquo;s enchanted palace had been shattered into a heap of  shapeless ruin by those accidental scraps of hard worldly wisdom with which  Valentine had pelted the fairy fabric. He a man to love, or to marry for love!  Why, he talked like some hardened world-weary sinner who had done with every  human emotion. The girl shuddered as she heard him. She had loved him, and  believed in his love. She had fancied a tender meaning in the voice which  softened when it spoke to her, a pensive earnestness in the dark eyes which  looked at her; but just when the voice had seemed softest and sweetest, the  pensive eyes most eloquently earnest, the adventurer&rsquo;s manner had changed all  at once, and for ever. He had grown hard, and cold, and indifferent. He had  scarcely tried to conceal the fact that the girl&rsquo;s companionship bored and  wearied him. He had yawned in her face, and had abandoned himself to moody  abstraction when accident obliged him to be alone with her. Miss Paget&rsquo;s pride  had been equal to the occasion. Mary Anne Kepp would have dissolved into tears  at the first unkind word from the lips of her beloved; but Mary Anne Kepp&rsquo;s  daughter, with the blood of the Cromie Pagets in her veins, was quite a  different person. She returned Mr. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s indifference with corresponding  disregard. If his manner was cold as a bleak autumn, hers was icy as a severe  winter; only now and then, when she was very tired of her joyless existence,  her untutored womanhood asserted itself, and she betrayed the real state of her  feelings &mdash; betrayed herself as she had done on her last night at For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne,  when she and Valentine had looked down at the lighted windows shining dimly  through the purple of the summer night. She looked back at the past now in the  quiet of the school-garden, and tried to remember how miserable she had been,  what agonies of despair she had suffered, how brief had been her delights, how  bitter her disappointments. She tried to remember what tortures she had  suffered from that wasted passion, that useless devotion. She tried to rejoice  in the consciousness of the peace and respectability of her present life; but  she could not. That passionate yearning for the past possessed her so strongly.  She could remember nothing except that she had been with him. She had seen his  face, she had heard his voice; and now how long and weary the time might be  before she could again see that one beloved face or hear the dear familiar  voice! The brightest hope she had in these midsummer holidays was the hope of a  letter from him; and even that might be the prelude of disappointment. She  wrestled with herself, and tried to exorcise those ghosts of memory which  haunted her by day and wove themselves into her dreams by night; but they were  not to be laid at rest. She hated her folly; but her folly was stronger than  herself.</p>
<p>For three weeks Diana Paget had no companions but  her sorrowful memories &mdash; her haunting shadows; but at the end of that time the  stagnant mill-pond of her life was suddenly ruffled &mdash; the dull course of  existence was disturbed by the arrival of two letters. She found them lying by  her plate upon the breakfast-table one bright July morning; and while she was  yet far away from the table she could see that one of the envelopes bore a foreign  stamp, and was directed by the hand of Valentine Hawkehurst. She seated herself  at the table in a delicious flutter of emotion, and tore open that foreign  envelope, while the French governess poured out the tea, and while the little  group of schoolgirls nudged one another and watched her eager face with  insolent curiosity.</p>
<p>The first letter contained only a few lines.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;MY DEAR DIANA,&rdquo; wrote the young man, &ldquo;your father  has decided on returning to London, where I believe he really intends to make a  respectable start, if he can only get the opening and the help he wants. I know  you will be glad to hear this. I don&rsquo;t exactly say where we shall take up our  quarters; but the Captain will of course come to see you; and if I can chasten  my outward semblance sufficiently to venture within the sacred precincts of a  lady&rsquo;s school, I shall come with him. Direct to the old address, if you write  before the end of the month, and believe me, as always, your friend.&rdquo;  &ldquo;VALENTINE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second letter was in Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s big  bold hand, and was frank, impetuous, and loving as the girl herself.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;MY OWN DEAREST DI, &mdash; It is all arranged,&rdquo; wrote  Miss Halliday, dashing at once into the heart of the subject. &ldquo;I talked mamma  over the very first day after my return, and then there was nothing more to be  done than to talk over Mr. Sheldon. Of course there was just a little  difficulty in that, for he is so awfully practical; and he wanted to know why I  wanted a companion, and what <em>use</em> you  would be in the house; as if the very last thing one required in a companion  was companionship. I&rsquo;m almost afraid to tell you the iniquitous fables I  invented about your extreme usefulness; your genius for millinery, and the  mints of money you would save by making up mamma&rsquo;s flimsy little caps; your  taste for dress-making, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. You <em>are</em> the cleverest creature in the world, you know, Di; for you must  remember how you altered that green silk dress for me when Miss Person had made  me a square-shouldered fright. So, after a great deal of humming, and ha-ing,  and argufication &mdash; <em>is</em> there such a  word as &lsquo;argufication,&rsquo; I wonder? &mdash; my stepfather said that if my heart was set  upon having you, and if I thought you would be useful, you might come to us;  but that he could not afford to give you any salary, and that if you wanted a  new dress now and then, I must buy it for you out of my own allowance; and I  will, darling, if you will only come and be my friend and sister. My life is  dreadfully dull without you. I walk up and down the stiff little gravel paths,  and stare at the geraniums and calceolarias. Mariana might have been dreary in  her moated grange; but I daresay the Lincolnshire flowers grew wild and free,  and she was spared the abomination of gaudy little patches of red and yellow,  and waving ribbons of blue and white, which constitute the glory of modern  gardening. Do come to me, dear. I have no one to talk to, and nothing to do.  Mamma is a dear good affectionate soul; but she and I don&rsquo;t understand each  other. I don&rsquo;t care for her twittering little birds, and she doesn&rsquo;t care for  my whims and fancies. I have read novels until I am tired. I am not allowed to  go out by myself, and mamma can scarcely walk to Kensington-gardens without  sinking under the exertion. We drive out sometimes; but I am sick to death of  crawling slowly up and down by the Serpentine staring at people&rsquo;s bonnets. I  might enjoy it, perhaps, if I had you with me to make fun out of some of the  bonnets. The house is very comfortable; but it always seems to me unpleasantly  like some philanthropic institution in miniature. I long to scratch the walls,  or break the windows; and I begin to understand the feelings of those unhappy  paupers who tear up their clothes: they get utterly tired of their stagnation,  you see, and must do something wicked and rebellious rather than do nothing at  all. You will take pity upon my forlorn state, won&rsquo;t you, Di? I shall come to  Hyde Lodge to-morrow afternoon with mamma, to hear your ulti &mdash; what&rsquo;s its name?  &mdash; and in the meanwhile, and for ever afterwards, believe me to be your devoted  and unchanging LOTTA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana Paget&rsquo;s eyes grew dim as she read this  letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love her very dearly,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;but not one  hundred-fold as much as I ought to love her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she went back to Mr. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s epistle,  and read and re-read its half-dozen lines, wondering when he would come to  London, and whether she would see him when he came. To see him again! The  thought of that possibility seemed like a spot of vivid light, which dazzled  her eyes and made them blind to anything around or beyond it. As for this offer  of a strange home in the household of Mr. Sheldon, it seemed to her a matter of  so very little importance where she went or what became of her, that she was  quite willing to let other people decide her existence. Anything would be  better than the monotony of Hyde Lodge. If Valentine Hawkehurst came to see her  at Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s house, he would be permitted to see her alone, most likely,  and it would be something like the old times; whereas at the Lodge Priscilla Paget  or one of the governesses would undoubtedly be present at any interview between  Diana and her old friend, and the real Valentine would be hidden under the  semblance of a respectable young man, with very little to say for himself.  Perhaps this one thought exercised considerable influence over Miss Paget&rsquo;s  decision. She wanted so much to see Valentine alone, to know whether he had  changed, to see his face at the first moment of meeting, and to discover, if  possible, the solution of that enigma which was the grand mystery of her life &mdash;  that one perpetual question which was always repeating itself in her brain &mdash;  whether he was altogether cold and indifferent, or if there was not some hidden  warmth, some secret tenderness beneath that repelling outward seeming.</p>
<p>In the afternoon Miss Halliday called with Mrs.  Sheldon, and there was a long discussion about Diana Paget&rsquo;s future life.  Georgy abandoned herself as unhesitatingly to the influence of her daughter as  she did to that of her husband, and had been brought to think that it would be  the most delightful thing in the world to have Miss Paget for a useful  companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you really make my caps, dear?&rdquo; she said,  when she had grown at her ease with Diana. &ldquo;Miss Terly in the Bayswater-road  charges me so much for the simplest little lace head-dress; and though Mr.  Sheldon is very good about those sort of things, I know he sometimes thinks my  bills rather high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana was very indifferent about her future, and  the heart must have been very hard which could have resisted Charlotte&rsquo;s tender  pleading; so it was ultimately decided that Miss Paget should write to her  kinswoman to describe the offer that had been made to her of a new home, and to  inquire if her services could be conveniently dispensed with at Hyde Lodge.  After which decision Charlotte embraced her friend with enthusiasm, and  departed, bearing off Mrs. Sheldon to the carriage which awaited them at the  gates of Priscilla Paget&rsquo;s umbrageous domain.</p>
<p>Diana sighed as she went back to the empty  schoolroom. Even Charlotte&rsquo;s affection could not altogether take the sting out  of dependence. To go into a strange house amongst strange people, and to hold a  place in it only on the condition of being perpetually useful and unfailingly  good-tempered and agreeable, is scarcely the pleasantest prospect which this  world can offer to a proud and beautiful woman. Diana remembered her bright  vision of Bohemianism in a lodging near the Strand. It would be very delightful  to ride on sufferance in Mrs. Sheldon&rsquo;s carriage, no doubt; but O, how much  pleasanter it would have been to sit by Valentine Hawkehurst in a hansom cab  spinning along the road to Greenwich or Richmond!</p>
<p>She had promised to despatch her letter to  Priscilla by that afternoon&rsquo;s post, and she kept her promise. The reply came by  return of post, and was very kind. Priscilla advised her by all means to accept  Miss Halliday&rsquo;s offer, which would give her a much better position than that  which she occupied at Hyde Lodge. She would have time to improve herself, no  doubt, Priscilla said, and might be able to hope for something still better in  the course of two or three years; &ldquo;for you must look the world straight in the  face, Diana,&rdquo; wrote the schoolmistress, &ldquo;as I did before I was your age; and  make up your mind to rely upon your own exertions, since you know what your  father is, and how little you have to hope for from him. As you are to have no  salary with the Sheldons, and will no doubt be expected to make a good  appearance, I shall do what I can to help you with your wardrobe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This letter decided the fate of Captain Paget&rsquo;s  daughter. A week after Miss Halliday&rsquo;s visit to Hyde Lodge a hack cab carried  Diana and all her earthly possessions to the Lawn, where Charlotte received her  with open arms, and where she was inducted into a neatly furnished bedchamber  adjoining that of her friend. Mr. Sheldon scrutinised her keenly from under the  shadow of his thick black brows when he came home to dinner. He treated her  with a stiff kind of politeness during the orderly progress of the meal; and  once, when he looked at her, he was surprised to find that she was  contemplating him with an expression of mingled wonder and reverence.</p>
<p>He was the first eminently respectable man whom  Miss Paget had ever encountered in familiar intercourse, and she was regarding  him attentively, as an individual with scientific tastes might regard some  natural curiosity.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  At The Lawn</h2>
<p>Life at the Lawn went by very smoothly for Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s family. Georgy was very happy in the society of a companion who  seemed really to have a natural taste for the manufacture of pretty little  head-dresses from the merest fragments of material in the way of lace and  ribbon. Diana had all that versatile cleverness and capacity for expedients  which is likely to be acquired in a wandering and troubled life. She had  learned more in her three years of discomfort with her father than in all the  undeviating course of the Hyde-Lodge studies; she had improved her French at  one <em>table d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</em>, her German at  another; she had caught some new trick of style in every concert-room, some  fresh combination of costume on every racecourse; and, being really grateful  for Charlotte&rsquo;s disinterested affection, she brought all her accomplishments to  bear to please her friend and her friend&rsquo;s household.</p>
<p>In this she succeeded admirably. Mrs. Sheldon found  her daughter&rsquo;s society much more delightful now that the whole pressure of  Charlotte&rsquo;s intellect and vitality no longer fell entirely upon herself. She  liked to sit lazily in her arm-chair while the two girls chattered at their  work, and she could venture an occasional remark, and fancy that she had a full  share in the conversation. When the summer weather rendered walking a martyrdom  and driving an affliction, she could recline on her favourite sofa reading a  novel, soothed by the feeble twittering of her birds; while Charlotte and Diana  went out together, protected by the smart boy in buttons, who was not  altogether without human failings, and was apt to linger behind his fair  charges, reading the boards before the doors of newsvendors&rsquo; shops, or looking  at the cartoons in <em>Punch</em> exhibited in  the stationers&rsquo; windows.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon made a point of pleasing his  stepdaughter whenever it was possible for him to do so without palpable  inconvenience to himself; and as she was to be gratified by so small a  pecuniary sacrifice as the trifling increase of tradesmen&rsquo;s bills caused by  Miss Paget&rsquo;s residence in the gothic villa, he was the last man in the world to  refuse her that indulgence. His own pursuits were of so absorbing a nature as  to leave little leisure for concern about other people&rsquo;s business. He asked no  questions about his stepdaughter&rsquo;s companion; but he was not the less surprised  to see this beautiful high-bred woman content to sit at his board as an  unsalaried dependent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend Miss Paget looks like a countess,&rdquo; he  said one day to Charlotte. &ldquo;I thought girls generally pitched upon some plain  homely young woman for their pet companion, but you seem to have chosen the  handsomest girl in the school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is very handsome, is she not? I wish some  of your rich City men would marry her, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Halliday consented to call her mother&rsquo;s  husband &ldquo;papa,&rdquo; though the caressing name seemed in a manner to stick in her  throat. She had loved that blustrous good-tempered Tom Halliday so very dearly,  and it was only to please poor Georgy that she brought herself to address any  other man by the name that had been his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My City men have something better to do than to  marry a young woman without a sixpence,&rdquo; answered Mr. Sheldon. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you  try to catch one of them for yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like City men,&rdquo; said Charlotte quickly;  and then she blushed, and added apologetically, &ldquo;at least not the generality of  City men, papa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diana had waited until her destiny was settled  before answering Valentine Hawkehurst&rsquo;s letter; but she wrote to him directly  she was established at the Lawn, and told him the change in her plans.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I think papa had better let me come to see him at  his lodgings,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;wherever they may be; for I should scarcely care  about Mr. Sheldon seeing him. No one here knows anything definite about my  history; and as it is just possible Mr. Sheldon may have encountered my father  somehow or other, it would be as well for him to keep clear of this house. I  could not venture to say this to papa myself, but perhaps you could suggest it  without offending him. You see I have grown very worldly-wise, and am learning  to protect my own interests in the spirit which you have so instilled into me.  I don&rsquo;t know whether that sort of spirit is likely to secure one&rsquo;s happiness,  but I have no doubt it is the wisest and best for this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Paget could not refrain from an occasional  sneer when she wrote to her old companion. He never returned her sneers, or  noticed them. His letters were always frank, friendly, and brotherly in tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither my good opinion nor my bad opinion is of  any consequence to him,&rdquo; Diana thought bitterly. It was late in August when  Captain Paget and his <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em> came to  town. Valentine suggested the wisdom of leaving Diana in her new home  uncompromised by any past associations. But this was a suggestion which Horatio  Paget could not accept. His brightest successes in the way of scheming had been  matured out of chance acquaintanceships with eligible men. A man who could  afford such a luxury as a companion for his daughter must needs be eligible,  and the Captain was not inclined to sacrifice his acquaintance from any extreme  delicacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter seems to have made new friends for  herself, and I should like to see what kind of people they are,&rdquo; he said  conclusively. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look them up this evening, Val.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. George Sheldon dined at the Lawn on the day on  which Horatio Paget determined on &ldquo;looking up&rdquo; his daughter&rsquo;s new friends, and  he and the two girls were strolling in the garden when the Captain and Mr.  Hawkehurst were announced. They had been told that Miss Paget was in the  garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be good enough to take me straight to her,&rdquo; said  the Captain to the boy in buttons; &ldquo;I am her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horatio Paget was too old a tactician not to know  that by an unceremonious plunge into the family circle he was more likely to  secure an easy footing in the household than by any direct approach of the  master. He had seen the little group in the garden, and had mistaken George for  the head of the house.</p>
<p>Diana turned from pale to red, and from red to pale  again, as she recognised the two men. There had been no announcement of their  coming. She did not even know that they were in England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa!&rdquo; she cried, and then held out her hand and  greeted him; coldly enough, as it seemed to Charlotte, who fancied that any  kind of <em>real</em> father must be very  dear.</p>
<p>But Captain Paget was not to be satisfied by that  cold greeting. It suited his purpose to be especially paternal on this  occasion. He drew his daughter to his breast, and embraced her affectionately,  very much to that young lady&rsquo;s surprise.</p>
<p>Then, having abandoned himself entirely for the  moment to this tender impulse of paternity, he suddenly put his daughter aside,  as if he had all at once remembered his duty to society, drew himself up  stiffly, and saluted Miss Halliday and George Sheldon with uncovered head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sheldon, I believe?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George Sheldon,&rdquo; answered that gentleman; &ldquo;my  brother Philip is in the drawing-room yonder, looking at us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip Sheldon came out into the garden as George  said this, It was one of those sultry evenings on which the most delightful of  gothic villas is apt to be too stifling for endurance; and in most of the prim  suburban gardens there were people lounging listlessly among the flower-beds.  Mr. Sheldon came to look at this patrician stranger who had just embraced his  daughter&rsquo;s companion; whereupon Captain Paget introduced himself and his friend  Mr. Hawkehurst. After the introduction Mr. Sheldon and the Captain fell into an  easy conversation, while the two girls walked slowly along the gravel pathway  with Valentine by their side, and while George loitered drearily along, chewing  the stalk of a geranium, and pondering the obscure reminiscences of the last  oldest inhabitant whose shadowy memories he had evoked in his search after new  links in the chain of the Haygarths.</p>
<p>The two girls walked in the familiar schoolgirl  fashion of Hyde Lodge, Charlotte&rsquo;s arm encircling the waist of her friend. They  were both dressed in white muslin, and looked very shadowy and sylph-like in  the summer dusk. Mr. Hawkehurst found himself in a new atmosphere in this  suburban garden, with these two white-robed damsels by his side; for it seemed  to him that Diana with Charlotte&rsquo;s arm round her waist, and a certain shy  gentleness of manner which was new to him, was quite a different person from  that Miss Paget whose wan face had looked at him so anxiously in the saloons of  the Belgian Kursaal.</p>
<p>At first there was considerable restraint in the  tone of the conversation, and some little of that unnecessary discussion as to  whether this evening was warmer than the preceding evening, or whether it was  not, indeed, the warmest evening of all that summer. And then, when the ice was  broken, Mr. Hawkehurst began to talk at his ease about Paris, which city Miss  Halliday had never seen; about the last book, the last play, the last folly,  the last fashionable bonnet; for it was one of the special attributes of this young  Robert Macaire to be able to talk about anything, and to adapt himself to any  society. Charlotte opened her eyes to their widest extent as she listened to  this animated stranger. She had been so wearied by the dry as dust arguments of  City men who had discussed the schemes of great contractors, &ldquo;which will never  be carried out, sir, while money is at its present rate, mark my words,&rdquo; &mdash; or  the chances of a company &ldquo;which is eaten up by debenture-bonds and  preference-shares, sir, and will never pay its original proprietors one  sixpence of interest on their capital,&rdquo; with a great deal more of the same  character; and it was quite new to her to hear about novels, theatres, and  bonnets from masculine lips, and to find that there were men living who could  interest themselves in such frivolities. Charlotte was delighted with Diana&rsquo;s  friend. It was she who encouraged Valentine every now and then by some  exclamation of surprise or expression of interest, while Miss Paget herself was  thoughtful and silent.</p>
<p>It was not thus that she had hoped to meet  Valentine Hawkehurst. She stole a look at him now and then as he walked by her  side. Yes, it was the old face &mdash; the face which would have been so handsome if  there had been warmth and life in it, instead of that cold listlessness which  repelled all sympathy, and seemed to constitute a kind of mask behind which the  real man hid himself.</p>
<p>Diana looked at him, and remembered her parting  from him in the chill gray morning on the platform at For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne. He had let  her go out alone into the dreary world to encounter what fate she might,  without any more appearance of anxiety than he might have exhibited had she  been starting for a summer-day&rsquo;s holiday; and now, after a year of separation,  he met her with the same air of unconcern, and could discourse conventional  small talk to another woman while she walked by his side.</p>
<p>While Mr. Hawkehurst was talking to Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s  stepdaughter, Captain Paget had contrived to make himself very agreeable to  that gentleman himself. Lord Lytton has said that &ldquo;there is something strange  and almost mesmerical in the <em>rapport</em> between two evil natures. Bring two honest men together, and it is ten to one  if they recognise each other as honest; differences in temper, manner, even  politics, may make each misjudge the other. But bring together two men  unprincipled and perverted &mdash; men who, if born in a cellar, would have been food  for the hulks or gallows &mdash; and they understand each other by instant sympathy.&rdquo;  However this might be with these two men, they had speedily become upon very  easy terms with each other. Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s plans for the making of money were  very complicated in their nature, and he had frequent need of clever  instruments to assist in the carrying out of his arrangements. Horatio Paget was  the exact type of man most likely to be useful to such a speculator as Philip  Sheldon. He was the very ideal of the &ldquo;Promoter,&rdquo; the well-dressed,  well-mannered gentleman, beneath whose magic wand new companies arise as if by  magic; the man who, without a sixpence in his own pocket, can set a small  Pactolus flowing from the pockets of other people; the man who, content himself  to live in a humble second floor at Chelsea, can point to gigantic hotels which  are as the palaces of a new Brobdignag, and say, &ldquo;Lo, these arose at my  bidding!&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon was always on the alert to discover anything or anybody  likely to serve his own interest, either in the present or the future; and he  came to the conclusion that Miss Paget&rsquo;s father was a person upon whom an occasional  dinner might not be altogether thrown away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a chop with us to-morrow at six,&rdquo; he said, on  parting from the Captain, &ldquo;and then you can hear the two girls play and sing.  They play remarkably well, I believe, from what other people tell me; but I am  not a musical man myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horatio Paget accepted the invitation as cordially  as it was given. It is astonishing how genial and friendly these men of the  world can be at the slightest imaginable notice. One can fancy the striped  tigers of Bengal shaking paws in the jungle, the vultures hob-nobbing in a  mountain cleft over the torn carcass of a stag, the kites putting their beaks  together after dining on a nest of innocent doves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we shall expect to see you at sharp six,&rdquo;  said Mr. Sheldon, &ldquo;and your friend Mr. Hawkehurst with you, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this the two gentlemen departed. Valentine  shook hands with Diana, and took a more ceremonious leave of Charlotte. George  Sheldon threw away his chewed geranium-stalk in order to bid good evening to  the visitors; and the little party walked to the garden-gate together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Sheldon seems a very clever fellow,&rdquo; said  Captain Paget, as he and Valentine walked towards the Park, which they had to  cross on their way to Chelsea, where the Captain had secured a convenient  lodging. &ldquo;I wonder whether he is any relation to the Sheldon who is in with a  low set of money-lenders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, the Sheldon of Gray&rsquo;s Inn?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.  Hawkehurst. &ldquo;We can easily find that out.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Horatio Paget and Valentine Hawkehurst were  frequent visitors at the Lawn after that first evening. Mr. Sheldon found the  Captain useful to him in the carrying out of certain business arrangements on  more than one occasion, and the relations between the respectable stockbroker  and the disreputable adventurer assumed a very friendly character. Diana  wondered to see so spotless a citizen as Philip Sheldon hand-and-glove with her  father. Mrs. Sheldon and Charlotte were delighted with the Captain and his <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em>; these two penniless Bohemians  were so much more agreeable to the feminine mind than the City men who were  wont to sit in the dining-room slowly imbibing Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s old port in the  long summer evenings, while their wives endured the abomination of desolation  with Georgy and Charlotte in the drawing-room. Captain Paget paid Mrs. Sheldon  flowery compliments, and told her delightful stories of the aristocracy and all  that shining West-end world with which he had once been familiar. Poor simple  Georgy regarded him with that reverential awe which a middle-class country-bred  woman is prone to feel for a man who bears upon him that ineffaceable stamp of  high birth and good breeding, not to be destroyed by half a century of  degradation. Nor could Charlotte withhold her admiration from the man whose tone  was so infinitely superior to that of all the other men she had encountered. In  his darkest hour Captain Paget had found his best friends, or his easiest  dupes, among women. It had gone hard with him when his dear friend had withheld  the temporary accommodation of a five-pound note; but it had been much harder  when his friend&rsquo;s wife had refused the loan of &ldquo;a little silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine Hawkehurst came very often to the Lawn,  sometimes with his friend and patron, sometimes alone. He brought the young  ladies small offerings in the way of a popular French novel adapted for  feminine perusal, or an occasional box for some theatre which had fallen upon  evil days, and was liberal in the circulation of &ldquo;paper.&rdquo; He met the two girls  sometimes in their morning walks in Kensington-gardens, and walked with them in  the leafy avenues, and only left them at the gate by which they departed. So  much of his life was a listless waiting for the arising of new chances, that he  had ample time to waste in feminine society, and he seemed very well inclined  to loiter away the leisure hours of existence in the companionship of Diana and  her friend.</p>
<p>And was Miss Paget glad of his coming, and pleased  to be in his company? Alas, no! The time had been, and only within a few  months, when she had sickened for the sight of his familiar face, and fancied  that the most exquisite happiness life could afford her would be to see him  once more, anywhere, under any circumstances. She saw him now almost daily, and  she was miserable. She saw him; but another woman had come between her and the  man she loved: and now, if his voice took a softer tone, or if his eyes assumed  a tender earnestness of expression, it might be Charlotte&rsquo;s influence which  wrought the transformation. Who could say that it was not on Charlotte&rsquo;s  account he came so often, and lingered so long? Diana looked at him sometimes  with haggard angry eyes, which saw that it was Miss Halliday who absorbed his  attention. It was Charlotte &mdash; Charlotte, who was so bright and happy a creature  that the coldest heart must needs have been moved and melted by her  fascination. What was the cold patrician beauty of Miss Paget&rsquo;s face when  compared with the changeful charm of this radiant girl, with the flashing gray  eyes and piquant features, and all those artless caprices of manner which made  her arch loveliness irresistible? Diana&rsquo;s heart grew sick and cold as she  watched these two day by day, and saw the innocent school-girl&rsquo;s ascendancy  over the adventurer. The attributes which made Charlotte charming were just  those very attributes which Valentine Hawkehurst had been least accustomed to  discover in the womankind he had hitherto encountered. He had seen beautiful  women, elegant and fascinating women, without number; but this frank girlish  nature, this happy childlike disposition, was entirely new to him. How should  he have met bright childlike creatures in the pathways which he had trodden?  For the first time in his life a fresh young heart revealed its treasures of  purity and tenderness before his world-weary eyes, and his own heart was melted  by the new influence. He had admired Diana; he had been touched by her girlish  fancy for him, and had loved her as well as he had believed himself capable of  loving any woman. But when Prudence and Honour counselled him to stifle and  crush his growing affection for the beautiful companion of his wanderings, the  struggle had involved no agony of regret or despair. He had told himself that  no good could ever come of his love for Captain Paget&rsquo;s daughter, and he had put  aside that love before it had taken any vital root in his heart. He had been  very strong and resolute in this matter &mdash; resisting looks of sad surprise which  would have melted a softer nature. And he had been proud of his own firmness.  &ldquo;Better for her, and better for me,&rdquo; he had said to himself: &ldquo;let her outlive  her foolish schoolgirl fancies, and wait patiently till her beauty wins her a  rich husband. As for me, I must marry some prosperous tradesman&rsquo;s widow, if I  ever marry at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The influence of the world in which his life had  been spent had degraded Valentine Hawkehurst, and had done much to harden him;  and yet he was not altogether hard. He discovered his own weakness very soon  after the beginning of his acquaintance with Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s stepdaughter. He  knew very well that if he had been no fitting lover for Diana Paget, he was  still less a fitting lover for Charlotte Halliday. He knew that although it  might suit Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s purpose to make use of the Captain and himself as  handy instruments for the accomplishment of somewhat dirty work, he would be  the very last man to accept one of those useful instruments as a husband for  his stepdaughter. He knew all this; and knew that, apart from all worldly  considerations, there was an impassable gulf between himself and Charlotte.  What could there be in common between the unprincipled companion of Horatio  Paget and this innocent girl, whose darkest sin had been a neglected lesson or  an ill-written exercise? If he could have given her a home and a position, an untarnished  name and respectable associations, he would even yet have been unworthy of her  affection, unable to assure her happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a scoundrel and an adventurer,&rdquo; he said to  himself, in his most contemptuous spirit. &ldquo;If some benevolent fairy were to  give me the brightest home that was ever created for man, and Charlotte for my  wife, I daresay I should grow tired of my happiness in a week or two, and go  out some night to look for a place where I could play billiards and drink beer.  Is there any woman upon this earth who could render my existence supportable <em>without</em> billiards and beer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing himself much better than the Grecian  philosopher seemed to think it possible for human nature to know itself, Mr.  Hawkehurst decided that it was his bounden duty, both for his own sake and that  of the young lady in question, to keep clear of the house in which Miss  Halliday lived, and the avenue in which she was wont to walk. He told himself  this a dozen times a day, and yet he made his appearance at the Lawn whenever  he had the poorest shadow of an excuse for going there; and it seemed as if the  whole business of his life lay at the two ends of Charlotte&rsquo;s favourite avenue,  so often did he find himself called upon to perambulate that especial  thoroughfare. He knew that he was weak and foolish and dishonourable; he knew  that he was sowing the dragon&rsquo;s teeth from which were to spring up armed demons  that would rend and tear him. But Charlotte&rsquo;s eyes were unspeakably bright and  bewitching, and Charlotte&rsquo;s voice was very sweet and tender. A thrilling  consciousness that he was not altogether an indifferent person in Charlotte&rsquo;s  consideration had possessed him of late when he found himself in that young  lady&rsquo;s society, and a happiness which had hitherto been strange to him gave a  new zest to his purposeless life.</p>
<p>He still affected the old indifference of manner,  the idle listless tone of a being who has finished with all the joys and  sorrows, affections and aspirations, of the world in which he lives. But the  pretence had of late become a very shallow one. In Charlotte&rsquo;s presence he was  eager and interested in spite of himself &mdash; childishly eager about the veriest  trifles which interested her. Love had taken up the glass of Time; and the days  and hours were reckoned by a new standard; everything in the world had suffered  some wondrous change, which Valentine Hawkehurst tried in vain to understand.  The very earth upon which he walked had undergone some mystic process of  transformation; the very streets of London were new to him. He had known  Kensington-gardens from his boyhood; but not those enchanted avenues of beech  and elm in which he walked with Charlotte. In the plainest and most commonplace  phraseology, Mr. Hawkehurst had fallen in love. This penniless adventurer, who at  eight-and-twenty years of age was steeped to the lips in the worst experiences  of a very indifferent world, found himself all at once hanging upon the words  and living upon the looks of an ignorant schoolgirl.</p>
<p>The discovery that he was capable of this tender  weakness had an almost overwhelming effect upon Mr. Hawkehurst. He was ashamed  of this touch of humanity, this foolish affection which had awakened all that  was purest and best in a nature that had been so long abandoned to degrading  influences. For some time he fought resolutely against that which he considered  his folly; but the training which had made him the master of many a perplexing  position had not given him the mastery over his own inclinations; and when he  found that Charlotte&rsquo;s society had become the grand necessity of his life, he  abandoned himself to his fate without further resistance. He let himself drift  with the tide that was so much stronger than himself; and if there were  breakers ahead, or fatal rocks lurking invisible beneath the blue waters, he  must take his chance. His frail bark must go to pieces when her time came. In  the meanwhile it was so delicious to float upon the summer sea, that a man  could afford to forget future possibilities in the way of rocks and quicksands.</p>
<p>Miss Paget had known very few pleasures in the  course of her uncared-for youth; but she hitherto had experienced no such  anguish as that which she had now to endure in her daily intercourse with  Valentine and Charlotte. She underwent her martyrdom bravely, and no prying eye  discovered the sufferings which her proud nature supported in silence. &ldquo;Who  takes any heed of my feelings, or cares whether I am glad or sorry?&rdquo; she  thought; &ldquo;<em>he</em> does not.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  The Compact Of Gray&rsquo;s Inn</h2>
<p>The sand which ran so swiftly in the glass which  that bright young urchin Love had wrested from the hand of grim old Time ran  with an almost equal swiftness in the hour-glasses of lodging-house keepers and  tradespeople, and the necessities of every day demanded perpetual exertion on  the part of Mr. Hawkehurst, let Charlotte&rsquo;s eyes be never so bright, and  Charlotte&rsquo;s society never so dear. For Captain Paget and his <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em> there was no such thing as rest;  and the ingenious Captain took care that the greater part of the labour should  be performed by Valentine, while the lion&rsquo;s share of the spoil was pounced upon  by the ready paw of the noble Horatio. Just now he found his pupil unusually  plastic, unusually careless of his own interests, and ready to serve his master  with agreeable blindness. Since that awkward little affair at For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne,  that tiresome entanglement about a King of Spades which had put in an  appearance at a moment when no such monarch was to be expected, Captain Paget  had obtained the means of existence in a manner which was almost respectable,  if not altogether honest; for it is not to be supposed that honesty and  respectability are by any means synonymous terms. It was only by the exercise  of superhuman address that the Captain had extricated himself from that  perplexing predicament at the Belgian watering-place; and it may be that the  unpleasant experiences of that particular evening were not without a salutary  effect upon the adventurer&rsquo;s future plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was touch-and-go work, Val,&rdquo; he said to his  companion; &ldquo;and if I hadn&rsquo;t carried matters with a high hand, and sprung my  position as an officer in the English service upon those French ruffians, I  don&rsquo;t know where it would have ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have come to a metallic ornamentation of  the ankle, and some amiable 444, who has murdered his grandmother with a  red-hot poker and extenuating circumstances, for your companion,&rdquo; murmured  Valentine. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t try it on with that supererogatory king again on this  side of the Channel, if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain bestowed a freezing look on his  flippant <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em> and then commenced a  very grave discussion of future ways and means, which ended in an immediate  departure for Paris, where the two men entered upon an unpretentious career in  the commercial line as agents and travellers for the patentees of an improved  kind of gutta percha, which material was supposed to be applicable to every  imaginable purpose, from the sole of an infant&rsquo;s boot to the roof of a  cathedral. There are times when genius must stoop to pick up its daily  pittance; and for twelve months the elegant Horatio Paget was content to devote  his best energies to the perpetual praise of the Incorrodible and  Indestructible and Incombustible India-rubber, in consideration of a very  modest percentage on his commercial transactions in that material. To exert the  persuasive eloquence of a Burke or a Thurlow in order to induce a man to roof  his new warehouses with a fabric which you are aware will be torn into ribbons  by the first run of stormy weather, for the sake of obtaining two-and-a-half  per cent on his investment, may not be in accordance with the honourable  notions of a Bayard, and yet in a commercial sense may be strictly correct. It  was only when Captain Paget had made a comfortable little purse out of his  percentage upon the Incorrodible and Incombustible that he discovered the  extreme degradation of his position as agent and traveller. He determined on  returning to the land of his birth. Joint-stock companies were beginning to  multiply in the commercial world at this period; and wherever there are many  schemes for the investment of public capital there is room for such a man as  Horatio Paget &mdash; a man who, with the aid of a hired brougham, can inspire  confidence in the breast of the least daring speculator.</p>
<p>The Captain came, accompanied as usual by that  plastic tool and subaltern, Valentine Hawkehurst, who, being afflicted with a  chronic weariness of everything in life, was always eager to abandon any  present pursuit in favour of the vaguest contingency, and to shake off the dust  of any given locality from his vagabond feet. Captain Paget and his <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em> came to London, where a  fortunate combination of circumstances threw them in the way of Mr. Sheldon.</p>
<p>The alliance which arose between that gentleman and  the Captain opened a fair prospect for the latter. Mr. Sheldon was interested  in the formation of a certain joint-stock company, but had his own reasons for  not wishing to be identified with it. A stalking-horse is by no means a  difficult kind of animal to procure in the cattle-fairs of London; but a  stalking-horse whose paces are sufficiently showy and imposing &mdash; a  high-stepper, of thoroughbred appearance, and a mouth sensitively alive to the  lightest touch of the curb, easy to ride or drive, warranted neither a kicker  nor a bolter &mdash; is a quadruped of rare excellence, not to be met with every day.  Just such a stalking-horse was Captain Paget; and Mr. Sheldon lost no time in  putting him into action. It is scarcely necessary to say that the stockbroker  trusted his new acquaintance only so far as it was absolutely necessary to  trust him; or that the Captain and the stockbroker thoroughly understood each  other without affecting to do so. For Horatio Paget the sun of prosperity arose  in unaccustomed splendour. He was able to pay for his lodgings, and was an  eminently respectable person in the eyes of his landlord. He enjoyed the daily  use of a neatly-appointed brougham, in which only the most practised eye could  discover the taint of the livery stable. He dined sumptuously at fashionable restaurants,  and wore the freshest of lavender gloves, the most delicate of waxen  heath-blossoms or creamy-tinted exotics in the button-hole of his faultless  coat.</p>
<p>While the chief flourished, the subaltern was  comparatively idle. The patrician appearance and manners of the Captain were a  perennial source of profit to that gentleman; but Valentine Hawkehurst had not  a patrician appearance; and the work which Mr. Sheldon found for him was of a  more uncertain and less profitable character than that which fell to the share  of the elegant Horatio. But Valentine was content. He shared the Captain&rsquo;s  lodging, though he did not partake of the Captain&rsquo;s dinners or ride in the  smart little brougham. He had a roof to shelter him, and was rarely unprovided  with the price of some kind of dinner; and as this was the highest order of  prosperity he had ever known, he was content. He was more than content; for the  first time in his existence he knew what it was to be happy. A purer joy than  life had ever held for him until now made him careless whether his dinner cost  eighteenpence or eighteen shillings; whether he rode in the most perfect of  broughams or walked in the mud. He took no heed for the future; he forgot the  past, and abandoned himself heart and soul to the new delights of the present.</p>
<p>Never had Philip Sheldon found so willing a tool,  so cheap a drudge. Valentine was ready to do anything or everything for  Charlotte&rsquo;s stepfather, since his relations with that gentleman enabled him to  spend so much of his life with Charlotte.</p>
<p>But even in this sublimated state of mind Mr.  Hawkehurst was not exempt from the great necessity of Mr. Skimpole and humanity  at large. He wanted pounds. His garments were shabby, and he desired new and  elegant raiment in which to appear to advantage before the eyes of the woman he  loved. It had been his privilege on several occasions to escort Mrs. Sheldon  and the two younger ladies to a theatre; and even this privilege had cost him  money. He wanted pounds to expend upon those new books and music which served  so often as the excuse for a visit to the Lawn. He wanted pounds for very  trivial purposes; but he wanted them desperately. A lover without pounds is the  most helpless and contemptible of mankind; he is a knight-errant without his  armour, a troubadour without his lute.</p>
<p>In his dilemma Mr. Hawkehurst resorted to that  simple method which civilisation has devised for the relief of pecuniary  difficulties of a temporary nature. He had met George Sheldon several times at  the Lawn, and had become tolerably intimate with that gentleman, whom he now  knew to be &ldquo;the Sheldon of Gray&rsquo;s Inn,&rdquo; and the ally and agent of certain  bill-discounters. To George he went one morning; and after requesting that  Captain Paget should know nothing of his application, explained his  requirements. It was a very small sum which he asked for, modestly conscious  that the security he had to offer was of the weakest. He only wanted thirty  pounds, and was willing to give a bill at two months for five-and-thirty.</p>
<p>There was a good deal of hesitation on the part of  the lawyer; but Valentine had expected to meet with some difficulty, and was  not altogether unprepared for a point-blank refusal. He was agreeably surprised  when George Sheldon told him he would manage that &ldquo;little matter; only the bill  must be for forty.&rdquo; But in proof of the liberal spirit in which Mr. Hawkehurst  was to be treated, the friendly lawyer informed him that the two months should  be extended to three.</p>
<p>Valentine did not stop to consider that by this  friendly process he was to pay at the rate of something over a hundred and  thirty per cent per annum for the use of the money he wanted. He knew that this  was his only chance of getting money; so he shut his eyes to the expensive  nature of the transaction, and thanked Mr. Sheldon for the accommodation  granted to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ve settled that little business, I  should like to have a few minutes&rsquo; private chat with you,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;on the  understanding that what passes between you and me is strictly confidential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have been leading rather an idle life  for the last few months; and it strikes me, Mr. Hawkehurst, you&rsquo;re too clever a  fellow to care about that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have been in some measure wasting my  sweetness on the desert air,&rdquo; Valentine answered carelessly. &ldquo;The governor  seems to have slipped into a good berth by your brother&rsquo;s agency; but I am not  Horatio Nugent Cromie Paget, and the brougham and lavender kids of the Promoter  are not for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is money to be picked up by better dodges  than promoting,&rdquo; replied the attorney ambiguously; &ldquo;but I suppose you wouldn&rsquo;t  care for anything that didn&rsquo;t bring immediate cash? You wouldn&rsquo;t care to  speculate the chances, however well the business might promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>C&rsquo;est selon!</em> That&rsquo;s as may be,&rdquo; answered Valentine coolly. &ldquo;You see those affairs that  promise so much are apt to fail when it comes to a question of performance. I&rsquo;m  not a capitalist; I can&rsquo;t afford to become a speculator. I&rsquo;ve been living from  hand to mouth lately by means of occasional contributions to a sporting weekly,  and a little bit of business which your brother threw in my way. I&rsquo;ve been able  to be tolerably useful to him, and he promises to get me something in the way  of a clerkship, foreign correspondence, and that kind of thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; muttered George Sheldon; &ldquo;that means  eighty pounds a year and fourteen hours&rsquo; work a day, letters that must be  answered by this mail, and so on. I don&rsquo;t think that kind of drudgery would  ever suit you, Hawkehurst. You&rsquo;ve not served the right apprenticeship for that  sort of thing; you ought to try for some higher game. What should you say to an  affair that might put two or three thousand pounds in your pocket if it was  successful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should feel very much inclined to fancy it a  bubble &mdash; one of those dazzling rainbow-tinted globes which look so bright  dancing about in the sunshine, and explode into nothing directly they encounter  any tangible substance. However, my dear Sheldon, if you really have any  employment to offer to a versatile young man who is not overburdened with  vulgar prejudices, you&rsquo;d better put the business in plain words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; answered George; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not an affair  that can be discussed in five minutes. It&rsquo;s rather a serious matter, and  involves a good deal of consideration. I know that you&rsquo;re a man of the world,  and a very clever fellow into the bargain; but there&rsquo;s something more than that  wanted for this business, and that is patience. The hare is a very fine animal  in her way, you know; but a man must have a little of the tortoise in him if he  wants to achieve anything out of the common run in the way of good luck. I have  been working, and waiting, and speculating the chances for the last fifteen  years, and I think I&rsquo;ve got a good chance at last. But there&rsquo;s a good deal of  work to be done before the business is finished; and I find that I must have  some one to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of business is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The search for the heir-at-law of a man who has  died intestate within the last ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men looked at each other at this juncture;  and Valentine<br>
  Hawkehurst smiled significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within the last ten years?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  rather a wide margin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you would be a good hand at hunting  up the missing links in the chain of a family history?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sheldon.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather tiresome work, you know, and requires no common amount of patience  and perseverance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can persevere,&rdquo; said Valentine decisively, &ldquo;if  you can show me that it will be worth my while to do so. You want an  heir-at-law, and I&rsquo;m to look for him. What am I to get while I&rsquo;m looking for  him? and what is to be my reward if I find him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a pound a week and your travelling  expenses while you&rsquo;re employed in the search; and I&rsquo;ll give you three thousand  pounds on the day the heir gets his rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Hawkehurst, rather  doubtfully; &ldquo;three thousand pounds is a very respectable haul. But then, you  see, I may fail to discover the heir; and even if I do find him the chances are  ten to one that the business would be thrown into Chancery at the last moment;  in which case I might wait till doomsday for the reward of my labours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Sheldon shrugged his shoulders impatiently.  He had expected this penniless adventurer to catch eagerly at the chance he  offered. &ldquo;Three thousand pounds are not to be picked up in the streets,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t care to work with me, I can find plenty of clever fellows  in London who&rsquo;ll jump at the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want me to begin work &mdash; ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how am I to pay forty pounds in three months  out of a pound a week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the bill,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon, with lofty  generosity. &ldquo;If you work heart and soul for me, I&rsquo;ll square that little matter  for you; I&rsquo;ll get it renewed for another three months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I&rsquo;m your man. I don&rsquo;t mind a little  hard work just now, and I can live upon a pound a week where another man would  starve. So now for my instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a brief pause, during which the lawyer  refreshed himself by walking up and down his office two or three times with his  hands in his pockets. After which relief he seated himself before his desk,  took out a sheet of foolscap, and selected a pen from the inkstand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as well to put things in a thoroughly  business-like manner,&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d have no objection to  signing a memorandum of agreement &mdash; nothing that would be of any use in a court  of law, you know, but a simple understanding between man and man, for our own  satisfaction, as a safeguard against all possibility of misunderstanding in the  future. I&rsquo;ve every reason to consider you the most honourable of men, you know;  but honourable men turn round upon each other sometimes. You might ask me for  something more than three thou&rsquo; if you succeeded in your search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely; or I might make terms with the  heir-at-law, and throw you over. Perhaps that was your idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. The first half of the chain is in my  hands, and the second half will be worth nothing without it. But to prevent all  unpleasantness we may as well put our intentions upon record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not the least objection,&rdquo; replied Valentine  with supreme indifference. &ldquo;Draw up whatever memorandum you please, and I&rsquo;ll  sign it. If you don&rsquo;t mind smoke, I should like to console myself with a cigar  while you draw the bond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was a polite formula, the atmosphere  of George Sheldon&rsquo;s office being redolent of stale tobacco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoke away,&rdquo; said the lawyer; &ldquo;and if you can  drink brandy-and-soda at this time of day, you&rsquo;ll find the <em>de quoi</em> in that cupboard. Make yourself at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst declined the brandy-and-soda, and  regaled himself only with a cigar, which he took from his own case. He sat in  one of the second-floor windows smoking, and looking dreamily into the gardens,  while George Sheldon drew up the agreement. He was thinking that any hazard  which took him away from London and Charlotte Halliday might be a fortunate  one.</p>
<p>The lawyer finished his document, which he read  aloud for the benefit of the gentleman who was to sign it. The agreement was in  the following terms: &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Memorandum of agreement between George Sheldon on  the one part, and Valentine Hawkehurst on the other part, whereby it is this  day mutually agreed by and between the parties hereto as follows:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;1. That, in consideration of a weekly salary of one  pound while in pursuit of certain inquiries, and of the sum of three thousand  pounds to be paid upon the arising of a certain event, namely, the  establishment of an heir-at-law to the estates of the late John Haygarth, the  said Valentine Hawkehurst shall act as agent for the said George Sheldon, and  shall not at any time during the continuance of this agreement do any act to  prejudice the inquiry or the steps now being taken by the said George Sheldon  to discover and establish an heir-at-law to the estates of the late John  Haygarth.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;2. That at no time hereafter shall the said  Valentine Hawkehurst be entitled to a larger recompense than is herein-before  provided; nor shall he be liable to the said George Sheldon for the return of  any moneys which the said George Sheldon may advance on account of the said  inquiries in the event of the same not resulting in the establishment of an  heir to the estates of the late John Haygarth.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;3. That the said Valentine Hawkehurst shall not  alter his character of agent to the said George Sheldon during the prosecution  of the said inquiry; that he shall deliver over to the said George Sheldon all  documents and other forms of evidence that may arise from his, the said  Valentine Hawkehurst&rsquo;s, inquires; and that he shall week by week, and every  week, and as often as may be necessary, report to the said George Sheldon the  result of such inquiries, and that he shall not on any pretence whatever be at  liberty to withhold such fruits of his researches, nor discover the same to any  one else than the said George Sheldon, under a penalty of ten thousand pounds,  to be recovered as liquidated damages previously agreed between the parties as  the measure of damages payable to the said George Sheldon upon the breach of  this agreement by the said Valentine Hawkehurst.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;In witness whereof the parties hereto have this  20th day of September 1862 set their hands and affixed their seals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds stiff enough to hold water in a court  of law,&rdquo; said Valentine, when George Sheldon had recited the contents of the  document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose it would be much good in  Chancery-lane,&rdquo; returned the lawyer carelessly; &ldquo;though I daresay it sounds  rather formidable to you. When one gets the trick of the legal jargon, it&rsquo;s not  easy to draw the simplest form of agreement without a few superfluous words. I  may as well call in my clerk to witness our signatures, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call in any one you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk was summoned from a sunless and airless  den at the back of his principal&rsquo;s office. The two men appended their  signatures to the document; the clerk added his in witness of the genuine  nature of those signatures. It was an affair of two minutes. The clerk was  dismissed. Mr. Sheldon blotted and folded the memorandum, and laid it aside in  one of the drawers of his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said cheerily, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a business-like  beginning at any rate. And now you&rsquo;d better have some brandy-and-soda, for what  I&rsquo;ve got to say will take some time in the saying of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this occasion Mr. Hawkehurst accepted the  lawyer&rsquo;s hospitality, and there was some little delay before the conversation  proceeded.</p>
<p>It was a very long conversation. Mr. Sheldon  produced a bundle of papers, and exhibited some of them to his agent, beginning  with that advertisement in the <em>Times</em> which had first attracted his notice, but taking very good care <em>not</em> to show his coadjutor the obituary  in the <em>Observer</em>, wherein the amount  of the intestate&rsquo;s fortune was stated. The ready wits which had been sharpened  at so many different grindstones proved keen enough for the occasion. Valentine  Hawkehurst had had little to do with genealogies or baptismal registers during  his past career; but his experiences were of such a manifold nature that he was  not easily to be baffled or mystified by any new experience. He showed himself  almost as quick at tracing up the intricacies of a family tree as Mr. Sheldon,  the astute attorney and practised genealogist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have traced these Haygarths back to the  intestate&rsquo;s great-grandfather, who was a carpenter and a Puritan in the reign  of Charles the First. He seems to have made money &mdash; how I have not been able to  discover with any certainty; but it is more than probable he served in the  civil wars, and came in for some of the plunder those crop-eared,  psalm-singing, pierce-the-brain-of-the-tyrant-with-the-nail-of-Jael scoundrels  were always in the way of, at the sack of Royalist mansions. The man made  money; and his son, the grandfather of the intestate, was a wealthy citizen in  the reigns of Anne and the first George. He was a grocer, and lived in the  market-place of Ullerton in Leicestershire; an out-of-the-way sleepy place it  is now, but was prosperous enough in those days, I daresay. This man (the  grandfather) began the world well off, and amassed a large fortune before he  had done with it. The lucky beggar lived in the days when free trade and  competition were unknown, when tea was something like sixty shillings a pound,  and when a psalm-singing sleek-haired fellow, with a reputation for wealth and  honesty, might cheat his customers to his heart&rsquo;s content. He had one son,  Matthew, who seems, from what I can gather, to have been a wild sort of fellow  in the early part of his career, and not to have been at any time on the best  possible terms with the sanctimonious dad. This Matthew married at fifty-three  years of age, and died a year after his marriage, leaving one son, who  afterwards became the reverend intestate; with whom, according to the evidence  at present before me, ends the direct line of the Haygarths.&rdquo; The lawyer  paused, turned over two or three papers, and then resumed his explanation. &ldquo;The  sanctimonious grocer, Jonathan Haygarth, had one other child besides the son &mdash;  a daughter called Ruth, who married a certain Peter Judson, and became the  mother of a string of sons and daughters; and it is amongst the descendants of  these Judsons that we may have to look for our heir at law, unless we find him  nearer home. Now my idea is that we <em>shall</em> find him nearer home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What reason have you for forming that idea?&rdquo; asked  Valentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you. This Matthew Haygarth is known to  have been a wild fellow. I obtained a good deal of fragmentary information  about him from an old man in some almshouses at Ullerton, whose grandfather was  a schoolfellow of Matthew&rsquo;s. He was a scapegrace, and was always spending money  in London while the respectable psalm-singer was hoarding it in Ullerton. There  used to be desperate quarrels between the two men, and towards the end of  Jonathan Haygarth&rsquo;s life the old man made half a dozen different wills in favour  of half a dozen different people, and cutting off scapegrace Matthew with a  shilling. Fortunately for scapegrace Matthew, the old man had a habit of  quarrelling with his dearest friends &mdash; a fashion not quite exploded in this  enlightened nineteenth century &mdash; and the wills were burnt one after another,  until the worthy Jonathan became as helpless and foolish as his great  contemporary and namesake, the Dean of St. Patrick&rsquo;s; and after having died  &lsquo;first at top,&rsquo; did his son the favour to die altogether, <em>intestate</em>, whereby the roisterer and spendthrift of Soho and  Covent-garden came into a very handsome fortune. The old man died in 1766, aged  eighty; a very fine specimen of your good old English tradesman of the  Puritanical school. The roisterer, Matthew, was by this time forty-six years of  age, and, I suppose, had grown tired of roistering. In any case he appears to  have settled down very quietly in the old family house in the Ullerton  market-place, where he married a respectable damsel of the Puritan school, some  seven years after, and in which house, or in the neighbourhood whereof, he  departed this life, with awful suddenness, one year after his marriage, leaving  his son and heir, the reverend intestate. And now, my dear Hawkehurst, you&rsquo;re a  sharp fellow, and I daresay a good hand at guessing social conundrums; so  perhaps you begin to see my idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My notion is, that Matthew Haygarth may possibly  have married before he was fifty-three years of age. Men of his stamp don&rsquo;t  often live to that ripe age without being caught in matrimonial toils somehow  or other. It was in the days of Fleet marriages &mdash; in the days when young men  about town were even more reckless and more likely to become the prey of  feminine deception than they are now. The fact that Matthew Haygarth revealed  no such marriage is no conclusive evidence against my hypothesis. He died very  suddenly &mdash; intestate, as it seems the habit of these Haygarths to die; and he  had never made any adjustment of his affairs. According to the oldest  inhabitant in Ullerton almshouses, this Matthew was a very handsome fellow,  generous-hearted, open-handed &mdash; a devil-may-care kind of a chap, the type of  the rollicking heroes in old comedies; the very man to fall over head and ears  in love before he was twenty, and to go through fire and water for the sake of  the woman he loved: in short, the very last man upon earth to live a bachelor  until his fifty-fourth year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may have been a profligate, you were going to  say, and have had baser ties than those of Church and State. So he may; but if  he was a scoundrel, tradition flatters him. Of course all the information one  can gather about a man who died in 1774 must needs be of a very uncertain and  fragmentary character. But if I can trust the rather hazy recollections of my  oldest inhabitant about what his father told him <em>his</em> father had said of wild Mat Haygarth, the young man&rsquo;s wildness  was very free from vice. There is no legend of innocence betrayed or infamy  fostered by Matthew Haygarth. He appears to have enjoyed what the young men of  that day called life &mdash; attended cock-fights, beat the watch, gambled a little,  and was intimately acquainted with the interior of the Fleet and Marshalsea  prisons. For nearly twenty years he seems to have lived in London; and during  all those years he was lost sight of by the Ullerton people. My oldest  inhabitant&rsquo;s grandfather was clerk to a merchant in the city of London, and had  therefore some opportunity of knowing his old schoolfellow&rsquo;s proceedings in the  metropolis. But the two townsmen don&rsquo;t seem to have seen much of each other in  the big city. Their meetings were rare, and, so far as I can make out, for the  most part accidental. But, as I said before, my oldest inhabitant is somewhat  hazy, and excruciatingly prolix; his chaff is in the proportion of some fifty  to one of his wheat. I&rsquo;ve given a good deal of time to this case already, you  see, Mr. Hawkehurst; and you&rsquo;ll find <em>your</em> work very smooth sailing compared to what I&rsquo;ve gone through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay that sort of investigation is rather  tiresome in the earlier stages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d say so, with a vengeance, if you had to do  it,&rdquo; answered George Sheldon almost savagely. &ldquo;You start with the obituary of  some old bloke who was so disgustingly old when he consented to die that there  is no one living who can tell you when he was born, or who were his father and  mother; for, of course, the old idiot takes care not to leave a blessed  document of any kind which can aid a fellow in his researches. And when you&rsquo;ve  had the trouble of hunting up half a dozen men of the same name, and have  addled your wretched brains in the attempt to patch the half dozen men &mdash;  turning up at different periods and in different places &mdash; into one man, they  all tumble to pieces like a child&rsquo;s puzzle, and you find yourself as far as  ever from the man you want. However, <em>you</em> won&rsquo;t have to do any of that work,&rdquo; added Mr. Sheldon, who was almost in a  passion when he remembered the trouble he had gone through. &ldquo;The ground has  been all laid out for you, by Jove, as smooth as a bowling-green; and if you  look sharp, you&rsquo;ll pick up your three thou&rsquo; before you know where you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I shall,&rdquo; answered Valentine coolly. He was  not the sort of person to go into raptures about three thousand pounds, though  such a sum must needs have seemed to him the wealth of a small Rothschild. &ldquo;I  know I want money badly enough, and am ready and willing to work for it  conscientiously, if I get the chance. But to return to this Matthew Haygarth.  Your idea is that there may have been a marriage previous to the one at  Ullerton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely. Of course there may have been no such  previous marriage; but you see it&rsquo;s on the cards; and since it is on the cards,  my notion is that we had better hunt up the history of Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s life in  London, and try to find our heir-at-law there before we go in for the Judsons.  If you knew how the Judsons have married and multiplied, and lost themselves  among herds of other people, you wouldn&rsquo;t care about tracing the ramifications  of <em>their</em> family tree,&rdquo; said Mr.  Sheldon, with a weary sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Hawkehurst carelessly;  &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll leave the
  Judsons alone, and go in for Matthew Haygarth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with the air of an archaeological  Hercules, to whom difficulties were nothing. It seemed as if he would have been  quite ready to &ldquo;go in&rdquo; for some sidereal branch of the Plantagenets, or the  female descendants of the Hardicanute family, if George Sheldon had suggested  that the intestate&rsquo;s next of kin was to be found <em>there</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mat Haygarth, by all means,&rdquo; he said. He was on  jolly-good-fellow-ish terms with the dead-and-gone grocer&rsquo;s son already, and  had the tone of a man who had been his friend and boon companion. &ldquo;Mat Haygarth  is our man. But how are we to ferret out his doings in London? A man who was  born in 1720 is rather a remote kind of animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The secret of success in these matters is time,&rdquo;  answered the lawyer sententiously: &ldquo;a man must have no end of time, and he must  keep his brain clear of all other business. Those two conditions are impossible  for me, and that&rsquo;s why I want a coadjutor: now you&rsquo;re a clever young fellow,  with no profession, with no particular social ties, as I can make out, and your  time is all your own; ergo, you&rsquo;re the very man for this business. The thing is  to be done: accept that for a certainty. It&rsquo;s only a question of time. Indeed,  when you look at life philosophically, what is there on earth that is <em>not</em> a question of time? Give the  crossing-sweeper between this and Chancery-lane time enough, and he might  develop into a Rothschild. He might want nine hundred years or so to do it in;  but there&rsquo;s no doubt he could do it, if you gave him time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon was becoming expansive under the  influence of the brandy-and-soda; for even that mild beverage is not without  its effect on the intellectual man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to this Haygarth case,&rdquo; he resumed, after the  consumption of a little more soda and a little more brandy, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a sure  success, if we work it properly; and you know three thou&rsquo; is not to be  despised,&rdquo; added George persuasively, &ldquo;even if a fellow has to wait some time  for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. And the bulk of the Haygarthian  fortune &mdash; I suppose that&rsquo;s something rather stiff?&rdquo; returned Valentine, in the  same persuasive tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you may suppose it&rsquo;s a decent figure,&rdquo;  answered Mr. Sheldon, with an air of deprecation, &ldquo;or how could I afford to  give you three thou&rsquo; out of the share I&rsquo;m likely to get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, to be sure. I think I shall take to the work  well enough when once I get my hand in; but I shall be very glad of any hint you  can give me at starting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my advice is this: begin at the beginning;  go down to Ullerton; see my oldest inhabitant. I pumped him as dry as I could,  but I couldn&rsquo;t give myself enough time for thoroughly exhaustive pumping; one  has to waste a small eternity before one gets anything valuable out of those  hazy old fellows. Follow up this Matthew from his birth; see the place where he  was born; ferret out every detail of his life, so far as it is to be ferreted;  trace his way step by step to London, and when you get him there, stick to him  like a leech. Don&rsquo;t let him slip through your fingers for a day; hunt him from  lodging to lodging, from tavern to tavern, into jail and out of jail &mdash; tantivy,  yoicks, hark-forward! I know it&rsquo;s deuced hard work; but a man must work  uncommonly hard in these days before he picks up three thou&rsquo;. In a few words,  the game is all before you; so go in and win,&rdquo; concluded George Sheldon, as he  poured the last amber drops from the slim smoke-coloured bottle, and swallowed  his glass of brandy undiluted by soda.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  Aunt Sarah</h2>
<p>After that interview in Gray&rsquo;s Inn, there were more  interviews of a like character. Valentine received further instructions from  George Sheldon, and got himself posted up in the Haygarthian history, so far as  the lawyer&rsquo;s information furnished the materials for such posting. But the sum  total of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s information seemed very little to his coadjutor when the  young man looked the Haygarthian business full in the face and considered what  he had to do. He felt very much like a young prince in the fairy tale who has  been bidden to go forth upon an adventurous journey in a trackless forest,  where if he escape all manner of lurking dangers, and remember innumerable  injunctions, such as not to utter a single syllable during the whole course of  his travels, or look over his left shoulder, or pat any strange dog, or gather  forest fruit or flower, or look at his own reflection in mirror or water-pool,  shining brazen shield or jewelled helm, he will ultimately find himself before  the gates of an enchanted castle, to which he may or may not obtain admittance.</p>
<p>Valentine fancied himself in the position of this  favourite young prince. The trackless forest was the genealogy of the  Haygarths; and in the enchanted castle he was to find the crown of success in  the shape of three thousand pounds. Could he marry Charlotte on the strength of  those three thousand pounds, if he were so fortunate as to unravel the tangled  skein of the Haygarth history? Ah, no; that black-whiskered stockbroking  stepfather would ask for something more than three thousand pounds from the man  to whom he gave his wife&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will try to marry her to some rich City swell,  I dare say,&rdquo; thought Valentine. &ldquo;I should be no nearer her with three thousand  pounds for my fortune than I am without a sixpence. The best thing I can do for  her happiness and my own is to turn my back upon her, and devote myself to  hunting the Haygarths. It&rsquo;s rather hard too, just as I have begun to fancy that  she likes me a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of those interviews in Gray&rsquo;s Inn  which occurred before Valentine took any active steps in his new pursuit,  certain conditions were agreed upon between him and Mr. Sheldon. The first and  most serious of these conditions was, that Captain Paget should be in nowise  enlightened as to his <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;&rsquo;s</em> plans. This was a strong point with George Sheldon. &ldquo;I have no doubt Paget&rsquo;s a  very good fellow,&rdquo; he said. (It was his habit to call everybody a good fellow.  He would have called Nana Sahib a good fellow, and would have made some  good-natured excuse for any peccadilloes on the part of that potentate).  &ldquo;Paget&rsquo;s an uncommonly agreeable man, you know; but he is not the man I should  care to trust with this kind of secret.&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon said this with a tone that  implied his willingness to trust Captain Paget with every other kind of secret,  from the contents of his japanned office-boxes to the innermost mysteries of  his soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see Paget is thick with my brother Phil,&rdquo; he  resumed; &ldquo;and whenever I find a man thick with my relations, I make it a point  to keep clear of that man myself. Relations never have worked well in harness,  and never will work well in harness. It seems to be against nature. Now Phil  has a dim kind of idea of the game I want to play, in a general way, but  nothing more than a dim idea. He fancies I&rsquo;m a fool, and that I&rsquo;m wasting my  time and trouble. I mean him to stick to that notion. For, you see, in a thing  of this kind there&rsquo;s always a chance of other people cutting in and spoiling a  man&rsquo;s game. Of course, that advertisement I read to you was seen by other men  besides me, and may have been taken up. My hope is that whoever has taken it up  has gone in for the female branch, and got himself snowed up under a heap of  documentary evidence about the Judsons. That&rsquo;s another reason why we should put  our trust in Matthew Haygarth. The Judson line is the obvious line to follow,  and there are very few who would think of hunting up evidence for a  hypothetical first marriage until they had exhausted the Judsons. Now, I rely  upon you to throw dust in Paget&rsquo;s eyes, so that there may be no possibility of  my brother getting wind of our little scheme through him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of that,&rdquo; answered Valentine; &ldquo;he  doesn&rsquo;t want me just now. He&rsquo;s in very high feather, riding about in broughams  and dining at West-end taverns. He won&rsquo;t be sorry to get rid of me for a short  time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;ll be your excuse for leaving town? He&rsquo;ll  be sure to want a reason, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll invent an aunt at Ullerton, and tell him I&rsquo;m  going down to stop with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not say Ullerton; Paget might take it  into his head to follow you down there in order to see what sort of person your  aunt was, and whether she had any money. Paget&rsquo;s an excellent fellow, but there&rsquo;s  never any knowing what that sort of man will do. You&rsquo;d better throw him off the  scent altogether. Plant your aunt in Surrey &mdash; say Dorking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he should want to write to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him to address to the post-office, Dorking,  as your aunt is inquisitive, and might tamper with your correspondence. I  daresay his letters will keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He could follow me to Dorking as easily as to  Ullerton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he could,&rdquo; answered George Sheldon; &ldquo;but  then, you see, at Dorking the most he could find out would be that he&rsquo;d been  made a fool of; whereas if he followed you to Ullerton, he might ferret out the  nature of your business there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst perceived the wisdom of this  conclusion, and agreed to make Dorking the place of his relative&rsquo;s abode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very near London,&rdquo; he suggested thoughtfully;  &ldquo;the Captain might easily run down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for that very reason he&rsquo;s all the less likely  to do it,&rdquo; answered the lawyer; &ldquo;a man who thinks of going to a place within an  hour&rsquo;s ride of town knows he can go any day, and is likely to think of going to  the end of the chapter without carrying out his intention. A man who resolves  to go to Manchester or Liverpool has to make his arrangements accordingly, and  is likely to put his idea into practice. The people who live on Tower-hill very  seldom see the inside of the Tower. It&rsquo;s the good folks who come up for a  week&rsquo;s holiday from Yorkshire and Cornwall who know all about the Crown jewels  and John of Gaunt&rsquo;s armour. Take my advice, and stick to Dorking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acting upon this advice, Valentine Hawkehurst lay  in wait for the Promoter that very evening. He went home early, and was seated  by a cheery little bit of fire, such as an Englishman likes to see at the close  of a dull autumn day, when that accomplished personage returned to his  lodgings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deuced tiresome work,&rdquo; said the Captain, as he  smoothed the nap of his hat with that caressing tenderness of manipulation  peculiar to the man who is not very clear as to the means whereby his next hat  is to be obtained,&mdash; &ldquo;deuced slow, brain-belabouring work! How many people do you  think I&rsquo;ve called upon to-day, eh, Val? Seven-and-thirty! What do you say to  that? Seven-and-thirty interviews, and some of them very tough ones. I think  that&rsquo;s enough to take the steam out of a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the moneyed swells bite?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hawkehurst,  with friendly interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather slowly, my dear Val, rather slowly. The  mercantile fisheries have been pretty well whipped of late years, and the fish  are artful &mdash; they are uncommonly artful, Val. Indeed, I&rsquo;m not quite clear at  this present moment as to the kind of fly they&rsquo;ll rise to most readily. I&rsquo;m  half inclined to be doubtful whether your gaudy pheasant-feather, your brougham  and lavender-kid business is the right thing for your angler. It has been  overdone, Val, considerably overdone; and I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if a sober little  brown fly &mdash; a shabby old chap in a rusty greatcoat, with a cotton umbrella  under his arm &mdash; wouldn&rsquo;t do the trick better. That sort of thing would look  rich, you see, Val &mdash; rich and eccentric; and I think on occasions &mdash; with a <em>very</em> downy bird &mdash; I&rsquo;d even go so far as  a halfp&rsquo;orth of snuff in a screw of paper. I really think a pinch of snuff out  of a bit of paper, taken at the right moment, might turn the tide of a  transaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Impressed by the brilliancy of this idea, Captain  Paget abandoned himself for the moment to profound meditation, seated in his  favourite chair, and with his legs extended before the cheerful blaze. He  always had a favourite chair in every caravanserai wherein he rested in his manifold  wanderings, and he had an unerring instinct which guided him in the selection  of the most comfortable chair, and that one corner, to be found in every room,  which is a sanctuary secure from the incursions of Boreas.</p>
<p>The day just ended had evidently not been a lucky  one, and the Captain&rsquo;s gaze was darkly meditative as he looked into the ruddy  little fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take a glass of cold water with a  dash of brandy in it, Val,&rdquo; he said presently; and he said it with the air of a  man who rarely tasted such a beverage; whereas it was as habitual with him to  sit sipping brandy-and-water for an hour or so before he went to bed as it was  for him to light his chamber candle. &ldquo;That fellow Sheldon knows how to take  care of himself,&rdquo; he remarked thoughtfully, when Valentine had procured the  brandy-and-water. &ldquo;Try some of that cognac, Val; it&rsquo;s not bad. To tell you the  truth, I&rsquo;m beginning to get sick of this promoting business. It pays very  little better than the India-rubber agency, and it&rsquo;s harder work. I shall look  about me for something fresh, if Sheldon doesn&rsquo;t treat me handsomely. And what  have you been doing for the last day or two?&rdquo; asked the Captain, with a  searching glance at his <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;&rsquo;s</em> face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always hanging about Sheldon&rsquo;s place; but you don&rsquo;t seem to do  much business with him. You and his brother George seem uncommonly thick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, George suits me better than the stockbroker.  I never could get on very well with your ultra-respectable men. I&rsquo;m as ready to  &lsquo;undertake a dirty job&rsquo; as any man; but I don&rsquo;t like a fellow to offer me dirty  work and pretend it&rsquo;s clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, he&rsquo;s been getting you to do a little of the  bear business, I suppose,&rdquo; said the Captain. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that your conscience  need trouble you about that. Amongst a commercial people money must change  hands. I can&rsquo;t see that it much matters how the change takes place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, to be sure; that&rsquo;s a comfortable way of  putting it, at any rate. However, I&rsquo;m tired of going about in the ursine guise,  and I&rsquo;m going to cut it. I&rsquo;ve an old aunt settled at Dorking who has got a  little bit of money to leave, and I think I&rsquo;ll go and look her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An aunt at Dorking! I never heard of her before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes you have,&rdquo; answered Mr. Hawkehurst, with  supreme nonchalance; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve heard of her often enough, only you&rsquo;ve a happy  knack of not listening to other people&rsquo;s affairs. But you must have been  wrapped up in yourself with a vengeance if you don&rsquo;t remember to have heard me  speak of my aunt &mdash; Sarah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, it may be so,&rdquo; murmured the Captain,  almost apologetically. &ldquo;Your aunt Sarah? Ah, to be sure; I have some  recollection: is she your father&rsquo;s sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; she&rsquo;s the sister of my maternal grandmother &mdash;  a great-aunt, you know. She has a comfortable little place down at Dorking, and  I can get free quarters there whenever I like; so as you don&rsquo;t particularly  want me just now, I think I&rsquo;ll run down to her for a week or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain had no objection to offer to this very  natural desire on the part of his adopted son; nor did he concern himself as to  the young man&rsquo;s motive for leaving London.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  Charlotte Prophesies Rain</h2>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst had no excuse for going to the Lawn  before his departure; but the stately avenues between Bayswater and Kensington  are free to any man; and, having nothing better to do, Valentine put a shabby  little volume of Balzac in his pocket, and spent his last morning in town under  the shadow of the mighty elms, reading one of the great Honor&eacute;&rsquo;s gloomiest  romances, while the autumn leaves drifted round him, dancing fairy measures on  the grass, and scraping and scuffling on the gravel, and while children with  hoops and children with balls scampered and screamed in the avenue by which he  sat. He was not particularly absorbed by his book. He had taken it haphazard  from the tattered collection of cheap editions which he carried about with him  in his wanderings, ignominiously stuffed into the bottom of a portmanteau,  amongst boots and clothes-brushes and disabled razors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick of them all,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;the De  Beauseants, and Rastignacs, the German Jews, and the patrician beauties, and  the Israelitish Circes of the Rue Taitbout, and the sickly self-sacrificing  provincial angels, and the ghastly <em>vieilles  filles</em>. Had that man ever seen such a woman as Charlotte, I wonder &mdash; a bright  creature, all smiles and sunshine, and sweet impulsive tenderness; an angel who  can be angelic without being <em>poitrinaire</em>,  and whose amiability never degenerates into scrofula? There is an odour of the  dissecting-room pervading all my friend Balzac&rsquo;s novels, and I don&rsquo;t think he  was capable of painting a fresh, healthy nature. What a mass of disease he  would have made Lucy Ashton, and with what dismal relish he would have dilated  upon the physical sufferings of Amy Robsart in the confinement of Cumnor Hall!  No, my friend Honor&eacute;, you are the greatest and grandest of painters of the  terrible school; but the time comes when a man sighs for something brighter and  better than your highest type of womanhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst put his book in his pocket, and abandoned  himself to meditation, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and his  face buried in his hands, unconscious of the trundling hoops and screaming  children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is better and fairer than the fairest heroine  of a novel,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;She is like Heloise. Yes, the quaint old French fits  her to a nicety:</p>
<p class="note">&rsquo;Elle ne fu oscure ne brune,<br>
  Ains fu clere comme la lune,<br>
  Envers qui les autres estoiles<br>
  Ressemblent petites chandoiles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Browning must have known such a woman:</p>
<p class="note">&rsquo;Her air had a meaning, her  movements a grace;<br>
  You turned from the fairest to gaze on her face;&rsquo;</p>
<p>and yet</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;She was not as pretty as women I know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Was she not?&rdquo; mused the lover. &ldquo;Is she not? Yes,&rdquo;  he cried suddenly, as he saw a scarlet petticoat gleaming in the distance, and  a bright young face under a little black turban hat &mdash; prettiest and most  bewitching of all feminine headgear, let fashion change as it may. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he  cried, &ldquo;she is the loveliest creature in the world, and I love her to  distraction.&rdquo; He rose, and went to meet the loveliest creature in the world,  whose earthly name was Charlotte Halliday. She was walking with Diana Paget,  who, to more sober judges, might have seemed the handsomer woman of the two.  Alas for Diana! the day had been when Valentine Hawkehurst considered her very  handsome, and had need to fight a hard battle with himself in order not to fall  in love with her. He had been conqueror in that struggle of prudence and honour  against nascent love, only to be vanquished utterly by Charlotte&rsquo;s brighter  charms and Charlotte&rsquo;s sunnier nature.</p>
<p>The two girls shook hands with Mr. Hawkehurst. An  indifferent observer might have perceived that the colour faded from the face  of one, while a blush mounted to the cheeks of the other. But Valentine did not  see the sudden pallor of Diana&rsquo;s face &mdash; he had eyes only for Charlotte&rsquo;s  blushes. Nor did Charlotte herself perceive the sudden change in her dearest  friend&rsquo;s countenance. And that perhaps is the bitterest sting of all. It is not  enough that some must weep while others play; the mourners must weep unnoticed,  unconsoled; happiness is so apt to be selfish.</p>
<p>Of course the conversation was the general sort of  thing under the given circumstances &mdash; just a little more inane and disjointed  than the ordinary small talk of people who meet each other in their walks  abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Hawkehurst? &mdash; Very well, thank  you. &mdash; Mamma is very well; at least no, not quite well; she has one of her  headaches this morning. She is rather subject to headache, you know; and the  canaries sing so loud. Don&rsquo;t the canaries sing abominably loud, Diana? &mdash; loudly  they would have made me say at Hyde Lodge; but it is only awfully clever people  who know when to use adverbs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Miss Halliday having said all this in a hurried  and indeed almost breathless manner, stopped suddenly, blushing more deeply  than at first, and painfully aware of her blushes. She looked imploringly at  Diana; but Diana would not come to the rescue; and this morning Mr. Hawkehurst  seemed as a man struck with sudden dumbness.</p>
<p>There followed presently a little discussion of the  weather. Miss Halliday was possessed by the conviction that there would be rain  &mdash; possibly not immediate rain, but before the afternoon inevitable rain.  Valentine thought not; was, indeed, positively certain there would be no rain;  had a vague idea that the wind was in the north; and quoted a dreary  Joe-Millerism to prove the impossibility of rain while the wind came from that  quarter. Miss Halliday and Mr. Hawkehurst held very firmly to their several  opinions, and the argument was almost a quarrel &mdash; one of those little playful  quarrels which form some of the most delicious phases of a flirtation. &ldquo;I would  not mind wagering a fortune &mdash; if I had one &mdash; on the certainty of rain,&rdquo; cried  Charlotte with kindling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I would not shrink from staking my existence  on the conviction that there will be no rain,&rdquo; exclaimed Valentine, looking  with undisguised tenderness at the glowing animated face.</p>
<p>Diana Paget took no part in that foolish talk about  the possibilities of the weather. She walked silently by the side of her friend  Charlotte, as far away from her old comrade, it seemed to her, as if the  Atlantic&rsquo;s wild waste of waters had stretched between them. The barrier that  divided them was only Charlotte; but then Miss Paget knew too well that  Charlotte in this case meant all the world.</p>
<p>The ice had been broken by that discussion as to  rain or no rain, and Miss Halliday and Mr. Hawkehurst talked pleasantly for  some time, while Diana still walked silently by her friend&rsquo;s side, only  speaking when compelled to do so. The strangeness of her manner would have been  observed by any one not utterly absorbed by that sublime egotism called love;  but Valentine and Charlotte were so absorbed, and had no idea that Miss Paget  was anything but the most delightful and amusing of companions.</p>
<p>They had taken more than one turn in the broad  avenue, when Charlotte asked Mr. Hawkehurst some question about a piece which  was speedily to be played at one of the theatres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do so much want to see this new French actress,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;Do you think there is any possibility of obtaining orders, Mr.  Hawkehurst? You know what a dislike Mr. Sheldon has to paying for admission to  a theatre, and my pocket-money was exhausted three weeks ago, or I wouldn&rsquo;t  think of giving you any trouble about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philosophers have observed that in the life of the  plainest woman there is one inspired moment in which she becomes beautiful.  Perhaps it is when she is asking a favour of some masculine victim &mdash; for women  have a knack of looking their prettiest on such occasions. Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s  pleading glance and insinuating tone were irresistible. Valentine would have  given a lien on every shilling of his three thousand pounds rather than  disappoint her, if gold could purchase the thing she craved. It happened  fortunately that his occasional connection with the newspapers made it  tolerably easy for him to obtain free admissions to theatres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not speak of the trouble; there will be no  trouble. The orders shall be sent you, Miss Halliday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, thanks &mdash; a thousand thanks! Would it be  possible to get a box, and for us all to go together?&rdquo; asked the fair  encroacher; &ldquo;mamma is so fond of the theatre. She used to go often with poor  papa, at York and in London. And you are such an excellent critic, Mr.  Hawkehurst, and it would be so nice to have you with us, &mdash; wouldn&rsquo;t it, Di? You  know what a good critic Mr. Hawkehurst is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Diana; &ldquo;we used to go to theatres  together very often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a cry of anguish wrung from a bleeding  heart; but to the two absorbed egotists it seemed the simplest of casual  observations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you could manage to get a box, Mr.  Hawkehurst?&rdquo; asked the irresistible enslaver, putting her head on one side, in  a manner which, for the protection of weak mankind, should be made penal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try my uttermost,&rdquo; answered Valentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, then I&rsquo;m sure you will succeed. And we shall be  amused by your deliciously bitter criticisms between the acts. One would think  you had studied under Douglas Jerrold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do me too much honour. But before the new  piece is produced I shall have left London, and shall not have the pleasure of  accompanying you to the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to leave London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So soon!&rdquo; cried Charlotte, with undisguised  regret; &ldquo;and for a long time, I suppose?&rdquo; she added, very mournfully.</p>
<p>Miss Paget gave a little start, and a feverish  flush lit up her face for one brief moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad he is going,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;I am very  glad he is going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Valentine, in reply to Charlotte&rsquo;s  inquiry, &ldquo;I am likely to be away for a considerable time; indeed my plans are  at present so vague, that I cannot tell when I may come back to town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not resist the temptation to speak of his  absence as if it were likely to be the affair of a lifetime. He could not  refrain from the delight of sounding the pure depths of that innocent young  heart. But when the tender gray eyes looked at him, so sweet in their sudden  sadness, his heart melted, and he could trifle with her unconscious love no  longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going away on a matter of business,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;which may or may not occupy some time; but I don&rsquo;t suppose I shall be many  weeks away from London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte gave a little sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you going very far?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some distance; yes &mdash; a &mdash; hundred and fifty miles  or so,&rdquo; Valentine answered very lamely. It had been an easy thing to invent an  ancient aunt Sarah for the mystification of the astute Horatio; but Valentine  Hawkehurst could not bring himself to tell Charlotte Halliday a deliberate  falsehood. The girl looked at him wonderingly, as he gave that hesitating  answer to her question. She was at a loss to understand why he did not tell her  the place to which he was going, and the nature of the business that took him  away.</p>
<p>She was very sorry that he was going to disappear  out of her life for a time so uncertain, that while on the one hand it might be  only a few weeks, it might on the other hand be for ever. The life of a young  English damsel, in a prim villa at Bayswater, with a very commonplace mother  and a practical stockbroking stepfather, is rather a narrow kind of existence;  and to such a damsel the stranger whose hand lifts the curtain that shrouds new  and brighter worlds is apt to become a very important personage, especially  when the stranger happens to be young and handsome, and invested with that dash  of Bohemianism which to artless and sentimental girlhood has such a flavour of  romance.</p>
<p>Charlotte was very silent as she retraced her steps  along the broad gravel walk. As they drew near the Bayswater-gate she looked at  her watch. It was nearly one o&rsquo;clock, and she had promised Mrs. Sheldon to be  home at one for luncheon, and afterwards shopping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we must hurry home, Di,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite ready to go,&rdquo; answered Miss Paget  promptly. &ldquo;Good-bye,<br>
  Valentine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Diana; good-bye, Miss Halliday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst shook hands with both young ladies;  but shaking hands with Charlotte was a very slow process compared to the same performance  with Diana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he repeated, in a lingering tone; and  then, after standing for some moments silent and irresolute, with his hat in  his hand, he put it on suddenly and hurried away.</p>
<p>The two girls had walked a few steps towards the  gate when Charlotte stopped before a stony-looking alcove, which happened at  this nursery-dinner-hour to be empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired, Di,&rdquo; she said, and went into the  alcove, where she sat down to rest. She had a little veil attached to her  turban hat &mdash; a little veil which she now drew over her face. The tears gathered  slowly in her eyes and fell through that flimsy morsel of lace with which she  would fain have hidden her childish sorrow. The tears gathered and fell on her  lap as she sat in silence, pretending not to cry. This much rain at least was  there to justify her prediction, uttered in such foolish gaiety of heart half  an hour before.</p>
<p>Miss Halliday&rsquo;s eyes were undimmed by tears when  she went back to the gothic villa; but she had a feeling that some great sorrow  had come upon her &mdash; a vague idea that the last lingering warmth and brightness  of summer had faded all in a moment, and that chill gray winter had closed in  upon Bayswater without any autumnal interval. What was it that she had lost?  Only the occasional society of a young man with a handsome pale face, a little  haggard and wan from the effect of dissipated habits and a previous  acquaintance with care and difficulty &mdash; only the society of a penniless  Bohemian who had a certain disreputable cleverness and a dash of gloomy  sentimentality, which the schoolgirl mistook for genius. But then he was the  first man whose eyes had ever softened with a mysterious tenderness as they  looked at her &mdash; the first whose voice had grown faintly tremulous when it  syllabled her name.</p>
<p>There was some allusion to Mr. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s  departure in the course of dinner, and Philip Sheldon expressed some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to leave town?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, papa,&rdquo; Charlotte answered; &ldquo;he is going a  long way into the country, &mdash; a hundred and fifty miles, he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you where he was going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he seemed unwilling to mention the place. He  only said something about a hundred and fifty miles.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter18"></a>Chapter 18<br>
  Mr. Sheldon On The Watch</h2>
<p>Mr. Sheldon had occasion to see Captain Paget early  the following day, and questioned him closely about his <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;&rsquo;s</em> movements. He had found Valentine a very useful tool in  sundry intricate transactions of the commercial kind, and he expected his tools  to be ready for his service. He was therefore considerably annoyed by  Valentine&rsquo;s abrupt departure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think young Hawkehurst might have told me he was  going out of town,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What the deuce has taken him off in such a  hurry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is going to see some mysterious old aunt at  Dorking, from whom he seems to expect money,&rdquo; the Captain answered carelessly.  &ldquo;I daresay I can do what you want, Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely. But how comes that young fellow to  have an aunt at Dorking? I fancy I&rsquo;ve heard him say he was without a relative  or a friend in the world &mdash; always excepting yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The aunt may be another exception; some poor old  soul that he&rsquo;s half ashamed to own, I daresay &mdash; the inmate of an almshouse,  perhaps. Val&rsquo;s expectations may be limited to a few pounds hoarded in a china  teapot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought Hawkehurst the last man in  the world to care about looking after that sort of thing. I could have given  him plenty to do if he had stopped in town. He and my brother George are  uncommonly intimate, by the bye,&rdquo; added Mr. Sheldon meditatively. It was his  habit to be rather distrustful of his brother and of all his brother&rsquo;s  acquaintance. &ldquo;I suppose you can give me Hawkehurst&rsquo;s address, in case I should  want to write to him?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me to send my letters to the post-office,  Dorking,&rdquo; answered the Captain, &ldquo;which really looks as if the aunt&rsquo;s residence  were something in the way of an almshouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No more was said about Valentine&rsquo;s departure.  Captain Paget concluded his business with his patron and departed, leaving the  stockbroker leaning forward upon his desk in a thoughtful attitude and  scribbling purposeless figures upon his blotting-paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something queer in this young man running  away from town; there&rsquo;s some mystification somewhere,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;He has not  gone to Dorking, or he would scarcely have told Lotta that he was going a  hundred and fifty miles from town. He would be likely to be taken off his guard  by her questions, and would tell the truth. I wonder whether Paget is in the  secret. His manner seemed open enough; but that sort of man can pretend  anything. I&rsquo;ve noticed that he and George have been very confidential lately. I  wonder whether there&rsquo;s any underhand game on the cards between those two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The game of which Mr. Sheldon thought as he leant  over his blotting-paper was a very different kind of game from that which  really occupied the attention of George and his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to his lodgings at once,&rdquo; he said to  himself by-and-by, rising and putting on his hat quickly in his eagerness to  act upon his resolution. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if he really has left town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stockbroker hailed the first empty hansom to be  seen in the crowded thoroughfare from which his shady court diverged. In less  than an hour he alighted before the door of the house in which Captain Paget  lodged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mr. Hawkehurst in?&rdquo; he asked of the girl who  admitted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; he&rsquo;s just left to go into the country. He  hasn&rsquo;t been gone ten minutes. You might a&rsquo;most have met him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where he has gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard say it was Dorking, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! I should like to have seen him before he  went. Did he take much luggage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One portmanter, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you didn&rsquo;t notice where he told the man  to drive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; it was Euston-square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Euston-square. I&rsquo;ll go there, then, on the  chance of catching him,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon.</p>
<p>He bestowed a donation upon the domestic, reentered  his hansom, and told the man to drive to Euston-square &ldquo;like a shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So! His destination is Dorking, and he goes from  Euston-square!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Sheldon, in sombre meditation, as the hansom  rattled and rushed, and jingled and jolted, over the stones. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something  under the cards here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Arrived at the great terminus, the stockbroker made  his way to the down platform. There was a lull in the day&rsquo;s traffic, and only a  few listless wretches lounging disconsolately here and there, with eyes ever  and anon lifted to the clock. Amongst these there was no Valentine Hawkehurst.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon peered into all the waiting-rooms, and  surveyed the refreshment-counter; but there was still no sign of the man he sought.  He went back to the ticket-office; but here again all was desolate, the  shutters of the pigeon-holes hermetically closed, and no vestige of Valentine  Hawkehurst.</p>
<p>The stockbroker was disappointed, but not defeated.  He returned to the platform, looked about him for a few moments, and then  addressed himself to a porter of intelligent aspect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What trains have left here within the last  half-hour?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one, sir; the 2.15 down, for Manchester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t happen to notice a dark-eyed, dark-haired  young man among the passengers &mdash; second class?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. There are always a good many passengers  by that train; I haven&rsquo;t time to notice their faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stockbroker asked no further questions. He was  a man who did not care to be obliged to others for information which he could  obtain for himself. He walked straight to a place where the time-tables were  pasted on the wall, and ran his finger along the figures till he came to those  he wanted.</p>
<p>The 2.15 train was a fast train, which stopped at  only four places &mdash; Rugby, Ullerton, Murford, and Manchester.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay he has gone to Manchester,&rdquo; thought Mr.  Sheldon&mdash; &ldquo;on some racing business most likely, which he wants to keep dark from  his patron the Captain. What a fool I am to trouble myself about him, as if he  couldn&rsquo;t stir without meaning mischief to me! But I don&rsquo;t understand the  friendship between him and George. My brother George is not likely to take up  any man without some motive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After these reflections Mr. Sheldon left the  station and went back to his office in another hansom, still extremely  thoughtful and somewhat disquieted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it matter to me where they go or what  they do?&rdquo; he asked himself, impatient of some lurking weakness of his own;  &ldquo;what does it matter to me whether those two are friendly or unfriendly? They  can do me no harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There happened to be a kind of lull in the stormy  regions of the Stock Exchange at the time of Valentine Hawkehurst&rsquo;s departure.  Stagnation had descended upon that commercial ocean, which is such a dismal  waste of waters for the professional speculator in its hour of calm. All the  Bulls in the zoological creation would have failed to elevate the drooping  stocks and shares and first-preference bonds and debentures, which hung their  feeble heads and declined day by day, the weaker of them threatening to fade  away and diminish to a vanishing-point, as it seemed to some dejected holders  who read the Stock-Exchange lists and the money article in the Times with a  persistent hopefulness which struggled against the encroachments of despair.  The Bears had been busy, but were now idle &mdash; having burnt their fingers,  commercial gentlemen remarked. So Bulls and Bears alike hung listlessly about a  melancholy market, and conversed together dolefully in corners; and the burden  of all their lamentations was to the effect that there never had been such  times, and things never had been so bad, and it was a question whether they  would ever right themselves. Philip Sheldon shared in the general depression.  His face was gloomy, and his manner for the time being lost something of its  brisk, business-like cheerfulness. The men who envied his better fortunes  watched him furtively when he showed himself amongst them, and wondered whether  Sheldon, of Jull, Girdlestone, and Sheldon, had been hit by these bad times.</p>
<p>It was not entirely the pressure of that commercial  stagnation which weighed on the spirits of Philip Sheldon. The stockbroker was  tormented by private doubts and uncertainties which had nothing to do with the  money-market.</p>
<p>On the day after Valentine&rsquo;s journey to Ullerton,  Mr. Sheldon the elder presented himself at his brother&rsquo;s office in Gray&rsquo;s Inn.  It was his habit to throw waifs and strays of business in the attorney&rsquo;s way,  and to make use of him occasionally, though he had steadily refused to lend or  give him money; and it was his habit, as it were, to keep an eye upon his  younger brother &mdash; rather a jealous eye, which took note of all George&rsquo;s doings,  and kept suspicious watch upon all George&rsquo;s associates. Going unannounced into  his brother&rsquo;s office on this particular morning, Philip Sheldon found him  bending over an outspread document &mdash; a great sheet of cartridge-paper covered  with a net-work of lines, dotted about with circles, and with little patches of  writing in red and black ink in the neatest possible penmanship. Mr. Sheldon  the elder, whose bright black eyes were as the eyes of the hawk, took note of  this paper, and had caught more than one stray word that stood out in larger  and bolder characters than its neighbours, before his brother could fold it;  for it is not an easy thing for a man to fold an elephantine sheet of cartridge  when he is nervously anxious to fold it quickly, and is conscious that the eyes  of an observant brother are upon him.</p>
<p>Before George had mastered the folding of the  elephantine sheet, Philip had seen and taken note of two words. One of these  was the word INTESTATE, and the other the name HAYGARTH.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem in a great hurry to get that document out  of the way,&rdquo; said
  Philip, as he seated himself in the client&rsquo;s chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to tell the truth, you rather startled me,&rdquo;  answered George. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know who it might be, you know; and I was expecting  a fellow who&mdash;&rdquo; And then Mr. Sheldon the younger broke off abruptly, and asked,  with rather a suspicious air, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t that boy announce you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I wouldn&rsquo;t let him. Why should he announce  me? One would think you were carrying on some political conspiracy, George, and  had a modern Thistlewood gang hidden in that cupboard yonder. How thick you and  Hawkehurst are, by the bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the convenient &ldquo;by the bye,&rdquo; this last  remark of the stockbroker&rsquo;s sounded rather irrelevant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about being &lsquo;thick.&rsquo; Hawkehurst seems  a very decent young fellow, and he and I get on pretty well together. But I&rsquo;m  not as &lsquo;thick&rsquo; with him as I was with Tom Halliday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was to be observed that Mr. Sheldon the younger  was very apt to refer to that friendship with the dead Yorkshireman in the  course of conversation with Philip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hawkehurst has just left town,&rdquo; said Philip  indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know he has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you hear it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw him last night,&rdquo; answered George, taken off  his guard by the carelessness of his brother&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; cried Mr. Sheldon. &ldquo;You make a mistake  there. He left town at two o&rsquo;clock yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you happen to know that?&rdquo; asked George  sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I happened to be at the station and saw  him take his ticket. There&rsquo;s something underhand in that journey of his by the  way; for Paget told me he was going to Dorking. I suppose he and Paget have  some game of their own on the cards. I was rather annoyed by the young man&rsquo;s  departure, as I had some work for him. However, I can find plenty of fellows to  do it as well as Hawkehurst could have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George was looking into an open drawer in his desk  while his brother said this. He had a habit of opening drawers and peering into  them absently during the progress of an interview, as if looking for some  particular paper, that was never to be found.</p>
<p>After this the conversation became less personal.  The brothers talked a little of the events of the day, the money-article in  that morning&rsquo;s Times, the probability or improbability of a change in the rate  of discount. But this conversation soon flagged, and Mr. Sheldon rose to depart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that sheet of cartridge-paper which you  had so much trouble to fold is one of your genealogical tables,&rdquo; he said as he  was going. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t try to keep things dark from me, George. I&rsquo;m not likely  to steal a march upon you; my own business gives me more work than I can do.  But if you have really got a good thing at last, I shouldn&rsquo;t mind going into it  with you, and finding the money for the enterprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Sheldon looked at his elder brother with a  malicious flitter in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On condition that you got the lion&rsquo;s share of the  profits,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;O yes; I know how generous you are, Phil. I have asked you  for money before today, and you have refused it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s face darkened just a little at this  point. &ldquo;Your manner of asking it was offensive,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m sorry for that,&rdquo; answered George  politely. &ldquo;However, you refused me money when I did want it; so you needn&rsquo;t  offer it me now I don&rsquo;t want it. There are some people who think I have  sacrificed my life to a senseless theory; and perhaps you are one of them. But  there is one thing you may be certain of, Philip Sheldon: if ever I <em>do</em> get a good chance, I shall know how  to keep it to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are men skilled in the concealment of their  feelings on all ordinary occasions, who will yet betray themselves in a crisis  of importance. George Sheldon would fain have kept his project hidden from his  elder brother; but in this one unguarded moment he forgot himself, and allowed  the sense of triumph to irradiate his face.</p>
<p>The stockbroker was a reader of men rather than  books; and it is a notable thing what superiority in all worldly wisdom is  possessed by men who eschew books. He was able to translate the meaning of  George&rsquo;s smile &mdash; a smile of mingled triumph and malice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow <em>has</em> got a good thing,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;and Hawkehurst is in it. It must be  a deuced good thing too, or he wouldn&rsquo;t refuse my offer of money.&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon  was the last man in the world to reveal any mortification which he might  experience from his brother&rsquo;s conduct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re quite right to stick to your chance,  George,&rdquo; he said, with agreeable frankness. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve waited long enough for it.  As for me, I&rsquo;ve got my fingers in a good many pies just at present; so perhaps  I had better keep them out of yours, whatever plums there may be to be picked  out of it by an enterprising Jack Horner. Pick out your plums for yourself, old  fellow, and I&rsquo;ll be one of the first to call you a good boy for your pains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this Mr. Sheldon slapped his brother&rsquo;s shoulder  and departed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve had the best of Master Phil for  once,&rdquo; muttered George; and then he thrust his sinewy hands into the depths of  his trousers-pocket, and indulged in a silent laugh, which displayed his strong  square white teeth to perfection. &ldquo;I flatter myself I took a rise out of Phil  to-day,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>The sense of a malicious triumph over a social  enemy is a very delightful kind of thing, &mdash; so delightful that a man is apt to  ignore the possible cost of the enjoyment. It is like the pleasure of kicking a  man who is down &mdash; very delicious in its way; only one never knows how soon the  man may be up again.</p>
<p>George Sheldon, who was tolerably skilled in the  science of human nature, should have known that &ldquo;taking a rise&rdquo; out of his  brother was likely to be a rather costly operation. Philip was not the safest  man to deal with at any time; but he was most dangerous when he was &ldquo;jolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="center"><strong><em><a name="BooktheFourth"></a>Book the Fourth &mdash; Valentine Hawkhurst&rsquo;s Record </em></strong></h1>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  The Oldest Inhabitant</h2>
<p>Black Swan Inn, Ullerton, October 2nd.</p>
<p>As the work I am now employed in is quite new to  me, and I am to keep Sheldon posted up in this business day by day, I have  decided on jotting down the results of my inquiries in a kind of diary. Instead  of writing my principal a formal letter, I shall send a copy of the entries in  the diary, revised and amended. This will insure exactitude; and there is just  the possibility that the record may be useful to me hereafter. To remember all  I hear and pick up about these departed Haygarths without the aid of pen and  ink would be out of the question; so I mean to go in for unlimited pen and ink  like a hero, not to say a martyr.</p>
<p>And I am to do all this for twenty shillings a  week, and the remote possibility of three thousand pounds! O genius, genius! in  all the markets of this round world is there no better price for you than that?</p>
<p>How sweetly my Charlotte looked at me yesterday,  when I told her I was going away! If I could have dared to kneel at her feet  under those whispering elms, &mdash; unconscious of the children, unconscious of the  nursemaids, &mdash; if I could have dared to cry aloud to her, &ldquo;I am a penniless  reprobate, but I love you; I am a disreputable pauper, but I adore you! Have  pity upon my love and forget my worthlessness!&rdquo; If I could have dared to carry  her away from her prim suburban home and that terrible black-whiskered  stockbroking stepfather! But how is a man to carry off the woman he adores when  he has not the <em>de quoi</em> for the first  stage of the journey?</p>
<p>With three thousand pounds in my pocket, I think I  could dare anything. Three thousand pounds! One year of splendour and  happiness, and then &mdash; the rest is chaos!</p>
<p>I have seen the oldest inhabitant. <em>Ay de mi</em>! Sheldon did not exaggerate the  prosiness of that intolerable man. I thought of the luckless wedding guest in  Coleridge&rsquo;s grim ballad as I sat listening to this modern-ancient mariner. I  had to remind myself of all the bright things to be bought for three thousand  pounds, every now and then, in order to endure with fortitude, if not serenity.  And now the day&rsquo;s work is done, I begin to think it might as well have been  left undone. How am I to disintegrate the mass of prosiness which I have heard  this day? For three mortal hours did I listen to my ancient mariner; and how  much am I the wiser for my patience? Clever as you may fancy yourself, my  friend Hawkehurst, you don&rsquo;t seem to be the man for this business. You have not  the legal mind. Your genius is not the genius of Scotland-yard, and I begin to  fear that in your new line you may prove yourself a failure.</p>
<p>However, where all is dark to me the astute Sheldon  may see daylight, so I&rsquo;ll observe the letter of my bond, and check off the  residuum of the ancient mariner&rsquo;s prosiness.</p>
<p>By dint of much pumping I obtained from my ancient,  first, his father&rsquo;s recollections of Matthew Haygarth a few years before his  death, and secondly, his grandfather&rsquo;s recollections of Matthew in his wild  youth. It seems that in those last years of his life Matthew was a most sober  and estimable citizen; attended the chapel of a nonconforming sect; read the  works of Baxter, and followed in the footsteps of his departed father; was a  kind husband to a woman who appears to me to have been rather a pragmatical and  icy personage, but who was esteemed a model of womanly virtue, and who had  money. Strange that these respectable and wealthy citizens should be so eager  to increase their store by alliance with respectable and wealthy citizenesses.</p>
<p>In his later years Matthew Haygarth seems to have  imitated his father in many respects. Like his father, he executed more than  one will; and, like his father, he died intestate. The lawyer who drew up his  will on more than one occasion was a man called Brice &mdash; like his client,  eminently respectable.</p>
<p>After his marriage, our esteemed Matthew retired to  a modest mansion in the heart of the country, and some ten or fifteen miles  from Ullerton. The mansion in question is at a place called Dewsdale, and was  the property of the wife, and accrued to him through her.</p>
<p>This house and estate of some thirty acres was  afterwards sold by the rev. intestate, John Haygarth, shortly after his coming  of age, and within a year of his mother&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>This much and no more could I extort from the  oldest inhabitant relative to the latter days of our Matthew.</p>
<p>Respecting his wild youth I obtained the following  crumbs of enlightenment. In the year 1741-2, being then one-and-twenty years of  age, he left Ullerton. It is my ancient mariner&rsquo;s belief that he ran away from  home, after some desperate quarrel with his father; and it is also the belief  of my ancient that he stayed away, without intermission, for twenty years, &mdash;  though on what precise fact that belief is founded is much more than I can  extract from the venerable proser.</p>
<p>My ancient suggests &mdash; always in the haziest and  most impracticable manner &mdash; the possibility that Matthew in his wild days  lodged somewhere Clerkenwell way. He has a dim idea that he has heard his  grandfather speak of St. John&rsquo;s-gate, Clerkenwell, in connection with Matthew  Haygarth; but, as my ancient&rsquo;s grandfather seems to have been almost imbecile  at the time he made such remarks, <em>this</em> is not much.</p>
<p>He has another idea &mdash; also very vague and  impracticable &mdash; of having heard his grandfather say something about an  adventure of Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s, which was rather a heroic affair in its way &mdash;  an adventure in which, in some inexplicable manner, the wild Matthew is mixed  up with a dancing-girl, or player-girl, of Bartholomew Fair, and a nobleman.</p>
<p>This is the sum-total of the information to be  extracted in three mortal hours from my ancient. Altogether the day has been  very unsatisfactory; and I begin to think I&rsquo;m not up to the sort of work  required of me.</p>
<p><em>Oct. 3rd.</em> Another long interview  with my ancient. I dropped in directly after my breakfast, and about an hour  after his dinner. I sat up late last night, occupied till nearly ten in copying  my diary for Sheldon &mdash; which was just in time for the London post &mdash; and  lingering over my cigar till past midnight, thinking of Charlotte. So I was  late this morning.</p>
<p>My ancient received me graciously. I took him half  a pound of mild bird&rsquo;s-eye tobacco, on diplomatic grounds. He is evidently the  sort of person who would receive Mephistopheles graciously, if the fiend  presented him with tobacco.</p>
<p>I returned to the charge &mdash; diplomatically, of  course; talked about Ullerton and Ullerton people in general, insinuating  occasional questions about the Haygarths. I was rewarded by obtaining some  little information about Mrs. Matthew. That lady appears to have been a devoted  disciple of John Wesley, and was fonder of travelling to divers towns and  villages to hear the discourses of that preacher than her husband approved. It  seems they were wont to disagree upon this subject.</p>
<p>For some years before her marriage Mrs. Matthew was  a member of a Wesleyan confraternity, in those days newly established at  Ullerton. They held meetings and heard sermons in the warehouse of a wealthy  draper; and shortly before Mrs. Matthew&rsquo;s demise they built a chapel, still  extant, in a dingy little thoroughfare known as Waterhouse-lane.</p>
<p>On these points my ancient mariner is tolerably  clear. They belong to the period remembered by his father.</p>
<p>And now I believe him to be pumped dry. I gave him  my benediction, and left him smoking some of my tobacco, content with himself  and with the world &mdash; always excepting the authorities, or board, of the  almshouses, against whom he appears to nourish a grievance.</p>
<p>After leaving him, I walked about Ullerton for an  hour or so before returning to my humble hostelry. The streets of Ullerton are  sealed with the seal of desolation &mdash; the abomination of desolation reigns in  the market-place, where the grass flourishes greenly in the interstices of the  pavement. The place has known prosperity, and is prosperous no longer; but  although its chief trade has left it, there are still some three or four factories  in full swing. I heard clanging bells, and met bare-headed women and  uncouth-looking men hurrying to and fro. I went to look at the Wesleyan chapel  in Waterhouse-lane. It is a queer little building, and bears some resemblance  to a toy Noah&rsquo;s Ark in red brick. Tall warehouses have arisen about it and  hemmed it in, and the slim chimney-shaft of a waterworks throws a black shadow  aslant its unpretending facade. I inquired the name of the present minister. He  is called Jonah Goodge, began life as a carpenter, and is accounted the pink  and pattern of piety. <em>Oct. 4th</em>. A  letter from Sheldon awaited me in the coffee-room letter-rack when I went  downstairs to breakfast.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;MY DEAR HAWKEHURST, &mdash; Don&rsquo;t be disheartened if the  work seems slow at first. You&rsquo;ll soon get used to it.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I should recommend you to adopt the following  tactics:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;1st. Go to the house at Dewsdale, inhabited by  M.H. and his wife. You may have some difficulty in obtaining admission &mdash; and  full liberty to explore and examine &mdash; from the present servant or owner; but  you are not the man I take you for if you cannot overcome such a difficulty. I  enclose a few of my cards, which you can use at your discretion. They show  professional status. It would be as well to call yourself my articled clerk,  and to state that you are prosecuting an inquiry on the behalf of a client of  mine, who wishes to prove a certain event in the past connected remotely with  the H. family. If asked whether your business relates to the property left by  the rev. intestate, you must reply decisively in the negative. But I must  remind you that extreme caution is required in every move you make. Wherever  you can do your work <em>without</em> any  reference to the name of Haygarth, avoid such reference. Always remember that  there may be other people on the same scent.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;2nd. Examine the house in detail; look for old  pictures, old furniture, old needlework &mdash; if you are lucky enough to find the  Haygarth furniture was sold with the property, which I should think probable.  The rev. intestate must have been at the University when he made the sale; and  a young Cantab would in all likelihood pass over his ancestral chairs and  tables to the purchaser of his ancestral mansion, as so much useless lumber. It  is proverbial that walls have ears. I hope the Dewsdale walls may have tongues,  and favour you with a little information.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;3rd. When you have done all that is to be done at  Dewsdale, your next work must be to hunt up any scion of the lawyer Brice, if  such scion be in existence at Ullerton. Or if not to be found in Ullerton,  ascertain where the descendant, or decendants, of Brice is, or are, to be  found. Brice, the lawyer, must have known the contents of those wills executed  and afterwards destroyed by Haygarth, and may have kept rough draughts, copies,  or memoranda of the same. This is most important. &mdash; Yours truly, G.S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Sheldon is a wonderful man, and a cautious! &mdash;  no Signature to his letter.</p>
<p>I started for Dewsdale immediately after my  breakfast. I have made arrangements for boarding in this house, which is a  second-rate commercial inn. They have agreed to give me board and lodging for  twenty shillings a week &mdash; the full amount of my stipend: so all that I gain by  my researches in the affairs of the departed Matthew is food and shelter.  However, as this food and shelter is perhaps more honestly obtained than those  little dinners which I have so often eaten with the great Horatio, I will try  to fancy a sweetness in the tough steaks and greasy legs of mutton. O sheep of  Midlandshire! why cultivate such ponderous calves, and why so incline to  sinews? O cooks of Midlandshire! why so superficial in the treatment of your  roasts, so impetuous and inconsiderate when you boil?</p>
<p>A railroad now penetrates the rural district in  which the village of Dewsdale is situated. There is a little station, something  like a wooden Dutch oven, within a mile of the village; and here I alighted.  The morning savoured of summer rather than autumn. The air was soft and balmy,  the sunshine steeped the landscape in warm light, and the red and golden tints  of the fading foliage took new splendour from that yellow sunshine. A man whose  life is spent in cities must be dull of soul indeed if he does not feel a  little touched by the beauty of rustic scenery, when he finds himself suddenly  in the heart of the country. I had seen nothing so fair as those English fields  and copses since I left the pine-clad hills of For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne. An idiotic boy  directed me across some fields to Dewsdale. He sent me a mile out of the way;  but I forgave and blest him, for I think the walk did me good. I felt as if all  manner of vicious vapours were being blown out of my head as the soft wind  lifted my hair.</p>
<p>And so to Dewsdale. Strolling leisurely through  those quiet meadows, I fell to thinking of many things that seldom came into my  mind in London. I thought of my dead mother &mdash; a poor gentle creature &mdash; too  frail to carry heroically the burden laid upon her, and so a little soured by  chronic debt and difficulty. I have reason to remember her tenderly; we shared  so much misery together. I believe my father married her in the Rules of the  Bench; and if I am not sure upon this point, I know for a certainty that I was  born within those mystic boundaries.</p>
<p>And then my mind wandered to those nomadic  adventures in which poor Diana Paget and I were so much together. I think we  were a little fond of each other in those days; but in that matter I was at  least prudent; and now the transient fancy has faded, on Di&rsquo;s part as well as  on mine.</p>
<p>If I could be as prudent where Charlotte H. is  concerned!</p>
<p>But prudence and Charlotte&rsquo;s eyes cannot hold their  own in the same brain. Of two things, one, as our neighbours say: a man must  cease to be prudent, or he must forget those bewitching gray eyes.</p>
<p>I know she was sorry when she heard of my intended  departure.</p>
<p>This is her birthday. She is twenty-one years of  age to-day. I remember the two girls talking of it, and Miss Halliday declaring  herself &ldquo;quite old.&rdquo; My dear one, I drink your health in this poor tavern  liquor, with every tender wish and holy thought befitting your innocent  girlhood!</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s Resting-Place</h2>
<p>I found the house at Dewsdale without difficulty.  It is a stiff, square, red-brick dwelling-place, with long narrow windows, a  high narrow door, and carved canopy; a house which savours of the <em>Tatler</em> and <em>Spectator</em>; a house in which the short-faced gentleman might have  spent his summer holidays after Sir Roger&rsquo;s death. It stands behind a high iron  gate, surmounted by a handsome coat of arms; and before it there lies a pleasant  patch of greensward, with a pond and a colony of cackling geese, which craned  their necks and screamed at me as I passed them.</p>
<p>The place is the simplest and smallest of rural  villages. There is a public-house &mdash; the Seven Stars; a sprinkling of humble  cottages; a general shop, which is at once a shoemaker&rsquo;s, a grocer&rsquo;s, a linen  draper&rsquo;s, a stationer&rsquo;s, and a post office. These habitations, a gray old  church with a square tower, half hidden by the sombre foliage of yews and  cedars, and the house once inhabited by the Haygarths, comprise the whole of  the village. The Haygarthian household is now the rectory. I ascertained this  fact from the landlord of the Seven Stars, at which house of entertainment I  took a bottle of soda-water, in order to <em>sonder  le terrain</em> before commencing business.</p>
<p>The present rector is an elderly widower with seven  children; an easy good-natured soul, who is more prone to bestow his money in  charity than to punctuality in the payment of his debts.</p>
<p>Having discovered thus much, I rang the bell at the  iron gate and boarded the Haygarthian mansion. The rector was at home, and  received me in a very untidy apartment, <em>par  excellence</em> a study. A boy in a holland blouse was smearing his face with  his inky fingers, and wrestling with a problem in Euclid, while his father  stood on a step-ladder exploring a high shelf of dusty books.</p>
<p>The rector, whose name is Wendover, descended from  the step-ladder and shook the dust from his garments. He is a little withered  old man, with a manner so lively as to be on the verge of flightiness. I  observed that he wiped his dusty palms on the skirts of his coat, and argued  therefrom that he would be an easy person to deal with. I soon found that my  deduction was correct.</p>
<p>I presented Sheldon&rsquo;s card and stated my business,  of course acting on that worthy&rsquo;s advice. Could Mr. Wendover give me any  information relating to the Haygarth family?</p>
<p>Fortune favoured me throughout this Dewsdale  expedition. The rector is a simple garrulous old soul, to whom to talk is  bliss. He has occupied the house five-and-thirty years. He rents it of the lord  of the manor, who bought it from John Haygarth. Not a stick of furniture has  been removed since our friend Matthew&rsquo;s time; and the rev. intestate may have  wrestled with the mysteries of Euclid on the same old-fashioned mahogany table  at which I saw the boy in brown holland.</p>
<p>Mr. Wendover left his books and manuscripts  scattered on the floor of the study, and conducted me to a cool shady  drawing-room, very shabbily furnished with the spindle-legged chairs and tables  of the last century. Here he begged me to be seated, and here we were ever and  anon interrupted by intruding juveniles, the banging of doors, and the shrill  clamour of young voices in the hall and garden.</p>
<p>I brought all the diplomacy of which I am master to  bear in my long interview with the rector; and the following is a transcript of  our conversation, after a good deal of polite skirmishing: &mdash; </p>
<p class="note"><em>Myself</em>. You see, my dear sir, the  business I am concerned in is remotely connected with these Haygarths. Any  information you will kindly afford me, however apparently trivial, may be of  service in the affair I am prosecuting.</p>
<p class="note"><em>The Rector.</em> To be sure, to be sure!  But, you see, though I&rsquo;ve heard a good deal of the Haygarths, it is all gossip &mdash;  the merest gossip. People are so fond of gossip, you know &mdash; especially country  people: I have no doubt you have remarked that. Yes, I have heard a great deal  about Matthew Haygarth. My late clerk and sexton, &mdash; a very remarkable man,  ninety-one when he died, and able to perform his duties very creditably within  a year of his death &mdash; very creditably; but the hard winter of &rsquo;56 took him off,  poor fellow, and now I have a young man. Old Andrew Hone &mdash; that was my late  clerk&rsquo;s name &mdash; was employed in this house when a lad, and was very fond of  talking about Matthew Haygarth and his wife. She was a rich woman, you know, a  very rich woman &mdash; the daughter of a brewer at Ullerton; and this house belonged  to her &mdash; inherited from her father.</p>
<p class="note"><em>Myself</em>. And did you gather from  your clerk that Matthew Haygarth and his wife lived happily together?</p>
<p class="note"><em>The Rector</em>. Well, yes, yes: I never  heard anything to the contrary. They were not a young couple, you know. Rebecca  Caulfield was forty years of age, and Matthew Haygarth was fifty-three when he  married; so, you see, one could hardly call it a love-match. [<em>Abrupt inroad of bouncing damsel, exclaiming  &ldquo;Pa!&rdquo;</em>] Don&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m engaged, Sophia Louisa? Why are you not at your  practice? [<em>Sudden retreat of bouncing  damsel, followed by the scrambling performance of scale of C major in adjoining  chamber, which performance abruptly ceases after five minutes</em>.] You see  Mrs. Haygarth was <em>not</em> young, as I was  about to observe when my daughter interrupted us; and she was perhaps a little  more steadfast in her adherence to the newly arisen sect of Wesleyans than was  pleasing to her husband, although he consented to become a member of that sect.  But as their married life lasted only a year, they had little time for domestic  unhappiness, even supposing them not to be adapted to each other.</p>
<p class="note"><em>Myself</em>. Mrs Matthew Haygarth did  not marry again?</p>
<p class="note"><em>The Rector</em>. No; she devoted herself  to the education of her son, and lived and died in this house. The room which  is now my study she furnished with a small reading-desk and a couple of  benches, now in my nursery, and made it into a kind of chapel, in which the  keeper of the general shop &mdash; who was, I believe, considered a shining light  amongst the Wesleyan community &mdash; was in the habit of holding forth every Sunday  morning to such few members of that sect as were within reach of Dewsdale. She  died when her son was nineteen years of age, and was buried in the family vault  in the churchyard yonder. Her son&rsquo;s adherence to the Church of England was a  very great trouble to her. [<em>Inroad of boy  in holland, very dejected and inky of aspect, also exclaiming &ldquo;Pa!&rdquo;</em>] No,  John; not till that problem is worked out. Take that cricket-bat back to the  lobby, sir, and return to your studies. [<em>Sulky  withdrawal of boy.</em>] You see what it is to have a large family, Mr. &mdash;  Sheldon. I beg pardon, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; &mdash; </p>
<p class="note"><em>Myself</em>. Hawkehurst, clerk to Mr.  Sheldon.</p>
<p class="note"><em>The Rector</em>. To be sure. I have some  thoughts of the Law for one of my elder sons; the Church is terribly  overcrowded. However, as I was on the point of saying when my boy John  disturbed us, though I have heard a great deal of gossip about the Haygarths, I  fear I can give you very little substantial information. Their connection with  Dewsdale lasted little more than twenty years. Matthew Haygarth was married in  Dewsdale church, his son John was christened in Dewsdale church, and he himself  is buried in the churchyard. That is about as much positive information as I  can give you; and you will perhaps remark that the parish register would afford  you as much.</p>
<p>After questioning the good-natured old rector  rather closely, and obtaining little more than the above information, I asked  permission to see the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old furniture and old pictures are apt to be  suggestive,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and perhaps while we are going over the house you may  happen to recall some further particulars relating to the Haygarth family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Wendover assented. He was evidently anxious to  oblige me, and accepted my explanation of my business in perfect good faith. He  conducted me from room to room, waiting patiently while I scrutinised the  panelled walls and stared at the attenuated old furniture. I was determined to  observe George Sheldon&rsquo;s advice to the very letter, though I had little hope of  making any grand melodramatic discovery in the way of documents hidden in old  cabinets, or mouldering behind sliding panels.</p>
<p>I asked the rector if he had ever found papers of  any kind in forgotten nooks and corners of the house or the furniture. His  reply was a decided negative. He had explored and investigated every inch of  the old dwelling-place, and had found nothing.</p>
<p>So much for Sheldon&rsquo;s idea.</p>
<p>Mr. Wendover led me from basement to garret,  encountering bouncing daughters and boys in brown holland wherever we went; and  from basement to garret I found that all was barren. In the whole of the house  there was but one object which arrested my attention, and the interest which  that one object aroused in my mind had no relation to the Haygarthian fortune.</p>
<p>Over a high carved chimney-piece in one of the  bedchambers there hung a little row of miniatures &mdash; old-fashioned oval  miniatures, pale and faded &mdash; pictures of men and women with the powdered hair  of the Georgian period, and the flowing full-bottomed wigs familiar to St.  James&rsquo;s and Tunbridge-wells in the days of inoffensive Anne. There were in all  seven miniatures, six of which specimens of antique portraiture were prim and  starched and artificial of aspect. But the seventh was different in form and  style: it was the picture of a girlish face looking out of a frame of loose  unpowdered locks; a bright innocent face, with gray eyes and marked black  eyebrows, pouting lips a little parted, and white teeth gleaming between lips  of rosy red; such a face as one might fancy the inspiration of an old poet. I  took the miniature gently from the little brass hook on which it hung, and  stood for some time looking at the bright frank face.</p>
<p>It was the picture of Charlotte Halliday. Yes; I  suppose there is a fatality in these things. It was one of those marvellous  accidental resemblances which every man has met with in the course of his life.  Here was this dead-and-gone beauty of the days of George the Second smiling  upon me with the eyes and lips of Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s stepdaughter!</p>
<p>Or was it only a delusion of my own? Was my mind so  steeped in the thought of that girl &mdash; was my heart so impressed by her beauty,  that I could not look upon a fair woman&rsquo;s face without conjuring up her  likeness in the pictured countenance? However this may be, I looked long and  tenderly at the face which seemed to me to resemble the woman I love.</p>
<p>Of course I questioned the rector as to the  original of this particular miniature. He could tell me nothing about it,  except that he thought it was not one of the Caulfields or Haygarths. The man  in the full-bottomed Queen-Anne wig was Jeremiah Caulfield, brewer, father of  the pious Rebecca; the woman with the high powdered head was the pious Rebecca  herself; the man in the George-the-Second wig was Matthew Haygarth. The other  three were kindred of Rebecca&rsquo;s. But the wild-haired damsel was some unknown  creature, for whose presence Mr. Wendover was unable to account.</p>
<p>I examined the frame of the miniature, and found  that it opened at the back. Behind the ivory on which the portrait was painted  there was a lock of dark hair incased in crystal; and on the inside of the  case, which was of some worthless metal gilded, there was scratched the name  &ldquo;Molly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How this Molly with the loose dark locks came to be  admitted among the prim, and pious Caulfields is certainly more than I can  understand.</p>
<p>My exploration of the house having resulted only in  this little romantic accident of the likeness to Charlotte, I prepared to take  my departure, no wiser than when I had first crossed the threshold. The rector  very politely proposed to show me the church; and as I considered that it would  be well to take a copy of the Haygarthian entries in the register, I availed  myself of his offer. He despatched a maid-servant to summon his clerk, in order  that that functionary might assist in the investigation of the registers. The  girl departed on this errand, while her master conducted me across his garden,  in which there is now a gate opening into the churchyard.</p>
<p>It is the most picturesque of burial-grounds,  darkened by the shadow of those solemn yews and spreading cedars. We walked  very slowly between the crumbling old tombstones, which have almost all grown  one-sided with time. Mr. Wendover led me through a little labyrinth of lowly  graves to a high and ponderous iron railing surrounding a square space, in the  midst of which there is a stately stone monument. In the railing there is a  gate, from which a flight of stone step leads down to the door of a vault. It  is altogether rather a pretentious affair, wherein one sees the evidence of  substantial wealth unelevated by artistic grace or poetic grandeur.</p>
<p>This is the family vault of the Caulfields and  Haygarths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you to look at this tomb,&rdquo; said the  rector, resting his hand upon the rusted railing, &ldquo;because there is rather a  romantic story connected with it &mdash; a story that concerns Matthew Haygarth, by  the bye. I did not think of it just now, when we were talking of him; but it  flashed on my memory as we came through the garden. It is rather a mysterious  affair; and though it is not very likely to have any bearing upon the object of  your inquiry, I may as well tell you about it, &mdash; as a leaf out of family  history, you know, Mr. Hawkehurst, and as a new proof of the old adage that  truth is stranger than fiction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assured the rector that I should be glad to hear  anything he could tell me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must premise that I only tell the story as I got  it from my old clerk, and that it may therefore seem rather indistinct; but  there is an entry in the register yonder to show that it is not without  foundation. However, I will waste no more words in preamble, but give you the  story, which is simply this:&rdquo; &mdash; </p>
<p>The rector seated himself on a dilapidated old  tombstone, while I leaned against the rails of the Haygarth vault, looking down  upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within a month or two of Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s death  a kind of melancholy came over him,&rdquo; said the rector. &ldquo;Whether he was unhappy  with his wife, or whether he felt his health declining, is more than I can say.  You must remember that my informant was but a lad at the time of which I speak,  and that when he talked to me about the subject sixty years afterwards he was a  very old man, and his impressions were therefore more or less vague. But upon  certain facts he was sufficiently positive; and amongst the circumstances he  remembered most vividly are those of the story I am going to tell you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that within a very few weeks of Matthew&rsquo;s  death, his wife, Rebecca Haygarth, started on an expedition to the north, in  the company of an uncle, to hear John Wesley preach on some very special  occasion, and to assist at a love-feast. She was gone more than a fortnight;  and during her absence Matthew Haygarth mounted his horse early one morning and  rode away from Dewsdale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His household consisted of three maids, a man, and  the lad Andrew Hone, afterwards my sexton. Before departing on his journey Mr.  Haygarth had said that he would not return till late the next evening, and had  requested that only the man (whose name I forget) should sit up for him.&rdquo; He  was punctiliously obeyed. The household, always of early habits, retired at  nine, the accustomed hour; and the man-servant waited to receive his master,  while the lad Andrew, who slept in the stables, sat up to keep his  fellow-servant company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At ten o&rsquo;clock Mr. Haygarth came home, gave his horse  into the charge of the lad, took his candle from the man-servant, and walked  straight upstairs, as if going to bed. The man-servant locked the doors, took  his master the key, and then went to his own quarters. The boy remained up to  feed and groom the horse, which had the appearance of having performed a hard  day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had nearly concluded this business when he was  startled by the slamming of the back door opening into the courtyard, in which  were the stables and outhouses. Apprehending thieves, the boy opened the door  of the stable and looked out, doubtless with considerable caution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was broad moonlight, and he saw at a glance  that the person who had opened the door was one who had a right to open it.  Matthew Haygarth was crossing the courtyard as the lad peeped out. He wore a  long black cloak, and his head drooped upon his breast as if he had been in  dejection. The lad &mdash; being, I suppose, inquisitive, after the manner of country  lads &mdash; made no more ado, but left his unfinished work and crept stealthily  after his master, who came straight to this churchyard, &mdash; indeed to this very  spot on which we are now standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this spot the boy Andrew Hone became the secret  witness of a strange scene. He saw an open grave close against the rails yonder,  and he saw a little coffin lowered silently into that grave by the sexton of  that time and a strange man, who afterwards went away in a mourning coach,  which was in waiting at the gate, and in which doubtless the stranger and the  little coffin had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the man departed he assisted to fill up the  grave; and when it was filled Matthew Haygarth gave money to both the men &mdash;  gold it seemed to the lad Andrew, and several pieces to each person. The two  men then departed, but Mr. Haygarth still lingered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as he fancied himself alone, he knelt down  beside the little grave, covered his face with his hands, and either wept or  prayed, Andrew Hone could not tell which. If he wept, he wept silently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that night, my sexton said, Matthew Haygarth  faded visibly. Mistress Rebecca came home from her love-feast, and nursed and  tended her husband with considerable kindness, though, so far as I can make  out, she was at the best a stern woman. He died three weeks after the event  which I have described, and was buried in that vault close to the little  grave.&rdquo; I thanked Mr. Wendover for his succinct narrative, and apologised for  the trouble I had occasioned him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not speak of the trouble,&rdquo; he answered kindly;  &ldquo;I am used to telling that story. I have heard it a great many times from poor  old Andrew, and I have told it a great many times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story has rather a legendary tone,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I  should have scarcely thought such a thing possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rector shrugged his shoulders with a  deprecating gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In our own day,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;such an occurrence  would be almost impossible; but you must remember that we are talking of the  last century &mdash; a century in which, I regret to say, the clergy of the Church of  England were sadly lax in the performance of their duties. The followers of  Wesley and Whitefield could scarcely have multiplied as they did if the flocks  had not been cruelly neglected by their proper shepherds. It was a period in  which benefices were bestowed constantly on men obviously unfitted for the holy  office &mdash; men who were gamblers and drunkards, patrons of cock-pits, and in many  cases open and shameless reprobates. In such an age almost anything was  possible; and this midnight and unhallowed interment may very well have taken  place either with the consent or without the knowledge of the incumbent, who, I  am told, bore no high character for piety or morality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you say there is an entry in the register?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a careless scrawl, dated Sept. 19th, 1774,  recording the burial of one Matthew Haygarth, aged four years, removed from the  burial-ground attached to the parish church of Spotswold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was a reinterment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is Spotswold in this county?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it is a very small village, about fifty miles  from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Matthew Haygarth died very soon after this  event?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did. He died very suddenly &mdash; with an awful  suddenness &mdash; and died intestate. His widow was left the possessor of great  wealth, which increased in the hands of her son John Haygarth, a very prudent  and worthy gentleman, and a credit to the Church of which he was a member. He  only died very lately, I believe, and must therefore have attained a great  age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is quite evident that Mr. Wendover had not seen  the advertisement in the Times, and was ignorant of the fact that the accumulated  wealth of Haygarths and Caulfields is now waiting a claimant.</p>
<p>I asked permission to see the register containing  the entry of the mysterious interment; and after the administration of a  shilling to the clerk &mdash; a shilling at Dewsdale being equal to half a crown in  London &mdash; the vestry cupboard was opened by that functionary, and the book I  required was produced from a goodly pile of such mouldy brown leather-bound  volumes.</p>
<p>The following is a copy of the entry: &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;On Thursday last past, being ye 19 Sep&rsquo;tr, A.D.  1774, was interr&rsquo;d ye bodie off onne Matthewe Haygarthe, ag&rsquo;d foure yeres,  remoov&rsquo;d fromm ye Churcheyarde off St. Marie, under ye hil, Spotswolde, in this  Co. Pade forr so doeing, sevven shill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After having inspected the register, I asked many  further questions, but without eliciting much further information. So I  expressed my thanks for the courtesy that had been shown me, and took my  departure, not wishing to press the matter so closely as to render myself a  nuisance to the worthy Wendover, and bearing in mind that it would be open to  me to return at any future time.</p>
<p>And now I ask myself &mdash; and I ask the astute Sheldon  &mdash; what is the meaning of this mysterious burial, and is it likely to have any  bearing on the object of our search? These are questions for the consideration  of the astute S.</p>
<p>I spent my evening in jotting down the events of  the day, in the above free-and-easy fashion for my own guidance, and in a more  precise and business-like style for my employer. I posted my letter before ten o&rsquo;clock,  the hour at which the London mail is made up, and then smoked my cigar in the  empty streets, overshadowed by gaunt square stacks of building and tall black  chimneys; and so back to my inn, where I took a glass of ale and another cigar,  and then to bed, as the worthy Pepys might have concluded.</p>

  Mr. Goodge&rsquo;s Wisdom</h2>
<p><em>Oct. 5th</em>. My dreams last night were  haunted by the image of gray-eyed Molly, with her wild loose hair. She must  needs have been a sweet creature; and how she came amongst those prim  fishy-eyed men and women with absurd head-gear is much more than I can  understand. That she should mix herself up with Diana Paget, and play <em>rouge-et-noir</em> at For&ecirc;tdech&ecirc;ne in a  tucked-up chintz gown and a quilted satin petticoat, in my dreams last night &mdash;  that I should meet her afterwards in the little stucco temple on the Belgian  hills, and stab her to the heart, whereon she changed into Charlotte Halliday &mdash;  is only in the nature of dreams, and therefore no subject for wonder.</p>
<p>On referring to Sheldon&rsquo;s letter I found that the  next people to be looked up were descendants of Brice the lawyer; so I devoted  my breakfast-hour to the cultivation of an intimacy with the oldest of the  waiters &mdash; a very antique specimen of his brotherhood, with a white stubble upon  his chin and a tendency to confusion of mind in the matter of forks and spoons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, or have you ever known, an attorney  of the name of Brice in this town?&rdquo; I asked him.</p>
<p>He rubbed the white stubble contemplatively with  his hand, and then gave his poor old head a dejected shake. I felt at once that  I should get very little good out of <em>him</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he murmured despondently, &ldquo;not that I can  call to mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I should like to know what he <em>could</em> call to mind, piteous old meanderer!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you belong to Ullerton, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and have belonged to it these seventy-five  years, man and boy;&rdquo; whereby, no doubt, the dreary confusion of the unhappy  being&rsquo;s mind. Figurez donc, mon cher. Qui-que-ce-soit, fifty-five years or so  of commercial breakfasts and dinners in such a place as Ullerton!  Five-and-fifty years of steaks and chops; five-and-fifty years of ham and eggs,  indifferently buttered toasts, and perennial sixes of brandy-and-water! After  rambling to and fro with spoons and forks, and while in progress of clearing my  table, and dropping the different items of my breakfast equipage, the poor  soddened faded face of this dreary wanderer became suddenly illumined with a  faint glimmer that was almost the light of reason.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were a Brice in Ullerton when I were a lad;  I&rsquo;ve heard father tell on him,&rdquo; he murmured slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An attorney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He were a rare wild one, he were! It was when  the Prince of Wales were Regent for his poor old mad father, as the saying is,  and folks was wilder like in general in those times, and wore spencers &mdash; lawyer  Brice wore a plum-coloured one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Imagine then again, mon cher, an attorney in a  plum-coloured spencer! Who, in these enlightened days, would trust his business  to such a practitioner? I perked up considerably, believing that my aged  imbecile was going to be of real service to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he were a rare wild one, he were,&rdquo; said my  ancient friend with excitement. &ldquo;I can remember him as well as if it was  yesterday, at Tiverford races &mdash; there was races at Tiverford in those days, and  gentlemen jocks. Lawyer Brice rode his roan mare &mdash; Queen Charlotte they called  her. But after that he went wrong, folks said &mdash; speckilated with some money,  you see, that he didn&rsquo;t ought to have touched &mdash; and went to America, and died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Died in America, did he? Why the deuce couldn&rsquo;t he  die in Ullerton? I should fancy it was a pleasanter place to die in than it is  to live in. And how about his sons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawyer Brice&rsquo;s sons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My imbecile&rsquo;s lips expanded into a broad grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawyer Brice never had no sons,&rdquo; he exclaimed,  with a tone which seemed to express a contemptuous pity for my ignorance; &ldquo;he  never married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well; his brothers. He had brothers, I  suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as <em>I</em> ever heard tell on,&rdquo; answered my imbecile, relapsing into hopeless inanity.</p>
<p>It was clear that no further help was to be  obtained from him. I went to the landlord &mdash; a brisk business-like individual of  Transatlantic goaheadism. From him I learned that there were no Brices in  Ullerton, and never had been within the thirty years of his experience in that  town. He gave me an Ullerton directory in confirmation of that fact &mdash; a neat  little shilling volume, which I begged leave to keep for a quarter of an hour  before returning it.</p>
<p>Brice was evidently a failure. I turned to the  letter G, and looked up the name of Goodge. Goodge, Jonah, minister of Beulah  Chapel, resided at No. 7, Waterhouse-lane &mdash; the lane in which I had seen the  chapel.</p>
<p>I determined upon waiting on the worthy Goodge. He  may be able to enlighten me as to the name of the pastor who preached to the  Wesleyan flock in the time of Rebecca Caulfield; and from the descendants of  such pastor I may glean some straws and shreds of information. The pious  Rebecca would have been likely to confide much to her spiritual director. The  early Wesleyans had all the exaltation of the Quietists, and something of the  lunatic fervour of the Convulsionists, who kicked and screamed themselves into  epilepsy under the influence of the Unigenitus Bull. The pious Rebecca was no  doubt an enthusiast.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I found No. 7, Waterhouse-lane. It is a neat little  six-roomed house, with preternaturally green palings enclosing about sixty  square feet of bright yellow gravel, adorned by a row of whitewashed shells.  Some scarlet geraniums bloomed in pots of still more vivid scarlet; and the  sight of those bright red blossoms recalled Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s garden at  Bayswater, and that sweet girl by whose side I have walked its trim pathways.</p>
<p>But business is business; and if I am ever to sue  for my Charlotte&rsquo;s hand, I must present myself before her as the winner of the  three thousand. Remembering this, I lifted Mr. Goodge&rsquo;s knocker, and presently  found myself in conversation with that gentleman.</p>
<p>Whether unordained piety has a natural tendency to  become greasy of aspect, and whether, among the many miracles vouchsafed to the  amiable and really great Wesley, he received for his disciples of all time to  come the gift of a miraculous straightness and lankiness of hair, I know not;  but I do know that every Methodist parson I have had the honour to know has  been of one pattern, and that Mr. Goodge is no exception to the rule.</p>
<p>I am bound to record that I found him a very civil  person, quite willing to afford me any help in his power, and far more  practical and business-like than the rector of Dewsdale.</p>
<p>It seems that the gift of tongues descended on the  Goodges during the lifetime of John Wesley himself, and during the earlier part  of that teacher&rsquo;s career. It was a Goodge who preached in the draper&rsquo;s  warehouse, and it was the edifying discourse of a Goodge which developed the  piety of Miss Rebecca Caulfield, afterwards Mrs. Haygarth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Goodge was my great-uncle,&rdquo; said the  courteous Jonah, &ldquo;and there was no one in Ullerton better acquainted with  Rebecca Caulfield. I&rsquo;ve heard my grandmother talk of her many a time. She used  to send him poultry and garden-stuff from her house at Dewsdale, and at his  instigation she contributed handsomely to the erection of the chapel in which  it is my privilege to preach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt that I had struck upon a vein of gold. Here  was a sharp-witted, middle-aged man &mdash; not an ancient mariner, or a meandering  imbecile &mdash; who could remember the talk of a grandmother who had known Matthew  Haygarth&rsquo;s wife. And this visit to Mr. Goodge was my own idea, not prompted by  the far-seeing Sheldon. I felt myself advancing in the insidious arts of a  private inquirer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am employed in the prosecution of a business  which has a <em>remote</em> relation to the  Haygarth family history,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and if you can afford me any information on  that subject I should be extremely obliged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I emphasised the adjective &ldquo;remote,&rdquo; and felt  myself, in my humble way, a Talleyrand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of information, do you require?&rdquo; asked  Mr. Goodge thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any information respecting Matthew Haygarth or his  wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Goodge became profoundly meditative after this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not given to act unadvisedly,&rdquo; he began &mdash; and  I felt that I was in for a little professional discourse: &ldquo;the creatures of  impulse are the children of Satan, the babes of Lucifer, the infants of  Beelzebub. I take counsel in the silence of the night, and wait the whispers of  wisdom in the waking hours of darkness. You must allow me time to ponder this  business in my heart and to be still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told Mr. Goodge that I would willingly await his  own time for affording me any information in his power to give.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is pleasant,&rdquo; said the pastor blandly: &ldquo;the  worldly are apt to rush blindly through life, as the roaring lion rushes  through the forest. I am not one of those rushing worldlings. I presume, by the  way, that such information as I may afford is likely to become a source of  pecuniary profit to your employer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began to see that my friend Goodge and the rector  of Dewsdale were very different kind of people, and that I must play my cards  accordingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will depend upon the nature of your  information,&rdquo; I replied diplomatically; &ldquo;it may be worth something to us, or it  may be worthless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in case it should be worth something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case my employer would be glad to remunerate  the person from whom he obtained it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Goodge again became meditative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the habit of the sainted Wesley to take  counsel from the Scriptures,&rdquo; he said presently: &ldquo;if you will call again  tomorrow, young man, I shall have taken counsel, and may be able to entreat  with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not much relish being addressed as &ldquo;young  man,&rdquo; even by such a shining light as the Rev. Jonah Goodge. But as I wanted  the Rev. Jonah&rsquo;s aid, I submitted with a tolerable grace to his patriarchal  familiarity, and bade him good morning, after promising to call again on the  following day. I returned to my inn and wrote to Sheldon in time for the  afternoon mail, recounting my interview with Mr. Goodge, and asking how far I  should be authorised to remunerate that gentleman, or to pledge myself to  remunerate him for such information as he might have to dispose of.</p>
<p><em>Oct. 6th</em>. A letter from Sheldon.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;DEAR HAWKEHURST, &mdash; There may be something very  important behind that mysterious burial at Dewsdale. Go without delay to  Spotswold; examine registers, tombstones, &amp;c; hunt up oldest inhabitant or  inhabitants, from whom you may be able to discover whether any Haygarth or  Haygarths ever lived there, and all that is known respecting such Haygarth or  Haygarths. You have got a clue to <em>something</em>.  Follow it up till it breaks off short, as such clues often do, or till you find  it is only leading you on a wild-goose chase. The Dewsdale business is worth  investigation.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Mem. How about descendants of lawyer Brice? &mdash;  Yours truly, G.S.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;G.&rsquo;s Inn, Oct. 5th.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before starting for Spotswold it was necessary for  me to see Mr. Goodge. I found that gentleman in a pious and yet business-like  frame of mind. He had taken counsel from the Scriptures, like the founder of  his sect; but I fancy with rather less spiritual aspirations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The text upon which the lot fell was the 12th  verse of the 9th chapter in the Book of Proverbs, &lsquo;If thou be wise, thou shalt  be wise for thyself,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said solemnly; &ldquo;whereby I perceive that I shall not  be justified in parting with that which you seek without fitting recompense. I  ask you, therefore, young man, what are you prepared to give?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Jonah&rsquo;s tone could scarcely have been more  lofty, or his manner more patronising, if he had been Saul and I the humble  David; but a man who is trying to earn three thousand pounds must put up with a  great deal. Finding that the minister was prepared to play the huckster, I  employed no further ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The price must of course depend on the quality of  the article you have to sell,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I must know that before I can propose  terms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose my information took the form of letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Letters from whom &mdash; to whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Mrs. Rebecca Haygarth to my great-uncle,  Samson Goodge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many of such letters have you to sell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put it very plainly; but the Rev. Jonah&rsquo;s  susceptibilities were not of the keenest order. He did not wince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say forty odd letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I pricked up my ears; and it needed all my  diplomacy to enable me to conceal my sense of triumph. Forty odd letters! There  must be an enormous amount of information in forty odd letters; unless the  woman wrote the direst twaddle ever penned by a feminine correspondent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over what period do the dates of these letters  extend?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over about seven years; from 1769 to 1776.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four years prior to the marriage with our friend  Matthew; three years after the marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they tolerably long letters, or mere scrawls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were written in a period when nobody wrote  short letters,&rdquo; answered Mr. Goodge sententiously,&mdash; &ldquo;the period of Bath post and  dear postage. The greater number of the epistles cover three sides of a sheet  of letter-paper; and Mrs. Rebecca&rsquo;s caligraphy was small and neat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;I suppose it is no use my  asking you to let me see one of these letters before striking a bargain &mdash; eh,  Mr. Goodge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think not,&rdquo; answered the oily old hypocrite. &ldquo;I have  taken counsel, and I will abide by the light that has been shown me. &lsquo;If thou  be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself;&rsquo; such are the words of inspiration.  No, I think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you ask for the forty odd letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stiff sum, Mr. Goodge, for forty sheets of old  letter-paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if they were not likely to be valuable, you  would scarcely happen to want them,&rdquo; answered the minister. &ldquo;I have taken  counsel, young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those are your lowest terms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot accept sixpence less. It is not in me to  go from my word. As Jacob served Laban seven years, and again another seven  years, having promised, so do I abide by my bond. Having said twenty pounds,  young man, Heaven forbid that I should take so much as twenty pence less than  those twenty pounds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The solemn unction with which he pronounced this  twaddle is beyond description. The pretence of conscientious feeling which he  contrived to infuse into his sordid bargain-driving might have done honour to  Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s Tartuffe. Seeing that he was determined to stick to his terms, I  departed. I telegraphed to Sheldon for instructions as to whether I was to give  Goodge the money he asked, and then went back to my inn, where I devoted myself  for the next ten minutes to the study of a railway time-table, with a view to  finding the best route to Spotswold.</p>
<p>After a close perusal of bewildering strings of  proper names and dazzling columns of figures, I found a place called Black  Harbour, &ldquo;for Wisborough, Spotswold, and Chilton.&rdquo; A train left Ullerton for  Black Harbour at six o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and was due at the latter place  at 8.40.</p>
<p>This gave me an interval of some hours, in which I  could do nothing, unless I received a telegram from Sheldon. The chance of a  reply from him kept me a prisoner in the coffee-room of the Swan Inn, where I  read almost every line in the local and London newspapers pending the arrival  of the despatch, which came at last.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Tell Goodge he shall have the sum asked, and get  the letters at once.<br>
  Money by to-night&rsquo;s post.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was Sheldon&rsquo;s message; sharp and short, and  within the eighteen penny limit. Acting upon this telegram, I returned to the  abode of Mr. Goodge, told him his terms were to be complied with, showed him  the telegram, at his request, and asked for the letters.</p>
<p>I ought to have known my reverend friend better  than to imagine he would part with those ancient documents except for money  upon the counter.</p>
<p>He smiled a smile which might have illuminated the  visage of<br>
  Machiavelli.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letters have kept a long time, young man,&rdquo; he  said, after having studied the telegram as closely as if it had been written in  Punic; &ldquo;and to you, they are in nowise the worse for keeping: so they will keep  yet longer. &lsquo;If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself.&rsquo; You can come for  the letters tomorrow, and bring the money with you. Say at 11 A.M.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put on my hat and bade my friend good day. I have  often been tempted to throw things at people, and have withheld my hand; but I  never felt Satan so strong upon me as at that moment, and I very much fear that  if I had had anything in the way of a kitchen-poker or a carving-knife about  me, I should have flung that missile at the patriarchal head of my saintly  Jonah. As it was, I bade him good day and returned to the Swan, where I took a  hurried repast and started for the station, carrying a light carpet-bag with  me, as I was not likely to return till the following night, at the earliest.</p>
<p>I arrived at the station ten minutes before the  starting of the train, and had to endure ten minutes of that weariness called  waiting. I exhausted the interest of all the advertisements on the station  walls; found out how I could have my furniture removed with the utmost  convenience &mdash; supposing myself to possess furniture; discovered where I ought  to buy a dinner-service, and the most agreeable kind of blind to screen my  windows in sunny weather. I was still lingering over the description of this  new invention in blinds, when a great bell set up a sudden clanging, and the  down train from London came thundering into the station.</p>
<p>This was also the train for Black Harbour. There  were a good many passengers going northwards, a good many alighting at  Ullerton; and in the hurry and confusion I had some difficulty in finding a  place in a second-class carriage, the passengers therein blocking up the  windows with that unamiable exclusiveness peculiar to railway travellers. I  found a place at last, however; but in hurrying from carriage to carriage I was  startled by an occurrence which I have since pondered very seriously.</p>
<p>I ran bolt against my respected friend and patron  Horatio Paget.</p>
<p>We had only time to recognise each other with  exclamations of mutual surprise when the clanging bell rang again, and I was  obliged to scuffle into my seat. A moment&rsquo;s delay would have caused me to be  left behind. And to have remained behind would have been very awkward for me;  as the Captain would undoubtedly have questioned me as to my business in  Ullerton. Was I not supposed to be at Dorking, enjoying the hospitality of an  aged aunt?</p>
<p>It would have been unlucky to lose that train.</p>
<p>But what &ldquo;makes&rdquo; the gallant Captain in Ullerton?  That is a question which I deliberated as the train carried me towards Black  Harbour.</p>
<p>Sheldon warned me of the necessity for secrecy, and  I have been as secret as the grave. It is therefore next to an impossibility  that Horatio Paget can have any idea of the business I am engaged in. He is the  very man of all others to try and supersede me if he had an inkling of my  plans; but I am convinced he can have no such inkling.</p>
<p>And yet the advertisement of the Haygarth property  in the <em>Times</em> was as open to the  notice of all the world as it was open to the notice of George Sheldon. What if  my patron should have been struck by the same advertisement, and should have  come to Ullerton on the same business?</p>
<p>It is possible, but it is not likely. When I left  town the Captain was engaged in Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s affairs. He has no doubt come  to Ullerton on Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s business. The town, which seems an abomination  of desolation to a man who is accustomed to London and Paris, is nevertheless a  commercial centre; and the stockbroker&rsquo;s schemes may involve the simple  Ullertonians, as well as the more experienced children of the metropolis.</p>
<p>Having thought the business out thus, I gave myself  no further trouble about the unexpected appearance of my friend and benefactor.</p>
<p>At Black Harbour I found a coach, which carried me  to Spotswold, whither I travelled in a cramped and painful position as regards  my legs, and with a pervading sensation which was like a determination of  luggage to the brain, so close to my oppressed head was the heavily-laden roof  of the vehicle. It was pitch dark when I and two fellow-passengers of  agricultural aspect were turned out of the coach at Spotswold, which in the  gloom of night appeared to consist of half a dozen houses shut in from the road  by ghastly white palings, a grim looming church, and a low-roofed inn with a feeble  light glimmering athwart a red stuff curtain.</p>
<p>At this inn I was fain to take up my abode for the  night, and was conducted to a little whitewashed bedchamber, draperied with  scanty dimity and smelling of apples &mdash; the humblest, commonest cottage chamber,  but clean and decent, and with a certain countrified aspect which was pleasing  to me. I fancied myself the host of such an inn, with Charlotte for my wife;  and it seemed to me that it would be nice to live in that remote and unknown  village, &ldquo;the world forgetting, by the world forgot.&rdquo; I beguiled myself by such  foolish fancies &mdash; I, who have been reared amidst the clamour and riot of the  Strand!</p>
<p>Should I be happy with that dear girl if she were  mine? Alas! I doubt it. A man who has led a disreputable life up to the age of  seven-and-twenty is very likely to have lost all capacity for such pure and  perfect happiness as that which good men find in the tranquil haven of a home.</p>
<p>Should I not hear the rattle of the billiard-balls,  or the voice of the <em>croupier</em> calling  the main, as I sat by my quiet fireside? Should I not yearn for the glitter and  confusion of West-end dancing-rooms, or the mad excitement of the ring, while  my innocent young wife was sitting by my side and asking me to look at the blue  eyes of my first-born?</p>
<p>No; Charlotte is not for me. There must be always  the two classes &mdash; the sheep and the goats; and my lot has been cast among the  goats.</p>
<p>And yet there are some people who laugh to scorn  the doctrines of
  Calvin, and say there is no such thing as predestination.</p>
<p>Is there not predestination? Was not I predestined  to be born in a gaol and reared in a gutter, educated among swindlers and  scoundrels, fed upon stolen victuals, and clad in garments never to be paid  for? Did no Eumenides preside over the birth of Richard Savage, so set apart  for misery that the laws of nature were reversed, and even his mother hated  him? Did no dismal fatality follow the footsteps of Chatterton? Has no  mysterious ban been laid upon the men who have been called Dukes of Buckingham?</p>
<p>What foolish lamentations am I scribbling in this  diary, which is intended to be only the baldest record of events! It is so  natural to mankind to complain, that, having no ear in which to utter his  discontent, a man is fain to resort to pen and ink.</p>
<p>I devoted my evening to conversation with the  landlord and his wife, but found that the name of Haygarth was as strange to  them as if it had been taken from an inscription in the tomb of the Pharaohs. I  inquired about the few inhabitants of the village, and ascertained that the  oldest man in the place is the sexton, native-born, and supposed by mine host  never to have travelled twenty miles from his birthplace. His name is Peter  Drabbles. What extraordinary names that class of people contrive to have! My first  business to-morrow morning will be to find my friend Drabbles &mdash; another ancient  mariner, no doubt &mdash; and to examine the parish registers.</p>
<p><em>Oct. 7th</em>. A misty morning, and a  perpetual drizzle &mdash; to say nothing of a damp, penetrating cold, which creeps  through the thickest overcoat, and chills one to the bone. I do not think  Spotswold can have much brightness or prettiness even on the fairest summer  morning that ever beautified the earth. I know that, seen as I see it to-day,  the place is the very archetype of all that is darksome, dull, desolate,  dismal, and dreary. (How odd, by the way, that all that family of epithets  should have the same initial!) A wide stretch of moorland lies around and about  the little village, which crouches in a hollow, like some poor dejected animal  that seeks to shelter itself from the bitter blast. On the edge of the  moorland, and above the straggling cottages and the little inn, rises the  massive square tower of an old church, so far out of proportion to the pitiful  cluster of houses, that I imagine it must be the remnant of some monastic  settlement.</p>
<p>Towards this church I made my way, under the  dispiriting drip, drip of the rain, and accompanied by a feeble old man, who is  sexton, clerk, gravedigger, and anything or everything of an official nature.</p>
<p>We went into the church after my ancient mariner  No. 2 had fumbled a good deal with a bunch of ghostly-looking keys. The door  opened with a dismal scroop, and shut with an appalling bang. Grim and dark as  the church is without, it is grimmer and darker within, and damp and  vault-like, <em>&agrave; faire fr&eacute;mir</em>. There are  all the mysterious cupboards and corners peculiar to such edifices; an  organ-loft, from which weird noises issue at every opening or closing of a  door; a vaulted roof, which echoes one&rsquo;s footsteps with a moan, as of some  outraged spirit hovering in empty space, and ejaculating piteously, &ldquo;Another  impious intruder after the sacramental plate! another plebeian sole trampling  on the brasses of the De Montacutes, lords of the manor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vestry is, if anything, more ghostly than the  general run of vestries; but the business mind is compelled to waive all  considerations of a supernatural character. For the moment there flashed across  my brain the shadows of all the Christmas stories I had ever read or heard  concerning vestries; the phantom bridal, in which the bride&rsquo;s beautiful white  hand changed to the bony fingers of a skeleton as she signed the register; the  unearthly christening, in which all at once, after the ceremony having been conducted  with the utmost respectability, to the edification of the unauthorised intruder  hiding behind a pillar, the godfathers and godmothers, nurse and baby, priest  and clerk, became in a moment dilapidated corpses; whereon the appalled  intruder fell prone at the foot of his pillar, there to be discovered the next  morning by his friends, and the public generally, with his hair blanched to an  awful whiteness, or his noble intellect degraded to idiocy. For a moment, the  memory of about a hundred Christmas stories was too much for me &mdash; so weird of  aspect and earthy of atmosphere was the vestry at Spotswold. And then &ldquo;being  gone&rdquo; the shadows of the Christmas stories, I was a man and a lawyer&rsquo;s clerk  again, and set myself assiduously to search the registers and interrogate my  ancient.</p>
<p>I found that individual a creature of mental  fogginess compared with whom my oldest inhabitant of Ullerton would have been a  Pitt, Earl of Chatham. But I questioned and cross-questioned him until I had in  a manner turned his poor old wits the seamy side without, and had discovered,  first, that he had never known any one called Haygarth in the whole course of  those seventy-five years&rsquo; vegetation which politeness compelled me to speak of  as his &ldquo;life;&rdquo; secondly, that he had never known any one who knew a Haygarth;  thirdly, that he was intimately acquainted with every creature in the village,  and that he knew that no one of the inhabitants could give me the smallest  shred of such information as I required.</p>
<p>Having extorted so much as this from my ancient  with unutterable expenditure of time and trouble, I next set to work upon the  registers.</p>
<p>If the ink manufactured in the present century is  of no more durable nature than that abominable fluid employed in the penmanship  of a hundred years ago, I profoundly pity the generations that are to come  after us. The registers of Spotswold might puzzle a Bunsen. However, bearing in  mind the incontrovertible fact that three thousand pounds is a very agreeable  sum of money, I stuck to my work for upwards of two hours, and obtained as a  result the following entries: &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;1. Matthew Haygarthe, aged foure yeares, berrid in  this churcheyarde, over against ye tombe off Mrs. Marttha Stileman, about 10  fete fromm ye olde yue tre. Febevarie 6th, 1753.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;2. Mary Haygarthe, aged twentie sevene yeers,  berrid under ye yue tree, Nov. 21, 1754.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After copying these two entries, I went out into  the churchyard to look for Mary Haygarth&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p>Under a fine old yew &mdash; which had been old a hundred  years ago, it seems &mdash; I found huddled amongst other headstones one so incrusted  with moss, that it was only after scraping the parasite verdure from the stone  with my penknife that I was able to discover the letters that had been cut upon  it. I found at last a brief inscription:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here lieth ye body of MARY HAYGARTH, aged 27. Born  1727. Died 1754. This stone has been set up by one who sorroweth without hope  of consolation.&rdquo; A strange epitaph: no scrap of Latin, no text from Scripture,  no conventional testimony to the virtues and accomplishments of the departed,  no word to tell whether the dead woman had been maid, wife, or widow. It was  the most provoking inscription for a lawyer or a genealogist, but such as might  have pleased a poet.</p>
<p>I fancy this Mary Haygarth must have been some quiet  creature, with very few friends to sorrow for her loss; perhaps only that one  person who sorrowed without hope of consolation.</p>
<p>Such a tombstone might have been set above the  grave of that simple maid who dwelt &ldquo;beside the banks of Dove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the uttermost that my patience or ingenuity  can do for me at Spotswold. I have exhausted every possibility of obtaining  further information. So, having written and posted my report to Sheldon, I have  no more to do but to return to Ullerton. I take back with me nothing but the  copy of the two entries in the register of burials. Who this Matthew Haygarth  or this Mary Haygarth was, and how related to <em>the</em> Matthew, is an enigma not to be solved at Spotswold.</p>
<p>Here the story of the Haygarths ends with the grave  under the yew-tree.</p>

  Betrayed By A Blotting-Pad</h2>
<p>At an early hour upon the day on which Valentine  Hawkehurst telegraphed to his employer, Philip Sheldon presented himself again  at the dingy door of the office in Gray&rsquo;s Inn.</p>
<p>The dingy door was opened by the still more dingy  boy; and Mr. Sheldon the elder &mdash; who lived in a state of chronic hurry, and had  a hansom cab in attendance upon him at almost every step of his progress  through life &mdash; was aggravated by the discovery that his brother was out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out!&rdquo; he repeated, with supreme disgust; &ldquo;he  always <em>is</em> out, I think.
  Where is he to be found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy replied that his master would be back in  half an hour, if Mr.
  Sheldon would like to wait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like to wait!&rdquo; cried the stockbroker; &ldquo;when will  lawyers&rsquo; clerks have sense enough to know that nobody on this earth ever <em>liked</em> to wait? Where&rsquo;s your master  gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s just slipped round into Holborn,  sir,&rdquo; the boy replied, with some slight hesitation. He was very well aware that  George had secrets from his brother, and that it was not judicious to be too  free in his communications to the elder gentleman. But the black eyes and white  teeth of the stockbroker seemed very awful to him; and if Philip chose to  question him, he must needs answer the truth, not having been provided by his  master with any convenient falsehood in case of inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What part of Holborn?&rdquo; asked Philip sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did hear tell as it was the telegraph office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Sheldon; and then he dashed  downstairs, leaving the lad on the threshold of the door staring after him with  eyes of wonder.</p>
<p>The telegraph office meant business; and any  business of his brother&rsquo;s was a matter of interest to Mr. Sheldon at this  particular period. He had meditated the meaning of George&rsquo;s triumphant smile in  the secluded calm of his own office; and the longer he had meditated, the more  deeply rooted had become his conviction that his brother was engaged in some  very deep and very profitable scheme, the nature of which it was his bounden  duty to discover.</p>
<p>Impressed by this idea, Mr. Sheldon returned to the  hansom-cab, which was waiting for him at the end of Warwick-court, and made his  way to the telegraph office. The ostensible motive of his call in Gray&rsquo;s Inn  was sufficient excuse for this following up of his brother&rsquo;s footsteps. It was  one of those waifs and strays of rather disreputable business which the elder  man sometimes threw in the way of the younger.</p>
<p>As the wheel of the hansom ground against the  kerbstone in front of the telegraph office, the figure of George Sheldon  vanished in a little court to the left of that establishment. Instead of  pursuing this receding figure, Philip Sheldon walked straight into the office.</p>
<p>It was empty. There was no one in any of the shaded  compartments, so painfully suggestive of pecuniary distress and the stealthy  hypothecation of portable property. A sound of rattling and bumping in an inner  office betrayed the neighbourhood of a clerk; but in the office Mr. Sheldon was  alone.</p>
<p>Upon the blotting-pad on the counter of the central  partition the stockbroker perceived one great blot of ink, still moist. He laid  the tip of his square forefinger upon it, to assure himself of that fact, and  then set himself deliberately to scrutinise the blotting-paper. He was a man  who seldom hesitated. His greatest <em>coups</em> on the money-market had been in a great measure the result of this faculty of  prompt decision. To-day he possessed himself of the blotting-pad, and examined  the half-formed syllables stamped upon it with as much coolness and self-possession  as if he had been seated in his own office reading his own newspaper. A man  given to hesitation would have looked to the right and the left and watched for  his opportunity &mdash; and lost it. Philip Sheldon knew better than to waste his  chances by needless precaution; and he made himself master of all the  intelligence the blotting-pad could afford him before the clerk emerged from  the inner den where the rattling and stamping was going forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; muttered the stockbroker, as  he recognised traces of his brother&rsquo;s sprawling penmanship upon the pad. The  message had been written with a heavy hand and a spongy quill pen, and had left  a tolerably clear impression of its contents on the blotting-paper.</p>
<p>Here and there the words stood out bold and clear;  here and there, again, there was only one decipherable letter amongst a few  broken hieroglyphics. Mr. Sheldon was accustomed to the examination of very  illegible documents, and he was able to master the substance of that random  impression. If he could not decipher the whole, he made out sufficient for his  purpose. Money was to be offered to a man called Goodge for certain letters. He  knew his brother&rsquo;s affairs well enough to know that these letters for which  money was to be offered must needs be letters of importance in some search for  an heir-at-law. So far all was clear and simple; but beyond this point he found  himself at fault. Where was this Goodge to be found? and who was the person  that was to offer him money for the letters? The names and address, which had  been written first, had left no impression on the blotting-pad, or an  impression so faint as to be useless for any practical purpose.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon put down the pad and lingered by the  door of the office deliberating, when the rattling and hammering came to an  abrupt termination, and the clerk emerged from the interior den.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all right. Your message  shall go directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stockbroker, whose face was half averted from  the clerk, and who stood between that functionary and the light from the open  doorway, at once comprehended the error that had arisen. The clerk had mistaken  him for his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not quite clear as to whether I gave the right  address,&rdquo; he said promptly, with his face still averted, and his attention apparently  occupied by a paper in his hand. &ldquo;Just see how I wrote it, there&rsquo;s a good  fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clerk withdrew for a few minutes, and returned  with the message in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From George Sheldon to Valentine Hawkehurst, Black  Swan Inn,<br>
  Ullerton,&rdquo; he read aloud from the document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, and thanks,&rdquo; cried the stockbroker.</p>
<p>He gave one momentary glance at the clerk, and had  just time to see that individual&rsquo;s look of bewilderment as some difference in  his voice and person from the voice and person of the black-whiskered man who  had just left the office dawned upon his troubled senses. After that one glance  Mr. Sheldon darted across the pavement, sprang into his cab, and called to the  driver, &ldquo;Literary Institution, Burton-street, as fast as you can go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try my luck in the second column of the <em>Times</em>,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;If George&rsquo;s  scheme is what I take it to be, I shall get some clue to it there.&rdquo; He took a  little oblong memorandum-book from his pocket, and looked at his memoranda of  the past week. Among those careless jottings he found one memorandum scrawled  in pencil, amongst notes and addresses in ink, &ldquo;<em>Haygarth &mdash; intestate. G.S. to see after.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;Haygarth &mdash; intestate;  Valentine Hawkehurst <em>not</em> at Dorking,  but working for my brother; Goodge &mdash; letters to be paid for. It&rsquo;s all like the  bits of mosaic that those antiquarian fellows are always finding in the ruins  of Somebody&rsquo;s Baths; a few handfuls of coloured chips that look like rubbish,  and can yet be patched into a perfect geometric design. I&rsquo;ll hunt up a file of  the <em>Times</em> at the Burton Institution,  and find out this Haygarth, if he is to be found there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Burton Institution was a somewhat dingy temple  devoted to the interests of science and literature, and next door to some baths  that were very popular among the denizens of Bloomsbury. People in quest of the  baths were apt to ascend the classic flight of steps leading to the  Institution, when they should have descended to a lowlier threshold lurking  modestly by the side of that edifice. The Baths and the Institution had both  been familiar to Mr. Sheldon in that period of probation which he had spent in  Fitzgeorge-street. He was sufficiently acquainted with the librarian of the  Institution to go in and out uninterrogated, and to make any use he pleased of  the reading-room. He went in to-day, asked to see the latest bound volumes of  the <em>Times</em> and the latest files of  unbound papers, and began his investigation, working backwards. Rapidly and  dexterously as he turned the big leaves of the journals, the investigation  occupied nearly three-quarters of an hour; but at the expiration of that time  he had alighted on the advertisement published in the March of the preceding  year.</p>
<p>He gave a very low whistle &mdash; a kind of phantom  whistle &mdash; as he read this advertisement. &ldquo;John Haygarth! &mdash; a hundred thousand  pounds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fortune for which a claimant was lacking  amounted to a hundred thousand pounds! Mr. Sheldon knew commercial despots who  counted their wealth by millions, and whose fiat could sway the exchanges of  Europe; but a hundred thousand pounds seemed to him a very nice thing  nevertheless, and he was ready to dispute the prize the anticipation whereof  had rendered his brother so triumphant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has rejected me as a coadjutor,&rdquo; he thought, as  he went back to his cab after having copied the advertisement; &ldquo;he shall have  me as an antagonist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Omega-street, Chelsea, next call,&rdquo; he cried to the  driver; and was soon beyond the confines of Bloomsbury, and rattling away  towards the border-land of Belgravia. He had completed his search of the  newspapers at ten minutes past twelve, and at twenty minutes to one he  presented himself at the lodging-house in Omega-street, where he found Captain  Paget, in whose &ldquo;promoting&rdquo; business there happened to be a lull just now. With  this gentleman he had a long interview; and the result of that interview was  the departure of the Captain by the two o&rsquo;clock express for Ullerton. Thus had  it happened that Valentine Hawkehurst and his patron encountered each other on  the platform of Ullerton station.</p>

  Valentine Invokes The Phantoms Of The Past</h2>
<p><em>Oct. 7th, midnight</em>. I was so fortunate as to  get away from Spotswold this morning very soon after the completion of my  researches in the vestry, and at five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon I found myself  once more in the streets of Ullerton. Coming home in the train I meditated  seriously upon the unexpected appearance of Horatio Paget at the head-quarters  of this Haygarthian investigation; and the more I considered that fact, the  more I felt inclined to doubt my patron&rsquo;s motives, and to fear his  interference. Can his presence in Ullerton have any relation to the business  that has brought me here? That is the question which I asked myself a hundred  times during my journey from Spotswold; that is the question which I ask myself  still.</p>
<p>I have no doubt I give myself unnecessary trouble;  but I know that old man&rsquo;s Machiavellian cleverness only too well; and I am  inclined to look with suspicion upon every action of his. My first business on  returning to this house was to ascertain whether any one bearing his name, or  answering to my description of him, had arrived during my absence. I was  relieved by finding that no stranger whatever had put up at the inn since the  previous forenoon. Who may have used the coffee-room is another question, not  so easily set at rest. In the evening a great many people come in and go out;  and my friend and patron may have taken his favourite brandy-and-soda, skimmed  his newspaper, and picked up whatever information was to be obtained as to <em>my</em> movements without attracting any  particular attention.</p>
<p>In the words of the immortal lessee of the Globe  Theatre, &ldquo;Why I should fear I know not &hellip; and yet I feel I fear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found a registered letter from George Sheldon, enclosing  twenty pounds in notes, and furnished therewith I went straight to my friend  Jonah, whom I found engaged in the agreeable occupation of taking tea. I showed  him the money; but my estimate of the reverend gentleman&rsquo;s honour being of a  very limited nature, I took care not to give it to him till he had produced the  letters. On finding that I was really prepared to give him his price, he went  to an old-fashioned bureau, and opened one of those secret recesses which  cannot for three minutes remain a secret to any investigator possessed of a  tolerably accurate eye or a three-foot rule. From this hiding-place &mdash; which he  evidently considered a triumph of mechanical art, worthy the cabinet of a  D&rsquo;Argenson or a Fouch&eacute; &mdash; he produced a packet of faded yellow letters, about  which there lurked a faint odour of dried rose-leaves and lavender, which  seemed the very perfume of the past.</p>
<p>When my reverend friend had laid the packet on the  table within reach of my hand, and not till then, I gave him the bank-notes.  His fat old fingers closed upon them greedily, and his fishy old eyes were  illumined by a faint glimmer which I believe nothing but bank-notes could have  kindled in them.</p>
<p>After having assured himself that they were genuine  acknowledgments of indebtedness on the part of the old lady in  Thread-needle-street, and not the base simulacra of Birmingham at  five-and-twenty shillings a dozen &mdash; thirteen as twelve &mdash; Mr. Goodge obligingly  consented to sign a simple form of receipt which I had drawn up for the  satisfaction of my principal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you said there were forty-odd letters,&rdquo; I  remarked, before I proceeded to count the documents in the presence of Mr.  Goodge.</p>
<p>That gentleman looked at me with an air of  astonishment, which, had I not known him to be the most consummate of  hypocrites, would have seemed to be simplicity itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said from thirty to forty,&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;I  never said there were forty-odd letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at him and he looked at me. His face told  me plainly enough that he was trying to deceive me, and my face told him  plainly enough that he had no chance of succeeding in that attempt. Whether he  was keeping back some of the letters with a view to extorting more money from  me hereafter, or whether he was keeping them with the idea of making a better bargain  with somebody else, I could not tell; but of the main fact I was certain &mdash; he  had cheated me.</p>
<p>I untied the red tape which held the letters  together. Yes, there was a piece of circumstantial evidence which might have  helped to convict my friend had he been on his trial in a criminal court. The  red tape bore the mark of the place in which it had been tied for half a  century; and a little way within this mark the trace of a very recent tying.  Some of the letters had been extracted, and the tape had been tied anew.</p>
<p>I had no doubt that this had been done while my  negotiation with Mr. Goodge had been pending. What was I to do? Refuse the  letters, and demand to have my principal&rsquo;s money returned to me? I knew my  friend well enough to know that such a proceeding would be about as useless as  it would be to request the ocean to restore a cup of water that had been poured  into it. The letters he had given me might or might not afford some slight link  in the chain I was trying to put together; and the letters withheld from me  might be more or less valuable than those given to me. In any case the  transaction was altogether a speculative one; and George Sheldon&rsquo;s money was  hazarded as completely as if it had been put upon an outsider for the Derby.</p>
<p>Before bidding him a polite farewell, I was  determined to make Mr.
  Goodge thoroughly aware that he had not taken me in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said there were more than forty letters,&rdquo; I  told him; &ldquo;I remember the phrase &lsquo;forty-odd,&rsquo; which is a colloquialism one  would scarcely look for in Tillotson or in John Wesley, who cherished a  prejudice in favour of scholarship which does not distinguish all his  followers. You said there were forty-odd letters, and you have removed some of  them from the packet. I am quite aware that I have no legal remedy against you,  as our contract was a verbal one, made without witnesses; so I must be content  with what I get; but I do not wish you to flatter yourself with the notion that  you have hoodwinked a lawyer&rsquo;s clerk. You are not clever enough to do that, Mr.  Goodge, though you are knave enough to cheat every attorney in the Law List.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, are you aware &mdash;&mdash; ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I have suffered by the absence of any witness  to our negotiation, I may as well profit by the absence of any witness to our  interview. You are a cheat and a trickster, Mr. Goodge, and I have the honour  to wish you good afternoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go forth, young man!&rdquo; cried the infuriated Jonah  whose fat round face became beet-root colour with rage, and who involuntarily  extended his hand to the poker &mdash; for the purpose of defence and not defiance, I  believe. &ldquo;Go forth, young man! I say unto you, as Abimelech said unto Jedediah,  go forth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am not quite clear as to the two scriptural  proper names with which the Rev. Jonah embellished his discourse on this occasion;  but I know that sort of man always has a leaning to the Abimelech and Jedediahs  of biblical history; solely, I believe, because the names have a sonorous roll  with them that is pleasant in the mouth of the charlatan.</p>
<p>As I was in the act of going forth &mdash; quite at my  leisure, for I had no fear of the clerical poker &mdash; my eye happened to alight on  a small side-table, covered with a chessboard-patterned cloth in gaudy colours,  and adorned with some of those sombre volumes which seem like an outward  evidence of the sober piety of their possessor. Among the sombre volumes lay  something which savoured of another hemisphere than that to which those brown  leather-bound books belonged. It was a glove &mdash; a gentleman&rsquo;s glove, of pale  lavender kid &mdash; small in size for a masculine glove, and bearing upon it the  evidence of the cleaner&rsquo;s art. Such might be the glove of an exiled Brummel,  but could never have encased the squat paw of a Jonah Goodge. It was as if the <em>point d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on</em> ruffle of Chesterfield  had been dropped in the study of John Wesley.</p>
<p>In a moment there flashed into my mind an idea  which has haunted me ever since. That glove had belonged to my respected  patron, Horatio Paget, and it was for his benefit the letters had been  abstracted from the packet. He had been with Jonah Goodge in the course of that  day, and had bought him over to cheat me.</p>
<p>And then I was obliged to go back to the old  question, Was it possible that the Captain could have any inkling of my  business? Who could have told him?</p>
<p>Who could have betrayed a secret which was known  only to George Sheldon and myself?</p>
<p>After all, are there not other people than Horatio  Paget who wear cleaned lavender gloves? But it always has been a habit with the  Captain to leave one loose glove behind him; and I daresay it was the  recollection of this which suggested the idea of his interference in the Goodge  business.</p>
<p>I devoted my evening to the perusal of Mrs. Rebecca  Haygarth&rsquo;s letters. The pale ink, the quaint cramped hand, the old-fashioned  abbreviations, and very doubtful orthography rendered the task laborious; but I  stuck to my work bravely, and the old clock in the market-place struck two as I  began the last letter. As I get deeper into this business I find my interest in  it growing day by day &mdash; an interest <em>sui  generis</em>, apart from all prospect of gain &mdash; apart even from the  consideration that by means of this investigation I am obtaining a living which  is earned <em>almost</em> honestly; for if I  tell an occasional falsehood or act an occasional hypocrisy, I am no worse than  a secretary of legation of an Old Bailey barrister.</p>
<p>The pleasure which I now take in the progress of  this research is a pleasure that is new to me: it is the stimulus which makes a  breakneck gallop across dreary fields gridironed with dykes and stone walls so  delicious to the sportsman; it is the stimulus which makes the task of the  mathematician sweet to him when he devotes laborious days to the solution of an  abstruse problem; it is the stimulus that sustains the Indian trapper against  all the miseries of cold and hunger, foul weather, and aching limbs; it is the  fever of the chase &mdash; that inextinguishable fire which, once lighted in the  human breast, is not to be quenched until the hunt is ended.</p>
<p>I should like to earn three thousand pounds; but if  I were to be none the richer for my trouble, I think, now that I am so deeply  involved in this business, I should still go on. I want to fathom the mystery  of that midnight interment at Dewsdale; I want to know the story of that Mary  Haygarth who lies under the old yew-tree at Spotswold, and for whose loss some  one sorrowed without hope of consolation.</p>
<p>Was that a widower&rsquo;s commonplace, I wonder, and did  the unknown mourner console himself ultimately with a new wife? Who knows? as  my Italian friends say when they discuss the future of France. Shall I ever  penetrate that mystery of the past? My task seems to me almost as hopeless as  if George Sheldon had set me to hunt up the descendants of King Solomon&rsquo;s  ninety-ninth wife. A hundred years ago seems as far away, for all practical  purposes, as if it were on the other side of the flood.</p>
<p>The letters are worth very little. They are prim  and measured epistles, and they relate much more to spiritual matters than to  temporal business. Mrs. Rebecca seems to have been so much concerned for the  health of her soul that she had very little leisure to think of anything so  insignificant as the bodies of other people. The letters are filled with  discourses upon her own state of mind; and the tone of them reveals not a  little of that pride whose character it is to simulate humility. Mrs. Rebecca  is always casting ashes on her head; but she takes care to let her friend and  pastor know what a saintly head it is notwithstanding.</p>
<p>I have laid aside three of the most secular  letters, which I selected after wading through unnumbered pages of bewailings  in the strain of a Wesleyan Madame Guyon. These throw some little light upon  the character of Matthew Haygarth, but do not afford much information of a  tangible kind. I have transcribed the letters verbatim, adhering even to  certain eccentricities of orthography which were by no means unusual in an age  when the Pretender to the crown of Great Britain wrote of his father as <em>Gems</em>.</p>
<p>The first letter bears the date of August 30th,  1773, one week after the marriage of the lady to our friend Matthew.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;REVERED FRIEND AND PASTOR, &mdash; On Monday sennite we  arriv&rsquo;d in London, wich seems to me a mighty bigg citty, but of no more meritt  or piety than Babylon of old. My husband, who knows ye towne better than he knows  those things with wich it would more become him to be familiar, was pleas&rsquo;d to  laugh mightily at that pious aversion wherewith I regarded some of ye most  notable sights in this place. We went t&rsquo;other night to a great garden called by  some Spring Garden, by others Vauxhall, &mdash; as having been at one time ye  residence or estate of that Arch Fiend and Papistical traitor Vaux, or Faux;  but although I felt obligated to my husband for ye desire to entertain me with  a fine sight, I could not but look with shame upon serious Christians  disporting themselves like children amongst coloured lamps, and listening as if  enraptured to profane music, when, at so much less cost of money or of health,  they might have been assembled together to improve and edify one another.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;My obliging Mathew would have taken me to other  places of the like character; but inspir&rsquo;d, as I hope and believe, by ye  direction of ye spirit, I took upon myself to tell him what vain trifling is  all such kind of pleasure. He argu&rsquo;d with me stoutly, saying that ye King and  Queen, who are both shining examples of goodness and piety, do attend Vauxhall  and Ranelagh, and are to be seen there frequent, to the delight of their  subjects. On which I told him that, much as I esteemed my sovereign and his  respectable consort, I would compleat my existence without having seen them  rather than I would seek to encounter them in a place of vain and frivolous  diversion. He listen&rsquo;d to my discoorse in a kind and sober temper, but he was  not convinc&rsquo;d; for by and by he falls of a sudden to sighing and groaning, and  cries out, &lsquo;O, I went to Vauxhall once when ye garden was not many years made,  and O, how bright ye lamps shone, like ye stars of heaven fallen among bushes!  and O, how sweet ye music sounded, like ye hymns of angels in ye dewy evening!  but that was nigh upon twenty years gone by, and all ye world is changed since  then.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;You will conceive, Reverend Sir, that I was  scandalised by such a foolish rapsodie, and in plain words admonish&rsquo;d my  husband of his folly. Whereupon he speedily became sober, and asked my pardon;  but for all that night continued of a gloomy countenance, ever and anon falling  to sighing and groning as before. Indeed, honour&rsquo;d Sir, I have good need of a  patient sperrit in my dealings with him; for altho&rsquo; at times I think he is in a  fair way to become a Christian, there are other times when I doubt Satan has  still a hold upon him, and that all my prayers and admonitions have been in  vaine.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;You, who know the wildness and wickedness of his  past life &mdash; so far as that life was ever known to any but himself, who was ever  of a secret and silent disposition concerning his own doings in this city, tho&rsquo;  free-spoken and frank in all common matters &mdash; you, honour&rsquo;d sir, know with how  serious an intention I have taken upon myself the burden of matrimony, hoping  thereby to secure the compleat conversion of this waywarde soul. You are aware  how it was ye earnest desire of my late respected father that Mathew Haygarth  and I shou&rsquo;d be man and wife, his father and my father haveing bin friends and  companions in ye days of her most gracious majesty Queen Anne. You know how,  after being lost to all decent company for many years, Mathew came back after  his father&rsquo;s death, and lived a sober and serious life, attending amongst our  community, and being seen to shed tears on more than one occasion while  listening to the discourse of our revered and inspired founder. And you, my  dear and honour&rsquo;d pastor, will feel for me when I tell you how I am tormented  by ye fear of backsliding in this soul which I have promised to restore to ye  fold. It was but yesterday, when walking with him near St. John&rsquo;s Gate at  Clerkenwell, he came to a standstill all of a sudden, and he cried in that  impetuous manner which is even yet natural to him, &lsquo;Look ye now, Becky, wouldst  like to see the house in which the happiest years of my life was spent?&rsquo; And I  making no answer, as thinking it was but some sudden freak, he points out a  black dirty-looking dwelling-place, with overhanging windows and a wide gabled  roof. &lsquo;Yonder it stands, Becky,&rsquo; he cries; &lsquo;number seven John-street,  Clerkenwell; a queer dingy box of four walls, my wench &mdash; a tumble-down kennel,  with a staircase that &rsquo;twould break your neck to mount, being strange to it &mdash;  and half a day&rsquo;s journey from the court-end of town. But that house was once  paradise to me; and to look at it even now, though &rsquo;tis over eighteen years  since I saw the inside of it, will bring the tears into these poor old eyes of  mine&rsquo;. And then he walk&rsquo;d on so fast that I could scarce keep pace with him,  till we came to Smithfield; and then he began to tell me about Bartholomew-fair  and the brave sights he had seen; and must needs show me where had stood the  booth of one Fielding &mdash; since infamously notorious as the writer of some trashy  novels, the dulness whereof is only surpassed by their profligacy: and then he  talks of Fawkes the conjurer, who made a great fortune, and of some humble  person called &lsquo;Tiddy Doll,&rsquo; a dealer in gingerbread and such foolish wares. But  he could tell me nothing of those early preachings of our revered founder in  Moorfields, which would have been more pleasant to me than all this vain babble  about drolls and jesters, gingerbread bakers and showmen.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;When we had walked the round of the place, and it was  time to take coach for our lodging at Chelsea &mdash; he having brought me thus far  to see St. Paul&rsquo;s and the prison of Newgate, the Mint and Tower &mdash; the gloomy  fit came on him again, and all that evening he was dull and sorrowful, though I  read aloud to him from the printed sermons of a rising member of our community.  So you will see, honour&rsquo;d sir, how difficult it is for these children of Satan  to withdraw themselves from that master they have once served; since at the  sober age of fifty-three yeares my husband&rsquo;s weak heart yet yearns after  profligate faires and foolish gardens lighted by color&rsquo;d lampes.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;And now no more, reverend friend, my paper being  gone and it being full time to reflect that y&rsquo;r patience must be gone also.  Service to Mrs. Goodge. I have no more room but to assure you that y&rsquo;r gayeties  of this foolish and erring citty have no power to withdraw y&rsquo;r heart of her  whose chief privilege it is to subscribe herself,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Your humble follower and servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Rebecca Haygarth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To my mind there seems just a shadowy hint of some  bygone romance in this letter. Why did the dingy house in John-street bring the  tears into Matthew&rsquo;s eyes? and why did the memory of Vauxhall and Bartholomew  fair seem so sweet to him? And then that sighing and groaning and dolefulness  of visage whenever the thought of the past came back to him?</p>
<p>What did it all mean, I wonder? Was it only his  vanished youth, which poor, sobered, converted, Wesleyanised Matthew regretted?  or were there pensive memories of something even sweeter than youth associated  with the coloured lamps of Vauxhall and the dinginess of Clerkenwell? Who shall  sound the heart of a man who lived a hundred years ago? and where is the  fathom-line which shall plumb its mysteries? I should need a stack of old  letters before I could arrive at the secret of that man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>The two other letters, which I have selected after  some deliberation, relate to the last few weeks of Matthew&rsquo;s existence; and in  these again I fancy I see the trace of some domestic mystery, some sorrowful  secret which this sober citizen kept hidden from his wife, but which he was on  several occasions half inclined to reveal to her.</p>
<p>Perhaps if the lady&rsquo;s piety &mdash; which seems to have  been thoroughly sincere and praiseworthy, by the bye &mdash; had been a little less  cold and pragmatical in its mode of expression, poor Matthew might have taken  heart of grace and made a clean breast of it.</p>
<p>That there was a secret in the man&rsquo;s life I feel  convinced; but that conviction goes very little way towards proving any one point  of the smallest value to George Sheldon.</p>
<p>I transcribe an extract from each of the two  important letters; the first written a month before Matthew&rsquo;s death, the second  a fortnight after that event.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;And indeed, honour&rsquo;d sir, I have of late suffered  much uneasinesse of speritt concerning my husband. Those fits of ye mopes of  w&rsquo;h I informed you some time back have again come upon him. For awhile I did  hope that these melancholic affections were ye fruit put forth by a regenerate  soul; but within this month last past it has been my sorrow to discover that  these gloomy disorders arise rather from ye promptings of the Evil One. It has  pleased Mr. Haygarthe of late to declare that his life is nigh at an end; and  indeed he affects a conviction that his days are number&rsquo;d. This profane and  impertinent notion I take to be a direct inspiration of Satan, of a like  character to ye sudden and unaccountable fitts of laughter which have seized  upon many pious Christians in the midst of earnest congregations; whereby much shame  and discomfiture has been brought upon our sect. Nor is there any justification  for this presumptuous certainty entertained by my husband, inasmuch as his  health is much as it has ordinarily been for ye last ten years. He does  acknowledge this with his own lips, and immediately after cries out that his  race is run, and ye hand of death is upon him; which I cannot but take as ye  voice of ye enemy speaking through that weak mouth of ye flesh.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;On Sunday night last past, ye gloomy fitt being  come upon him after prayers, Mr. Haygarthe began all on a sudden, as it is his  habit to do:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;There is something I would fain tell ye, wench,&rsquo;  he cries out, &lsquo;something about those roistering days in London, which it might  be well for thee to know.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;But I answered him directly, that I had no desire  to hear of profane roisterings, and that it would be better for him to keep his  peace, and listen reverently to the expounding of the Scriptures, which  Humphrey Bagot, our worthy pastor and friend, had promised to explain and  exemplify after supper. We was seated at ye time in ye blue parlour, the table  being spread for supper, and were awaiting our friend from the village, a man  of humble station, being but a poor chapman and huckster, but of exalted mind  and a most holy temper, and sells me the same growth of Bohea as that drunk by  our gracious queen at Windsor.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;After I had thus reproved him &mdash; in no unkind  speritt &mdash; Mr. Haygarthe fell to sighing; and then cries out all at once:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;When I am on my death-bed, wife, I will tell thee  something: be sure thou askest me for it; or if death come upon me unawares,  thou wouldst do well to search in the old tulip-leaf bureau for a letter, since  I may tell thee that in a letter which I would not tell with these lips.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Before there was time to answer him in comes Mr.  Bagot, and we to supper; after which he did read the sixth chapter of Hebrews  and expound it at much length for our edifying; at the end whereof Satan had  obtained fast hold of Mr. Haygarthe, who was fallen asleep and snoring  heavily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is plain allusion to some secret, which that  pragmatical idiot, Mrs. Rebecca, studiously endeavoured not to hear. The next  extract is from a letter written when the lips that had been fain to speak were  stilled for ever. Ah, Mistress Rebecca, you were but mortal woman, although you  were also a shining light amongst the followers of John Wesley; and I wonder  what you would have given for poor Matthew&rsquo;s secret <em>then</em>.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Some days being gone after this melancholic event,  I bethought me of that which my husband had said to me before I left Dewsdale  for that excursion to the love-feasts at Kemberton and Kesfield, Broppindean  and Dawnfold, from which I returned but two short weeks before my poor  Matthew&rsquo;s demise. I called to remembrance that discourse about approaching  death which in my poor human judgment I did esteem a pestilent error of mind,  but which I do now recognise as a spiritual premonition; and I set myself  earnestly to look for that letter which Matthew told me he would leave in the  tulip-leaf bureau. But though I did search with great care and pains, my  trouble was wasted, inasmuch as there was no letter. Nor did I leave off to  search until ev&rsquo;ry nook and crevvis had been examin&rsquo;d. But in one of ye secret  drawers, hidden in an old dog&rsquo;s-eared book of prayers, I did find a lock of  fair hair, as if cut from the head of a child, entwin&rsquo;d curiously with a long  plait of dark hair, which, by reason of ye length thereof, must needs have been  the hair of a woman, and with these the miniature of a girl&rsquo;s face in a gold  frame. I will not stain this paper, which is near come to an end, by the  relation of such suspicions as arose in my mind on finding these curious  treasures; nor will I be of so unchristian a temper as to speak ill of the  dead. My husband was in his latter days exemplarily sober, and a humble acting  Xtian. Ye secrets of his earlier life will not now be showne to me on this side  heaven. I have set aside ye book, ye picture, and ye plaited hair in my desk  for conveniency, where I will show them to you when I am next rejoic&rsquo;d by y&rsquo;r  improving conversation. Until then, in grief or in happiness, in health and  sickness, I trust I shall ever continue, with y&rsquo;r same sincerity,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Your humble and obliged Servant and disciple</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;REBECCA  HAYGARTHE.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Thus end my excerpts from the correspondence of  Mrs. Haygarthe. They are very interesting to me, as containing the vague shadow  of a vanished existence; but whether they will ever be worth setting forth in  an affidavit is extremely uncertain. Doubtless that miniature of an unknown  girl which caused so much consternation in the mind of sober Mrs. Rebecca was  no other than the &ldquo;Molly&rdquo; whose gray eyes reminded me of Charlotte Halliday.</p>
<p>As I copied Mrs. Rebecca&rsquo;s quaint epistles, in the  midnight stillness, the things of which I was writing arose before me like a  picture. I could see the blue parlour that Sunday evening; the sober couple  seated primly opposite to each other; the china monsters on the high  chimneypiece; the blue-and-white Dutch tiles, with queer squat figures of  Flemish citizens on foot and on horseback; the candles burning dimly on the  spindle-legged table &mdash; two poor pale flames reflected ghastly in the dark  polished panels of the wainscot; the big open Bible on an adjacent table; the  old silver tankard, and buckhorn-handled knives and forks set out for supper;  the solemn eight-day clock, ticking drearily in the corner; and amid all that  sombre old-fashioned comfort, gray-haired Matthew sighing and lamenting for his  vanished youth.</p>
<p>I have grown strangely romantic since I have fallen  in love with Charlotte Halliday. The time was when I should have felt nothing  but a flippant ignorant contempt for poor Haygarth&rsquo;s feeble sighings and  lamentings; but now I think of him with a sorrowful tenderness, and am more  interested in his poor commonplace life, that picture, and those two locks of  hair, than in the most powerful romance that ever emanated from mortal genius.  It has been truly said, that truth is stranger than fiction: may it not as  justly be said, that truth has a power to touch the human heart which is  lacking in the most sublime flights of a Shakespeare, or the grandest  imaginings of an Aeschylus? One is sorry for the fate of Agamemnon; but one is  infinitely more sorrowful for the cruel death of that English Richard in the  dungeon at Pomfret, who was a very insignificant person as compared to the king  of men and of ships.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
  Hunting The Judsons</h2>
<p><em>Oct. 10th</em>. Yesterday and the day  before were blank days. On Saturday I read Mrs. Rebecca&rsquo;s letters a second time  after a late breakfast, and spent a lazy morning in the endeavour to pick up  any stray crumbs of information which I might have overlooked the previous  night. There was nothing to be found, however; and, estimable as I have always  considered the founder of the Wesleyan fraternity, I felt just a little weary  of his virtues and his discourses, his journeyings from place to place, his  love-feasts and his prayer-meetings, before I had finished with Mrs. Haygarth&rsquo;s  correspondence. In the afternoon I strolled about the town; made inquiries at  several inns, with a view to discover whether Captain Paget was peradventure an  inmate thereof; looked in at the railway-station, and watched the departure of  a train; dawdled away half an hour at the best tobacconist&rsquo;s shop in the town  on the chance of encountering my accomplished patron, who indulges in two of  the choicest obtainable cigars per diem, and might possibly repair thither to  make a purchase, if he were in the place. Whether he is still in Ullerton or not  I cannot tell; but he did not come to the tobacconist&rsquo;s; and I was fain to go  back to my inn, having wasted a day. Yet I do not think that George Sheldon  will have cause to complain of me, since I have worked very closely for my  twenty shillings per week, and have devoted myself to the business in hand with  an amount of enthusiasm which I did not think it possible for me to experience  &mdash; except for &mdash;&mdash; </p>
<p>I went to church on Sunday morning, and was more  devoutly inclined than it has been my habit to feel; for although a man who  lives by his wits must not necessarily be a heathen or an atheist, it is very  difficult for him to be anything like a Christian. Even my devotion yesterday  was not worth much, for my thoughts went vagabondising off to Charlotte Halliday  in the midst of a very sensible practical sermon.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I read the papers, and dozed by  the fire in the coffee-room &mdash; two-thirds coke by the way, and alternating from  the fierceness of a furnace to the dreary blackness of an exhausted coal-mine &mdash;  still thinking of Charlotte.</p>
<p>Late in the evening I walked the streets of the  town, and thought what a lonely wretch I was. The desert of Sahara is somewhat  dismal, I daresay; but in its dismality there is at least a flavour of romance,  a smack of adventure. O, the hopeless dulness, the unutterable blankness of a  provincial town late on a Sunday night, as it presents itself to the  contemplation of a friendless young man without a sixpence in his pocket, or  one bright hope to tempt him to forgetfulness of the past in pleasant dreaming  of the future!</p>
<p>Complaining again! O pen, which art the voice of my  discontent, your spluttering is like this outburst of unmanly fretfulness and  futile rage! O paper, whose flat surface typifies the dull level of my life,  your greasy unwillingness to receive the ink is emblematic of the soul&rsquo;s revolt  against destiny!</p>
<p>This afternoon brought me a letter from Sheldon,  and opened a new channel for my explorations in that underground territory, the  past. That man has a marvellous aptitude for his work; and has, what is more  than aptitude, the experience of ten years of failure. Such a man must succeed  sooner or later. I wonder whether his success will come while I am allied to  him. I have been used to consider myself an unlucky wretch, a creature of  ill-fortune to others as well as to myself. It is a foolish superstition,  perhaps, to fancy one&rsquo;s self set apart for an evil destiny; but the Eumenides  have been rather hard upon me. Those &ldquo;amiable&rdquo; deities, whom they of Colonae  tried so patiently to conciliate with transparent flatteries, have marked me  for their prey from the cradle &mdash; I don&rsquo;t suppose that cradle was paid for, by  the bye. I wonder whether there is an avenging deity whose special province it  is to pursue the insolvent &mdash; a Nemesis of the Bankruptcy Court.</p>
<p>My Sheldon&rsquo;s epistle bears the evidence of a very  subtle brain, as I
  think. It is longer than his previous letters. I transcribe it here, as
  I wish this record to be a complete brief of my proceedings in this
  Haygarth business.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Gray&rsquo;s Inn, Sunday night.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;DEAR HAWKEHURST, &mdash; The copies of the letters came  duly to hand, and I think you have made your selections with much discretion,  always supposing you have overlooked nothing in the remaining mass of writing.  I will thank you to send me the rest of the letters, by the way. You can take  notes of anything likely to be useful to yourself, and it will be as well for  me to possess the originals.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I find one very strong point in the first letter  of your selection, viz. the allusion to a house in John-street. It is clear  that Matthew lived in that house, and in that neighbourhood there may even yet  remain some traces of his existence. I shall begin a close investigation  to-morrow within a certain radius of that spot; and if I have the good luck to  fall upon any clear-headed centenarians, I may pick up something.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;There are some alms-houses hard by  Whitecross-street prison, where the inmates live to ages that savour of the  Pentateuch. Perhaps there I may light upon some impoverished citizen fallen  from a good estate who can remember some contemporary of Matthew&rsquo;s. London was  smaller in those days than it is now, and men lived out their lives in one  spot, and had leisure to be concerned about the affairs of their neighbours. As  I have now something of a clue to Matthew&rsquo;s roistering days, I shall set to  work to follow it up closely; and your provincial researches and my  metropolitan investigations proceeding simultaneously, we may hope to advance  matters considerably ere long. For your own part, I should advise you forthwith  to hunt up the Judson branch. You will remember that Matthew&rsquo;s only sister was  a Mrs. Judson of Ullerton. I want to find an heir-at-law in a direct line from  Matthew; and you know my theory on that point. But if we fail in that  direction, we must of course fall back upon the Judsons, who are a disgustingly  complicated set of people, and will take half a lifetime to disentangle, to say  nothing of other men who may be working the same business, and who are pretty  sure to have pinned their faith on the female branch of the Haygarthian tree.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I want you to ferret out some of the Judson  descendants with a view to picking up further documentary evidence in the shape  of old letters, inscriptions in old books, and so on. That Matthew had a secret  is certain; and that he was very much inclined to reveal that secret in his  later days is also certain. Who shall say that he did not tell it to his only  sister, though he was afraid to tell it to his wife?</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;You have acted with so much discretion up to this  point, that I do not care to trouble you with any further hints or suggestions.  When money is wanted, it shall be forthcoming; but I must beg you to manage  things economically, as I have to borrow at a considerable sacrifice; and should  this affair prove a failure, my ruin is inevitable.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Yours, &amp;c. G.S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend Sheldon is a man who can never have been  more than &ldquo;yours et-cetera&rdquo; to any human creature. I suppose what he calls ruin  would be a quiet passage through the Bankruptcy Court, and a new set of  chambers. I should not suppose that sort of ruin would be very terrible for a  man whose sole possessions are a few weak-backed horsehair chairs, a couple of  battered old desks, half a dozen empty japanned boxes, a file of <em>Bell&rsquo;s Life</em>, and a Turkey carpet in  which the progress of corruption is evident to the casual observer.</p>
<p>The hunting-up of the Judsons is a very easy matter  as compared to the task of groping in the dimness of the past in search of some  faint traces of the footsteps of departed Haygarths. Whereas the Haygarth  family seem to be an extinct race, the Judsonian branch have bred and mustered  in the land; and my chief difficulty in starting has been an <em>embarras de richesse</em>, in the shape of  half a page of Judsons in the Ullerton directory.</p>
<p>Whether to seek out Theodore Judson, the attorney,  in Nile street East, or the Rev. James Judson, curate of St. Gamaliel; whether  to appeal in the first instance to Judson &amp; Co., haberdashers and silk  mercers, of the Ferrygate, or to Judson of Judson and Grinder, wadding  manufacturers in Lady-lane &mdash; was the grand question. On inquiring of the  landlord as to the antecedents of these Judsons, I found that they were all  supposed to spring from one common stock, and to have the blood of old Jonathan  Haygarth in their veins. The Judsons had been an obscure family &mdash; people of &ldquo;no  account,&rdquo; my landlord told me, until Joseph Judson, chapman and cloth merchant  in a very small way, was so fortunate as to win the heart of Ruth Haygarth,  only daughter of the wealthy Nonconformist grocer in the market-place. This  marriage had been the starting-point of Joseph Judson&rsquo;s prosperity. Old  Haygarth had helped his industrious and respectable son-in-law along the stony  road that leads to fortune, and had no doubt given him many a lift over the  stones which bestrew that toilsome highway. My landlord&rsquo;s information was as  vague as the information of people in general; but it was easily to be made  out, from his scanty shreds and scraps of information, that the well-placed Judsons  of the present day had almost all profited to some extent by the hard-earned  wealth of Jonathan Haygarth. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve nearly all of them got the name of  Haygarth mixed up with their other names somehow,&rdquo; said my landlord. &ldquo;Judson of  Judson and Grinder is Thomas Haygarth Judson. He&rsquo;s a member of our tradesman&rsquo;s  club, and worth a hundred thousand pounds, if he&rsquo;s worth a sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have observed, by the way, that a wealthy  tradesman in a country town is never accredited with less than a hundred  thousand; there seems a natural hankering in the human mind for round numbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s J.H. Judson of St. Gamaliel,&rdquo; continued my  landlord&mdash;&rdquo;he&rsquo;s James Haygarth Judson; and young Judson the attorney&rsquo;s son puts  &lsquo;Haygarth Judson&rsquo; on his card, and gets people to call him Haygarth Judson when  they will &mdash; which in a general way they won&rsquo;t, on account of his giving himself  airs, which you may see him any summer evening walking down Ferrygate as if the  place belonged to him, and he didn&rsquo;t set much value on it. They <em>do</em> say his father&rsquo;s heir-at-law to a  million of money left by the last of the Haygarths, and that he and the son are  trying to work up a claim to the property against the Crown. But I have heard  young Judson deny it in our room when he was spoken to about it, and I don&rsquo;t  suppose there&rsquo;s much ground for people&rsquo;s talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was sorry to discover there was any ground for  such talk; Mr. Judson the lawyer would be no insignificant opponent. I felt  that I must give a very wide berth to Mr. Theodore Judson the attorney, and his  stuck-up son, unless circumstances should so shape themselves as to oblige us  to work with him. In the meanwhile any move I made amongst the other Judsons  would be likely, I thought, to come to the knowledge of these particular  members of the family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the Judson family very friendly with one  another?&rdquo; I artfully inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, some of &rsquo;em are, and some of &rsquo;em  ain&rsquo;t. They&rsquo;re most of &rsquo;em third and fourth cousins, you see, and that ain&rsquo;t a  very near relationship in a town where there&rsquo;s a good deal of competition, and  interests often clash. Young Theodore &mdash; Haygarth Judson as he calls himself &mdash;  is very thick with Judson of St. Gamaliel&rsquo;s, they were at college together, you  see: and fine airs they give themselves on the strength of a couple of years or  so at Cambridge. Those two get on very well together. But Judson of the  Lady-lane Mills don&rsquo;t speak to either of &rsquo;em when he meets &rsquo;em in the street,  and has been known to cut &rsquo;em dead in my room. William Judson of Ferrygate is a  dissenter, and keeps himself to himself very close. The other Judsons are too  fast a lot for him: though what&rsquo;s the harm of a man taking a glass or two of  brandy-and-water of an evening with his friends is more than <em>I</em> can find out,&rdquo; added mine host,  musingly.</p>
<p>It was to William Judson the dissenter, who kept  himself to himself, that I determined to present myself in the first instance.  As a dissenter, he would be likely to have more respect for the memory of the  Nonconformist and Wesleyan Haygarths, and to have preserved any traditions  relating to them with more fidelity than the Anglican and frivolous members of  the Judson family. As an individual who kept himself to himself, he would be  unlikely to communicate my business to his kindred.</p>
<p>I lost no time in presenting myself at the house of  business in Ferrygate, and after giving the servant George Sheldon&rsquo;s card, and  announcing myself as concerned in a matter of business relating to the Haygarth  family, I was at once ushered into a prim counting-house, where a dapper little  old gentleman in spotless broadcloth, and a cambric cravat and shirt frill  which were soft and snowy as the plumage of the swan, received me with  old-fashioned courtesy. I was delighted to find him seventy-five years of age  at the most moderate computation, and I should have been all the better pleased  if he had been older. I very quickly discovered that in Mr. Judson the linen  draper I had to deal with a very different person from the Rev. Jonah Goodge.  He questioned me closely as to my motive in seeking information on the subject  of the departed Haygarth, and I had some compunction in diplomatising with him  as I had diplomatised with Mr. Goodge. To hoodwink the wary Jonah was a triumph  &mdash; to deceive the confiding linen draper was a shame. However, as I have before  set down, I suppose at the falsest I am not much farther from the truth than a  barrister or a diplomatist. Mr. Judson accepted my account of myself in all  simplicity, and seemed quite pleased to have an opportunity of talking about  the deceased Haygarths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not concerned in the endeavour to assert  Theodore Judson&rsquo;s claim to the late John Haygarth&rsquo;s property, eh?&rdquo; the old man  asked me presently, as if struck by a sudden misgiving.</p>
<p>I assured him that Mr. Theodore Judson&rsquo;s interests  and mine were in no respect identical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that,&rdquo; answered the draper; &ldquo;not that  I owe Theodore Judson a grudge, you must understand, though his principles and  mine differ very widely. I have been told that he and his son hope to establish  a claim to that Haygarth property; but they will never succeed, sir &mdash; they will  never succeed. There was a young man who went to India in &rsquo;41; a scamp and a  vagabond, sir, who was always trying to borrow money in sums ranging from a  hundred pounds, to set him up in business and render him a credit to his  family, to a shilling for the payment of a night&rsquo;s lodging or the purchase of a  dinner. But that young man was the great-grandson of Ruth Haygarth &mdash; the eldest  surviving grandson of Ruth Haygarth&rsquo;s eldest son; and if that man is alive, he  is rightful heir to John Haygarth&rsquo;s money. Whether he is alive or dead at this  present moment is more than I can tell, since he has never been heard of in  Ullerton since he left the town; but until Theodore Judson can obtain legal  proof of that man&rsquo;s death he has no more chance of getting one sixpence of the  Haygarth estate than I have of inheriting the crown of Great Britain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man had worked himself into a little  passion before he finished this speech, and I could see that the Theodore  Judsons were as unpopular in the draper&rsquo;s counting-house as they were at the  Swan Inn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was this man&rsquo;s Christian name?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter. He was called Peter Judson; and was the  great-grandson of my grandfather, Joseph Judson, who inhabited this very house,  sir, more than a hundred years ago. Let me see: Peter Judson must have been  about five-and-twenty years of age when he left Ullerton; so he is a  middle-aged man by this time if he hasn&rsquo;t killed himself, or if the climate  hasn&rsquo;t killed him long ago. He went as supercargo to a merchant vessel: he was  a clever fellow, and could work hard when it suited him, in spite of his  dissipated life. Theodore Judson is a very good lawyer; but though he may bring  all his ingenuity to bear, he will never advance a step nearer to the  possession of John Haygarth&rsquo;s money till he obtains evidence of Peter Judson&rsquo;s  death; and he&rsquo;s afraid to advertise for that evidence for fear he might arouse  the attention of other claimants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much as I was annoyed to find that there were  claimants lying in wait for the rev. intestate&rsquo;s wealth, I was glad to perceive  that Theodore Judson&rsquo;s unpopularity was calculated to render his kindred  agreeably disposed to any stranger likely to push that gentleman out of the  list of competitors for these great stakes, and I took my cue from this in my  interview with the simple old draper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret that I am not at liberty to state the  nature of my business,&rdquo; I said, in a tone that was at once insinuating and  confidential; &ldquo;but I think I may venture to go so far as to say, without breach  of trust to my employer, that whoever may ultimately succeed to the Rev. John  Haygarth&rsquo;s money, neither Mr. Judson the lawyer nor his son will ever put a  finger on a penny of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not sorry to hear it,&rdquo; answered Mr. Judson,  enraptured; &ldquo;not that I owe the young man a grudge, you must understand, but  because he is particularly undeserving of good fortune. A young man who passes  his own kindred in the streets of his native town without the common courtesy  due to age or respectability; a young man who sneers at the fortune acquired in  an honest and reputable trade; a young man who calls his cousins  counter-jumpers, and his aunts and uncles &lsquo;swaddlers&rsquo; &mdash; a vulgar term of  contempt applied to the earlier members of the Wesleyan confraternity &mdash; such a  young man is not the individual to impart moral lustre to material wealth; and  I am free to confess that I had rather any one else than Theodore Judson should  inherit this vast fortune. Why, are you aware, my dear sir, that he has been  seen to drive tandem through this very street, as it is; and I should like to  know how many horses he would harness to that gig of his, or how openly he  would insult his relatives, if he had a hundred thousand pounds to deal with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred thousand pounds!&rdquo; exclaimed I; &ldquo;am I to  understand that the fortune left by the Reverend John Haygarth amounts to that  sum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To every penny of it, sir; and a nice use Theodore  Judson and that precious son of his would make of it if it fell into their  hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a second time Mr. Judson the draper had worked  himself into a little passion, and the conversation had to be discontinued for  some minutes while he cooled down to his ordinary temperament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O ho!&rdquo; said I within myself, while awaiting the  completion of this cooling-down process; &ldquo;so <em>this</em> is the stake for which my friend Sheldon is playing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I will do for you, Mr. &mdash; Mr.  Hawke-shell,&rdquo; &mdash; Mr. Judson said at last, making a compound of my own and my  employer&rsquo;s names; &ldquo;I will give you a line of introduction to my sister. If any  one can help you in hunting up intelligence relating to the past she can. She  is two years my junior &mdash; seventy-one years of age, but as bright and active as  a girl. She has lived all her life in Ullerton, and is a woman who hoards every  scrap of paper that comes in her way. If old letters or old newspapers can  assist you, she can show you plenty amongst her stores.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon this the old man wrote a note, which he dried  with sand out of a perforated bottle, as Richard Steele may have dried one of  those airy tender essays which he threw off in tavern parlours for the payment  of a jovial dinner.</p>
<p>Provided with this antique epistle, written on Bath  post and sealed with a great square seal from a bunch of cornelian monstrosities  which the draper carried at his watch-chain, I departed to find Miss Hephzibah  Judson, of Lochiel Villa, Lancaster-road.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
  Glimpses Of A Bygone Life</h2>
<p><em>October 10th</em>. I found the villa  inhabited by Miss Hephzibah Judson very easily, and found it one of those stiff  square dwelling-houses with brass curtain-rods, prim flower-beds, and vivid  green palings, only to be discovered in full perfection in the choicer suburb  of a country town.</p>
<p>I had heard enough during my brief residence in  Ullerton to understand that to live in the Lancaster-road was to possess a  diploma of respectability not easily vitiated by individual conduct. No  disreputable persons had ever yet set up their unholy Lares and Penates in one  of those new slack-baked villas; and that person must have been very bold who,  conscious of moral unfitness or pecuniary shortcoming, should have ventured to  pitch his tent in that sacred locality.</p>
<p>Miss Hephzibah Judson was one of the individuals  whose shining sanctity of life and comfortable income lent a reflected  brightness to the irreproachable suburb. I was admitted to her abode by an  elderly woman of starched demeanour but agreeable visage, who ushered me into a  spotless parlour, whereof the atmosphere was of that vault-like coldness  peculiar to a room which is only inhabited on state occasions. Here the  starched domestic left me while she carried my letter of introduction to her  mistress. In her absence I had leisure to form some idea of Miss Judson&rsquo;s  character on the mute evidence of Miss Judson&rsquo;s surroundings. From the fact  that there were books of a sentimental and poetical tenor amongst the religious  works ranged at mathematically correct distances upon the dark green  table-cover &mdash; from the presence of three twittering canaries in a large brass cage  &mdash; from the evidence of a stuffed Blenheim spaniel, with intensely brown eyes,  reclining on a crimson velvet cushion under a glass shade &mdash; I opined that Miss  Judson&rsquo;s piety was pleasantly leavened by sentiment, and that her Wesleyanism  was agreeably tempered by that womanly tenderness which, failing more  legitimate outlets, will waste itself upon twittering canaries and plethoric  spaniels.</p>
<p>I was not mistaken. Miss Judson appeared presently,  followed by the servant bearing a tray of cake and wine. This was the first  occasion on which I had been offered refreshment by any person to whom I had  presented myself. I argued, therefore, that Miss Judson was the weakest person  with whom I had yet had to deal; and I flattered myself with the hope that from  Miss Judson&rsquo;s amiable weakness, sentimentality, and womanly tenderness, I  should obtain better aid than from more business-like and practical people.</p>
<p>I fancied that with this lady it would be necessary  to adopt a certain air of candour. I therefore did not conceal from her the  fact that my business had something to do with that Haygarthian fortune  awaiting a claimant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person for whom you are concerned is not Mr.  Theodore Judson?&rdquo; she asked, with some asperity.</p>
<p>I assured her that I had never seen Theodore Judson,  and that I was in no manner interested in his success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I shall be happy to assist you as far  as lies in my power; but I can do nothing to advance the interests of Theodore  Judson junior. I venture to hope that I am a Christian; and if Theodore Judson  junior were to come here to me and ask my forgiveness, I should accord that  forgiveness as a Christian; but I cannot and will not lend myself to the  furtherance of Theodore Judson&rsquo;s avaricious designs. I cannot lend myself to  the suppression of truth or the assertion of falsehood. Theodore Judson senior  is not the rightful heir to the late John Haygarth&rsquo;s fortune, though I am bound  to acknowledge that his claim would be prior to my brother&rsquo;s. There is a man  who stands before the Theodore Judsons, and the Theodore Judsons know it. But  were they the rightful claimants, I should still consider them most unfitted to  enjoy superior fortune. If that dog could speak, he would be able to testify to  ill-usage received from Theodore Judson junior at his own garden-gate, which  would bespeak the character of the man to every thoughtful mind. A young man  who could indulge his spiteful feelings against an elderly kinswoman at the  expense of an unoffending animal is not the man to make worthy use of fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I expressed my acquiescence with this view of the  subject; and I was glad to perceive that with Miss Judson, as with her brother,  the obnoxious Theodores would stand me in good stead. The lady was only two  years younger than her brother, and even more inclined to be communicative. I  made the most of my opportunity, and sat in the vault-like parlour listening  respectfully to her discourse, and from time to time hazarding a leading  question, as long as it pleased her to converse; although it seemed to me as if  a perennial spring of cold water were trickling slowly down my back and  pervading my system during the entire period. As the reward of my fortitude I  obtained Miss Judson&rsquo;s promise to send me any letters or papers she might find  amongst her store of old documents relating to the personal history of Matthew  Haygarth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I have a whole packet of letters in  Matthew&rsquo;s own hand amongst my grandmother&rsquo;s papers,&rdquo; said Miss Judson. &ldquo;I was a  great favourite with my grandmother, and used to spend a good deal of my time  with her before she died &mdash; which she did while I was in pinafores; but young  people wore pinafores much longer in my time than they do now; and I was  getting on for fourteen years of age when my grandmother departed this life.  I&rsquo;ve often heard her talk of her brother Matthew, who had been dead some years  when I was born. She was very fond of him, and he of her, I&rsquo;ve heard her say;  and she used often to tell me how handsome he was in his youth; and how well he  used to look in a chocolate and gold-laced riding coat, just after the victory  of Culloden, when he came to Ullerton in secret, to pay her a visit &mdash; not being  on friendly terms with his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked Miss Judson if she had ever read Matthew  Haygarth&rsquo;s letters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I look at them sometimes when I&rsquo;m  tidying the drawer in which I keep them, and I have sometimes stopped to read a  word here and there, but no more. I keep them out of respect to the dead; but I  think it would make me unhappy to read them. The thoughts and the feelings in  old letters seem so fresh that they bring our poor mortality too closely home  to us when we remember how little except those faded letters remains of those  who wrote them. It is well for us to remember that we are only travellers and  wayfarers on this earth; but sometimes it seems just a little hard to think how  few traces of our footsteps we leave behind us when the journey is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The canaries seemed to answer Miss Judson with a  feeble twitter of assent: and I took my leave, with a feeling of compassion in  my heart. I, the scamp &mdash; I, Robert Macaire the younger &mdash; had pity upon the  caged canaries, and the lonely old woman whose narrow life was drawing to its  close, and who began to feel how very poor a thing it had been after all.</p>
<p><em>Oct. 11th</em>. I have paid the penalty  of my temerity in enduring the vault-like chilliness of Miss Hephzibah Judson&rsquo;s  parlour, and am suffering to-day from a sharp attack of influenza; that  complaint which of all others tends to render a man a burden to himself, and a  nuisance to his fellow-creatures. Under these circumstances I have ordered a  fire in my own room &mdash; a personal indulgence scarcely warranted by Sheldon&rsquo;s  stipend &mdash; and I sit by my own fire pondering over the story of Matthew  Haygarth&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>On the table by my side are scattered more than a  hundred letters, all in Matthew&rsquo;s bold hand; but even yet, after a most careful  study of those letters, the story of the man&rsquo;s existence is far from clear to  me. The letters are full of hints and indications, but they tell so little  plainly. They deal in enigmas, and disguise names under the mask of initials.</p>
<p>There is much in these letters which relates to the  secret history of Matthew&rsquo;s life. They were written to the only creature  amongst his kindred in whom he fully confided. This fact transpires more than  once, as will be seen anon by the extracts I shall proceed to make; if my  influenza &mdash; which causes me to shed involuntary tears that give me the  appearance of a drivelling idiot, and which jerks me nearly out of my chair  every now and then with a convulsive sneeze &mdash; will permit me to do anything  rational or useful.</p>
<p>I have sorted and classified the letters, first  upon one plan, then upon another, until I have classified and sorted them into  chaos. Having done this, my only chance is to abandon all idea of  classification, and go quietly through them in consecutive order according to  their dates, jotting down whatever strikes me as significant. George Sheldon&rsquo;s  acumen must do the rest.</p>
<p>Thus I begin my notes, with an extract from the fourth  letter in the series. Mem. I preserve Matthew&rsquo;s own orthography, which is the  most eccentric it was ever my lot to contemplate.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;<em>December</em> 14, &rsquo;42. Indeed, my dear Ruth, I am ventursom wear you are concurn&rsquo;d, and w&rsquo;d  tell you that I w&rsquo;d taik panes to kepe fromm another. I saw ye same girl w&rsquo;h it  was my good fortun to saive from ye molestashun of raketters and mohoks at  Smithfelde in September last past. She is ye derest prittiest creture you ever  saw, and as elegant and genteel in her speche and maner as a Corte lady, or as  ye best bredd person in Ullerton. I mett her in ye nayborood of ye Marchalsee  prison wear her father is at this pressent time a prisener, and had som  pleassant talke with her. She rememberr&rsquo;d me at once, and seme&rsquo;d mitily gladd  to see me. Mem. Her pritty blu eys wear fill&rsquo;d with teares wen she thank&rsquo;d me  for having studd up to be her champyun at ye Fare. So you see, Mrs. Ruth, ye  brotherr is more thort off in London than with them which hav ye rite to regard  him bestt. If you had scen ye pore simpel childeish creetur and heeard her tell  her arteless tale, I think y&rsquo;r kinde hart w&rsquo;d have bin sore to considder so  much unmiritted misfortun: ye father is in pore helth, a captiv, ye mother has  binn dedd thre yeres, and ye pore orfann girl, Mollie, has to mentane ye burden  of ye sick father, and a yung helples sister. Think of this, kinde Mrs. Ruth,  in y&rsquo;r welthy home. Mem. Pore Mrs. Mollie is prittier than ye fineist ladies  that wear to be sene at ye opening of ye grand new roome at Ranellar this  spring last past, wear I sor ye too Miss Gunings and Lady Harvey, wich is alsoe  accounted a grate buty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think this extract goes very far to prove that my  friend Matthew was considerably smitten by the pretty young woman whose  champion he had been in some row at Bartholomew Fair. This fits into one of the  scraps of information afforded by my ancient inhabitant in Ullerton Almshouses,  who remembers having heard his grandfather talk of Mat Haygarth&rsquo;s part in some  fight or disturbance at the great Smithfield festival.</p>
<p>My next extract treats again of Mollie, after an  interval of four months. It seems as if Matthew had confided in his sister so  far as to betray his tenderness for the poor player-girl of the London booths;  but I can find no such letter amongst those in my hands. Such an epistle may  have been considered by Mrs. Ruth too dangerous to be kept where the parental  eye might in some evil hour discover it. Matthew&rsquo;s sister was unmarried at this  date, and lived within the range of that stern paternal eye. Matthew&rsquo;s letter  appears to me to have been written in reply to some solemn warning from Ruth.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;<em>April</em> 12, 1743. Sure, my dear sister cannot think me so baise a retch as to injoore a  pore simpel girl hoo confides in me as ye best and trooest of mortals, wich for  her dere saik I will strive to be. If so be my sister cou&rsquo;d think so ill of me  it wou&rsquo;d amost temt me to think amiss of her, wich cou&rsquo;d imagen so vile a  thort. You tel me that Mrs. Rebecka Caulfeld is mor than ever estemed by my  father; but, Ruth, I am bounde to say, my father&rsquo;s esteme is nott to be ye rule  of my ackshuns thro&rsquo; life, for it semes to me their is no worser tyrrannie than  ye wich fathers do striv to impose on there children, and I do acount that a  kind of barbarity wich wou&rsquo;d compel ye hart of youth to sute ye proodense of  age. I do not dout but Mrs. Rebecka is a mitey proper and well-natur&rsquo;d person,  tho&rsquo; taken upp with this new sekt of methodys, or, as sum do call them in  derission, swaddlers and jumpers, set afoot by ye madbrain&rsquo;d young man, Wesley,  and one that is still madder, Witfelde. Thear ar I dare sware many men in  Ullerton wich wou&rsquo;d be gladd to obtane Mrs. Rebecka&rsquo;s hand and fortun; but if  ye fortun wear ten times more, I wou&rsquo;d not preetend to oferr my harte to herr  w&rsquo;h can never be its misteress. Now, my deare sister, having gone as farr  towards satisfieing all y&rsquo;r queerys as my paper wou&rsquo;d welle permitt, I will say  no more but to begg you to send me all ye knews, and to believe that none can  be more affectionately y&rsquo;r humble servant than your brother.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;MATHEW  HAYGARTH.&rdquo; </p>
<p>In this extract we have strong ground for supposing  that our Matthew truly loved the player-girl, and meant honestly by his  sweetheart. There is a noble indignation in his repudiation of his sister&rsquo;s  doubts, and a manly determination not to marry Mrs. Rebecca&rsquo;s comfortable  fortune. I begin to think that Sheldon&rsquo;s theory of an early and secret marriage  will turn up a trump card; but Heaven only knows how slow or how difficult may  be the labour of proving such a marriage. And then, even if we can find  documentary evidence of such an event, we shall have but advanced one step in  our obscure path, and should have yet to discover the issue of that union, and  to trace the footsteps of Matthew&rsquo;s unknown descendants during the period of a  century.</p>
<p>I wonder how Sisyphus felt when the stone kept  rolling back upon him. Did he ever look up to the top of the mountain and  calculate the distance he must needs traverse before his task should be done?</p>
<p>The next letter in which I find a passage worth  transcribing is of much later date, and abounds in initials. The postmark is  illegible; but I can just make out the letters PO and L, the two first close  together, the third after an interval; and there is internal evidence to show that  the letter was written from some dull country place. Might not that place have  been Spotswold? the PO and the L of the postmark would fit very well into the  name of that village. Again I leave this question to the astute Sheldon. The  date is March, 1749.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;M. is but porely. Sumtimes I am pain&rsquo;d to believe  this quiett life is not well suted to herr disposishun, having bin acustumed to  so much livlinesse and nois. I hav reproched her with this, but she tolde me,  with teres in her eys, to be neare mee and M. and C. was to be happie, and yt  it is il helth onlie wich is ye cawse of yr sadnesse. I pray heaven M.&rsquo;s helth  may be on ye mending hand soone. Little M. grows more butiful everry day; and  indede, my dear sisterr, if you cou&rsquo;d stele another visitt this waye, and  oblidge yr affectionat brother, you wou&rsquo;d considerr him ye moste butifull  creetur ever scene. So much enteligence with sich ingaging temper endeares him  to all hartes. Mrs. J. says she adors him, and is amost afraide to be thort a  Paygann for bestoeing so much affection on a erthly creetur, and this to oure  good parson who cou&rsquo;d find no reproche for her plesant folly.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;We hav had heavy ranes all ye week last past. Sech  wether can but serve to hinderr M.&rsquo;s recovery. The fysichion at G., wear I tooke  her, saies she shou&rsquo;d hav much fresh aire everry day &mdash; if not afoot, to be  carrid in a chaire or cotche; but in this wether, and in a plaice wear neeither  chaire nor cotche can be had, she must needs stop in doors. I hav begg&rsquo;d her to  lett me carry her to G., but she will not, and says in ye summerr she will be  as strong as everr. I pray God she may be so. Butt theire are times whenn my  harte is sore and heavy; and the rane beeting agenst the winder semes lik  dropps of cold worter falling uponn my pore aking harte.

<p class="note">&ldquo;Yr loving brother and obediant servent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;MATHEW  HAYGARTH.&rdquo; </p>
<p>To me this letter is almost conclusive evidence of  a marriage. Who can this little M. be, of whom he writes so tenderly, except a  child? Who can this woman be, whose ill health causes him such anxiety, unless  a wife? Of no one <em>but</em> a wife could he  write so freely to his sister. The place to which he asks her to &ldquo;steal a  visit&rdquo; must needs be a home to which a man could invite his sister. I fancy it  is thus made very clear that at this period Matthew Haygarth was secretly  married and living at Spotswold, where his wife and son were afterwards buried,  and whence the body of the son was ultimately removed to Dewsdale to be laid in  that grave which the father felt would soon be his own resting-place. That  allusion to the Ullerton talk of London roisterings indicates that Matthew&rsquo;s  father believed him to be squandering the paternal substance in the metropolis  at the very time when the young man was leading a simple domestic life within  fifty miles of the paternal abode. No man could do such a thing in these days  of rapid locomotion, when every creature is more or less peripatetic; but in  that benighted century the distance from Ullerton to Spotswold constituted a  day&rsquo;s journey. That Matthew was living in one place while he was supposed to be  in another is made sufficiently clear by several passages in his letters, all  more or less in the strain of the following: &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I was yesterday &mdash; markett-day &mdash; at G., wear I ran  suddennly agenst Peter Browne&rsquo;s eldest ladd. The boy openn&rsquo;d his eyes wide,  stearing like an owle; butt I gaive him bakk his looke with interrest, and  tolde him if he was curiouse to know my name, I was Simon Lubchick, farmer, at  his servise. The pore simpel ladd arsk&rsquo;d my pardonn humbly for having mistook  me for a gentelman of Ullerton &mdash; a frend of his father; on wich I gaive him a  shillin, and we parted, vastly plesed with eche other; and this is nott the  fust time the site of Ullerton fokes has putt me into a swett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amongst later letters are very sad ones. The little  M. is dead. The father&rsquo;s poor aching heart proclaims its anguish in very simple  words:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;<em>Nov</em>.  1751. I thank my dear sister kindly for her friendlinesse and compashin; butt,  ah, he is gone, and their semes to be no plesure or comforte on this erth  without him! onlie a littel childe of 6 yeres, and yett so dere a creetur to  this harte that the worlde is emty and lonely without him. M. droopes sadly,  and is more ailing everry day. Indede, my dere Ruth, I see nothing butt sorrow  before me, and I wou&rsquo;d be right gladd to lay down at peece in my littel M.&rsquo;s  grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can find no actual announcements of death, only  sad allusions here and there. I fancy the majority of Matthew&rsquo;s letters must  have been lost, for the dates of those confided to my hands are very far apart,  and there is evidence in all of them of other correspondence. After the letter  alluding to little M.&rsquo;s death, there is a hiatus of eight years. Then comes a  letter with the post-mark London very clear, from which I transcribe an  extract. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;<em>October 4th</em>, 1759. The toun  is very sadd; everry body, high and low, rich and pore, in morning for Gennerel  Wolf: wot a nobel deth to die, and how much happier than to live, when one  considers the cairs and miseries of this life; and sech has bin the oppinion of  wiser fokes than y&rsquo;r humble servent. Being in companie on Thersday sennite with  that distingwish&rsquo;d riter, Dr. Johnson, &mdash; whose admir&rsquo;d story of <em>Raselass</em> I sent you new from ye press,  but who I am bound to confesse is less admirable as a fine gentlemann than as  an orther, his linning siled and his kravatt twisted ary, and his manners wot  in a more obskure personn wou&rsquo;d be thort ungenteel, &mdash; he made a remark wich  impress&rsquo;d me much. Some one present, being almost all gentelmenn of parts and  learning, except y&rsquo;r pore untuter&rsquo;d brother, observed that it was a saying with  the ainchents that ye happiest of men was him wich was never born; ye next  happy him wich died the soonest. On wich Dr. Johnson cried out verry loud and  angry, &lsquo;That was a Paggann sentyment, sir, and I am asham&rsquo;d that a Xtian  gentelmann shou&rsquo;d repete it as a subject for admerashun. Betwene these heathen  men and ye followers of Christ their is all ye differenc betwene a slave and a  servent of a kind Master. Eche bears the same burden; butt ye servent knows he  will recieve just wages for his work, wile ye slave hopes for nothing, and so  conkludes that to escape work is to be happy!&rsquo; I could but aknowlege the  wisdomm and pyety of this speche; yett whenn I see ye peopel going bye in their  black rayment, I envy the young Gennerel his gloreous deth, and I wish I was  laying amongst the plane on the hites of Quebeck. I went to look at ye old  house in J. St., but I wou&rsquo;d not go in to see Mr. F. or ye old roomes; for I  think I shou&rsquo;d see the aparishions of those that once liv&rsquo;d in them. C. thrivs  at Higate, wear the aire is fresh and pewer. I go to see her offen. She is  nerely as high as you. Give my servis to Mrs. Rebecka, sinse you say it will  plese my father to do so, and he is now dispos&rsquo;d to think more kindly of me.  Butt if he thinks I shal everr arske her to be my wife he is mityly mistaken.  You know wear my harte lies &mdash; in ye grave with all that made life dere. Thank  my father for the Bill, and tell him I pass my time in good companie, and  neether drink nor play; and will come to Ullerton to pay him my respeckts when  he pleses to bid me. Butt I hav no desire to leeve London, as I am gladd to be  neare C.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who was C., whom Matthew visited at Highgate, and who  was nearly as tall as Ruth Judson? Was she not most likely the same C.  mentioned in conjunction with the little M. in the earlier letters? and if so,  can there be any doubt that she was the daughter of Matthew Haygarth? Of whom  but of a daughter would he write as in this letter? She was at Highgate, at  school most likely, and he goes to see her. She is nearly as tall as Mrs.  Judson. This height must have been a new thing, or he would scarcely impart it  as a piece of news to his sister. And then he has no desire to leave London, as  he is glad to be near C.</p>
<p>My life upon it, C. is a daughter.</p>
<p>Acting upon this conviction, I have transcribed all  passages relating to C., at whatever distance of time they occur.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Thus, in 1763, I find&mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;C. has grone very hansome,  and Mrs. N. tells me is much admir&rsquo;d by a brother of her frend Tabitha. She  never stirs abrorde but with Tabitha, and if a dutchess, cou&rsquo;d be scarce wated  on more cairfully. Mrs. N. loves her verry tenderly, and considers her the  sweetest and most wel bredd of young women. I hav given her the new edishun of  Sir Charls Grandisson, wich they read alowde in ye evenings, turn and turn  about, to Mrs. N. at her spinning. C. has given me a wool comforter of her owne  worke, and sum stockings wich are two thick to ware, but I hav not told her  so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, in 1764:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Tabitha Meynell&rsquo;s brother goes  more than ever to Higate. He is a clark in his father&rsquo;s wearhouse; very sober  and estimabel, and if it be for ye hapiness of C. to mary him, I wou&rsquo;d be ye  laste of men to sett my orthoritty agenst her enclinashun. She is yett but  ayteen yeres of age, wich is young to make a change; so I tell Mrs. N. we will  waite. Meanwhile ye young peapel see eche other offen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, in 1765:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Young Meynell is still constant,  expressing much love and admirashun for C. in his discorse with Mrs. N., butt  sattisfide to wait my plesure before spekeing oppenly to C. He semes a most  exempelry young man; his father a cittizen of some repewt in Aldersgait-street,  ware I have din&rsquo;d since last riting to you, and at hoose tabel I was paid much  considerashun. He, Tomas Meynell ye father, will give his son five hundred  pound, and I prommis a thousand pound with C. and to furnish a house at  Chelsee, a verry plesent and countriefide vilage; so I make no doubt there will  soon be a wedding.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I am sorrie to here my father is aleing; give him  my love and servise, and will come to Ullerton immediate on receiving his  commands. I am plesed to think Mrs. Rebecka Caulfeld is so dutifull and kind to  him, and has comfortedd him with prairs and discorses. I thank her for this  more than for any frendshipp for my undeserving self. Pray tell her that I am  much at her servise.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Our new king is lov&rsquo;d and admir&rsquo;d by all. His  ministers not so; and wise peopel do entertain themselfs with what I think  foollish jokes a-bout a <em>Skotch boote</em>.  Perhapps I am not cleverr enuff to see the funn in this joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this letter I detect a certain softening of  feeling towards Mrs. Rebecca Caulfield. In the next year&mdash;&rsquo;66 &mdash; according to my  notes, Matthew&rsquo;s father died, and I have no letters bearing the date of that  year, which our Matthew no doubt spent at home. Nor have I any letters from  this time until the year of Matthew&rsquo;s marriage with Rebecca Caulfield. In the  one year of his union with Mrs. Rebecca, and the last year of his life, there  are many letters, a few from London and the rest from the manor-house at  Dewsdale. But in these epistles, affectionate and confidential as they are,  there is little positive information.</p>
<p>These are the letters of the regenerate and  Wesleyanised Matthew; and, like the more elaborate epistles of his wife  Rebecca, deal chiefly with matters spiritual. In these letters I can perceive  the workings of a weak mind, which in its decline has become a prey to religious  terrors; and though I fully recognise the reforming influence which John Wesley  exercised upon the people of England, I fancy poor Matthew would have been  better in the hands of a woman whose piety was of a less severe type than that  of Wesleyan Rebecca. There is an all-pervading tone of fear in these letters &mdash;  a depression which is almost despair. In the same breath he laments and regrets  the lost happiness of his youth, and regrets and laments his own iniquity in  having been so ignorantly and unthinkingly happy.</p>
<p>Thus in one letter he says, &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;When I think of that inconsideratt foolish time  with M., and how to be nere her semed the highest blisse erth cou&rsquo;d bistowe or  Heven prommis, I trimbel to think of my pore unawaken&rsquo;d sole, and of her dome  on wich the tru light never shown. If I cou&rsquo;d believe she was happy my owne  sorow wou&rsquo;d be lesse; but I canot, sence all ye worthyest memberrs of our seck  agree that to die thinking onely of erthly frends, and clingeng with a  passhunate regrett to them we luv on erth is to be lesse than a tru Xtian, and  for sech their is but one dome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again, in a still later epistle, he writes, &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;On Toosday sennite an awakning discorse fromm a  verry young man, until lately a carppenter, but now imploid piusly in going from  toun to toun and vilage to vilage, preching. He says, that a life of cairlesse  happyness, finding plesure in ye things of this worlde, is &mdash; not being  repentied of &mdash; irretrevable damnation. This is a maloncally thort! I fell to  mewsing on M., with hoom I injoy&rsquo;d such compleat happyness, tel Deth came like  a spekter to bannish all comforte. And now I knowe that our lives wear vainity.  I ashure you, dear sister, I am prodidjusly sadd when I reffleckt upon this  truth &mdash; ashuredly it is a harde saying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anon comes that strange foreknowledge of death &mdash;  that instinctive sense of the shadowy hand so soon to lay him at rest; and with  that mystic prescience comes a yearning for the little child M. to be laid  where his father may lay down beside him. There are many passages in the latter  letters which afford a clue to that mysterious midnight burial at Dewsdale.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Last nite I drem&rsquo;t of the cherchyarde at S. I  satte under the olde yewe tree, as it semed in my dreme, and hurd a childes  voice crying in a very piteous mannerr. The thort of this dreme has oppress&rsquo;d  my speritts all day, and Rebecka has enquier&rsquo;d more than wunce wot ales me.

Wot  dose it matter to my sole wear my vile bodie is laid? and yet I have a fonde  fooleish desier to be berrid with littel M.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in these latest letters there is ample evidence  of that yearning on Matthew&rsquo;s part to reveal a secret which Rebecca&rsquo;s own  correspondence betrays.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;We tawked of manny things, and she was more than  ordinnary kind and gentel. I had a mind to tell her about M, and aske her  frendship for C; but she seemed not to cair to here my sekrets, and I think  wou&rsquo;d be offended if she new the trooth. So I cou&rsquo;d not finde courrage to tell  her. Before I die I shal speek planely for the saik of C. and M. and ye little  one. I shal cum to U. erly nex weak to make my Wille, and this time shal  chainge my umour no more. I have burnt ye laste, not likeing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This passage occurs in the last letter, amongst the  packet confided to me. The letter is dated September 5, 1774. On the fourteenth  of the following month Matthew died, and in all probability the will here  alluded to was never executed. Certain it is that Matthew, whose end was  awfully sudden at the last, died intestate, whereby his son John inherited the  bulk, and ultimately the whole, of his fortune. There are many allusions to  this infant son in the last few letters; but I do not think the little creature  obtained any great hold on the father&rsquo;s heart. No doubt he was bound and  swaddled out of even such small semblance to humanity as one may reasonably  expect in a child of six or seven weeks old, and by no means an agreeable  being. And poor weak-minded Matthew&rsquo;s heart was with that player-girl wife whom  he never acknowledged, and the little M. And thus ends the story of Matthew  Haygarth, so far as I have been able to trace it in the unfathomable gloom of  the past.</p>
<p>It seems to me that what I have next to do will be  to hunt up information respecting that young man Meynell, whose father lived in  Aldersgate Street, and was a respectable and solid citizen, of that ilk; able  to give a substantial dinner to the father of his son&rsquo;s sweetheart, and  altogether a person considerable enough, I should imagine, to have left  footprints of some kind or other on the sands of Time. The inscrutable Sheldon  will be able to decide in what manner the hunt of the Meynells must begin. I  doubt if there is anything more to be done in Ullerton.</p>
<p>I have sent Sheldon a fair copy of my extracts from  Matthew&rsquo;s correspondence, and have returned the letters to Miss Judson,  carefully packed in accordance with her request. I now await my Sheldon&rsquo;s next  communication and the abatement of my influenza before making my next move in  the great game of chess called Life.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of Horatio Paget&rsquo;s lengthened  abode in this town? He is still here. He went past this house to-day while I  was standing at my window in that abject state of mind known only to influenza  and despair. I think I was suffering from a touch of both diseases, by the bye.  What is that man doing here? The idea of his presence fills me with all manner  of vague apprehensions. I cannot rid myself of the absurd notion that the  lavender glove I saw lying in Goodge&rsquo;s parlour had been left there by the  Captain. I know the idea <em>is</em> an absurd  one, and I tell myself again and again that Paget <em>cannot</em> have any inkling of my business here, and therefore <em>cannot</em> attempt to forestall me or steal  my hard-won information. But often as I reiterate this &mdash; in that silent  argument which a man is always elaborating in his own mind &mdash; I am still  tormented by a nervous apprehension of treachery from that man. I suppose the  boundary line between influenza and idiocy is a very narrow one. And then  Horatio Paget is such a thorough-paced scoundrel. He is <em>li&eacute;</em> with Philip Sheldon too &mdash; another thorough-paced scoundrel in a  quiet gentlemanly way, unless my instinct deceives me.</p>
<p><em>October 12th</em>. There is treachery  somewhere. Again the Haygarthian epistles have been tampered with. Early this  morning comes an indignant note from Miss Judson, reminding me that I promised  the packet of letters should be restored to her yesterday at noon, and  informing me that they were not returned until last night at eleven o&rsquo;clock,  when they were left at her back garden-gate by a dirty boy who rang the bell as  loudly as if he had been giving the alarm of fire, and who thrust the packet  rudely into the hand of the servant and vanished immediately. So much for the  messenger. The packet itself, Miss Judson informed me, was of a dirty and  disgraceful appearance, unworthy the hands of a gentlewoman, and one of the  letters was missing.</p>
<p>Heedless of my influenza, I rushed at once to the  lower regions of the inn, saw the waiter into whose hands I had confided my  packet at half-past ten o&rsquo;clock yesterday morning, and asked what messenger had  been charged with it. The waiter could not tell me. He did not remember. I told  him plainly that I considered this want of memory very extraordinary. The  waiter laughed me to scorn, with that quiet insolence which a well-fed waiter  feels for a customer who pays twenty shillings a week for his board and  lodging. The packet had been given to a very respectable messenger, the waiter  made no doubt. As to whether it was the ostler, or one of the boys, or the  Boots, or a young woman in the kitchen who went on errands sometimes, the  waiter wouldn&rsquo;t take upon himself to swear, being a man who would perish rather  than inadvertently perjure himself. As to my packet having been tampered with,  that was ridiculous. What on earth was there in a lump of letter-paper for any  one to steal? Was there money in the parcel? I was fain to confess there was no  money; on which the waiter laughed aloud.</p>
<p>Failing the waiter, I applied myself severally to  the ostler, the boys, the Boots, and the young woman in the kitchen; and then  transpired the curious fact that no one had carried my packet. The ostler was  sure he had not; the Boots could take his Bible oath to the same effect; the  young woman in the kitchen could not call to mind anything respecting a packet,  though she was able to give me a painfully circumstantial account of the events  of the morning &mdash; where she went and what she did, down to the purchase of  three-pennyworth of pearl-ash and a pound of Glenfield starch for the head  chambermaid, on which she dwelt with a persistent fondness.</p>
<p>I now felt assured that there had been treachery  here, as in the Goodge business; and I asked myself to whom could I impute that  treachery?</p>
<p>My instinctive suspicion was of Horatio Paget. And  yet, was it not more probable that Theodore Judson, senr. and Theodore Judson,  junr. were involved in this business, and were watching and counterchecking my  actions with a view to frustrating the plans of my principal? This was one  question which I asked myself as I deliberated upon this mysterious business.  Had the Theodore Judsons some knowledge of a secret marriage on the part of  Matthew Haygarth? and did they suspect the existence of an heir in the  descendant of the issue of that marriage? These were further questions which I  asked myself, and which I found it much more easy to ask than to answer. After  having considered these questions, I went to the Lancaster-road, saw Miss  Judson &mdash; assured her, on my word as a gentleman, that the packet had been  delivered by my hands into those of the waiter at eleven o&rsquo;clock on the previous  day, and asked to see the envelope. There it was &mdash; my large blue wire-wove  office envelope, addressed in my own writing. But in these days of adhesive  envelopes there is nothing easier than to tamper with the fastening of a  letter. I registered a mental vow never again to trust any important document  to the protection of a morsel of gummed paper. I counted the letters, convinced  myself that there was a deficiency, and then set to work to discover which of  the letters had been abstracted. Here I failed utterly. For my own convenience  in copying my extracts, I had numbered the letters from which I intended to  transcribe passages before beginning my work. My pencilled figures in  consecutive order were visible in the corner of the superscription of every  document I had used. Those numbered covers I now found intact, and I could thus  assure myself that the missing document was one from which I had taken no  extract.</p>
<p>This inspired me with a new alarm. Could it be  possible that I had overlooked some scrap of information more important than  all that I had transcribed?</p>
<p>I racked my brains in the endeavour to recall the  contents of that one missing letter; but although I sat in that social tomb,  Miss Judson&rsquo;s best parlour, until I felt my blood becoming of an arctic  quality, I could remember nothing that seemed worth remembering in the letters  I had laid aside as valueless.</p>
<p>I asked Miss Judson if she had any suspicion of the  person who had tampered with the packet. She looked at me with an icy smile,  and answered in ironical accents, which were even more chilling than the  atmosphere of her parlour, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not ask if I know who has tampered with those  letters, Mr. Hawkehurst. Your affectation of surprise has been remarkably well  put on; but I am not to be deceived a second time. When you came to me in the  first instance, I had my suspicions; but you came furnished with a note from my  brother, and as a Christian I repressed those suspicions. I know now that I  have been the dupe of an impostor, and that in entrusting those letters to you  I entrusted them to an emissary and tool of THEODORE JUDSON.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I protested that I had never to my knowledge set  eyes upon either of the Theodore Judsons; but the prejudiced kinswoman of those  gentlemen shook her head with a smile whose icy blandness was eminently  exasperating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not to be deceived a second time,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;Who else but Theodore Judson should have employed you? Who else but Theodore  Judson is interested in the Haygarth fortune? O, it was like him to employ a  stranger where he knew his own efforts would be unavailing; it was like him to  hoodwink me by the agency of a hireling tool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been addressed as a &ldquo;young man&rdquo; by the  reverend Jonah, and now I was spoken of as a &ldquo;hireling tool&rdquo; by Miss Judson. I  scarcely knew which was most disagreeable, and I began to think that board and  lodging in the present, and a visionary three thousand pounds in the future,  would scarcely compensate me for such an amount of ignominy.</p>
<p>I went back to my inn utterly crestfallen &mdash; a  creature so abject that even the degrading influence of influenza could  scarcely sink me any lower in the social scale. I wrote a brief and succinct  account of my proceedings, and despatched the same to George Sheldon, and then  I sat down in my sickness and despair, as deeply humiliated as Ajax when he  found that he had been pitching into sheep instead of Greeks, as miserable as  Job amongst his dust and ashes, but I am happy to say untormented by the chorus  of one or the friends of the other. In that respect at least I had some  advantage over both.</p>
<p><em>October 13th</em>. This morning&rsquo;s post  brought me a brief scrawl from Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back to town directly. I have found the  registry of Matthew<br>
  Haygarth&rsquo;s marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so I turn my back on Ullerton; with what  rejoicing of spirit it is not in language to express.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="center"><strong><em><a name="BooktheSixth"></a>Book the Sixth &mdash; The Heiress of the Haygarths </em></strong></h1>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
  Disappointment</h2>
<p>Of all places upon this earth, perhaps, there is  none more obnoxious to the civilized mind than London in October; and yet to  Valentine Hawkehurst, newly arrived from Ullerton per North-Western Railway,  that city seemed as an enchanted and paradisiacal region. Were not the western  suburbs of that murky metropolis inhabited by Charlotte Halliday, and might he  not hope to see her?</p>
<p>He did hope for that enjoyment. He had felt  something more than hope while speeding Londonwards by that delightful  combination of a liberal railway management, a fast and yet cheap train. He had  beguiled himself with a delicious certainty. Early the next morning &mdash; or at any  rate as early as civilization permitted &mdash; he would hie him to Bayswater, and  present himself at the neat iron gate of Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s gothic villa. <em>She</em> would be there, in the garden most  likely, his divine Charlotte, so bright and radiant a creature that the dull  October morning would be made glorious by her presence &mdash; she would be there,  and she would welcome him with that smile which made her the most enchanting of  women.</p>
<p>Such thoughts as these had engaged him during his  homeward journey; and compared with the delight of such visions, the perusal of  daily papers and the consumption of sandwiches, whereby other passengers  beguiled their transit, seemed a poor amusement. But, arrived in the dingy  streets, and walking towards Chelsea under a drizzling rain, the bright picture  began to grow dim. Was it not more than likely that Charlotte would be absent  from London at this dismal season? Was it not very probable that Philip Sheldon  would give him the cold shoulder? With these gloomy contingencies before him,  Mr. Hawkehurst tried to shut Miss Halliday&rsquo;s image altogether out of his mind,  and to contemplate the more practical aspect of his affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether that scoundrel Paget has come  back to London?&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;What am I to say to him if he has? If I own to  having seen him in Ullerton, I shall lay myself open to being questioned by him  as to my own business in that locality. Perhaps my wisest plan would be to say  nothing, and hear his own account of himself. I fully believe he saw me on the  platform that night when we passed each other without speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Horatio Paget was at home when his <em>proteg&eacute;</em> arrived. He was seated by his  fireside in all the domestic respectability of a dressing-gown and slippers,  with an evening paper on his knee, a slim smoke-coloured bottle at his elbow,  and the mildest of cigars between his lips, when the traveller, weary and  weather-stained, entered the lodging-house drawing-room.</p>
<p>Captain Paget received his friend very graciously,  only murmuring some faint deprecation of the young man&rsquo;s reeking overcoat, with  just such a look of gentlemanly alarm as the lamented Brummel may have felt  when ushered into the presence of a &ldquo;damp stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you&rsquo;ve come back at last,&rdquo; said the  Captain, &ldquo;from Dorking?&rdquo; He made a little pause here, and looked at his friend  with a malicious sparkle in his eye. &ldquo;And how was the old aunt? Likely to cut  up for any considerable amount, eh? It could only be with a view to that  cutting-up process that you could consent to isolate yourself in such a place  as Dorking. How did you find things?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Mr. Hawkehurst  answered rather impatiently, for his worst suspicions were confirmed by his  patron&rsquo;s manner; &ldquo;I only know I found it tiresome work enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, to be sure! elderly people always are  tiresome, especially when they are unacquainted with the world. There is a  perennial youth about men and women of the world. The sentimental twaddle  people talk of the freshness and purity of a mind unsullied by communion with  the world is the shallowest nonsense. Your Madame du Deffand at eighty and your  Horace Walpole at sixty are as lively as a girl and boy. Your octogenarian  Voltaire is the most agreeable creature in existence. But take Cymon and Daphne  from their flocks and herds and pastoral valleys in their old age, and see what  senile bores and quavering imbeciles you would find them. Yes, I have no doubt  you found your Dorking aunt a nuisance. Take off your wet overcoat and put it  out of the room, and then ring for more hot water. You&rsquo;ll find that cognac very  fine. Won&rsquo;t you have a cigar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain extended his russia-leather case with  the blandest smile. It was a very handsome case. Captain Paget was a man who  could descend into some unknown depths of the social ocean in the last stage of  shabbiness, and who, while his acquaintance were congratulating themselves upon  the fact of his permanent disappearance, would start up suddenly in an  unexpected place, provided with every necessity and luxury of civilized life,  from a wardrobe by Poole to the last fashionable absurdity in the shape of a  cigar-case.</p>
<p>Never had Valentine Hawkehurst found his patron  more agreeably disposed than he seemed to be this evening, and never had he  felt more inclined to suspect him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what have you been doing while I have been  away?&rdquo; the young man asked presently. &ldquo;Any more promoting work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, a little bit of provincial business; a  life-and-fire on a novel principle; a really good thing, if we can only find  men with perception enough to see its merits, and pluck enough to hazard their  capital. But promoting in the provinces is very dull work. I&rsquo;ve been to two or  three towns in the Midland districts &mdash; Beauport, Mudborough, and Ullerton &mdash; and  have found the same stagnation everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing could be more perfect than the semblance of  unconscious innocence with which the Captain gave this account of himself:  whether he was playing a part, or whether he was telling the entire truth, was  a question which even a cleverer man than Valentine Hawkehurst might have found  himself unable to answer.</p>
<p>The two men sat till late, smoking and talking; but  to-night Valentine found the conversation of his &ldquo;guide, philosopher, and  friend&rdquo; strangely distasteful to him. That cynical manner of looking at life,  which not long ago had seemed to him the only manner compatible with wisdom and  experience, now grated harshly upon those finer senses which had been awakened  in the quiet contemplative existence he had of late been leading. He had been  wont to enjoy Captain Paget&rsquo;s savage bitterness against a world which had not provided  him with a house in Carlton-gardens, and a seat in the Cabinet; but to-night he  was revolted by the noble Horatio&rsquo;s tone and manner. Those malicious sneers  against respectable people and respectable prejudices, with which the Captain  interlarded all his talk, seemed to have a ghastly grimness in their mirth. It  was like the talk of some devil who had once been an angel, and had lost all  hope of ever being restored to his angelic status.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To believe in nothing, to respect nothing, to hope  for nothing, to fear nothing, to consider life as so many years in which to  scheme and lie for the sake of good dinners and well-made coats &mdash; surely there  can be no state of misery more complete, no degradation more consummate,&rdquo;  thought the young man, as he sat by the fireside smoking and listening dreamily  to his companion. &ldquo;Better to be Mrs. Rebecca Haygarth, narrow-minded and  egotistical, but always looking beyond her narrow life to some  dimly-comprehended future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was glad to escape at last from the Captain&rsquo;s  society, and to retire to his own small chamber, where he slept soundly enough  after the day&rsquo;s fatigues, and dreamed of the Haygarths and Charlotte Halliday.</p>
<p>He was up early the next morning; but, on  descending to the sitting-room, he found his patron toasting his <em>Times</em> before a cheerful fire; while his  gold hunting-watch stood open on the breakfast-table, and a couple of new-laid  eggs made a pleasant wabbling noise in a small saucepan upon the hob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t care for eggs, I know, Val,&rdquo; said the  Captain, as he took the saucepan from the hob.</p>
<p>He had heard the young man object to an egg of  French extraction too long severed from its native land; but he knew very well  that for rural delicacies from a reliable dairyman, at twopence apiece, Mr.  Hawkehurst had no particular antipathy. Even in so small a matter as a new-laid  egg the Captain knew how to protect his own interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some of that Italian sausage you&rsquo;re so  fond of, dear boy,&rdquo; he said politely, pointing to a heel of some grayish  horny-looking compound. &ldquo;Thanks; I&rsquo;ll pour out the coffee; there&rsquo;s a knack in  these things; half the clearness of coffee depends on the way in which it&rsquo;s  poured out, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this assurance Captain Paget filled his  own large breakfast-cup with a careful hand and a tender solemnity of  countenance. If he was a trifle less considerate in the pouring out of the  second cup, and if some &ldquo;grounds&rdquo; mingled with the second portion, Valentine  Hawkehurst was unconscious of the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do try that Italian sausage,&rdquo; said the Captain, as  he discussed his second egg, after peeling the most attractive crusts from the  French rolls, and pushing the crumb to his <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you; it looks rather like what your  shop-people call an old housekeeper; besides, there&rsquo;s a little too much garlic  in those compositions for my taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your taste has grown fastidious,&rdquo; said the  Captain; &ldquo;one would think you were going to call upon some ladies this  morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are not many ladies on my visiting-list. O,  by the way, how&rsquo;s
  Diana? Have you seen her lately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the Captain, promptly. &ldquo;I only  returned from my provincial tour a day or two ago, and have had no time to  waste dancing attendance upon her. She&rsquo;s well enough, I&rsquo;ve no doubt; and she&rsquo;s  uncommonly well off in Sheldon&rsquo;s house, and ought to think herself so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having skimmed his newspaper, Captain Paget rose  and invested himself in his overcoat. He put on his hat before the glass over  the mantelpiece, adjusting the brim above his brows with the thoughtful care  that distinguished his performance of all those small duties which he owed to  himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may <em>you</em> be going to do with yourself to-day, Val?&rdquo; he asked of the young man, who sat  nursing his own knee and staring absently at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t quite know,&rdquo; Mr. Hawkehurst  answered, hypocritically; &ldquo;I think I may go as far as Gray&rsquo;s Inn, and look in  upon George Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll dine out of doors, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a polite way of telling Mr. Hawkehurst  that there would be no dinner for him at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I shall. You know I&rsquo;m not punctilious on  the subject of dinner. Anything you please &mdash; from a banquet at the London  Tavern to a ham-sandwich and a glass of ale at fourpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, to be sure; youth is reckless of its gastric  juices. I shall find you at home when I come in to-night, I daresay. I think I  may dine in the city. <em>Au plaisir</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about the pleasure,&rdquo; muttered Mr.  Hawkehurst. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very delightful person, my friend Horatio; but there  comes a crisis in a man&rsquo;s existence when he begins to feel that he has had  enough of you. Poor Diana! what a father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not waste much time on further consideration  of his patron, but set off at once on his way to Gray&rsquo;s Inn. It was too early  to call at the Lawn, or he would fain have gone there before seeking George  Sheldon&rsquo;s dingy offices. Nor could he very well present himself at the gothic  villa without some excuse for so doing. He went to Gray&rsquo;s Inn therefore; but on  his way thither called at a tavern near the Strand, which was the head-quarters  of a literary association known as the Ragamuffins. Here he was fortunate  enough to meet with an acquaintance in the person of a Ragamuffin in the  dramatic-author line, who was reading the morning&rsquo;s criticisms on a rival&rsquo;s  piece produced the night before, with a keen enjoyment of every condemnatory  sentence. From this gentleman Mr. Hawkehurst obtained a box-ticket for a  West-end theatre; and, armed with this mystic document, he felt himself able to  present a bold countenance at Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will she be glad to see me again?&rdquo; he asked  himself. &ldquo;Pshaw! I daresay she has forgotten me by this time. A fortnight is an  age with some women; and I should fancy Charlotte Halliday just one of those  bright impressionable beings who forget easily. I wonder whether she is <em>really</em> like that &lsquo;Molly&rsquo; whose miniature  was found by Mrs. Haygarth in the tulip-leaf escritoire; or was the resemblance  between those two faces only a silly fancy of mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst walked the whole distance from  Chelsea to Gray&rsquo;s Inn; and it was midday when he presented himself before  George Sheldon, whom he found seated at his desk with the elephantine pedigree  of the Haygarths open before him, and profoundly absorbed in the contents of a  note-book. He looked up from this note-book as Valentine entered, but did not  leave off chewing the end of his pencil as he mumbled a welcome to the  returning wanderer. It has been seen that neither of the Sheldon brothers were  demonstrative men.</p>
<p>After that unceremonious greeting, the lawyer  continued his perusal of the note-book for some minutes, while Valentine seated  himself in a clumsy leather-covered arm-chair by the fireplace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young gentleman,&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon exclaimed, as  he closed his book with a triumphant snap, &ldquo;I think <em>you&rsquo;re</em> in for a good thing; and you may thank your lucky stars for  having thrown you into my path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars are not remarkable for their luckiness in  a general way,&rdquo; answered Mr. Hawkehurst, coolly, for the man had not yet been  born from whom he would accept patronage. &ldquo;I suppose if I&rsquo;m in for a good  thing, you&rsquo;re in for a better thing, my dear George; so you needn&rsquo;t come the  benefactor quite so strong for my edification. How did you ferret out the  certificate of gray-eyed Molly&rsquo;s espousals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Sheldon contemplated his coadjutor with an  admiring stare. &ldquo;It has been my privilege to enjoy the society of cool hands,  Mr. Hawkehurst; and certainly you are about the coolest of the lot &mdash; bar one,  as they say in the ring. But that is <em>ni  ci ni l&agrave;</em>. I have found the certificate of Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s marriage, and  to my mind the Haygarth succession is as good as ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, those birds in the bush have such splendid  plumage! but I&rsquo;d rather have the modest sparrow in my hand. However, I&rsquo;m very  glad our affairs are marching. How did you discover the marriage-lines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without hard labour, I can tell you. Of course  my idea of a secret marriage was at the best only a plausible hypothesis; and I  hardly dared to hug myself with the hope that it might turn up trumps. My idea  was based upon two or three facts, namely, the character of the young man, his  long residence in London away from the ken of respectable relatives and  friends, and the extraordinary state of the marriage laws at the period in  which our man lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, to be sure! That was a strong point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should rather think it was. I took the trouble  to look up the history of Mayfair marriages and Fleet marriages before you  started for Ullerton, and I examined all the evidence I could get on that  subject. I made myself familiar with the Rev. Alexander Keith of Mayfair, who  helped to bring clandestine marriages into vogue amongst the swells, and with  Dr. Gaynham &mdash; agreeably nicknamed Bishop of Hell &mdash; and more of the same  calibre; and the result of my investigations convinced me that in those days a  hare-brained young reprobate must have found it rather more difficult to avoid  matrimony than to achieve it. He might be married when he was tipsy; he might  be married when he was comatose from the effects of a stand-up fight with  Mohawks; his name might be assumed by some sportive Benedick of his  acquaintance given to practical joking, and he might find himself saddled with  a wife he never saw; or if, on the other hand, of an artful and deceptive turn,  he might procure a certificate of a marriage that had never taken place, &mdash; for  there were very few friendly offices which the Fleet parsons refused to perform  for their clients &mdash; for a consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how about the legality of the Fleet marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the rub. Before the New Marriage Act passed  in 1753 a Fleet marriage was indissoluble. It was an illegal act, and the  parties were punishable; but the Gordian knot was quite as secure as if it had  been tied in the most orthodox manner. The great difficulty to my mind was the <em>onus probandi</em>. The marriage might have  taken place; the marriage be to all intents and purposes a good marriage; but  how produce undeniable proof of such a ceremony, when all ceremonies of the  kind were performed with a manifest recklessness and disregard of law? Even if  I found an apparently good certificate, how was I to prove that it was not one  of those lying certificates of marriages that had never taken place? Again,  what kind of registers could posterity expect from these parson-adventurers,  very few of whom could spell, and most of whom lived in a chronic state of  drunkenness? They married people sometimes by their Christian names alone &mdash;  very often under assumed names. What consideration had they for heirs-at-law in  the future, when under the soothing influence of a gin-bottle in the present? I  thought of all these circumstances, and I was half inclined to despair of  realising my idea of an early marriage. I took it for granted that such a  secret business would be more likely to have taken place in the precincts of  the Fleet than anywhere else; and having no particular clue, I set to work, in  the first place, to examine all available documents relating to such  marriages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been slow work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <em>was</em> slow work,&rdquo; answered Mr. Sheldon with a suppressed groan, that was evoked by  the memory of a bygone martyrdom. &ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t enter into all the details of the  business, &mdash; the people I had to apply to for permission to see this set of  papers, and the signing and counter-signing I had to go through before I could  see that set of papers, and the extent of circumlocution and idiocy I had to  encounter in a general way before I could complete my investigation. The result  was nil; and after working like a galley-slave I found myself no better off  than before I began my search. Your extracts from Matthew&rsquo;s letters put me on a  new track. I concluded therefrom that there had been a marriage, and that the  said marriage had been a deliberate act on the part of the young man. I  therefore set to work to do what I ought to have done at starting &mdash; I hunted in  all the parish registers to be found within a certain radius of such and such  localities. I began with Clerkenwell, in which neighbourhood our friend spent  such happy years, according to that pragmatical epistle of Mrs. Rebecca&rsquo;s; but  after hunting in all the mouldy old churches within a mile of St. John&rsquo;s-gate,  I was no nearer arriving at any record of Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s existence. So I  turned my back upon Clerkenwell, and went southward to the neighbourhood of the  Marshalsea, where Mistress Molly&rsquo;s father was at one time immured, and whence I  thought it very probable Mistress Molly had started on her career as a matron.  This time my guess was a lucky one. After hunting the registers of St. Olave&rsquo;s,  St. Saviour&rsquo;s, and St. George&rsquo;s, and after the expenditure of more shillings in  donations to sextons than I care to remember, I at last lighted on a document  which I consider worth three thousand pounds to you &mdash; and &mdash; a very decent sum  of money to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what colour our hair will be when we  touch that money?&rdquo; said Valentine meditatively. &ldquo;These sort of cases generally  find their way into Chancery-lane, don&rsquo;t they? &mdash; that lane which, for some  unhappy travellers, has no turning except the one dismal <em>via</em> which leads to dusty death. You seem in very good spirits; and  I suppose I ought to be elated too. Three thousand pounds would give me a start  in life, and enable me to set up in the new character of a respectable  rate-paying citizen. But I&rsquo;ve a kind of presentiment that this hand of mine  will never touch the prize of the victor; or, in plainer English, that no good  will ever arise to me or mine out of the reverend intestate&rsquo;s hundred thousand  pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what a dismal-minded croaker you are this  morning!&rdquo; exclaimed George Sheldon with unmitigated disgust; &ldquo;a regular raven,  by Jove! You come to a fellow&rsquo;s office just as matters are beginning to look  like success &mdash; after ten years&rsquo; plodding and ten years&rsquo; disappointment &mdash; and  you treat him to maudlin howls about the Court of Chancery. This is a new line  you&rsquo;ve struck out, Hawkehurst, and I can tell you it isn&rsquo;t a pleasant one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I suppose I oughtn&rsquo;t to say that sort of  thing,&rdquo; answered Valentine in an apologetic tone; &ldquo;but there are some days in a  man&rsquo;s life when there seems to be a black cloud between him and everything he  looks at. I feel like that today. There&rsquo;s a tightening sensation about  something under my waistcoat &mdash; my heart, perhaps &mdash; a sense of depression that  may be either physical or mental, that I can&rsquo;t get rid of. If a man had walked  by my side from Chelsea to Holborn whispering forebodings of evil into my ear  at every step, I couldn&rsquo;t have felt more downhearted than I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you eat for breakfast?&rdquo; asked Mr. Sheldon  impatiently. &ldquo;A tough beefsteak fried by a lodging-house cook, I daresay &mdash; they <em>will</em> fry their steaks. Don&rsquo;t inflict  the consequences of your indigestible diet upon me. To tell me that there&rsquo;s a  black cloud between you and everything you look at, is only a sentimental way  of telling me that you&rsquo;re bilious. Pray be practical, and let us look at things  from a business point of view. Here is Appendix A. &mdash; a copy of the registry of  the marriage of Matthew Haygarth, bachelor, of Clerkenwell, in the county of  Middlesex, to Mary Murchison, spinster, of Southwark, in the county of Surrey.  And here is Appendix B. &mdash; a copy of the registry of the marriage between  William Meynell, bachelor, of Smithfield, in the county of Middlesex, to  Caroline Mary Haygarth, spinster, of Highgate, in the same county.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have found the entry of a second Haygarthian  marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have. The C. of Matthew&rsquo;s letters is the  Caroline Mary here indicated, the daughter and heiress of Matthew Haygarth &mdash;  doubtless christened Caroline after her gracious majesty the consort of George  II., and Mary after the Molly whose picture was found in the tulip-leaf bureau.  The Meynell certificate was easy enough to find, since the letters told me that  Miss C.&rsquo;s suitor had a father who lived in Aldersgate-street, and a father who  approved his son&rsquo;s choice. The Aldersgate citizen had a house of his own, and a  more secure social status altogether than that poor, weak, surreptitious  Matthew. It was therefore only natural that the marriage should be celebrated  in the Meynell mansion. Having considered this, I had only to ransack the  registers of a certain number of churches round and about Aldersgate-street in  order to find what I wanted; and after about a day and a half of hard labour, I  did find the invaluable document which places me one generation nearer the  present, and on the high-road to the discovery of my heir-at-law. I searched  the same registry for children of the aforesaid William and Caroline Mary  Meynell, but could find no record of such children nor any further entry of the  name of Meynell. But we must search other registries within access of  Aldersgate-street before we give up the idea of finding such entries in that  neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is to be the next move?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hunting-up of all descendants of this William  and Caroline Mary Meynell, wheresoever such descendants are to be found. We are  now altogether off the Haygarth and Judson scent, and have to beat a new  covert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Valentine more cheerfully. &ldquo;How  is the new covert to be beaten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must start from Aldersgate-street. Meynell of  Aldersgate-street must have been a responsible man, and it will be hard if  there is no record of him extant in all the old topographical histories of  wards, without and within, which cumber the shelves of your dry-as-dust  libraries. We must hunt up all available books; and when we&rsquo;ve got all the  information that books can give us, we can go in upon hearsay evidence, which  is always the most valuable in these cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means another encounter with ancient mariners  &mdash; I beg your pardon &mdash; oldest inhabitants,&rdquo; said Valentine with a despondent  yawn. &ldquo;Well, I suppose that sort of individual is a little less obtuse when he  lives within the roar of the great city&rsquo;s thunder than when he vegetates in the  dismal outskirts of a manufacturing town. Where am I to find my octogenarian  prosers? and when am I to begin my operations upon them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner you begin the better,&rdquo; replied Mr.  Sheldon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken all preliminary steps for you already, and you&rsquo;ll find the  business tolerably smooth sailing. I&rsquo;ve made a list of certain people who may  be worth seeing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon selected a paper from the numerous  documents upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;John Grewter, wholesale  stationer, Aldersgate-street; Anthony Sparsfield, carver and gilder, in Barbican.  These are, so far as I can ascertain, the two oldest men now trading in  Aldersgate-street; and from these men you ought to be able to find out  something about old Meynell. I don&rsquo;t anticipate any difficulty about the  Meynells, except the possibility that we may find more of them than we want,  and have some trouble in shaking them into their places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tackle my friend the stationer to-morrow  morning,&rdquo; said Valentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better drop in upon him in the afternoon,  when the day&rsquo;s business may be pretty well over,&rdquo; returned the prudent Sheldon.  &ldquo;And now all you&rsquo;ve got to do, Hawkehurst, is to work with a will, and work on  patiently. If you do as well in London as you did at Ullerton, neither you nor  I will have any cause to complain. Of course I needn&rsquo;t impress upon you the  importance of secrecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Valentine; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m quite alive to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then proceeded to inform George Sheldon of that  encounter with Captain Paget on the platform at Ullerton, and of the suspicion  that had been awakened in his mind by the sight of the glove in Goodge&rsquo;s  parlour.</p>
<p>The lawyer shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That idea about the glove was rather far-fetched,&rdquo;  he said, thoughtfully; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t like the look of that meeting at the  station. My brother Philip is capable of anything in the way of manoeuvring;  and I&rsquo;m not ashamed to confess that I&rsquo;m no match for him. He was in here one  day when I had the Haygarth pedigree spread out on the table, and I know he  smelt a rat. We must beware of him, Hawkehurst, and we must work against time  if we don&rsquo;t want him to anticipate us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t let the grass grow under my feet,&rdquo;  replied Valentine. &ldquo;I was really interested in that Haygarthian history: there  was a dash of romance about it, you see. I don&rsquo;t feel the same gusto in the  Meynell chase, but I daresay I shall begin to get up an interest in it as my  investigation proceeds. Shall I call the day after to-morrow and tell you my  adventures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;d better stick to the old plan, and  let me have the result of your work in the form of a diary,&rdquo; answered Sheldon.  And with this the two men parted.</p>
<p>It was now half-past two o&rsquo;clock; it would be  half-past three before Valentine could present himself at the Lawn &mdash; a very  seasonable hour at which to call upon Mrs. Sheldon with his offering of a box  for the new play.</p>
<p>An omnibus conveyed him to Bayswater at a snail&rsquo;s  pace, and with more stoppages than ever mortal omnibus was subjected to before,  as it seemed to that one eager passenger. At last the fading foliage of the  Park appeared between the hats and bonnets of Valentine&rsquo;s opposite neighbours.  Even those orange tawny trees reminded him of Charlotte. Beneath such umbrage  had he parted from her. And now he was going to see the bright young face once  more. He had been away from town about a fortnight; but taken in relation with  Miss Halliday, that fortnight seemed half a century.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums and china-asters beautified Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s neat little garden, and the plate-glass windows of his house shone  with all their wonted radiance. It was like the houses one sees framed and  glazed in an auctioneer&rsquo;s office &mdash; the greenest imaginable grass, the bluest  windows, the reddest bricks, the whitest stone. &ldquo;It is a house that would set  my teeth on edge, but for the one sweet creature who lives in it,&rdquo; Valentine  thought to himself, as he waited at the florid iron gate, which was painted a  vivid ultramarine and picked out with gold.</p>
<p>He tried in vain to catch a glimpse of some  feminine figure in the small suburban garden. No flutter of scarlet petticoat  or flash of scarlet plume revealed the presence of the divinity.</p>
<p>The prim maid-servant informed him that Mrs.  Sheldon was at home, and asked if he would please to walk into the  drawing-room.</p>
<p>Would he please? Would he not have been pleased to  walk into a raging furnace if there had been a chance of meeting Charlotte  Halliday amid the flames? He followed the maid-servant into Mrs. Sheldon&rsquo;s  irreproachable apartment, where the show books upon the show table were ranged  at the usual mathematically correct distances from one another, and where the  speckless looking-glasses and all-pervading French polish imparted a chilly  aspect to the chamber. A newly-lighted fire was smouldering in the shining  steel grate, and a solitary female figure was seated by the broad Tudor window  bending over some needlework.</p>
<p>It was the figure of Diana Paget, and she was quite  alone in the room. Valentine&rsquo;s heart sank a little as he saw the solitary  figure, and perceived that it was not the woman he loved.</p>
<p>Diana looked up from her work and recognised the  visitor. Her face flushed, but the flush faded very quickly, and Valentine was  not conscious of that flattering indication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Diana?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here I am again,  you see, like the proverbial bad shilling. I have brought Mrs. Sheldon an order  for the Princess&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind; but I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;ll care  to go. She was complaining of a headache this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, she&rsquo;ll forget all about her headache if she  wants to go to the play. She&rsquo;s the sort of little woman who is always ready for  a theatre or a concert. Besides, Miss Halliday may like to go, and will easily  persuade her mamma. Whom could she not persuade?&rdquo; added Mr. Hawkehurst within  himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Halliday is out of town,&rdquo; Diana replied  coldly.</p>
<p>The young man felt as if his heart were suddenly  transformed into so much lead, so heavy did it seem to grow. What a foolish  thing it seemed that he should be the victim of this fair enslaver! &mdash; he who  until lately had fancied himself incapable of any earnest feeling or deep emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of town!&rdquo; he repeated with unconcealed  disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she has gone on a visit to some relations in  Yorkshire. She actually has relations; doesn&rsquo;t that sound strange to you and  me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine did not notice this rather cynical  remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be away ever so long, I suppose?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea how long she may stay there. The  people idolise her, I understand. You know it is her privilege to be idolised;  and of course they will persuade her to stay as long as they can. You seem  disappointed at not seeing her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very much disappointed,&rdquo; Valentine answered  frankly; &ldquo;she is a sweet girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence after this. Miss Paget resumed  her work with rapid fingers. She was picking up shining little beads one by one  on the point of her needle, and transferring them to the canvas stretched upon  an embroidery frame before her. It was a kind of work exacting extreme care and  precision, and the girl&rsquo;s hand never faltered, though a tempest of passionate  feeling agitated her as she worked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry not to see her,&rdquo; Valentine said  presently, &ldquo;for the sight of her is very dear to me. Why should I try to hide  my feelings from you, Diana? We have endured so much misery together that there  must be some bond of union between us. To me you have always seemed like a  sister, and I have no wish to keep any secret from you, though you receive me  so coldly that one would think I had offended you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not offended me. I thank you for being so  frank with me. You would have gained little by an opposite course. I have long  known your affection for Charlotte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guessed my secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw what any one could have seen who had taken  the trouble to watch you for ten minutes during your visits to this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was my unhappy state so very conspicuous?&rdquo;  exclaimed Valentine, laughing. &ldquo;Was I so obviously spoony? <em>I</em> who have so ridiculed anything in the way of sentiment. You make  me blush for my folly, Diana. What is that you are dotting with all those  beads? &mdash; something very elaborate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a prie-dieu chair I am working for Mrs.  Sheldon. Of course I am bound to do something for my living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you wear out your eyesight in the working  of chairs. Poor girl! it seems hard that your beauty and accomplishments should  not find a better market than that. I daresay you will marry some millionaire  friend of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s one of these days, and I shall hear of your house in  Park-lane and three-hundred guinea barouche.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind to promise me a millionaire. The  circumstances of my existence hitherto have been so peculiarly fortunate that I  am justified in expecting such a suitor. My millionaire shall ask you to dinner  at my house in Park-lane; and you shall play <em>&eacute;cart&eacute;</em> with him, if you like &mdash; papa&rsquo;s kind of <em>&eacute;cart&eacute;</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of those things, Di,&rdquo; said Mr.  Hawkehurst, with something that was almost a shudder; &ldquo;let us forget that we  ever led that kind of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Diana, &ldquo;let us forget it &mdash; if we  can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bitterness of her tone struck him painfully. He  sat for some minutes watching her silently, and pitying her fate. What a sad  fate it seemed, and how hopeless! For him there was always some chance of  redemption. He could go out into the world, and cut his way through the forest  of difficulty with the axe of the conqueror. But what could a woman do who  found herself in the midst of that dismal forest? She could only sit at the  door of her lonesome hut, looking out with weary eyes for the prince who was to  come and rescue her. And Valentine remembered how many women there are to whom  the prince never comes, and who must needs die and be buried beneath that  gloomy umbrage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! let us have women doctors, women lawyers, women  parsons, women stone-breakers &mdash; anything rather than these dependent creatures  who sit in other people&rsquo;s houses working prie-dieu chairs and pining for  freedom,&rdquo; he thought to himself, as he watched the pale stern face in the chill  afternoon light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do leave off working for a few minutes, and talk  to me, Di,&rdquo; he said rather impatiently. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how painful it is to a  man to see a woman absorbed in some piece of needlework at the very moment when  he wants all her sympathy. I am afraid you are not quite happy. Do confide in  me, dear, as frankly as I confide in you. Are these people kind to you?  Charlotte is, of course. But the elder birds, Mr. and Mrs. Sheldon, are they  kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are very kind. Mr. Sheldon is not a  demonstrative man, as you know; but I am not accustomed to have people in a  rapturous state of mind about me and my affairs. He is kinder to me than my father  ever was; and I don&rsquo;t see how I can expect more than that. Mrs. Sheldon is  extremely kind in her way &mdash; which is rather a feeble way, as you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Charlotte &mdash; ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You answered for Charlotte yourself just now. Yes,  she is very, very, very good to me; much better than I deserve. I was almost  going to quote the collect, and say &lsquo;desire or deserve.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you not desire or deserve her  goodness?&rdquo; asked Valentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am not a loveable kind of person. I am  not sympathetic. I know that Charlotte is very fascinating, very charming; but  sometimes her very fascination repels me. I think the atmosphere of that  horrible swampy district between Lambeth and Battersea, where my childhood was  spent, must have soured my disposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Diana; you have only learnt a bitter way of  talking. I know your heart is noble and true. I have seen your suppressed  indignation many a time when your father&rsquo;s meannesses have revolted you. Our  lives have been very hard, dear; but let us hope for brighter days. I think  they must come to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will never come to me,&rdquo; said Diana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that with an air of conviction. But why  should they not come to you &mdash; brighter and better days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you that. I can only tell you that  they will not come.
  And do you hope that any good will ever come of your love for Charlotte
  Halliday &mdash; you, who know Mr. Sheldon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to hope anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that Mr. Sheldon would let his  stepdaughter marry a penniless man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may not always be penniless. Besides, Mr. Sheldon  has no actual authority over Charlotte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he has moral influence over her. She is very  easily influenced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to hope even in spite of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s  opposing influence. You must not try to crush this one little floweret that has  grown up in a barren waste, Diana. It is my prison-flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheldon came into the room as he said this.  She was very cordial, very eloquent upon the subject of her headache, and very  much inclined to go to the theatre, notwithstanding that ailment, when she  heard that Mr. Hawkehurst had been kind enough to bring her a box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana and I could go,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if we can manage  to be in time after our six o&rsquo;clock dinner. Mr. Sheldon does not care about  theatres. All the pieces tire him. He declares they are all stupid. But then,  you see, if one&rsquo;s mind is continually wandering, the cleverest piece must seem  stupid,&rdquo; Mrs. Sheldon added thoughtfully; &ldquo;and my husband is so very  absent-minded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After some further discussion about the theatres,  Valentine bade the ladies good afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you stop to see Mr. Sheldon?&rdquo; asked  Georgina; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s in the library with Captain Paget. You did not know that your  papa was here, did you, Diana, my dear? He came in with Mr. Sheldon an hour  ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t disturb Mr. Sheldon,&rdquo; said Valentine. &ldquo;I  will call again in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took leave of the two ladies, and went out into  the hall. As he emerged from the drawing-room, the door of the library was  opened, and he heard Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s voice within, saying, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo; &mdash; your accuracy with regard to the name of  Meynell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the close of a sentence; but the name struck  immediately upon Valentine&rsquo;s ear. Meynell! &mdash; the name which had for him so  peculiar an interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it only a coincidence,&rdquo; he thought to himself,  &ldquo;or is Horatio Paget on our track?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he argued with himself that his ears might  have deceived him, and that the name he had heard might not have been Meynell,  but only a name of somewhat similar sound.</p>
<p>It was Captain Paget who had opened the door. He  came into the hall and recognised his <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em>.  They left the house together, and the Captain was especially gracious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will dine together somewhere at the West-end,  Val,&rdquo; he said; but, to his surprise, Mr. Hawkehurst declined the proffered  entertainment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired out with a hard day&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;and should be very bad company; so, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;ll go back to  Omega-street and get a chop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain stared at him in amazement. He could  not comprehend the man who could refuse to dine luxuriously at the expense of  his fellow-man.</p>
<p>Valentine had of late acquired new prejudices. He  no longer cared to enjoy the hospitality of Horatio Paget. In Omega-street the  household expenses were shared by the two men. It was a kind of club upon a  small scale; and there was no degradation in breaking bread with the elegant  Horatio.</p>
<p>To Omega-street Valentine returned this afternoon,  there to eat a frugal meal and spend a meditative evening, uncheered by one  glimmer of that radiance which more fortunate men know as the light of home.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
  Valentine&rsquo;s Record Continued</h2>
<p><em>October 15th</em>. I left Omega-street for  the City before noon, after a hasty breakfast with my friend Horatio, who was  somewhat under the dominion of his black dog this morning, and far from  pleasant company. I was not to present myself to the worthy John Grewter,  wholesale stationer, before the afternoon; but I had no particular reason for  staying at home, and I had a fancy for strolling about the old City quarter in  which Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s youth had been spent. I went to look at John-street,  Clerkenwell, and dawdled about the immediate neighbourhood of Smithfield,  thinking of the old fair-time, and of all the rioters and merry-makers, who now  were so much or so little dust and ashes in City churchyards, until the great  bell of St. Paul&rsquo;s boomed three, and I felt that it might be a leisure time  with Mr. Grewter.</p>
<p>I found the stationer&rsquo;s shop as darksome and dreary  as City shops usually are, but redolent of that subtle odour of wealth which  has a mystical charm for the nostrils of the penniless one. Stacks of ledgers,  mountains of account-books, filled the dimly-lighted warehouse. Some clerks  were at work behind a glass partition, and already the gas flared high in the  green-shaded lamps above the desk at which they worked. I wondered whether it  was a pleasant way of life theirs, and whether one would come to feel an  interest in the barter of day-books and ledgers if they were one&rsquo;s daily bread.  Alas for me! the only ledger I have ever known is the sainted patron of the  northern racecourse. One young man came forward and asked my business, with a  look that plainly told me that unless I wanted two or three gross of  account-books I had no right to be there. I told him that I wished to see Mr.  Grewter, and asked if that gentleman was to be seen.</p>
<p>The clerk said he did not know; but his tone  implied that, in his opinion, I could <em>not</em> see Mr. Grewter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you could go and ask,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes. Is it old or young Mr. Grewter you want  to see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Mr. Grewter,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll go and see. You&rsquo;d better send in  your card, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I produced one of George Sheldon&rsquo;s cards, which the  clerk looked at. He gave a little start as if an adder had stung him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not Mr. Sheldon?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; Mr. Sheldon is my employer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you go about giving people Sheldon&rsquo;s card  for?&rdquo; asked the clerk, with quite an aggrieved air. &ldquo;I know Sheldon of Gray&rsquo;s  Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve found him a very  accommodating gentleman,&rdquo; I replied, politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deuce take his accommodation! He nearly  accommodated me into the Bankruptcy Court. And so you&rsquo;re Sheldon&rsquo;s clerk, and  you want the governor. But you don&rsquo;t mean to say that Grewter and Grewter are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said in an awe-stricken undertone. I  hastened to reassure the stationer&rsquo;s clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Sheldon ever saw Mr. Grewter in  his life,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>After this the clerk condescended to retire into  the unknown antres behind the shop, to deliver my message. I began to think  that George Sheldon&rsquo;s card was not the best possible letter of introduction.</p>
<p>The clerk returned presently, followed by a tall,  white-bearded man, with a bent figure, and a pair of penetrating gray eyes &mdash; a  very promising specimen of the octogenarian.</p>
<p>He asked me my business in a sharp suspicious way,  that obliged me to state the nature of my errand without circumlocution. As I  got farther away from the Rev. John Haygarth, intestate, I was less fettered by  the necessity of secrecy. I informed my octogenarian that I was prosecuting a  legal investigation connected with a late inhabitant of that street, and that I  had taken the liberty to apply to him, in the hope that he might be able to  afford me some information.</p>
<p>He looked at me all the time I spoke as if he  thought I was going to entreat pecuniary relief &mdash; and I daresay I have  something the air of a begging-letter writer. But when he found that I only  wanted information, his hard gray eyes softened ever so little, and he asked me  to walk into his parlour.</p>
<p>His parlour was scarcely less gruesome than his  shop. The furniture looked as if its manufacture had been coeval with the time  of the Meynells, and the ghastly glare of the gas seemed a kind of anachronism.  After a few preliminary observations, which were not encouraged by Mr.  Grewter&rsquo;s manner, I inquired whether he had ever heard the name of Meynell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there was a Meynell in this street  when I was a young man &mdash; Christian Meynell, a carpet-maker by trade. The  business is still carried on &mdash; and a very old business it is, for it was an old  business in Meynell&rsquo;s time; but Meynell died before I married, and his name is  pretty well forgotten in Aldersgate-street by this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had he no sons?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes; he had one son, Samuel, a kind of  companion of mine. But he didn&rsquo;t take to the business, and when his father died  he let things go anyhow, as you may say. He was rather wild, and died two or  three years after his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he die unmarried?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. There was some talk of his marrying a Miss  Dobberly, whose father was a cabinet-maker in Jewin-street; but Samuel was too  wild for the Dobberlys, who were steady-going people, and he went abroad, where  he was taken with some kind of fever and died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was this son the only child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; there were two daughters. The younger of them  married; the elder went to live with her &mdash; and died unmarried, I&rsquo;ve heard say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know whom the younger sister married?&rdquo; I  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She didn&rsquo;t marry in London. She went into the  country to visit some friends, and she married and settled down in those parts  &mdash; wherever it might be &mdash; and I never heard of her coming back to London again.  The carpet business was sold directly after Samuel Meynell&rsquo;s death. The new  people kept up the name for a good twenty years&mdash;&lsquo;Taylor, late Meynell,  established 1693,&rsquo; that&rsquo;s what was painted on the board above the window &mdash; but  they&rsquo;ve dropped the name of Meynell now. People forget old names, you see, and  it&rsquo;s no use keeping to them after they&rsquo;re forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, the old names are forgotten, the old people  fade off the face of the earth. The romance of Matthew Haygarth seemed to come  to a lame and impotent conclusion in this dull record of dealers in carpeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t remember what part of England it was  that Christian
  Meynell&rsquo;s daughter went to when she married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. It wasn&rsquo;t a matter I took much interest in. I  don&rsquo;t think I ever spoke to the young woman above three times in my life,  though she lived in the same street, and though her brother and I often met  each other at the Cat and Salutation, where there used to be a great deal of  talk about the war and Napoleon Bonaparte in those days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea of the time at which she was  married?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as to the exact year. I know it was after I  was married; for I remember my wife and I sitting at our window upstairs one  summer Sunday evening, and seeing Samuel Meynell&rsquo;s sister go by to church. I  can remember it as well as if it was yesterday. She was dressed in a white gown  and a green silk spencer. Yes &mdash; and I didn&rsquo;t marry my first wife till 1814. But  as to telling you exactly when Miss Meynell left Aldersgate-street, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These reminiscences of the past seemed to exercise  rather a mollifying influence upon the old man&rsquo;s mind, commonplace as they  were. He ceased to look at me with sharp, suspicious glances, and he seemed  anxious to afford me all the help he could. &ldquo;Was Christian Meynell&rsquo;s father  called William?&rdquo; I asked, after having paused to make some notes in my  pocket-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I can&rsquo;t tell you; though, if Christian  Meynell was living to-day, he wouldn&rsquo;t be ten years older than me. His father  died when I was quite a boy; but there must be old books at the warehouse with  his name in them, if they haven&rsquo;t been destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I determined to make inquiries at the carpet  warehouse; but I had little hope of finding the books of nearly a century gone  by. I tried another question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know whether Christian Meynell was an only  son, or the only son who attained manhood?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>My elderly friend shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christian Meynell never had any brothers that I  heard of,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but the parish register will tell you all about that,  supposing that his father before him lived all his life in Aldersgate-street,  as I&rsquo;ve every reason to believe he did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this I asked a few questions about the  neighbouring churches, thanked Mr. Grewter for his civility, and departed.</p>
<p>I went back to Omega-street, dined upon nothing  particular, and devoted the rest of my evening to the scrawling of this  journal, and a tender reverie, in which Charlotte Halliday was the central  figure.</p>
<p>How bitter poverty and dependence have made Diana  Paget! She used to be a nice girl too.</p>
<p><em>Oct. 16th</em>. To-day&rsquo;s work has been  confined to the investigation of parish registers &mdash; a most wearisome business  at the best. My labours were happily not without result. In the fine old church  of St. Giles, Cripplegate, I found registries of the baptism of Oliver Meynell,  son of William and Caroline Mary Meynell, 1768; and of the burial of the same  Oliver in the following year. I found the record of the baptism of a daughter  to the same William and Caroline Mary Meynell, and further on the burial of the  said daughter, at five years of age. I also found the records of the baptism of  Christian Meynell, son of the same William and Caroline Mary Meynell, in the  year 1772, and of William Meynell&rsquo;s decease in the year 1793. Later appeared  the entry of the burial of Sarah, widow of Christian Meynell. Later still, the  baptism of Samuel Meynell; then the baptism of Susan Meynell; and finally, that  of Charlotte Meynell.</p>
<p>These were all the entries respecting the Meynell  family to be found in the registry. There was no record of the burial of  Caroline Mary, wife of William Meynell, nor of Christian Meynell, nor of Samuel  Meynell, his son; and I knew that all these entries would be necessary to my  astute Sheldon before his case would be complete. After my search of the  registries, I went out into the churchyard to grope for the family vault of the  Meynells, and found a grim square monument, enclosed by a railing that was  almost eaten away by rust, and inscribed with the names and virtues of that  departed house. The burial ground is interesting by reason of more  distinguished company than the Meynells. John Milton, John Fox, author of the  Martyrology, and John Speed, the chronologer, rest in this City churchyard.</p>
<p>In the hope of getting some clue to the missing  data, I ventured to make a second call upon Mr. Grewter, whom I found rather  inclined to be snappish, as considering the Meynell business unlikely to result  in any profit to himself, and objecting on principle to take any trouble not  likely to result in profit. I believe this is the mercantile manner of looking  at things in a general way.</p>
<p>I asked him if he could tell me where Samuel  Meynell was buried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he was buried in foreign parts,&rdquo; replied  the old gentleman, with considerable grumpiness, &ldquo;since he died in foreign  parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, he died abroad, did he? Can you tell me where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied Mr. Grewter, with  increasing grumpiness; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t trouble myself about other people&rsquo;s affairs  then, and I don&rsquo;t trouble myself about them now, and I don&rsquo;t particularly care  to be troubled about them by strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made the meekest possible apology for my  intrusion, but the outraged<br>
  Grewter was not appeased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your best apology will be not doing it again,&rdquo; he  replied. &ldquo;Those that know my habits know that I take half an hour&rsquo;s nap after  dinner. My constitution requires it, or I shouldn&rsquo;t take it. If I didn&rsquo;t happen  to have a strange warehouseman on my premises, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been allowed  to disturb me two afternoons running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finding Mr. Grewter unappeasable, I left him, and  went to seek a more placable spirit in the shape of Anthony Sparsfield, carver  and gilder, of Barbican.</p>
<p>I found the establishment of Sparsfield and Son, carvers  and gilders. It was a low dark shop, in the window of which were exhibited two  or three handsomely carved frames, very much the worse for flies, and one  oil-painting, of a mysterious and Rembrandtish character. The old-established  air that pervaded almost all the shops in this neighbourhood was peculiarly  apparent in the Sparsfield establishment.</p>
<p>In the shop I found a mild-faced man of about forty  engaged in conversation with a customer. I waited patiently while the customer  finished a minute description of the kind of frame he wanted made for a set of  proof engravings after Landseer; and when the customer had departed, I asked  the mild-faced man if I could see Mr. Sparsfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mr. Sparsfield,&rdquo; he replied politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Mr. Anthony Sparsfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my name is Anthony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was given to understand that Mr. Anthony  Sparsfield was a much older person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I suppose you mean my father,&rdquo; replied the  mild-faced man. &ldquo;My father is advanced in years, and does very little in the  business nowadays; not but what his head is as clear as ever it was, and there  are some of our old customers like to see him when they give an order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This sounded hopeful. I told Mr. Sparsfield the  younger that I was not a customer, and then proceeded to state the nature of my  business. I found him as courteous as Mr. Grewter had been disobliging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me and father are old-fashioned people,&rdquo; he said;  &ldquo;and we&rsquo;re not above living over our place of business, which most of the  Barbican tradespeople are nowadays. The old gentleman is taking tea in the  parlour upstairs at this present moment, and if you don&rsquo;t mind stepping up to  him, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;ll be proud to give you any information he can. He likes  talking of old times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the sort of oldest inhabitant I wanted to  meet with &mdash; a very different kind of individual from Mr. Grewter, who doled out  every answer to my questions as grudgingly as if it had been a five-pound note.</p>
<p>I was conducted to a snug little sitting-room on  the first-floor, where there was a cheerful fire and a comfortable odour of tea  and toast. I was invited to take a cup of tea; and as I perceived that my  acceptance of the invitation would be accounted a kind of favour, I said yes.  The tea was very weak, and very warm, and very sweet; but Mr. Sparsfield and  his son sipped it with as great an air of enjoyment as if it had been the most  inspiring of beverages.</p>
<p>Mr. Sparsfield the elder was more or less rheumatic  and asthmatic, but a cheerful old man withal, and quite ready to prate of old  times, when Barbican and Aldersgate-street were pleasanter places than they are  to-day, or had seemed so to this elderly citizen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meynell!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;I knew Sam Meynell as  well as I knew my own brother, and I knew old Christian Meynell almost as well  as I knew my own father. There was more sociability in those days, you see,  sir. The world seems to have grown too full to leave any room for friendship.  It&rsquo;s all push and struggle, and struggle and push, as you may say; and a man  will make you a frame for five-and-twenty shillings that will look more  imposing like than what I could turn out for five pound. Only the gold-leaf  will all drop off after a twelvemonth&rsquo;s wear; and that&rsquo;s the way of the world  nowadays. There&rsquo;s a deal of gilding, and things are made to look uncommon  bright; but the gold all drops off &rsquo;em before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After allowing the old man to moralise to his  heart&rsquo;s content, I brought him back politely to the subject in which I was  interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Samuel Meynell was as good a fellow as ever  breathed,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but he was too fond of the tavern. There were some very  nice taverns round about Aldersgate-street in those days; and you see, sir, the  times were stirring times, and folks liked to get together and talk over the  day&rsquo;s news, with a pipe of tobacco and a glass of their favourite liquor, all  in a sociable way. Poor Sam Meynell took a little too much of his favourite  liquor; and when the young woman that he had been keeping company with &mdash; Miss  Dobberly of Jewin-street &mdash; jilted him and married a wholesale butcher in  Newgate Market, who was old enough to be her father, Sam took to drinking, and  neglected his business. One day he came to me and said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve sold the  business, Tony,&rsquo; &mdash; for it was Sam and Tony with us, you see, sir,&mdash; &lsquo;and I&rsquo;m off  to France.&rsquo; This was soon after the battle of Waterloo; and many folks had a  fancy for going over to France now that they&rsquo;d seen the back of Napoleon  Bonaparte, who was generally alluded to in those days by the name of monster or  tiger, and was understood to make his chief diet off frogs. Well, sir, we were  all of us very much surprised at Sam&rsquo;s going to foreign parts; but as he&rsquo;d  always been wild, it was only looked upon as a part of his wildness, and we  weren&rsquo;t so much surprised to hear a year or two afterwards that he&rsquo;d drunk  himself to death upon cheap brandy &mdash; odyvee as <em>they</em> call it, poor ignorant creatures &mdash; at Calais.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He died at Calais?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the old man; &ldquo;I forget who brought  the news home, but I remember hearing it. Poor Sam Meynell died and was buried  amongst the Mossoos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure he was buried at Calais?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, as sure as I can be of anything. Travelling  was no easy matter in those days, and in foreign parts there was nothing but  diligences, which I&rsquo;ve heard say were the laziest-going vehicles ever invented.  There was no one to bring poor Sam&rsquo;s remains back to England, for his mother  was dead, and his two sisters were settled somewhere down in Yorkshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Yorkshire! I am afraid I looked rather sheepish  when Mr. Sparsfield senior mentioned this particular county, for my thoughts  took wing and were with Charlotte Halliday before the word had well escaped his  lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Meynell settled in Yorkshire, did she?&rdquo; I  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she married some one in the farming way down  there. Her mother was a Yorkshirewoman, and she and her sister went visiting  among her mother&rsquo;s relations, and never came back to London. One of them  married, the other died a spinster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the name of the man she married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sparsfield, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I  do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the name of the place she went to  &mdash; the town or village, or whatever it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might remember it if I heard it,&rdquo; he responded  thoughtfully; &ldquo;and I ought to remember it, for I&rsquo;ve heard Sam Meynell talk of  his sister Charlotte&rsquo;s home many a time. She was christened Charlotte, you see,  after the Queen. I&rsquo;ve a sort of notion that the name of the village was  something ending in Cross, as it might be Charing Cross, or Waltham Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was vague, but it was a great deal more than I  had been able to extort from Mr. Grewter. I took a second cup of the sweet warm  liquid which my new friends called tea, in order to have an excuse for  loitering, while I tried to obtain more light from the reminiscences of the old  frame-maker.</p>
<p>No more light came, however. So I was fain to take  my leave, reserving to myself the privilege of calling again on a future  occasion.</p>
<p><em>Oct. 18th</em>. I sent Sheldon a  statement of my Aldersgate-street researches the day before yesterday morning.  He went carefully through the information I had collected, and approved my  labours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done uncommonly well, considering the short  time you&rsquo;ve been at the work,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve reason to congratulate  yourself upon having your ground all laid out for you, as my ground has never  been laid out for me. The Meynell branch seems to be narrowing itself into the  person of Christian Meynell&rsquo;s daughter and her descendants, and our most  important business now will be to find out when, where, and whom she married,  and what issue arose from such marriage. This I think you ought to be able to  do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head rather despondingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any hope of finding out the name of  the young woman&rsquo;s husband,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;unless I can come across another oldest  inhabitant, gifted with a better memory for names and places than my obliging  Sparsfield or my surly Grewter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are the almshouses,&rdquo; said Sheldon; &ldquo;you  haven&rsquo;t tried them yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I suppose I must go in for the almshouses,&rdquo; I  replied, with the sublime resignation of the pauper, whose poverty must consent  to anything; &ldquo;though I confess that the prosiness of the almshouse intellect is  almost more than I can endure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you know that you mayn&rsquo;t get the name  of the place out of your friend the carver and gilder?&rdquo; said George Sheldon;  &ldquo;he has given you some kind of clue in telling you that the name ends in Cross.  He said he should know the name if he heard it; why not try him with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in order to do that, I must know the name  myself,&rdquo; replied I, &ldquo;and in that case I shouldn&rsquo;t want the aid of my  Sparsfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not great in expedients,&rdquo; said Sheldon,  tilting back his chair, and taking a shabby folio from a shelf of other shabby  folios. &ldquo;This is a British gazetteer,&rdquo; he said, turning to the index of the  work before him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll test the ancient Sparsfield&rsquo;s memory with every Cross  in the three Ridings, and if the faintest echo of the name we want still  lingers in his feeble old brain, we&rsquo;ll awaken it.&rdquo; My patron ran his  finger-nail along one of the columns of the index.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just take your pencil and write down the names as  I call them,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here we are &mdash; Aylsey Cross; and here we are again &mdash;  Bowford Cross, Callindale Cross, Huxter&rsquo;s Cross, Jarnam Cross, Kingborough  Cross.&rdquo; Then, after a careful examination of the column, he exclaimed, &ldquo;Those  are all the Crosses in the county of York, and it will go hard with us if you  or I can&rsquo;t find the descendants of Christian Meynell&rsquo;s daughter at one of them.  The daughter herself may be alive, for anything we know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about the Samuel Meynell who died at  Calais? You&rsquo;ll have to find some record of his death, won&rsquo;t you? I suppose in  these cases one must prove everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I must prove the demise of Samuel,&rdquo; replied  the sanguine genealogist; &ldquo;that part of the business I&rsquo;ll see to myself, while  you hunt out the female branch of the Meynells. I want an outing after a long  spell of hard work; so I&rsquo;ll run across to Calais and search for the register of  Samuel&rsquo;s interment. I suppose somebody took the trouble to bury him, though he  was a stranger in the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I extort the name we want from poor old  Sparsfield&rsquo;s recollection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case you can start at once for the place,  and begin your search on the spot. It can&rsquo;t be above fifty years since this  woman married, and there must be some inhabitant of the place old enough to  remember her. O, by the bye, I suppose you&rsquo;ll be wanting more cash for  expenses,&rdquo; added Mr. Sheldon, with a sigh. He took a five-pound note from his  pocket-book, and gave it to me with a piteous air of self-sacrifice. I know that  he is poor, and that whatever money he does contrive to earn is extorted from  the necessities of his needier brethren. Some of this money he speculates upon  the chances of the Haygarthian succession, as he has speculated his money on  worse chances in the past. &ldquo;Three thousand pounds!&rdquo; he said to me, as he handed  me the poor little five-pound note; &ldquo;think what a prize you are working for,  and work your hardest. The nearer we get to the end, the slower our progress  seems to me; and yet it has been very rapid progress, considering all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So sentimental have I become, that I thought less  of that possible three thousand pounds than of the fact that I was likely to go  to Yorkshire, the county of Charlotte&rsquo;s birth, the county where she was now  staying. I reminded myself that it was the largest shire in England, and that  of all possible coincidences of time and place, there could be none more  unlikely than the coincidence that would bring about a meeting between  Charlotte Halliday and me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that for all practical purposes I shall be  no nearer to her in Yorkshire than in London,&rdquo; I said to myself; &ldquo;but I shall  have the pleasure of fancying myself nearer to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before leaving George Sheldon, I told him of the  fragmentary sentences I had heard uttered by Captain Paget and Philip Sheldon  at the Lawn; but he pooh-poohed my suspicions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Valentine Hawkehurst,&rdquo;  he said, fixing those hard black eyes of his upon me as if he would fain have  pierced the bony covering of my skull to discover the innermost workings of my  brain; &ldquo;neither Captain Paget nor my brother Phil can know anything of this  business, unless you have turned traitor and sold them my secrets. And mark me,  if you have, you&rsquo;ve sold yourself and them into the bargain: my hand holds the  documentary evidence, without which all your knowledge is worthless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a traitor,&rdquo; I told him quietly, for I  despise him far too heartily to put myself into a passion about anything he  might please to say of me; &ldquo;and I have never uttered a word about this business  either to Captain Paget or to your brother. If you begin to distrust me, it is  high time you should look out for a new coadjutor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had my Sheldon, morally speaking, at my feet in a  moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be melodramatic, Hawkehurst,&rdquo; he said;  &ldquo;people sell each other every day of the week, and no one blames the seller,  provided he makes a good bargain. But this is a case in which the bargain would  be a very bad one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this I took my leave of Mr. Sheldon. He was  to start for Calais by that night&rsquo;s mail, and return to town directly his  investigation was completed. If he found me absent on his return, he would  conclude that I had obtained the information I required and started for  Yorkshire. In this event he would patiently await the receipt of tidings from  that county.</p>
<p>I went straight from Gray&rsquo;s Inn to Jewin-street. I  had spent the greater part of the day in Sheldon&rsquo;s office, and when I presented  myself before my complacent Sparsfield junior, Sparsfield senior&rsquo;s tea and  toast were already in process of preparation; and I was again invited to step  upstairs to the family sitting-room, and again treated with that Arcadian  simplicity of confidence and friendliness which it has been my fate to  encounter quite as often in the heart of this sophisticated city as in the most  pastoral of villages. With people who were so frank and cordial I could but be  equally frank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I am making myself a nuisance to you,  Mr. Sparsfield,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;but I know you&rsquo;ll forgive me when I tell you that the  affair I&rsquo;m engaged in is a matter of vital importance to me, and that your help  may do a great deal towards bringing matters to a crisis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sparsfield senior declared himself always ready  to assist his fellow-creatures, and was good enough further to declare that he  had taken a liking to me. So weak had I of late become upon all matters of  sentiment, I thanked Mr. Sparsfield for his good opinion, and then went on to  tell him that I was about to test his memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it ain&rsquo;t a bad un,&rdquo; he cried, cheerily,  clapping his hand upon his knee by way of emphasis. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a bad memory, is  it, Tony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few better, father,&rdquo; answered the dutiful Anthony  junior. &ldquo;Your memory&rsquo;s better than mine, a long way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the old man, with a chuckle, &ldquo;folks  lived different in my day. There weren&rsquo;t no gas, and there weren&rsquo;t no  railroads, and London tradespeople was content to live in the same house from  year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end. But now your tradesman must go on his foreign tours,  like a prince of the royal family, and he must go here and go there; and when  he&rsquo;s been everywhere, he caps it all by going through the Gazette. Folks stayed  at home in my day; but they made their fortunes, and they kept their health,  and their eyesight, and their memory, and their hearing, and many of &rsquo;em have  lived to see the next generation make fools of themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, father,&rdquo; cried Anthony junior, aghast at this  flood of eloquence, &ldquo;what an oration!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it ain&rsquo;t often I make an oration, is it,  Tony?&rdquo; said the old man, laughing. &ldquo;I only mean to say that if my memory&rsquo;s  pretty bright, it may be partly because I haven&rsquo;t frittered it away upon  nonsense, as some folks have. I&rsquo;ve stayed at home and minded my own business,  and left other people to mind theirs. And now, sir, if you want the help of my  memory, I&rsquo;m ready to give it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me the other day that you could not  recall the name of the place where Christian Meynell&rsquo;s daughter married, but  you said you should remember it if you heard it, and you also said that the  name ended in Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick to that,&rdquo; replied my ancient friend.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stick to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;Very well then. It is a settled thing that the place was in Yorkshire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m sure of that too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that the name ended in Cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did, as sure as my name is Sparsfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then in that case, as there are only six towns or  villages in the county of York the names of which end in Cross, it stands to  reason that the place we want must be one of those six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus premised, I took my list from my pocket  and read aloud the names of the six places, very slowly, for Mr. Sparsfield&rsquo;s  edification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aylsey Cross &mdash; Bowford Cross &mdash; Callindale Cross &mdash;  Huxter&rsquo;s Cross &mdash; Jarnam<br>
  Cross &mdash; Kingborough Cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him!&rdquo; cried my old friend suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which?&rdquo; I asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huxter&rsquo;s Cross; I remember thinking at the time  that it must be a place where they sold things, because of the name Huxter, you  see, pronounced just the same as if it was spelt with a cks instead of an x.  And I heard afterwards that there&rsquo;d once been a market held at the place, but  it had been done away with before our time. Huxter&rsquo;s Cross; yes, that&rsquo;s the  name of the place where Christian Meynell&rsquo;s daughter married and settled. I&rsquo;ve  heard it many a time from poor Sam, and it comes back to me as plain as if I&rsquo;d  never forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an air of conviction about the old man  which satisfied me that he was not deceived. I thanked him heartily for his aid  as I took my leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may have helped to put a good lump of money in  my pocket, Mr. Sparsfield,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;and if you have, I&rsquo;ll get my picture  taken, if it&rsquo;s only for the pleasure of bringing it here to be framed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this valedictory address I left my simple  citizens of Barbican. My heart was very light as I wended my way across those  metropolitan wilds that lay between Barbican and Omega-street. I am ashamed of  myself when I remember the foolish cause of this elation of mind. I was going  to Yorkshire, the county of which my Charlotte was now an inhabitant. My  Charlotte! It is a pleasure even to write that delicious possessive pronoun &mdash;  the pleasure of poor Alnascher, the crockery-seller, dreaming his day-dream in  the eastern market-place.</p>
<p>Can any one know better than I that I shall be no  nearer Charlotte
  Halliday in Yorkshire than I am in London? No one. And yet I am glad my
  Sheldon&rsquo;s business takes me to the woods and wolds of that wide
  northern shire.</p>
<p>Huxter&rsquo;s Cross &mdash; some Heaven-forgotten spot, no  doubt. I bought a railway time-table on my way home to-night, and have  carefully studied the bearings of the place amongst whose mouldy records I am  to discover the history of Christian Meynell&rsquo;s daughter and heiress.</p>
<p>I find that Huxter&rsquo;s Cross lies off the railroad,  and is to be approached by an obscure little station &mdash; as I divine from the  ignominious type in which its name appears &mdash; about sixty miles northward of  Hull. The station is called Hidling; and at Hidling there seems to be a coach  which plies between the station and Huxter&rsquo;s Cross.</p>
<p>Figure to yourself again, my dear, the heir-at-law  to a hundred thousand pounds vegetating in the unknown regions of Huxter&rsquo;s  Cross cum Hidling, unconscious of his heritage!</p>
<p>Shall I find him at the plough-tail, I wonder, this  mute inglorious heir-at-law? or shall I find an heiress with brawny arms meekly  churning butter? or shall I discover the last of the Meynells taking his rest  in some lonely churchyard, not to be awakened by earthly voice proclaiming the  tidings of earthly good fortune?</p>
<p>I am going to Yorkshire &mdash; that is enough for me. I  languish for the starting of the train which shall convey me thither. I begin  to understand the nostalgia of the mountain herdsman: I pine for that northern  air, those fresh pure breezes blowing over moor and wold &mdash; though I am not  quite clear, by the bye, as to the exact nature of a wold. I pant, I yearn for  Yorkshire. I, the cockney, the child of Temple Bar, whose cradle-song was  boomed by the bells of St. Dunstan&rsquo;s and St. Clement&rsquo;s Danes.</p>
<p>Is not Yorkshire my Charlotte&rsquo;s birthplace? I want  to see the land whose daughters are so lovely.</p>

  Arcadia</h2>
<p><em>November 1st</em>. This is Huxter&rsquo;s Cross,  and I live here. I have lived here a week. I should like to live here for ever.  O, let me be rational for a few hours, while I write the record of this last  blissful week; let me be reasonable, and business-like, and Sheldon-like for  this one wet afternoon, and then I may be happy and foolish again. Be still,  beating heart! as the heroines of Minerva-press romances were accustomed to say  to themselves on the smallest provocation. Be still, foolish, fluttering,  schoolboy heart, which has taken a new lease of youth and folly from a fair  landlord called Charlotte Halliday.</p>
<p>Drip, drip, drip, O rain! &ldquo;The day is dark and cold  and dreary, and the vine still clings to the mouldering wall; and with every  gust the dead leaves fall:&rdquo; but thy sweet sad verse wakes no responsive echo in  my heart, O tender Transatlantic Poet, for my heart is light and glad &mdash;  recklessly glad &mdash; heedless of to-morrow &mdash; forgetful of yesterday &mdash; full to the  very brim with the dear delight of to-day.</p>
<p>And now to business. I descend from the supernal  realms of fancy to the dry record of commonplace fact. This day week I arrived  at Hidling, after a tedious journey, which, with stoppages at Derby and  Normanton, and small delays at obscurer stations, had occupied the greater part  of the day. It was dusk when I took my place in the hybrid vehicle, half coach,  half omnibus, which was to convey me from Hidling to Huxter&rsquo;s Cross. A  transient glimpse at Hidling showed me one long straggling street and a square  church-tower. Our road branched off from the straggling street, and in the  autumn dusk I could just discover the dim outlines of distant hills encircling  a broad waste of moor.</p>
<p>I have been so steeped in London that this wild  barren scene had a charm for me which it could scarcely possess for others.  Even the gloom of that dark waste of common land was pleasant to me. I shared  the public vehicle with one old woman, who snored peacefully in the remotest  corner, while I looked out at the little open window and watched the darkening  landscape.</p>
<p>Our drive occupied some hours. We passed two or  three little clusters of cottages and homesteads, where the geese screamed and  the cocks crowed at our approach, and where a few twinkling tapers in upper  windows proclaimed the hour of bed-time. At one of these clusters of  habitation, a little island of humanity in the waste of wold and moor, we  changed horses, with more yo-oh-ing and come-up-ing than would have attended  the operation in a civilised country. At this village I heard the native tongue  for the first time in all its purity; and for any meaning which it conveyed to  my ear I might as well have been listening to the <em>patois</em> of agricultural Carthage.</p>
<p>After changing horses, we went up hill, with  perpetual groanings, and grumblings, and grindings, and whip-smacking and  come-up-ing, for an indefinite period; and then we came to a cluster of  cottages, suspended high up in the sharp autumn atmosphere as it seemed to me;  and the driver of the vehicle came to my little peephole of a window, and told  me with some slight modification of the Carthaginian <em>patois</em> that I was &ldquo;theer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I alighted, and found myself at the door of a  village inn, with the red light from within shining out upon me where I stood,  and a battered old sign groaning and creaking above my head. For me, who in all  my life had been accustomed to find my warmest welcome at an inn, this was to  be at home. I paid my fare, took up my carpet-bag, and entered the hostelry.</p>
<p>I found a rosy-faced landlady, clean and trim,  though a trifle floury as to the arms and apron. She had emerged from a  kitchen, an old-fashioned chamber with a floor of red brick; a chamber which  was all in a rosy glow with the firelight, and looked like a Dutch picture, as  I peeped at it through the open doorway. There were the most picturesque of  cakes and loaves heaped on a wooden bench by the hearth, and the whole aspect  of the place was delicious in its homely comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;how much better the  northern winds blowing over these untrodden hills, and the odour of home-made  loaves, than the booming bells of St. Dunstan&rsquo;s, and the greasy steam of tavern  chops and steaks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My heart warmed to this Yorkshire and these  Yorkshire people. Was it for Charlotte&rsquo;s sake, I wonder, that I was so ready to  open my heart to everybody and everything in this unknown land?</p>
<p>A very brief parley set me quite at ease with my  landlady. Even, the Carthaginian <em>patois</em> became intelligible to me after a little experience. I found that I could have  a cosy, cleanly chamber, and be fed and cared for upon terms that seemed  absurdly small, even to a person of my limited means. My cordial hostess  brought me a meal which was positively luxurious; broiled ham and poached eggs,  such as one scarcely hopes to see out of a picture of still life; crisp brown  cakes fresh from that wonderful oven whose door I had seen yawning open in the  Flemish interior below; strong tea and cream &mdash; the cream that one reads of in  pastoral stories.</p>
<p>I enjoyed my banquet, and then opened my window and  looked out at the still landscape, dimly visible in the faint starlight.</p>
<p>I was at the top of a hill &mdash; the topmost of an  ascending range of hills &mdash; and to some minds that alone is rapture. To inhale  the fresh night air was to drink deeply of an ethereal beverage. I had never  experienced so delicious a sensation since I had stood on the grassy  battlements of the Chateau d&rsquo;Arques, with the orchards and gardens of sunny  Normandy spread like a carpet below my feet.</p>
<p>But this hill was loftier than that on which the  feudal castle rears its crumbling towers, and the landscape below me was wilder  than verdant Normandy.</p>
<p>No words can tell how I rejoiced in this untrodden  region &mdash; this severance from the Strand and Temple Bar. I felt as if my old  life was falling away from me &mdash; like the scales of the lepers who were cleansed  by the Divine Healer. I felt myself worthier to love, or even to be loved by,  the bright true-hearted girl whose image fills my heart. Ah, if Heaven gave me  that dear angel, I think my old life, my old recklessness, my old want of  principle, would drop away from me altogether, and the leper would stand forth  cleansed and whole. Could I not be happy with her here, among these forgotten  hills, these widely scattered homesteads? Could I not be happy dissevered  eternally from billiard-room and kursaal, race-ground and dancing-rooms? Yes,  completely and unreservedly happy &mdash; happy as a village curate with seventy  pounds a year and a cast-off coat, supplied by the charity of a land too poor  to pay its pastors the wage of a decent butler &mdash; happy as a struggling farmer,  though the clay soil of my scanty acres were never so sour and stubborn, my  landlord never so hard about his rent &mdash; happy as a pedlar, with my pack of  cheap tawdry wares slung behind me, and my Charlotte tramping gaily by my side.</p>
<p>I breakfasted next morning in a snug little parlour  behind the bar, where I overheard two carters conversing in the Carthaginian <em>patois</em>, to which I became hourly more  accustomed. My brisk cheery landlady came in and out while I took my meal; and  whenever I could detain her long enough, I tried to engage her in conversation.</p>
<p>I asked her if she had ever heard the name of  Meynell; and after profound consideration she replied in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind hearing aught of folks called  Meynell,&rdquo; she said with more or less of the <em>patois</em>,  which I was beginning to understand; &ldquo;but I haven&rsquo;t got mooch memory for  nee-ams. I might have heard o&rsquo; such folks, and not minded t&rsquo; nee-am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was rather dispiriting; but I knew that if any  record of Christian Meynell&rsquo;s daughter existed at Huxter&rsquo;s Cross, it was in my  power to discover it.</p>
<p>I asked if there was any official in the way of a  registrar to be found in the village; and found that there was no one more  important than an old man who kept the keys of the church. The registers were  kept in the vestry, my landlady believed, and the old man was called Jonas  Gorles, and lived half a mile off, at the homestead of his son-in-law. But my  landlady said she would send for him immediately, and pledged herself to  produce him in the course of an hour. I told her that I would find my way to  the churchyard in the mean time, whither Mr. Gorles could follow me as soon as  convenient.</p>
<p>The autumnal morning was fresh and bright as  spring, and Huxter&rsquo;s Cross seemed the most delightful place on earth to me,  though it is only a cluster of cottages, relieved by one farmhouse of moderate  pretensions, my hostelry of the Magpie, a general shop, which is also the  post-office, and a fine old Norman church, which lies away from the village,  and bears upon it the traces of better days. Near the church there is an old  granite cross, around which the wild flowers and grasses grow rank and high. It  marks the spot where there was once a flourishing market-place; but all mortal  habitations have vanished, and the Huxter&rsquo;s Cross of the past has now no other  memorial than this crumbling stone.</p>
<p>The churchyard was unutterably still and solitary.  A robin was perched on the topmost bar of the old wooden gate, singing his  joyous carol. As I approached, he hopped from the gate to the low moss-grown  wall, and went on singing as I passed him. I was in the humour to apostrophise  skylark or donkey, or to be sentimental about anything in creation, just then;  so I told my robin what a pretty creature he was, and that I would sooner  perish than hurt him by so much as the tip of a feather.</p>
<p>Being bound to remember my Sheldon even when most  sentimental, I endeavoured to combine the meditative mood of a Hervey with the  business-like sharpness of a lawyer&rsquo;s clerk; and while musing on the common lot  of man in general, I did not omit to search the mouldering tombstones for some  record of the Meynells in particular.</p>
<p>I found none; and yet, if the daughter of Christian  Meynell had been buried in that churchyard, the name of her father would surely  have been inscribed upon her tombstone. I had read all the epitaphs when the  wooden gate creaked on its hinges, and admitted a wizen little old man &mdash; one of  those ancient meanderers who seem to have been created on purpose to fill the  post of sexton.</p>
<p>With this elderly individual I entered the church  of Huxter&rsquo;s Cross, which had the same mouldy atmosphere as the church at  Spotswold. The vestry was an icy little chamber, which had once been a family vault;  but it was not much colder than Miss Judson&rsquo;s best parlour; and I endured the  cold bravely while I searched the registries of the last sixty years.</p>
<p>I searched in vain. After groping amongst the names  of all the nonentities who had been married at Huxter&rsquo;s Cross since the  beginning of the century, I found myself no nearer the secret of Charlotte  Meynell&rsquo;s marriage. And then I reflected upon all the uncertainties surrounding  that marriage. Miss Meynell had gone to Yorkshire, to visit her mother&rsquo;s relations,  and had married in Yorkshire; and the place which Anthony Sparsfield remembered  having heard of in connection with that marriage was Huxter&rsquo;s Cross. But it did  not by any means follow that the marriage had taken place at that obscure  village. Miss Meynell might have been married at Hull, or York, or Leeds, or at  any of the principal places of the county. With that citizen class of people  marriage was a grand event, a solemn festivity; and Miss Meynell and her  friends would have been likely to prefer that so festive an occasion should be  celebrated anywhere rather than at that forgotten old church among the hills.  &ldquo;I shall have to search every register in Yorkshire till I light upon the  record I want,&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;unless Sheldon will consent to advertise  for the Meynell marriage certificate. There could scarcely be danger in such an  advertisement, as the connection between the name of Meynell and the Haygarth  estate is only known to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acting upon this idea, I wrote to George Sheldon by  that afternoon&rsquo;s post, urging him to advertise for descendants of Miss  Charlotte Meynell.</p>
<p>Charlotte! dear name, which is a kind of music for  me. It was almost a pleasure to write that letter, because of the repetition of  that delightful noun.</p>
<p>The next day I devoted to a drive round the  neighbourhood, in a smart little dog-cart, hired on very moderate terms from  mine host. I had acquainted myself with the geography of the surrounding  country; and I contrived to visit every village church within a certain radius  of Huxter&rsquo;s Cross. But my inspection of mildewed old books, and my heroic  endurance of cold and damp in mouldy old churches, resulted in nothing but  disappointment.</p>
<p>I returned to my &ldquo;Magpie&rdquo; after dark a little  disheartened and thoroughly tired, but still very well pleased with my rustic  quarters and my adopted county. My landlord&rsquo;s horse had shown himself a very  model of equine perfection.</p>
<p>Candles were lighted and curtains drawn in my cosy  little chamber, and the table creaked beneath one of those luxurious Yorkshire  teas which might wean an alderman from the coarser delights of turtle or  conger-eel soup and venison.</p>
<p>At noon the following day a very primitive kind of  postman brought me a letter from Sheldon. That astute individual told me that  he declined to advertise, or to give any kind of publicity to his requirements.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;If I were not afraid of publicity, I should not be  obliged to pay you a pound a week,&rdquo; he remarked, with pleasing candour, &ldquo;since  advertisements would get me more information in a week than you may scrape  together in a twelvemonth. But I happen to know the danger of publicity, and  that many a good thing has been snatched out of a man&rsquo;s hands just as he was  working it into shape. I don&rsquo;t say that this could be done in my case; and you  know very well that it could not be done, as I hold papers which are essential  to the very first move in the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I perfectly understand the meaning of these  remarks, and I am inclined to doubt the existence of those important papers.  Suspicion is a fundamental principle in the Sheldon mind. My friend George  trusts me because he is obliged to trust me &mdash; and only so far as he is obliged  &mdash; and is tormented, more or less, by the idea that I may at any moment attempt  to steal a march upon him.</p>
<p>But to return to his letter:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I should recommend you to examine the registries  of every town or village within, say, thirty miles of Huxter&rsquo;s Cross. If you  find nothing in such registries, we must fall back upon the larger towns,  beginning with Hull, as being nearest to our starting-point. The work will, I  fear, be slow, and very expensive for me. I need scarcely again urge upon you  the necessity of confining your outlay to the minimum, as you know that my  affairs are desperate. It couldn&rsquo;t well be lower water than it is with me, in a  pecuniary sense; and I expect every day to find myself aground.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;And now for my news. I have discovered the  burial-place of Samuel Meynell, after no end of trouble, the details of which I  needn&rsquo;t bore you with, since you are now pretty well up in that sort of work. I  am thankful to say I have secured the evidence that settles for Samuel, and  ascertained by tradition that he died unmarried. The <em>onus probandi</em> would fall upon any one purporting to be descended  from the said Samuel, and we know how uncommonly difficult said person would  find it to prove anything.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;So, having disposed of Samuel, I came back to  London by the next mail; Calais, in the month of November, not being one of  those wildly-gay watering-places which tempt the idler. I arrived just in time  to catch this afternoon&rsquo;s post; and now I look impatiently to your Miss  Charlotte Meynell, of Huxter&rsquo;s Cross. &mdash; Yours, &amp;c. G.S.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I obeyed my employer to the letter; hired my  landlord&rsquo;s dog-cart for another day&rsquo;s exploration; and went further afield in  search of Miss Charlotte&rsquo;s marriage-lines. I came home late at night &mdash; this  time thoroughly worn out &mdash; studied a railway guide with a view to my departure,  and decided on starting for Hull by a train that would leave Hidling station at  four o&rsquo;clock on the following afternoon.</p>
<p>I went to bed tired in body and depressed in  spirit. Why was I so sorry to leave Huxter&rsquo;s Cross? What subtle instinct of the  brain or heart made me aware that the desert region amongst the hills held  earth&rsquo;s highest felicity for me?</p>
<p>The next morning was bright and clear. I heard the  guns of sportsmen popping merrily in the still air as I breakfasted before an  open window, while a noble sea-coal fire blazed on the hearth opposite me.  There is no stint of fuel at the Magpie. Everything in Yorkshire seems to be  done with a lavish hand. I have heard Yorkshiremen called mean. As if meanness  could exist in the hearts of my Charlotte&rsquo;s countrymen! My own experience of  the county is brief; but I can only say that my friends of the Magpie are  liberality itself, and that a Yorkshire tea is the very acme of unsophisticated  bliss in the way of eating and drinking. I have dined at Philippe&rsquo;s; I know  every dish in the <em>menu</em> of the Maison  Dor&eacute;e; but if I am to make my life a burden beneath the dark sway of the demon  dyspepsia, let my destruction arrive in the shape of the ham and eggs, the  crisp golden-brown cakes, and undefiled honey, of this northern Arcadia.</p>
<p>I told my friendly hostess that I was going to  leave her, and she was sorry. She was sorry for me, the wanderer. I can picture  to myself the countenance of a London landlady if informed thus suddenly of her  lodger&rsquo;s departure, and her suppressed mutterings about the ill-convenience of  such a proceeding.</p>
<p>After breakfast I went out to take my own pleasure.  I had done my duty in the matter of mouldy churches and mildewed registries;  and I considered myself entitled to a holiday during the few hours that must  elapse before the starting of the hybrid vehicle for Hidling.</p>
<p>I sauntered past the little cluster of cottages,  admiring their primitive aspect, the stone-crop on the red-tiled roofs, that  had sunk under the weight of years. All was unspeakably fresh and bright; the  tiny panes of the casement twinkled in the autumn sunlight, birds sang, and  hardy red geraniums bloomed in the cottage windows. What pleasure or  distraction had the good housewives of Huxter&rsquo;s Cross to lure them from the  domestic delights of scrubbing and polishing? I saw young faces peeping at me  from between snow-white muslin curtains, and felt that I was a personage for  once in my life; and it was pleasant to feel one&rsquo;s self of some importance even  in the eyes of Huxter&rsquo;s Cross.</p>
<p>Beyond the cottages and the post-office there were  three roads stretching far away over hill and moorland. With two of those roads  I had made myself thoroughly familiar; but the third remained to be explored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now for &lsquo;fresh fields and pastures new,&rsquo;&rdquo; I  said to myself as I quickened my pace, and walked briskly along my unknown  road.</p>
<p>Ah, surely there is some meaning in the  fluctuations of the mental barometer. What but an instinctive consciousness of  approaching happiness could have made me so light-hearted that morning? I sang  as I hastened along that undiscovered road. Fragments of old Italian serenades  and barcarolles came back to me as if I had heard them yesterday for the first  time. The perfume of the few lingering wild-flowers, the odour of burning weeds  in the distance, the fresh autumn breeze, the clear cold blue sky, &mdash; all were  intensely delicious to me; and I felt as if this one lonely walk were a kind of  renovating process, from which my soul would emerge cleansed of all its stains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to thank George Sheldon for a great deal,&rdquo;  I said to myself, &ldquo;since through him I have been obliged to educate myself in  the school of man&rsquo;s best teacher, Solitude. I do not think I can ever be a  thorough Bohemian again. These lonely wanderings have led me to discover a vein  of seriousness in my nature which I was ignorant of until now. How thoroughly  some men are the creatures of their surroundings! With Paget I have been a  Paget. But a few hours <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em> with Nature renders one averse from the society of Pagets, be they never so  brilliant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From moralising thus, I fell into a delicious  day-dream. All my dreams of late had moved to the same music. How happy I could  be if Fate gave me Charlotte and three hundred a year! In sober moods I asked  for this much of worldly wealth, just to furnish a nest for my bird. In my  wilder moments I asked Fate for nothing but Charlotte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the bird without the nest,&rdquo; I cried to  Fortune; &ldquo;and we will take wing to some trackless forest where there are  shelter and berries for nestless birds. We will imitate that delightful bride  and bridegroom of Parisian Bohemia, who married and settled in an attic, and  when their stock of fuel was gone fell foul of the staircase that led to their  bower, and so supplied themselves merrily enough till the staircase was all  consumed, and the poor little bride, peeping out of her door one morning, found  herself upon the verge of an abyss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then came the furious landlord, demanding  restitution. But close behind the landlord came the good fairy of all  love-stories, with Pactolus in her pocket. Ah, yes, there is always a  providence for true lovers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had passed away by this time from the barren moor  to the regions of cultivation. The trimly-cut hedges on each side of the way  showed me that my road now lay between farm lands. I was outside the boundary  of some upland farm. I saw sheep cropping trefoil in a field on the other side  of the brown hedgerow, and at a distance I saw the red-tiled roof of a  farm-house.</p>
<p>I looked at my watch, and found that I had still  half an hour to spare; so I went on towards the farm-house, bent upon seeing  what sort of habitation it was. In a solitary landscape like this, every  dwelling-place has a kind of attraction for the wayfarer.</p>
<p>I went on till I came to a white gate, against  which a girlish figure was leaning.</p>
<p>It was a graceful figure, dressed in that semi-picturesque  costume which has been adopted by women of late years. The vivid blue of a  boddice was tempered by the sober gray of a skirt, and a bright-hued ribbon  gleamed among rich tresses of brown hair.</p>
<p>The damsel&rsquo;s face was turned away from me, but  there was something in the carriage of the head, something in the modelling of  the firm full throat, which reminded me of &mdash; </p>
<p>But then, when a man is over head and ears in love,  everything in creation reminds him more or less of his idol. Your pious  Catholic gives all his goods for the adornment of a church; your true lover  devotes his every thought to the dressing up of one dear image.</p>
<p>The damsel turned as my steps drew near, loud on  the crisp gravel. She turned, and showed me the face of Charlotte Halliday.</p>
<p>I must entreat posterity to forgive me, if I leave  a blank at this stage of my story. &ldquo;There are chords in the human heart which  had better not be wibrated,&rdquo; said Sim Tappertit. There are emotions which can  only be described by the pen of a poet. I am not a poet; and if my diary is so  happy as to be of some use to posterity as a picture of the manners of a  repentant Bohemian, posterity must not quarrel with my shortcomings in the way  of sentimental description.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
  In Paradise</h2>
<p>We stood at the white gate talking to each other,  my Charlotte and I. The old red-tiled roof which I had seen in the distance  sheltered the girl I love. The solitary farm-house which it had been my whim to  examine was the house in which my dear love made her home. It was here, to this  untrodden hillside, that my darling had come from the prim modern villa at  Bayswater. Ah, what happiness to find her here, far away from all those  stockbroking surroundings &mdash; here, where our hearts expanded beneath the divine  influence of Nature!</p>
<p>I fear that I was coxcomb enough to fancy myself  beloved that day we parted in Kensington-gardens. A look, a tone &mdash; too subtle  for definition &mdash; thrilled me with a sudden hope so bright, that I would not  trust myself to believe it could be realised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a coquette,&rdquo; I said to myself. &ldquo;Coquetry is  one of the graces which Nature bestows upon these bewitching creatures. That  little conscious look, which stirred this weak heart so tumultuously, is no  doubt common to her when she knows herself beloved and admired, and has no  meaning that can flatter my foolish hopes.&rdquo; This is how I had reasoned with  myself again and again during the dreary interval in which Miss Halliday and I  had been separated. But, O, what a hardy perennial blossom hope must be! The  tender buds were not to be crushed by the pelting hailstones of hard common  sense. They had survived all my philosophical reflections, and burst into  sudden flower to-day at sight of Charlotte&rsquo;s face. She loved me, and she was  delighted to see me. That was what her radiant face told me; and could I do  less than believe the sweet confession? For the first few moments we could  scarcely speak to each other, and then we began to converse in the usual  commonplace strain.</p>
<p>She told me of her astonishment on seeing me in  that remote spot. I could hardly confess to having business at Huxter&rsquo;s Cross,  so I was fain to tell my dear love a falsehood, and declare that I was taking a  holiday &ldquo;up at the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you come to choose Huxter&rsquo;s Cross for  your holiday?&rdquo; she asked <em>na&iuml;vely</em>.</p>
<p>I told her that I had heard the place spoken of by  a person in the city &mdash; my simple-minded Sparsfield to wit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you could not have come to a better place,&rdquo;  she cried, &ldquo;though people do call it the very dullest spot in the world. This  was my dear aunt Mary&rsquo;s house &mdash; papa&rsquo;s sister, you know. Grandpapa Halliday had  two farms. This was one, and Hyley the other. Hyley was much larger and better  than this, you know, and was left to poor papa, who sold it just before he  died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face clouded as she spoke of her father&rsquo;s  death. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak about that without pain even now,&rdquo; she said softly,  &ldquo;though I was only nine years old when it happened. But one can suffer a great  deal at nine years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, after a little pause, she went on to  speak of her Yorkshire home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My aunt and uncle Mercer are so kind to me; and  yet they are neither of them really related to me. My aunt Mary died very  young, when her first baby was born, and the poor little baby died too: and  uncle Mercer inherited the property from his wife, you see. He married again  after two years, and his second wife is the dearest, kindest creature in the  world. I always call her aunt, for I don&rsquo;t remember poor papa&rsquo;s sister at all;  and no aunt that ever lived could be kinder to me than aunt Dorothy. I am  always so happy here,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and it seems such a treat to get away from  the Lawn &mdash; of course I am sorry to leave mamma, you know,&rdquo; she added,  parenthetically&mdash; &ldquo;and the stiff breakfasts, and Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s newspapers that  crackle, crackle, crackle so shockingly all breakfast-time; and the stiff  dinners, with a prim parlor-maid staring at one all the time, and bringing one  vegetables that one doesn&rsquo;t want if one only ventures to breathe a little  louder than usual. Here it is Liberty Hall. Uncle Joe &mdash; he is aunt Dorothy&rsquo;s  husband &mdash; is the kindest creature in the world, just the very reverse of Mr.  Sheldon in everything. I don&rsquo;t mean that my stepfather is unkind, you know. O,  no, he has always been very good to me &mdash; much kinder than I have deserved that  he should be. But uncle Joe&rsquo;s ways are <em>so</em> different. I am sure you will like him; and I am sure he will like you, for he  likes everybody, dear thing. And you must come and see us very often, please,  for Newhall farm is open house, you know, and the stranger within the gates is  always welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now my duty to my Sheldon demanded that I should  scamper back to Huxter&rsquo;s Cross as fast as my legs would carry me, in order to  be in time for the hybrid vehicle that was to convey me to Hidling station; and  here was this dear girl inviting me to linger, and promising me a welcome to  the house which was made a paradise by her presence.</p>
<p>I looked at my watch. It would have been impossible  for me to reach Huxter&rsquo;s Cross in time for the vehicle. Conscience whispered  that I could hire my landlord&rsquo;s dog-cart, and a boy to drive me to Hidling; but  the whispers of conscience are very faint; and love cried aloud, &ldquo;Stay with  Charlotte: supreme happiness is offered to you for the first time in your life.  Fool that would reject so rare a gift!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was to this latter counsellor I gave my ear. My  Sheldon&rsquo;s interests went overboard; and I stayed by the white gate, talking to  Charlotte, till it was quite too late to heed the reproachful grumblings of  conscience about that dog-cart.</p>
<p>My Charlotte &mdash; yes, I boldly call her mine now &mdash; my  dear is great in agriculture. She enlightened my cockney mind on the subject of  upland farms, telling me how uncle and aunt Mercer&rsquo;s land is poor and sandy,  requiring very little in the way of draining, but producing by no means  luxuriant crops. It is a very picturesque place, and has a certain  gentlemanlike air with it pleasing to my snobbish taste. The house lies in a  tract of open grass-land, dotted here and there by trees, and altogether of a  park-like appearance. True that the mild and useful sheep rather than the  stately stag browses on that greensward, and few carriages roll along the  winding gravel road that leads to the house.</p>
<p>I felt a rapturous thirst for agricultural  knowledge as I listened to my Charlotte. Was there a vacancy for hind or  herdsman on Newhall farm, I wondered. What is the office so humble I would not  fill for her dear sake? O, how I sighed for the days of Jacob, that first  distinguished usurer, so that I might serve seven years and again seven years  for my darling!</p>
<p>I stayed by the white gate, abandoning all thought  of my employer&rsquo;s behests, unconscious of time &mdash; unconscious of everything  except that I was with Charlotte Halliday, and would not have resigned my  position to be made Lord Chancellor of England.</p>
<p>Anon came uncle Joe, with a pleasant rubicund  visage beaming under a felt hat, to tell Lotta that dinner was ready. To him I  was immediately presented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mercer, my dear uncle Joseph &mdash; Mr. Hawkehurst,  a friend of my stepfather&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Charlotte.</p>
<p>Two or three minutes afterwards we were all three  walking across the park-like sward to the hospitable farm-house; for the idea  of my departing before dinner seemed utterly preposterous to this friendly  farmer.</p>
<p>Considered apart from the glamour that for my eyes  must needs shine over any dwelling inhabited by Charlotte Halliday, I will  venture to say that Newhall farm-house is the dearest old place in the world.  Such delightful old rooms, with the deepest window-seats, the highest mantelpieces,  the widest fireplaces possible in domestic architecture; such mysterious  closets and uncanny passages; such pitfalls in the way of unexpected flights of  stairs; such antiquated glazed corner-cupboards for the display of old china! &mdash;  everything redolent of the past.</p>
<p>In one corner a spinning-wheel, so old that its  spindle might be the identical weapon that pierced Princess Sleeping Beauty&rsquo;s  soft white hand; in another corner an arm-chair that must have been  old-fashioned in the days of Queen Anne; and O, what ancient flowered chintzes,  what capacious sofas, what darling mahogany secretaries and bureaus, with  gleaming brazen adornments in the way of handles! &mdash; and about everything the  odour of rose-leaves and lavender.</p>
<p>I have grown familiar with every corner of the dear  old place within the last few days, but on this first day I had only a general  impression of its antiquated aspect and homely comfort. I stayed to dine at the  same unpretending board at which my Charlotte had sat years ago, elevated on a  high chair, and as yet new to the use of knives and forks. Uncle Joe and aunt  Dorothy told me this in their pleasant friendly way; while the young lady sat  by, blushing and dimpling like a summer sea beneath the rosy flush of sunrise.  No words can relate how delightful it was to me to hear them talk of my dear  love&rsquo;s childhood; they dwelt so tenderly upon her sweetness, they dilated with  such enthusiasm upon her &ldquo;pretty ways.&rdquo; Her &ldquo;pretty ways!&rdquo; ah, how fatal a  thing it is for mankind when Nature endows woman with those pretty ways! From  the thrall of Grecian noses and Castilian eyes there may be hope of  deliverance, but from the spell of that indescribable witchery there is none.</p>
<p>I whistled my Sheldon down the wind without  remorse, and allowed myself to be as happy as if I had been the squire of  valley and hillside, with ten thousand a year to offer my Charlotte with the  heart that loves her so fondly. I have no idea what we had for dinner. I know  only that the fare was plenteous, and the hospitality of my new friends  unbounded. We were very much at ease with one another, and our laughter rang up  to the stalwart beams that sustained the old ceiling. If I had possessed the  smallest fragment of my heart, I should have delivered it over without  hesitation to my aunt Dorothy &mdash; pardon! &mdash; my Charlotte&rsquo;s aunt Dorothy, who is  the cheeriest, brightest, kindest matron I ever met, with a sweet unworldly  spirit that beams out of her candid blue eyes.</p>
<p>Charlotte seems to have been tenderly attached to  her father, the poor fellow who died in Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s house &mdash; uncomfortable  for Sheldon, I should think. The Mercers talk a good deal of Thomas Halliday,  for whom they appear to have entertained a very warm affection. They also spoke  with considerable kindness of the two Sheldons, whom they knew as young men in  the town of Barlingford; but I should not imagine either uncle Joseph or aunt  Dorothy very well able to fathom the still waters of the Sheldon intellect.</p>
<p>After dinner uncle Joe took us round the farm. The  last stack of corn had been thatched, and there was a peaceful lull in the  agricultural world. We went into a quadrangle lined with poultry sheds, where I  saw more of the feathered race than I had ever in my life beheld congregated  together; thence to the inspection of pigs &mdash; and it was agreeable to inspect  even those vulgar querulous grunters, with Charlotte by my side. Her brightness  shed a light on all those common objects; and O, how I longed to be a farmer,  like uncle Mercer, and devote my life to Charlotte and agriculture!</p>
<p>When uncle Joe had done the honours of his  farm-yards and threshing-machinery, he left us to attend to his afternoon  duties; and we wandered together over the breezy upland at our own sweet wills,  or at <em>her</em> sweet will rather, since  what could I do but follow where she pleased to lead?</p>
<p>We talked of many things: of the father whom she  had loved so dearly, whose memory was still so mournfully dear to her; of her  old home at Hyley; of her visits to these dear Mercers; of her schooldays, and  her new unloved home in the smart Bayswater villa. She confided in me as she  had never done before; and when we turned in the chill autumn gloaming, I had  told her of my love, and had won from her the sweet confession of its return.</p>
<p>I have never known happiness so perfect as that  which I felt as we walked home together &mdash; home &mdash; yes; that old farm-house must  be my home as well as hers henceforward; for any habitation which she loved  must be a kind of home for me. Sober reflection tells me how reckless and  imprudent my whole conduct has been in this business; but when did ever love  and prudence go hand-in-hand? We were children, Charlotte and I, on that  blessed afternoon; and we told each other our love as children might have told  it, without thought of the future. We have both grown wiser since that time,  and are quite agreed as to our imprudence and foolishness; but, though we  endeavour to contemplate the future in the most serious manner, we are too  happy in the present to be able to analyse the difficulties and dangers that  lie in our pathway.</p>
<p>Surely there must be a providence for imprudent  lovers.</p>
<p>The November dews fell thick, and the November air  was chill, as we walked back to the homestead. I was sorry that there should be  that creeping dampness in the atmosphere that night. It seemed out of harmony  with the new warmth in my heart. I pressed my darling&rsquo;s little hand closer to  my breast, and had no more consciousness of any impediments to my future bliss  than of the ground on which I walked &mdash; and that seemed air.</p>
<p>We found our chairs waiting for us at aunt  Dorothy&rsquo;s tea-table; and I enjoyed that aldermanic banquet, a Yorkshire tea,  under circumstances that elevated it to an Olympian repast.</p>
<p>I thought of the Comic Latin Grammar:</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;Musa, musae, the gods were at  tea;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Musae musam, eating raspberry jam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was Jove, and my love was Juno. I looked at her  athwart the misty clouds that issued from the hissing urn, and saw her  beautified by a heightened bloom, and with a sweet, shy conscious look in her  eyes which made her indeed divine.</p>
<p>After tea we played whist; and I am bound to  confess that my divinity played execrably, persistently disdaining to return  her partner&rsquo;s lead, and putting mean little trumps upon her adversary&rsquo;s tricks,  with a fatuous economy of resources which is always ruin.</p>
<p>I stayed till ten o&rsquo;clock, reckless of the unknown  country which separated me from the Magpie, and then walked home alone, under  the faint starlight, though my friendly host would fain have lent me a  dog-cart. The good people here lend one another dog-carts as freely as a  cockney offers his umbrella. I went back to Huxter&rsquo;s Cross alone, and the long  solitary walk was very pleasant to me.</p>
<p>Looking up at the stars as I tramped homeward, I  could but remember an old epigram: &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you the earth, dear love,  and I the skies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love should shine on you like to the  sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And look upon you with ten thousand eyes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till heaven wax&rsquo;d blind, and till the world  were done.</p>
<p>I had ample leisure for reflection during that long  night-walk, and found myself becoming a perfect Young &mdash; Hervey &mdash; Sturm &mdash; what  you will, in the way of meditation. I could not choose but wonder at myself  when I looked back to this time last year, and remembered my idle evenings in  third-rate <em>caf&eacute;s</em>, on the <em>rive gauche</em>, playing dominoes, talking  the foul slang of Parisian bohemia, and poisoning my system with adulterated  absinthe. And now I feast upon sweet cakes and honey, and think it paradisiac  enjoyment to play whist &mdash; for love &mdash; in a farm-house parlour. I am younger by  ten years than I was twelve months ago.</p>
<p>Ah, let me thank God, who has sent me my  redemption.</p>
<p>I lifted my hat, and pronounced the thanksgiving  softly under that tranquil sky. I was almost ashamed to hear the sound of my  own voice. I was like some shy child who for the first time speaks his father&rsquo;s  name.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
  Too Fair To Last</h2>
<p>In my confidences with my dear girl I had told her  neither the nature of my mission in Yorkshire, nor the fact that I was bound to  leave Huxter&rsquo;s Cross immediately upon an exploring expedition to nowhere in  particular, in search of the archives of the Meynells. How could I bring myself  to tell her that I must leave her? &mdash; how much less could I bring myself to do  it?</p>
<p>Rendered desperately unmindful of the universe by  reason of my all-absorbing happiness, I determined on giving myself a holiday  boldly, in defiance of Sheldon and the Sheldonian interests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I a bounden slave?&rdquo; I asked myself, &ldquo;that I  should go here or there at any man&rsquo;s bidding, for the pitiful stipend of twenty  shillings a week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is to be observed that the rate of hire makes  all the difference in these cases; and while it is ignominious for a lawyer&rsquo;s  clerk to hasten to and fro in the earning of his weekly wage, it is in no way  dishonourable for the minister of state to obey the call of his chief, and  hurry hither and thither in abnegation of all his own predilections, and to the  aggravation of his chronic gout.</p>
<p>I wrote to my Sheldon, and told him that I had met  with friends in the neighbourhood of Huxter&rsquo;s Cross, and that I intended to  give myself a brief holiday; after which I would resume my labours, and do my  uttermost to make up for wasted time. I had still the remnant of my borrowed  thirty pounds, and amongst these northern hills I felt myself a millionaire.</p>
<p>Three thousand pounds at five per cent &mdash; one  hundred and fifty pounds a year. I felt that with such an income assured to us,  and the fruits of my industry, Charlotte and I might be secure from all the  storms of life. Ah, what happiness it would be to work for her! And I am not  too old to begin life afresh; not too old for the bar; not too old to make some  mark as a writer on the press; not too old to become a respectable member of  society.</p>
<p>After having despatched my letter to Sheldon, I  made off for Newhall farm with all speed. I had received a sort of general  invitation from the kindest of uncles and aunts, but I contrived with becoming  modesty to arrive after Mr. Mercer&rsquo;s dinner-hour. I found Charlotte alone in  the dear old-fashioned parlour, aunt Dorothy being engaged in some domestic  operations in the kitchen, and uncle Joseph making his usual after-dinner  rounds amongst the pig-styes and the threshing-machines. I discovered  afterwards that it was Miss Halliday&rsquo;s wont to accompany her kind kinsman in  this afternoon investigation; but to-day she had complained of a headache and  preferred to stay at home. Yet there were few symptoms of the headache when I  found her standing in the bow-window, watching the path by which I came, and  the face of Aurora herself could scarcely be brighter or fresher than my  darling&rsquo;s innocent blushes when I greeted her with the privileged kiss of  betrothal.</p>
<p>We sat in the bow-window talking till the twilight  shadows crept over the greensward, and the sheep were led away to their fold,  with cheerful jingling of bells and barking of watchful dog. My dearest girl  told me that our secret had already been discovered by the penetrating eyes of  aunt Dorothy and uncle Joseph. They had teased her unmercifully, it seemed, all  that day, but were graciously pleased to smile upon my suit, like a pair of  imprudent Arcadians as they are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They like you very much indeed,&rdquo; my Lotta said  joyously; &ldquo;but I believe they think I have known you much longer than I really  have, and that you are very intimate with my stepfather. It seems almost like  deceiving them to allow them to think so, but I really haven&rsquo;t the courage to  tell the truth. How foolish and bold they would think me if they knew how very  short a time I have known you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty times longer than Juliet had known Romeo  when they met in the
  Friar&rsquo;s cell to be married,&rdquo; I urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but that was in a play,&rdquo; replied Charlotte,  &ldquo;where everything is obliged to be hurried; and at Hyde Lodge we all of us  thought that Juliet was a very forward young person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poets all believe in love at first sight, and  I&rsquo;ll wager our dear uncle Joe fell over head and ears in love with aunt Dorothy  after having danced with her two or three times at an assize ball,&rdquo; said I.  After this we became intensely serious, and I told my darling girl that I hoped  very soon to be in possession of a small fixed income, and to have begun a  professional career. I told her how dear an incentive to work she had given me,  and how little fear I had for the future.</p>
<p>I reminded her that Mr. Sheldon had no legal power  to control her actions, and that, as her father&rsquo;s will had left her entirely to  her mother&rsquo;s guardianship, she had only her mother&rsquo;s pleasure to consult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe poor mamma would let me marry a  crossing-sweeper, if I cried and declared it would make me miserable not to  marry him,&rdquo; said Charlotte; &ldquo;but then, you see, mamma&rsquo;s wishes mean Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s wishes; she is sure to think whatever he tells her to think; and if  he is strongly against our marriage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I am sure he will be,&rdquo; I interjected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will work upon poor mamma in that calm,  persistent, logical way of his till he makes her as much against it as  himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even your mamma has no legal power to control  your actions, my love. Were you not of age on your last birthday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My darling replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then of course you are free to marry whom you  please; and as I am thankful to say you don&rsquo;t possess a single sixpence in your  own right, there need be no fuss about settlements or pin-money. We can marry  any fine morning that my dear girl pleases to name, and defy all the stern  stepfathers in creation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How I wish I had a fortune, for your sake!&rdquo; she  said with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be glad for my sake that you have none,&rdquo; I  answered. &ldquo;You cannot imagine the miserable complications and perplexities  which arise in this world from the possession of money. No slave so tightly  bound as the man who has what people call &lsquo;a stake in the country&rsquo; and a  balance at his banker&rsquo;s. The true monarch of all he surveys is the penniless  reprobate who walks down Fleet-street with his whole estate covered by the  seedy hat upon his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus moralized, I proceeded to ask Miss  Halliday if she was prepared to accept a humbler station than that enjoyed by  her at the Lawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No useful landau, to be an open carriage at noon  and a family coach at night,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;no nimble page to skip hither and  thither at his fair lady&rsquo;s commands, if not belated on the way by the  excitement of tossing halfpence with youthful adventurers of the byways and  alleys; no trim parlour-maids, with irreproachable caps, dressed for the day at  11 o&rsquo;clock A.M. &mdash; but instead of these, a humble six-roomed bandbox of a house,  and one poor hardworking slavey, with perennial smudges from saucepan-lids upon  her honest pug-nose. Consider the prospect seriously, Charlotte, and ask  yourself whether you can endure such a descent in the social scale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Charlotte laughed, as if the prospect had been  the most delightful picture ever presented to mortal vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I care for the landau or the page?&rdquo;  she cried. &ldquo;If it were not for mamma&rsquo;s sake, I should detest that prim villa  and all its arrangements. You see me so happy here, where there is no pretence  of grandeur&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am bound to warn you that I shall not be able  to provide Yorkshire teas at the commencement of our domestic career,&rdquo; I  remarked, by way of parenthesis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Dorothy will send us hampers of poultry and  cakes, sir, and for the rest of our time we can live upon bread and water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this I promised my betrothed a house in  Cavendish or Portman-square, and a better-built landau than Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s, in  the remote future. With those dear eyes for my pole-stars, I felt myself strong  enough to clamber up the slippery ascent to the woolsack. The best and purest  ambition must surely be that which is only a synonym for love.</p>
<p>After we had sat talking in the gloaming to our  hearts&rsquo; content, aunt Dorothy appeared, followed by a sturdy handmaid with  lighted candles, and a still sturdier handmaid with a ponderous tea-tray. The  two made haste to spread a snow-white cloth, and to set forth the species of  banquet which it is the fashion nowadays to call high tea. Anon came uncle  Joseph, bringing with him some slight perfume from the piggeries, and he and  aunt Dorothy were pleased to be pleasantly facetious and congratulatory in  their conversation during the social meal which followed their advent.</p>
<p>After tea we played whist again, aunt Dorothy and I  obtaining a succession of easy victories over Charlotte and uncle Joe. I felt  myself hourly more and more completely at home in that simple domestic circle,  and enjoyed the proud position of an accepted lover. My Arcadian friends  troubled themselves in nowise as to the approval or disapproval of Mr. and Mrs.  Sheldon, or with regard either to my prospects or my antecedents. They saw me  devoted to my dear girl, they saw my dearest pleased by my devotion, and they  loved her so well that they were ready to open their hearts without reserve to  the man who adored her and was loved by her, let him be rich or poor, noble or  base-born. As they would have given her the wax-doll of her desire ten or  twelve years ago without question as to price or fitness of things, so they now  gave her their kindly smiles and approval for the lover of her choice. &ldquo;I know  Phil Sheldon is a man who looks to the main chance,&rdquo; said uncle Joe, in the  course of a discussion about his niece&rsquo;s future which dyed her cheeks with  blushes in the present; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll lay you&rsquo;ll find him rather a difficult  customer to deal with, especially as poor Tom&rsquo;s will left all the money in  Georgy&rsquo;s hands, which of course is tantamount to saying that Sheldon has got  the disposal of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I assured uncle Joe that money was the very last  thing which I desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then in that case I don&rsquo;t see why he shouldn&rsquo;t let  you have Charlotte,&rdquo; replied Mr. Mercer; &ldquo;and if she&rsquo;s cheated out of her poor  dad&rsquo;s money, she shan&rsquo;t be cheated out of what her old aunt and uncle may have  to leave her by-and-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here were these worthy people promising me an heiress  with no more compunction than if they had been offering me a cup of tea.</p>
<p>I walked homeward once more beneath the quiet  stars. O, how happy I was! Can happiness so perfect, joy so sinless, endure? I,  the friendless wanderer and penniless Bohemian, asked myself this question; and  again I paused upon the lonely moorland road to lift my hat as I thanked God  for having given me such bright hopes.</p>
<p>But George Sheldon&rsquo;s three thousand pounds must be  mine before I can secure the humblest shelter for my sweet one; and although it  would be bliss to me to tramp through the world barefoot with Charlotte by my  side, the barefooted state of things is scarcely the sort of prospect a man  would care to offer to the woman he loves. So once more to the chase. One more  day in this delicious island of the lotus-eaters, Newhall farm; and then away!  &mdash; hark forward! &mdash; tantivy! &mdash; and hey for the marriage-lines of Charlotte  Meynell, great-granddaughter of Matthew Haygarth, and, if still in the flesh,  rightful heiress to the one hundred thousand pounds at present likely to be  absorbed by the ravening jaws of the Crown! One more day, one more delightful  idle day, in the land where it is always afternoon, and then away to Hidling in  the hybrid vehicle, and thence to Hull, from Hull to York, from York to Leeds,  then Bradford, Huddersfield &mdash; <em>toute la  boutique!</em></p>
<p>The rain beats against the diamond panes of my  casement as I write. The day has been hopelessly wet, so I have stayed in my  snug little chamber and occupied myself in writing this record. Foul wind or  weather would have little power to keep me from my darling; but even if it had  been a fine day, I could not with any grace have presented myself at Newhall  farm for a third afternoon. To-morrow my immediate departure will afford me an  excuse for presenting myself once more before my kind uncle and aunt. It will  be my farewell visit. I wonder whether Charlotte will miss me this afternoon. I  wonder whether she will be sorry when I tell her that I am going to leave this  part of the country. Ah, shall we ever meet again under such happy auspices?  Shall I ever again find such kind friends or such a hospitable dwelling as  those I shall leave amidst these northern hills?</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31<br>
  Found In The Bible</h2>
<p><em>November</em> 3<em>d</em>. The most wonderful event has befallen &mdash; surely the most  wonderful that ever came to pass outside the realms of fiction. Let me set down  the circumstances of yesterday coolly and quietly if I can. I invoke the placid  spirit of my Sheldon. I invoke all the divinities of Gray&rsquo;s Inn and &ldquo;The  Fields.&rdquo; Let me be legal and specific, perspicacious and logical &mdash; if this  beating heart, this fevered brain, will allow me a few hours&rsquo; respite.</p>
<p>The autumn sunshine blessed the land again  yesterday. Moorland and meadow, fallow and clover-field, were all the brighter  for the steady downfall of the previous day. I walked to Newhall directly after  breakfast, and found my dearest standing at the white five-barred gate, dressed  in her pretty blue jacket, and with ribbons in her bonny brown hair.</p>
<p>She was pleased to see me, though at first just a  little inclined to play the <em>boudeuse</em> on account of my absence on the previous day. Of course I assured her that it  had been anguish for me to remain away from her, and quoted that divine sonnet  of our William&rsquo;s to the like effect:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;How like a winter hath my absence been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>and again:</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rdquo;O, never say that I was false of  heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though absence seemed my flame to qualify.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Equally of course my pet pretended not to believe  me. After this little misunderstanding we forgave each other, and adored each  other again with just a little more than usual devotion; and then we went for a  long ramble among the fields, and looked at the dear placid sheep, who stared  at us wonderingly in return, as if exclaiming to themselves, &ldquo;And these are a  specimen couple of the creatures called lovers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We met uncle Joe in the course of our wanderings,  and returned with him in time for the vulgar superstition of dinner, which we  might have forgotten had we been left by ourselves. After dinner uncle Joe made  off to his piggeries; while aunt Dorothy fell asleep in a capacious old  arm-chair by the fire, after making an apologetic remark to the effect that she  was tired, and had been a good deal &ldquo;tewed&rdquo; that morning in the dairy. &ldquo;Tewed,&rdquo;  I understand, is Yorkshire for &ldquo;worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Dorothy having departed into the shadowy realm  of dreams,
Charlotte and I were left to our own devices.</p>
<p>There was a backgammon board on a side-table,  surmounted by an old Indian bowl of dried rose-leaves; and, <em>pour nous distraire</em>, I proposed that I  should teach my dearest that diverting game. She assented, and we set to work  in a very business-like manner, Miss Halliday all attention, I serious as a  professional schoolmaster.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for my pupil&rsquo;s progress, the game of  backgammon proved less entertaining than our own conversation, so, after a very  feeble attempt on the one side to learn and on the other to teach, we closed  the board and began to talk; &mdash; first of the past, then of the future, the happy  future, which we were to share.</p>
<p>There is no need that I should set down this  lovers&rsquo; talk. Is it not written on my heart? The future seemed so fair and  unclouded to me, as my love and I sat talking together yesterday afternoon. Now  all is changed. The strangest, the most surprising complications have arisen;  and I doubt, I fear.</p>
<p>After we had talked for a long time, Miss Halliday  suddenly proposed that I should read to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana once told me that you read very  beautifully,&rdquo; said this flatterer; &ldquo;and I should so like to hear you read &mdash;  poetry of course. You will find plenty of poems in that old bookcase &mdash; Cowper,  and Bloomfield, and Pope. Now I am sure that Pope is just the kind of poet  whose verses you would read magnificently. Shall we explore the bookcase  together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now if there is any manner of beguiling an idle  afternoon, which seems to me most delightful, it is by the exploration of old  bookcases; and when that delight can be shared by the woman one fondly loves,  the pleasure thereof must be of course multiplied to an indefinite amount.</p>
<p>So Charlotte and I set to work immediately to  ransack the lower shelves of the old-fashioned mahogany bookcase, which  contained the entire library of the Mercer household.</p>
<p>I am bound to admit that we did not light upon many  volumes of thrilling interest. The verses of Cowper, like those of Southey,  have always appeared to me to have only one fault &mdash; there are too many of them.  One shrinks appalled from that thick closely-printed volume of morality cut  into lengths of ten feet; and beyond the few well-worn quotations in daily use,  I am fain to confess that I am almost a stranger to the bard of Olney.</p>
<p>Half a dozen odd volumes of the <em>Gentleman&rsquo;s Magazine</em>, three or four of  the <em>Annual Register</em>, a neatly-bound  edition of <em>Clarissa Harlowe</em> and <em>Sir Charles Grandison</em> in twelve volumes,  Law&rsquo;s <em>Holy Call to a Serious Life</em>, <em>Paradise Lost</em>, <em>Joseph Andrews</em>, <em>Hervey&rsquo;s  Meditations</em>, and <em>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</em>,  formed the varied contents of the principal shelves. Above, there were  shabbily-bound volumes and unbound pamphlets. Below, there were folios, the  tops whereof were thickly covered with the dust of ages, having escaped the  care of the handmaidens even in that neatly-appointed household.</p>
<p>I knelt down to examine these.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be covered with dust if you touch them,&rdquo;  cried Charlotte. &ldquo;I was once curious enough to examine them, but the result was  very disappointing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet they look so delightfully mysterious,&rdquo; I  said. &ldquo;This one, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is an old history of London, with curious  plates and maps; rather interesting if one has nothing more amusing to read.  But the perennial supply of novels from Mudie&rsquo;s spoils one for that kind of  book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever I come to Newhall again, I shall dip into  the old history. One is never tired of dead and gone London. But after Mr.  Knight&rsquo;s delightful book any old history must seem very poor. What is my burly  friend here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, a dreadful veterinary-surgeon&rsquo;s encyclopaedia &mdash; <em>The Farmer&rsquo;s
  Friend</em> I think it is called; all about the ailments of animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next is an odd volume of the <em>Penny Magazine</em>. Dear aunt Dorothy is  rich in odd volumes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the next, &mdash; my bulky friend number two, &mdash; with  a cracked leather back and a general tendency to decay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, that is the Meynell Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The MEYNELL BIBLE! A hot perspiration broke out  upon my face as I knelt at Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s feet, with my hand resting  lightly on the top of the book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Meynell Bible!&rdquo; I repeated; and my voice was  faintly tremulous, in spite of the effort I made to control myself. &ldquo;What do you  mean by the Meynell Bible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean the old family Bible that belonged to my  grand-mamma. It was her father&rsquo;s Bible, you know; and of course he was my  great-grandfather &mdash; Christian Meynell. Why, how you stare at me, Valentine! Is  there anything so wonderful in my having had a great-grandfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, darling; but the fact is that I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another moment I should have told her the entire  truth; but I remembered just in time that I had pledged myself to profound  secrecy with regard to the nature and progress of my investigation, and I had  yet to learn whether that pledge did or did not involve the observance of  secrecy even with those most interested in my researches. Pending further  communication with Sheldon, I was certainly bound to be silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a kind of interest in the name of Meynell,&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;for I was once engaged in a business matter with people of that name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And having thus hoodwinked my beloved with a  bouncer, I proceeded to extract the Bible from its shelf. The book was so  tightly wedged into its place, that to remove it was like drawing a tooth. It  was a noble-looking old volume, blue with the mould of ages, and redolent of a  chill dampness like the atmosphere of a tomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should so like to examine the old book when the  candles come in,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the maintenance of my secret, the  darkness was closing in upon us when I discovered the volume, and the room was  only fitfully illuminated by the flame that brightened and faded every minute.</p>
<p>I carried the book to a side-table, and Charlotte  and I resumed our talk until the candles came, and close behind them uncle Joe.  I fear I must have seemed a very inattentive lover during that brief interval,  for I could not concentrate my thoughts upon the subject of our discourse. My  mind would wander to the strange discovery that I had just made, and I could  not refrain from asking myself whether by any extraordinary chance my own dear  love should be the rightful claimant to John Haygarth&rsquo;s hoarded wealth.</p>
<p>I hoped that it might not be so. I hoped that my  darling might be penniless rather than the heir to wealth, which, in all  likelihood, would create an obstacle strong enough to sever us eternally. I  longed to question her about her family, but could not as yet trust myself to  broach the subject. And while I doubted and hesitated, honest blustering uncle  Joe burst into the room, and aunt Dorothy awoke, and was unutterably surprised  to find she had slept so long.</p>
<p>After this came tea; and as I sat opposite my  dearest girl I could not choose but remember that gray-eyed Molly, whose  miniature had been found in the tulip-wood bureau, and in whose bright face I  had seen the likeness of Philip Sheldon&rsquo;s beautiful stepdaughter. And Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s lovely stepdaughter was the lineal descendant of this very Molly.  Strange mystery of transmitted resemblances! Here was the sweet face that had  bewitched honest, simple-minded Matthew Haygarth reproduced after the lapse of  a century.</p>
<p>My Charlotte was descended from a poor little  player girl who had smiled on the roisterous populace of Bartholomew Fair. Some  few drops of Bohemian blood mingled with the pure life-stream in her veins. It  pleased me to think of this; but I derived no pleasure from the idea that  Charlotte might possibly be the claimant of a great fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may have cousins who would stand before her,&rdquo;  I said to myself; and there was some comfort in the thought.</p>
<p>After tea I asked permission to inspect the old  family Bible, much to the astonishment of uncle Joe, who had no sympathy with  antiquarian tastes, and marvelled that I should take any interest in so mouldy  a volume. I told him, with perfect truth, that such things had always more or  less interest for me; and then I withdrew to my little table, where I was  provided with a special pair of candles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find the births and deaths of all poor  Molly&rsquo;s ancestors on the first leaf,&rdquo; said uncle Joe. &ldquo;Old Christian Meynell  was a rare one for jotting down such things; but the ink has gone so pale that  it&rsquo;s about as much as you&rsquo;ll do to make sense of it, I&rsquo;ll lay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte looked over my shoulder as I examined the  fly-leaf of the family Bible. Even with this incentive to distraction I  contrived to be tolerably business-like; and this is the record which I found  on the faded page:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Samuel Matthew Meynell, son of Christian and Sarah  Meynell, b. March 9, 1796, baptised at St. Giles&rsquo;s, Cripplegate, in this city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan Meynell, daughter of Christian and Sarah  Meynell, b. June 29, 1798, also baptised in the same church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte Meynell, second daughter of the above  Christian and Sarah, b. October 3, 1800, baptised at the above-mentioned church  of St. Giles, London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Below these entries, in blacker ink and in a  different hand-writing &mdash; a bold, business-like, masculine caligraphy &mdash; came the  following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charlotte Meynell married to James Halliday, in  the parish church of<br>
  Barngrave, Yorks. April 15, 1819.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas Halliday, son of the above James and  Charlotte Halliday, b. Jan. 3d, 1821, baptised in the parish church of  Barngrave, Feb. 20 in the same year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Halliday, daughter of the above-named James  and Charlotte Halliday, b. May 27th, 1823, baptised at Barngrave, July 1st in  the same year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Below this there was an entry in a woman&rsquo;s  penmanship:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan, the beloved sister of C. H., died in  London, July 11, 1835.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judge not, that ye be not judged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to call sinners, and not the righteous, to  repentance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This record seemed to hint vaguely at some sad  story: &ldquo;Susan, the beloved sister;&rdquo; no precise data of the death &mdash; no surname!  And then those two deprecating sentences, which seemed to plead for the dead.</p>
<p>I had been led to understand that Christian  Meynell&rsquo;s daughters had both died in Yorkshire &mdash; one married, the other  unmarried.</p>
<p>The last record in the book was the decease of  James Halliday, my dear girl&rsquo;s grandfather.</p>
<p>After pondering long over the strangely-worded  entry of Susan Meynell&rsquo;s death, I reflected that, with the aid of those  mysterious powers Hook and Crook, I must contrive to possess myself of an exact  copy of this leaf from a family history, if not of the original document. Again  my duty to my Sheldon impelled me to be false to all my new-born instincts, and  boldly give utterance to another bouncer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very much interested in a county history now  preparing for the press,&rdquo; I said to my honoured uncle, who was engaged in a  hand at cribbage with his wife; &ldquo;and I really think this old leaf from a family  Bible would make a very interesting page in that work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I blushed for myself as I felt how shamefully I was  imposing upon my newly-found kinsman&rsquo;s credulity. With scarcely any one but  uncle Joe could I have dared to employ so shallow an artifice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it really, now?&rdquo; said that confiding  innocent. &ldquo;Well, I suppose old papers, and letters, and such like, are  uncommonly interesting to some folks. I can&rsquo;t say I care much about &rsquo;em  myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you have any objection to my taking a copy  of these entries?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word, no, lad; not I. Take half a dozen copies,  and welcome, if they can be of any use to you or other people. That&rsquo;s not much  to ask for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thanked my simple host, and determined to write  to a stationer at Hull for some tracing-paper by the first post next morning.  There was some happiness, at least, in having found this unlooked-for end to my  researches. I had a good excuse for remaining longer near Charlotte Halliday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only for my poor Mary&rsquo;s sake I set any value  on that old volume,&rdquo; the farmer said, presently, in a meditative tone. &ldquo;You see  the names there are the names of her relations, not mine; and this place and  all in it was hers. Dorothy and I are only interlopers, as you may say, at the  best, though I brought my fortune to the old farm, and Dorothy brought her  fortune, and between us we&rsquo;ve made Newhall a much better place than it was in  old James Halliday&rsquo;s time. But there&rsquo;s something sad in the thought that none  of those that were born on the land have left chick or child to inherit it.&rdquo;  Uncle Joseph fell for a while into a pensive reverie, and I thought of that  other inheritance, well-nigh fifty times the value of Newhall farm, which is  now waiting for a claimant. And again I asked myself, Could it be possible that  this sweet girl, whose changeful face had saddened with those old memories,  whose innocent heart knew not one sordid desire &mdash; could it be indeed she whose  fair hand was to wrest the Haygarthian gold from the grip of Crown lawyers?</p>
<p>The sight of that old Bible seemed to have revived  Mr. Mercer&rsquo;s memory of his first wife with unwonted freshness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a sweet young creature,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the  living picture of our Lottie, and sometimes I fancy it must have been that  which made me take to Lottie when she was a little one. I used to see my first  wife&rsquo;s eyes looking up at me out of Lottie&rsquo;s eyes. I told Tom it was a comfort  to me to have the little lass with me, and that&rsquo;s how they let her come over so  often from Hyley. Poor old Tom used to bring her over in his Whitechapel cart,  and leave her behind him for a week or so at a stretch. And then, when my  Dorothy, yonder, took pity upon a poor lonely widower, she made as much of the  little girl as if she&rsquo;d been her own, and more, perhaps; for, not having any  children of her own, she thought them such out-of-the-way creatures, that you  couldn&rsquo;t coddle them and pet them too much. There&rsquo;s a little baby lies buried  in Barngrave churchyard with Tom Halliday&rsquo;s sister that would have been a noble  young man, sitting where you&rsquo;re sitting, Mr. Hawkehurst, and looking at me as  bright as you&rsquo;re looking, perhaps, if the Lord&rsquo;s will hadn&rsquo;t been otherwise.  We&rsquo;ve all our troubles, you see, and that was mine; and if it hadn&rsquo;t been for  Dorothy, life would not have been worth much for me after that time &mdash; but my  Dorothy is all manner of blessings rolled up in one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The farmer looked fondly at his second wife as he  said this, and she blushed and smiled upon him with responsive tenderness. I  fancy a woman&rsquo;s blushes and smiles wear longer in these calm solitudes than  amid the tumult and clamour of a great city.</p>
<p>Finding my host inclined to dwell upon the past, I  ventured to hazard an indirect endeavour to obtain some information respecting  that entry in the Bible which had excited my curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Susan Meynell died unmarried, I believe?&rdquo; I  said. &ldquo;I see her death recorded here, but she is described by her Christian  name only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, very like,&rdquo; replied Mr. Mercer, with an air of  indifference, which I perceived to be assumed. &ldquo;Yes, my poor Molly&rsquo;s aunt Susan  died unmarried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in London? I had been given to understand that  she died in
  Yorkshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I blushed for my own impertinence as I pressed this  inquiry. What right had I to be given to understand anything about these honest  Meynells? I saw poor uncle Joe&rsquo;s disconcerted face, and I felt that the hunter  of an heir-at-law is apt to become a very obnoxious creature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan Meynell died in London &mdash; the poor lass died  in London,&rdquo; replied Joseph Mercer, gravely; &ldquo;and now we&rsquo;ll drop that subject,  if you please, my lad. It isn&rsquo;t a pleasant one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this I could no longer doubt that there was  some painful story involved in those two deprecating sentences of the gospel.</p>
<p>It was some time before uncle Joe was quite his own  jovial and rather noisy self again, and on this evening we had no whist. I bade  my friends good night a little earlier than usual, and departed, after having  obtained permission to take a tracing of the fly-leaf as soon as possible.</p>
<p>On this night the starlit sky and lonesome moor  seemed to have lost their soothing power. There was a new fever in my mind. The  simple plan of the future which I had mapped out for myself was suddenly  shattered. The Charlotte of to-night &mdash; heiress-at-law to an enormous fortune &mdash;  ward in Chancery &mdash; claimant against the Crown &mdash; was a very different person  from the simple maid &ldquo;whom there were none&rdquo; &mdash; or only a doating simpleton in  the person of the present writer&mdash; &ldquo;to praise, and very few to love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night before last I had hoped so much; to-night  hope had forsaken me. It seemed as if a Titan&rsquo;s hand had dug a great pit  between me and the woman I loved &mdash; a pit as deep as the grave.</p>
<p>Philip Sheldon might have consented to give me his  stepdaughter unpossessed of a sixpence; but would he give me his stepdaughter  with a hundred thousand pounds for her fortune? Alas! no; I know the Sheldonian  intellect too well to be fooled by any hope so wild and baseless. The one  bright dream of my misused life faded from me in the hour in which I discovered  my dearest girl&rsquo;s claim to the Haygarthian inheritance. But I am not going to  throw up the sponge before the fight is over. Time enough to die when I am  lying face downward in the ensanguined mire, and feel the hosts of the foemen  trampling above my shattered carcass. I will live in the light of my  Charlotte&rsquo;s smiles while I can, and for the rest&mdash; &ldquo;<em>Il ne faut pas dire, fontaine, je ne boirai pas de ton eau</em>.&rdquo; There  is no cup so bitter that a man dare say, I will not drain it to the very dregs.  &ldquo;What must be, shall be &mdash; that&rsquo;s a certain text;&rdquo; and in the mean time <em>carpe diem</em>. I am all a Bohemian again.</p>
<p><em>Nov. 5th</em>. After a day&rsquo;s delay I  have obtained my tracing-paper, and made two tracings of the entries in the  Meynell Bible. How intercourse with the Sheldonian race inclines one to the  duplication of documents! I consider the copying-press of modern civilization  the supreme incarnation of man&rsquo;s distrust of his fellow-men.</p>
<p>I spent this afternoon and evening with my dear  love &mdash; my last evening in Yorkshire. To-morrow I shall see my Sheldon, and  inform him of the very strange termination which has come to my researches.  Will he communicate at once with his brother? Will he release me from my oath of  secrecy? There is nothing of the masonic secretiveness in my organisation, and  I am very weary of the seal that has been set upon my unwary lips. Will  Charlotte be told that she is the reverend intestate&rsquo;s next of kin? These are  questions which I ask myself as I sit in the stillness of my room at the  Magpie, scribbling this wretched diary of mine, while the church clock booms  three solemn strokes in the distance.</p>
<p>O, why did not the reverend intestate marry his  housekeeper, and make a will, like other honest citizens, and leave my  Charlotte to walk the obscure byways of honest poverty with me? I do believe  that I could have been honest; I do believe that I could have been brave and  true and steadfast for her dear sake. But it is the office of man to propose,  while the Unseen disposes. Perhaps such a youth as mine admits of no  redemption. I have written circulars for Horatio Paget. I have been the willing  remorseless tool of a man who never eats his dinner without inflicting a wrong  upon his fellow-creatures. Can a few moments of maudlin sentimentality, a vague  yearning for something brighter and better, a brief impulse towards honesty,  inspired by a woman&rsquo;s innocent eyes &mdash; can so little virtue in the present atone  for so much guilt in the past? Alas! I fear not.</p>
<p>I had one last brief <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em> with my dear girl while I took the tracing from the old  Bible. She sat watching me, and distracting me more or less while I worked; and  despite the shadow of doubt that has fallen upon me, I could not be otherwise  than happy in her sweet company.</p>
<p>When I came to the record of Susan Meynell&rsquo;s death,  my Charlotte&rsquo;s manner changed all at once from her accustomed joyousness to a  pensive gravity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very sorry you spoke of Susan Meynell to  uncle Joseph,&rdquo; she said, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why sorry, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had some vague notion as to the cause of this  sorrow; but the instincts of the chase impelled me to press the subject. Was I  not bound to know every secret in the lives of Matthew Haygarth&rsquo;s descendants?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a very sad story connected with my aunt  Susan &mdash; she was my great-aunt, you know,&rdquo; said Charlotte, with a grave earnest  face. &ldquo;She went away from home, and there was great sorrow. I cannot talk of  the story, even to you, Valentine, for there seems something sacred in these  painful family secrets. My poor aunt Susan left all her friends, and died many  years afterwards in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was known to have died unmarried?&rdquo; I asked.  This would be an important question from George Sheldon&rsquo;s point of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Charlotte replied, blushing crimson.</p>
<p>That blush told me a great deal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was some one concerned in this poor lady&rsquo;s  sorrow,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;some one to blame for all her unhappiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One whom she loved and trusted, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom she loved and trusted only too well. O,  Valentine, must not that be terrible? To confide with all your heart in the  person you love, and to find him base and cruel! If my poor aunt had not  believed Montagu Kingdon to be true and honourable, she would have trusted her  friends a little, instead of trusting so entirely in him. O, Valentine, what am  I telling you? I cannot bear to cast a shadow on the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear love, do you think I cannot pity this  injured lady? Do you think I am likely to play the Pharisee, and be eager to bespatter  the grave of this poor sufferer? I can almost guess the story which you shrink  from telling me &mdash; it is one of those sad histories so often acted, so often  told. Your aunt loved a person called Montagu Kingdon &mdash; her superior in  station, perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at Charlotte as I said this, and her face  told me that I had guessed rightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Montagu Kingdon admired and loved her,&rdquo; I  said. &ldquo;He seemed eager to make her his wife, but no doubt imposed secrecy as to  his intentions. She accepted his word as that of a true-hearted lover and a  gentleman, and in the end had bitter reason to repent her confidence. That is  an outline of the story, is it not, Charlotte?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure that it was so. I am sure that when she  left Newhall she went away to be married,&rdquo; cried Charlotte, eagerly; &ldquo;I have  seen a letter that proves it &mdash; to me, at least. And yet I have heard even mamma  speak harshly of her &mdash; so long dead and gone off the face of this earth &mdash; as if  she had deliberately chosen the sad fate which came to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not possible that Mr. Kingdon did marry Miss  Meynell, after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Charlotte, very sadly; &ldquo;there is no  hope of that. I have seen a letter written by my poor aunt years afterwards &mdash; a  letter that tells much of the cruel truth; and I have heard that Mr. Kingdon  came back to Yorkshire and married a rich lady during my aunt&rsquo;s lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see that letter,&rdquo; I said,  involuntarily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Valentine?&rdquo; asked my darling, looking at me  with sorrowful, wondering eyes, &ldquo;To me it seems so painful to talk of these  things: it is like reopening an old wound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the interests of other people require&mdash;&rdquo; I  began, in a very blundering manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose interest can be served by my showing you my  poor aunt&rsquo;s letter?<br>
  It would seem like an act of dishonour to the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could I say after this &mdash; bound hand and foot  as I am by my promise to Sheldon?</p>
<p>After a long talk with my sweet one, I borrowed  uncle Joe&rsquo;s dog-cart, and spun across to Barngrave, where I found the little  church, beneath whose gray old roof Charlotte Meynell plighted her troth to  James Halliday. I took a copy of all entries in the register concerning Mrs.  Meynell Halliday and her children, and then went back to Newhall to restore the  dog-cart, and to take my last Yorkshire tea at the hospitable old farm-house.</p>
<p>To-morrow I am off to Barlingford, fifteen miles  from this village, to take more copies from registries concerning my sweet  young heiress &mdash; the registries of her father&rsquo;s marriage, and her own birth.  After that I think my case will be tolerably complete, and I can present myself  to Sheldon in the guise of a conqueror.</p>
<p>Is it not a great conquest to have made? Is it not  almost an act of chivalry for these prosaic days to go forth into the world as  a private inquirer, and win a hundred thousand pounds for the lady of one&rsquo;s  love? And yet I wish any one rather than my Charlotte were the lineal  descendant of Matthew Haygarth.</p>
<p><em>Nov. 10th</em>. Here I am in London once  more, with my Sheldon in ecstatics, and our affairs progressing marvellously  well, as he informs me; but with that ponderous slowness peculiar to all mortal  affairs in which the authorities of the realm are in any way concerned.</p>
<p>My work is finished. Hawkehurst the genealogist and  antiquarian sinks into Hawkehurst the private individual. I have no more to do  but to mind my own business and await the fruition of time in the shape of my  reward.</p>
<p>Can I accept three thousand pounds for giving my  dearest her birthright? Can I take payment for a service done to her? Surely  not: and, on the other hand, can I continue to woo my sweet one, conscious that  she is the rightful claimant to a great estate? Can I take advantage of her  ignorance, and may it not be said that I traded on my secret knowledge?</p>
<p>Before leaving Yorkshire, I stole one more day from  the Sheldon business, in order to loiter just a few hours longer in that  northern Arcadia called Newhall farm. What assurance have I that I shall ever  re-enter that pleasant dwelling? What hold have I, a wanderer and vagabond, on  the future which respectable people map out for themselves with such  mathematical precision? And even the respectable people are sometimes out in  their reckoning. To snatch the joys of to-day must always be the policy of the  adventurer. So I took one more happy afternoon at Newhall. Nor was the  afternoon entirely wasted; for, in the course of my farewell visit, I heard  more of poor Susan Meynell&rsquo;s history from honest uncle Joseph. He told me the  story during an after-dinner walk, in which he took me the round of his pig-styes  and cattle-sheds for the last time, as if he would fain have had them leave  their impress on my heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may see plenty of cattle in Yorkshire,&rdquo; he  remarked, complacently, &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t see many beasts to beat that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to a brown and mountainous mass of inert  matter, which he gave me to understand was something in the way of cattle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to see him standing?&rdquo; he asked,  giving the mass a prod with the handle of his walking-stick, which to my  cockney mind seemed rather cruel, but which, taken from an agricultural point  of view, was no doubt the correct thing. &ldquo;He <em>can</em> stand. Coom up, Brownie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I humbly entreated that the ill-used mass might be  allowed to sprawl in undisturbed misery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thorley!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Mercer, laying his finger  significantly against the side of his unpretending nose.</p>
<p>I had not the faintest comprehension of my revered  uncle-in-law&rsquo;s meaning; but I said, &ldquo;O, indeed!&rdquo; with the accents of  admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thorley&rsquo;s Condiment,&rdquo; said my uncle. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see  some fine animate at the Cattle-show; but if you see a two-year-old ox to beat  him, my name is not Joe Mercer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this I had to pay my respects to numerous  specimens of the bovine race, all more or less prostrate under the burden of  superabundant flesh, all seeming to cry aloud for the treatment of some Banting  of the agricultural world.</p>
<p>After we had &ldquo;done&rdquo; the cattle-sheds, with heroic  resignation on my part, and with enthusiasm on the part of Mr. Mercer, we went  a long way to see some rarities in the way of mutton, which commodity was to be  found cropping the short grass on a distant upland.</p>
<p>With very little appreciation of the zoological  varieties, and with the consciousness that my dear one was sitting in the  farm-house parlour, wondering at my prolonged absence, this excursion could not  be otherwise than a bore to me. But it was a small thing to sacrifice my own  pleasure for once in a way, when by so doing I might gratify the kindest of men  and of uncles; so I plodded briskly across the fields with the friendly farmer.</p>
<p>I had my reward; for, in the course of this walk,  Mr. Mercer gave me the history of poor Susan Meynell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t care to talk about the story the other  night before the young lass,&rdquo; he said, gravely; &ldquo;for her heart&rsquo;s so full of  pity and tenderness, pretty dear, that any tale such as that is like to upset  her. But the story&rsquo;s known to almost all the folks in these parts; so there&rsquo;s  no particular reason against my telling it to you. I&rsquo;ve heard my poor mother  talk of Susan Meynell many a time. She was a regular beauty, it seems; prettier  than her sister Charlotte, and she was a pretty woman, as you may guess by  looking at <em>our</em> Charlotte, who is  thought the image of her grandmother. But Susan was one of those beauties that  you don&rsquo;t see very often &mdash; more like a picture than flesh and blood. The gentry  used to turn round to look at her at Barngrave church, I&rsquo;ve heard my mother  say. She was a rare one for dress, too; for she had a few hundreds left her by  her father and mother, who had both of them been very well-to-do people. The  mother was daughter to William Rand, of Barngrave, a man who farmed above a  thousand acres of his own land; and the father kept a carpet warehouse in  Aldersgate-street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This information I received with respectful  deference, and a hypocritical assumption of ignorance respecting Miss Meynell&rsquo;s  antecedents.</p>
<p>Mr. Mercer paused to take breath, and then  continued the story after his own rambling fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my lad, what with her fine dress, and what  with her pretty looks, Susan Meynell seems to have thought a little too much of  herself; so that when Montagu Kingdon, of Kingdon-place, younger brother to  Lord Durnsville, fell in love with her, and courted her &mdash; not exactly openly,  but with the knowledge of her sister, Mrs. Halliday &mdash; she thought it no more  than natural that he should intend to make her his wife. Mr. Kingdon was ten  years older than Susan, and had served in Spain, and had not borne too good a  character abroad. He had been in a hard-drinking cavalry regiment, and had  spent all his money, and sold out directly the war was over. There was very  little of all this known down hereabouts, where Mr. Kingdon stood very high, on  account of his being Lord Durnsville&rsquo;s brother. But it was known that he was  poor, and that the Durnsville estates were heavily encumbered into the  bargain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this gentleman would have been no grand match  for Miss Meynell, if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he had married her? No, my lad; and it might  have been the knowledge of his poverty that made Susan and her sister think  less of the difference between his station and the girl&rsquo;s. The two women  favoured him, anyhow; and they kept the secret from James Halliday, who was a  regular upstraight-and-downright kind of fellow, as proud as any lord in his  own way. The secret was kept safe enough for some time, and Mr. Kingdon was  always dropping in at Newhall when Jim was out of the way; but folks in these  parts are very inquisitive, and, lonesome as our place is, there are plenty of  people go by between Monday and Saturday; so by-and-by it got to be noticed  that there was very often a gentleman&rsquo;s horse standing at Newhall gate, with  the bridle tied to one of the gate-posts; and those that knew anything, knew  that the horse belonged to Montagu Kingdon. A friend of Jim Halliday&rsquo;s told him  as much one day, and warned him that Mr. Kingdon was a scamp, and was said to  have a Spanish wife somewhere beyond seas. This was quite enough for James  Halliday, who flew into a roaring rage at the notion of any man, most of all  Lord Durnsville&rsquo;s brother, going to his house and courting his sister-in-law in  secret. It was at Barngrave he was told this, one market-day, as he was  lounging with his friends in the old yard of the Black Bull inn, where the corn  exchange used to be held in those days. He called for his horse the next  minute, and left the town at a gallop. When he came to Newhall, he found  Montagu Kingdon&rsquo;s chestnut mare tied to the gate-post, and he found Mr. Kingdon  himself, dawdling about the garden with Miss Meynell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I suppose there was a scene?&rdquo; I  suggested, with unfeigned interest in this domestic story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I believe there was, my lad. I&rsquo;ve heard all  about it from my poor Molly, who had the story from her mother. James Halliday  didn&rsquo;t mince matters; he gave Mr. Kingdon a bit of his mind, in his own rough  outspoken way, and told him it would be the worse for him if he ever crossed  the threshold of Newhall gate again. &lsquo;If you meant well by that foolish girl,  you wouldn&rsquo;t come sneaking here behind my back,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but you don&rsquo;t mean  well by her, and you&rsquo;ve a Spanish wife hidden away somewhere in the Peninsula.&rsquo;  Mr. Kingdon gave the lie to this; but he said he shouldn&rsquo;t stoop to justify  himself to an unmannerly yeoman. &lsquo;If you were a gentleman,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you  should pay dearly for your insolence.&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m ready to pay any price you like,&rsquo;  answered James Halliday, as bold as brass; &lsquo;but as you weren&rsquo;t over fond of  fighting abroad, where there was plenty to be got for it, I don&rsquo;t suppose you  want to fight at home, where there&rsquo;s nothing to be got for it.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did Susan Meynell hear this?&rdquo; I asked. I could  fancy this ill-fated girl standing by and looking on aghast while hard things  were said to the man she loved, while the silver veil of sweet romance was  plucked so roughly from the countenance of her idol by an angry rustic&rsquo;s rude  hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t quite know whether she heard all,&rdquo;  answered Mr. Mercer, thoughtfully. &ldquo;Of course, James Halliday told his wife all  about the row afterwards. He was very kind to his sister-in-law, in spite of her  having deceived him; and he talked to her very seriously, telling her all he  had heard in Barngrave against Montagu Kingdon. She listened to him quietly  enough, but it was quite clear that she didn&rsquo;t believe a word he said. &lsquo;I know  you have heard all that, James,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;but the people who said it knew  they were not telling the truth. Lord Durnsville and his brother are not  popular in the country, and there are no falsehoods too cruel for the malice of  his enemies.&rsquo; She answered him with some such fine speech as that, and when the  next morning came she was gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She eloped with Mr. Kingdon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She left a letter for her sister, full of  romantic stuff about loving him all the better because people spoke ill of him;  regular woman&rsquo;s talk, you know, bless their poor silly hearts!&rdquo; murmured Mr.  Mercer, with tender compassion. &ldquo;She was going to London to be married to Mr.  Kingdon, she wrote. They were to be married at the old church in the city where  she had been christened, and she was going to stay with an old friend &mdash; a young  woman who had once been her brother&rsquo;s sweetheart, and who was married to a  butcher in Newgate-market &mdash; till the bans were given out, or the license  bought. The butcher&rsquo;s wife had a country-house out at Edmonton, and it was there  Susan was going to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that seemed straightforward enough,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied uncle Joe; &ldquo;but if Mr. Kingdon had  meant fairly by Susan Meynell, it would have been as easy for him to marry her  at Barngrave as in London. He was as poor as a church mouse, but he was his own  master, and there was no one to prevent him doing just what he pleased. This is  about what James Halliday thought, I suppose; for he tore off to London, as  fast as post-horses could carry him, in pursuit of his wife&rsquo;s sister and Mr.  Kingdon. But though he made inquiries all along the road he could not hear that  they had passed before him, and for the best of all reasons. He went to the  butcher&rsquo;s house at Edmonton; but there he found no trace of Susan Meynell,  except a letter posted in Yorkshire, on the day of the row between James and  Mr. Kingdon, telling her intention of visiting her old friend within the next  few days, and hinting at an approaching marriage. There was the letter  announcing the visit, but the visitor had not come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the existence of that letter bears witness  that Miss Meynell believed in the honesty of her lover&rsquo;s intentions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure it does, poor lass,&rdquo; answered Mr.  Mercer pensively. &ldquo;She believed in the word of a scoundrel, and she was made to  pay dearly for her simplicity. James Halliday did all he could to find her. He  searched London through, as far as any man can search such a place as London;  but it was no use, and for a very good reason, as I said before. The end of it  was, he was obliged to go back to Newhall no wiser than when he started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was nothing further ever discovered?&rdquo; I asked  eagerly, for I felt that this was just one of those family complications from  which all manner of legal difficulties might arise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry, my lad,&rdquo; answered uncle Joe;  &ldquo;wickedness is sure to come to light sooner or later. Three years after this  poor young woman ran away there was a drunken groom dismissed from Lord  Durnsville&rsquo;s stable; and what must he needs do but come straight off to James  Halliday, to vent his spite against his master, and perhaps to curry favour at  Newhall. &lsquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have gone to London to look for the young lady, Muster  Halliday,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you should have gone the other way. I know a man as drove  Mr. Kingdon and your wife&rsquo;s sister across country to Hull with two of my lord&rsquo;s  own horses, stopping to bait on the way. They went aboard ship at Hull, Mr.  Kingdon and the young lady &mdash; a ship that was bound for foreign parts.&rsquo; This is  what the groom said; but it was little good knowing it now. There&rsquo;d been  advertisements in the papers beseeching her to come back; and everything had  been done that could be done, and all to no end. A few years after this back  comes Mr. Kingdon as large as life, married to some dark-faced, frizzy-haired  lady, whose father owned half the Indies, according to people&rsquo;s talk: but he  fought very shy of James Halliday; but when they did meet one day at the covert  side, Jim rode up to the honourable gentleman and asked him what he had done  with Susan Meynell. Those that saw the meeting say that Montagu Kingdon turned  as white as a ghost when he saw Jim Halliday riding up to him on his big,  raw-boned horse; but nothing came of the quarrel. Mr. Kingdon did not live many  years to enjoy the money his frizzy-haired West-Indian lady brought him. He  died before his brother, Lord Durnsville, and left neither chick nor child to  inherit his money, nor yet the Durnsville title, which was extinct on the death  of the viscount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what of the poor girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, poor lass, what of her? It was fourteen years  after she left her home before her sister got so much as a line to say she was  in the land of the living. When a letter did come at last, it was a very  melancholy one. The poor creature wrote to her sister to say she was in London,  alone and penniless, and, as she thought, dying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sister went to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I remembered that deprecating sentence in the  family Bible, written in a woman&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she did, good honest soul, as fast as she  could travel, carrying a full purse along with her. She found poor Susan at an  inn near Aldersgate-street &mdash; the old quarter, you see, that she&rsquo;d known in her  young days. Mrs. Halliday meant to have brought the poor soul back to  Yorkshire, and had settled it all with Jim; but it was too late for anything of  that kind. She found Susan dying, wandering in her mind off and on, but just  able to recognise her sister, and to ask forgiveness for having trusted to  Montagu Kingdon, instead of taking counsel from those that wished her well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that all?&rdquo; I asked presently.</p>
<p>Mr. Mercer made long pauses in the course of his  narrative, during which we walked briskly on; he pondering on those past  events, I languishing for further information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, lad, that was about all. Where Susan had  been in all those years, or what she had been doing, was more than Mrs.  Halliday could find out. Of late she had been living somewhere abroad. The  clothes she had last worn were of foreign make, very poor and threadbare; and  there was one little box in her room at the inn that had been made at Rouen,  for the name of a Rouen trunkmaker was on the inside of the lid. There were no  letters or papers of any kind in the box; so you see there was no way of  finding out what the poor creature&rsquo;s life had been. All her sister could do was  to stay with her and comfort her to the last, and to see that she was quietly  laid to rest in a decent grave. She was buried in a quiet little city  churchyard, somewhere where there are green trees among the smoke of the  chimney-pots. Montagu Kingdon had been dead some years when that happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that last letter still in existence?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; my first wife kept it with the rest of her  family letters and papers. Dorothy takes care of them now. We country folks set  store by those sort of things, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would fain have asked Mr. Mercer to let me see  this last letter written by Susan Meynell; but what excuse could I devise for  so doing? I was completely fettered by my promise to George Sheldon, and could  offer no reasonable pretence for my curiosity.</p>
<p>There was one point which I was bound to push home  in the interests of my Sheldon, or, shall I not rather say, of my Charlotte?  That all-important point was the question of marriage or no marriage. &ldquo;You feel  quite clear as to the fact that Montagu Kingdon never did marry this young  woman?&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; replied uncle Joe; &ldquo;that was proved  beyond doubt, I&rsquo;m sorry to say. Mr. Kingdon never could have dared to come back  here with his West-Indian wife in poor Susan Meynell&rsquo;s lifetime if he had  really married her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how about the lady he was said to have married  in Spain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say anything about that. It may have been  only a scandal, or, if there was a marriage, it may have been illegal. The  Kingdons were Protestants, and the Spaniards are all papists, I suppose. A  marriage between a Protestant and a Roman Catholic wouldn&rsquo;t be binding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not upon such a man as this Kingdon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems more than probable that the opinion  arrived at by this poor soul&rsquo;s friends must be correct, and that Montagu  Kingdon was a scoundrel. But how about Susan Meynell&rsquo;s after-life? &mdash; the  fourteen years in which she was lost sight of? May she not have married some  one else than Mr. Kingdon? and may she not have left heirs who will arise in  the future to dispute my darling&rsquo;s claim?</p>
<p>Is it a good thing to have a great inheritance? The  day has been when such a question as that could not by any possibility have  shaped itself in my mind. Ah! what is this subtle power called love, which  worketh such wondrous changes in the human heart? Surely the miracle of the  cleansed leper is in some manner typical of this transformation. The emanation  of divine purity encircled the leper with its supernal warmth, and the scales  fell away beneath that mysterious influence. And so from the pure heart of a  woman issues a celestial fire which burns the plague-spot out of the sinner&rsquo;s  breast. Ah, how I languish to be at my darling&rsquo;s feet, thanking her for the  cure she has wrought!</p>
<p>I have given my Sheldon the story of Susan  Meynell&rsquo;s life, as I had it from uncle Joseph. He agrees with me as to the  importance of Susan&rsquo;s last letter, but even that astute creature does not see a  way to getting the document in his hands without letting Mr. Mercer more or  less into our secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might tell this man Mercer some story about a  little bit of money coming to his niece, and get at Susan Meynell&rsquo;s letter that  way,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but whatever I told him would be sure to get round to Philip  somehow or other, and I don&rsquo;t want to put him on the scent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Sheldon&rsquo;s legal mind more than ever inclines to  caution, now that he knows the heiress of the Haygarths is so nearly allied to  his brother Philip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, Hawkehurst,&rdquo; he said to  me, after we had discussed the business in all its bearings, &ldquo;there are not  many people I&rsquo;m afraid of, but I don&rsquo;t mind owning to you that I am afraid of  my brother Phil. He has always walked over my head; partly because he can wear  his shirt-front all through business hours without creasing it, which I can&rsquo;t,  and partly because he&rsquo;s &mdash; well &mdash; more unscrupulous than I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused meditatively, and I too was meditative;  for I could not choose but wonder what it was to be more unscrupulous than  George Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he were to get an inkling of this affair,&rdquo; my  patron resumed presently, &ldquo;he&rsquo;d take it out of our hands before you could say  Jack Robinson &mdash; supposing anybody ever wanted to say Jack Robinson, which they  don&rsquo;t &mdash; and he&rsquo;d drive a bargain with us, instead of our driving a bargain with  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My friend of Gray&rsquo;s Inn has a pleasant way of  implying that our interests are coequal in this affair. I caught him watching  me curiously once or twice during our last interview, when Charlotte&rsquo;s name was  mentioned. Does he suspect the truth, I wonder?</p>
<p><em>Nov. 12th</em>. I had another interview  with my patron yesterday, and rather a curious interview, though not altogether  unsatisfactory. George Sheldon has been making good use of his time since my  return from Yorkshire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we need have any fear of opposition  from children or grandchildren of Susan Meynell,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have found the  registry of her interment in the churchyard of St. Giles&rsquo;s, Cripplegate. She is  described in that registry by her maiden name, and there is a plain headstone  in a corner of the ground, inscribed with the name of Susan Meynell, who died  July 14th, 1835, much lamented; and then the text about &lsquo;the one sinner that  repenteth,&rsquo; and so on,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon, as if he did not care to dwell on so  hackneyed a truism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;she might have been married, in  spite of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she might,&rdquo; replied my Sheldon, captiously;  &ldquo;but then, you see, the probability is that she wasn&rsquo;t. If she had been  married, she would have told her sister as much in that last letter, or she  would have said as much when they met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she was delirious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not all the time. She was sensible enough to talk  about her sorrow for the past, and so on; and she must have been sensible  enough to have spoken of her children, if she had ever had any. Besides, if she  had been married, she would scarcely have been wandering about the world in  that miserable manner, unless her husband was an uncommonly bad lot. No,  Hawkehurst, depend upon it, we&rsquo;ve nothing to fear in that quarter. The person  we have to fear is that precious brother of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talked the other day about driving a bargain  with him,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite understand your meaning. The fortune can  only be claimed by Char &mdash; Miss Halliday, and your brother has no legal  authority to dispose of her money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; answered my employer, with  contemptuous impatience of my dulness; &ldquo;but my brother Phil is not the man to  wait for legal power. His ideas will be Miss Halliday&rsquo;s ideas in this business.  When my case is ripe for action, I shall make my bargain &mdash; half the fortune to  be mine from the day of its recovery. A deed containing these conditions must  be executed by Charlotte Halliday before I hand over a single document relating  to the case. Now, as matters stand at present,&rdquo; he went on, looking very  fixedly at me, &ldquo;her execution of that deed would rest with Philip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when shall you make your overtures to Mr.  Sheldon?&rdquo; I asked, at a loss to understand that intent look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until the last links of the chain are put  together. Not before I&rsquo;m ready to make my first move on the Chancellor&rsquo;s  chessboard. Perhaps not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can tide over for a little time, I may throw  Philip overboard altogether, and get some one else to manage Miss Halliday for  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, Hawkehurst,&rdquo; answered my patron,  resting his elbows on the table by which we were sitting, and looking me  through with those penetrating black eyes of his. &ldquo;My brother Phil played me a  shabby trick a few years ago, which I have not forgotten or forgiven. So I  shouldn&rsquo;t mind paying him out in some of his own coin. Beyond which, I tell you  again, I don&rsquo;t like the idea of his having a finger in this business. Where  that kind of man&rsquo;s finger can go, his whole hand will follow; and if once that  hand fastens on John Haygarth&rsquo;s money, it&rsquo;ll be bad times for you and me. Miss  Halliday counts for exactly nothing in my way of reckoning. If her stepfather  told her to sign away half a million, she&rsquo;d scribble her name at the bottom of  the paper, and press her pretty little thumb upon the wafer, without asking a  single question as to the significance of the document. And, of course, she&rsquo;d  be still less inclined to make objections if it was her husband who asked her  to execute the deed. Aha! my young friend, how is it you grow first red and  then white when I mention Miss Halliday&rsquo;s husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have no doubt that I did indeed blanch when that  portentous word was uttered in conjunction with my darling&rsquo;s name. Mr. Sheldon  leant a little further across the table, and his hard black eyes penetrated a  little deeper into the recesses of my foolish heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine Hawkehurst,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;shall we throw my  brother Phil overboard altogether? Shall you and I go shares in this fortune?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word and honour I don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; I  said, in all sincerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that you won&rsquo;t understand me,&rdquo; answered  George Sheldon, impatiently; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll make myself pretty clear presently; and  as your own interest is at stake, you&rsquo;ll be very unlike the rest of your  species if you don&rsquo;t find it easy enough to understand me. When first I let you  in for the chance of a prize out of this business, neither you nor I had the  slightest idea that circumstances would throw the rightful claimant to the  Haygarth estate so completely into our way. I had failed so many times with  other cases before I took up this case, that it&rsquo;s a wonder I had the courage to  work on. But, somehow or other, I had a notion that this particular business  would turn up trumps. The way seemed a little clearer than it usually is; but  not clear enough to tempt Tom, Dick, and Harry. And then, again, I had learnt a  good many secrets from the experience of my failures. I was well up to my work.  I might have carried it on, and I ought to have carried it on, without help;  but I was getting worn out and lazy, so I let you into my secret, having taken  it into my head that I could venture to trust you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t trust me further than you could help,  my friend,&rdquo; I replied with my usual candour. &ldquo;You never told me the amount left  by the reverend intestate; but I heard that down at Ullerton. A half share in a  hundred thousand pounds is worth trying for, Mr. Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call it a hundred thousand down there, do  they?&rdquo; asked the lawyer, with charming innocence. &ldquo;Those country people always  deal in high figures. However, I don&rsquo;t mind owning that the sum is a handsome  one, and if you and I play our cards wisely, we may push Philip out of the game  altogether, and share the plunder between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I was obliged to confess myself unable to  grasp my employer&rsquo;s meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry Charlotte Halliday out of hand,&rdquo; he said,  bringing his eyes and his elbows still nearer to me, until his bushy black  whiskers almost touched my face. &ldquo;Marry her before Philip gets an inkling of  this affair, and then, instead of being made a tool of by him, she&rsquo;ll be safe  in your hands, and the money will be in your hands into the bargain. Why, how  you stare, man! Do you think I haven&rsquo;t seen how the land lies between you two?  Haven&rsquo;t I dined at Bayswater when you&rsquo;ve been there? and could any man with his  wits about him see you two sentimental young simpletons together <em>without</em> seeing how things were going on?  You are in love with Charlotte, and Charlotte is in love with you. What more  natural than that you two should make a match of it? Charlotte is her own  mistress, and hasn&rsquo;t sixpence in the world that any one but you and I know of;  for, of course, my brother Phil will continue to stick to every penny of poor  old Tom&rsquo;s money. All you have to do is to follow up the young lady; it&rsquo;s the  course that would suggest itself to any man in the same case, even if Miss  Halliday were the ugliest old harridan in Christendom, instead of being a very  jolly kind of girl, as girls go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My employer said this with the tone of a man who  had never considered the genus girl a very interesting part of creation. I  suppose I looked at him rather indignantly; for he laughed as he resumed, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say she&rsquo;s an angel, if you like,&rdquo; he said;  &ldquo;and if you think her one, so much the better. You may consider it a very lucky  thing that you came in my way, and a still more lucky thing that Miss Halliday  has been silly enough to fall in love with you. I&rsquo;ve heard of men being born  with silver spoons in their mouths; but I should think you must have come into  the world with a whole service of plate. However, that is neither here nor  there. Your policy will be to follow up your advantages; and if you can  persuade the young lady to change her name for Hawkehurst on the quiet some  fine morning, without stopping to ask permission of her stepfather, or any one  else, so much the better for you, and so much the more agreeable to me. I&rsquo;d  rather do business with you than with my brother Phil; and I shan&rsquo;t be sorry to  cry quits with that gentleman for the shabby trick he played me a few years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My Sheldon&rsquo;s brow darkened as he said this, and the  moody fit returned.
  That old grudge which my patron entertains against his brother must
  have relation to some very disagreeable business, if I may judge by
  George Sheldon&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>Here was a position for me, Valentine Hawkehurst,  soldier of fortune, cosmopolitan adventurer, and child of the nomadic tribes  who call Bohemia their mother country! Already blest with the sanction of my  dear love&rsquo;s simple Yorkshire kindred, I was now assured of George Sheldon&rsquo;s  favour; nay, urged onward in my paradisiac path by that unsentimental Mentor.  The situation was almost too much for my bewildered brain. Charlotte an  heiress, and George Sheldon eager to bring about my participation in the  Haygarthian thousands!</p>
<p>And now I sit in my little room in Omega-street,  pondering upon the past, and trying to face the perplexities of the future.</p>
<p>Is this to be? Am I, so hopeless an outsider in the  race of life, to come in with a rush and win the prize which Fortune&rsquo;s first  favourite might envy? Can I hope or believe it? Can the Fates have been playing  a pleasant practical joke with me all this time, like those fairies who decree  that the young prince shall pass his childhood and youth in the guise of a wild  boar, only to be transformed into an Adonis at last by the hand of the woman  who is disinterested enough to love him despite his formidable tusks and  ungainly figure?</p>
<p>No! a thousand times no! The woman I love, and the  fortune I have so often desired, are not for me. Every man has his own especial  Fates; and the three sisters who take care of me are grim, hard-visaged,  harder-hearted spinsters, not to be mollified by propitiation, or by the smooth  tongue of the flatterer. The cup is very sweet, and it seems almost within my  grasp; but between that chalice of delight and the lips that thirst for it, ah,  what a gulf!</p>
<p><em>Nov. 13th</em>. The above was written  late at night, and under the influence of my black dog. What an ill-conditioned  cur he is, and how he mouths and mangles the roses that bestrew his pathway,  always bent upon finding the worm at the core!</p>
<p>I kicked the brute out of doors this morning, on  finding a letter from my dear one lying in my plate. &ldquo;Avaunt, aroint thee, foul  fiend!&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;Thou art the veritable poodle in whose skin Mephistopheles  hides when bent on direst mischief. I will set the sign of the cross upon my  threshold, and thou shalt enter no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is what I said to myself as I tore open  Charlotte&rsquo;s envelope, with its pretty little motto stamped on cream-coloured  sealing-wax, &ldquo;<em>Pensez &agrave; moi.</em>&rdquo; Ah,  love; &ldquo;while memory holds a seat in this distracted globe.&rdquo; I saw the eyes of  my friend Horatio fixed upon me as I opened my letter, and knew that my  innermost sentiments were under inspection. Prudence demands all possible  caution where the noble Captain is concerned. I cannot bring myself to put  implicit faith in his account of his business at Ullerton. He may have been  there, as he says, on some promoting spec; but our meeting in that town was, to  say the least, a strange coincidence, and I am not a believer in coincidences &mdash;  off the stage, where a gentleman invariably makes his appearance directly his  friends begin to talk about him.</p>
<p>I cannot forget my conviction that Jonah Goodge was  bought over by a rival investigator, and that Rebecca Haygarth&rsquo;s letters were  tampered with; nor can I refrain from connecting that shapely but well-worn  lavender glove with the person of my dandy friend, Horatio Paget. The  disappearance of a letter from the packet intrusted to me by Miss Judson is  another mysterious circumstance; nor can I do away with the impression that I  heard the name Meynell distinctly pronounced by Philip Sheldon the last time I  was at the villa.</p>
<p>George Sheldon tells me the secret cannot by any  possibility have been betrayed, unless by me; and I have been prudence itself.</p>
<p>Supposing my suspicions of Mr. Goodge to be  correct, the letters extracted from Mrs. Rebecca&rsquo;s correspondence might tell  much, and might even put Horatio on the track of the Meynells. But how should he  get his first inkling of the business?</p>
<p>Certainly not from me or from George Sheldon. But  might not his attention have been attracted by that advertisement for  heirs-at-law to the Haygarthian estate which appeared in the <em>Times</em>?</p>
<p>These are questions with which the legal intellect  of my Sheldon may best grapple. For myself, I can only drift with the  resistless stream called life.</p>
<p>I was so unfortunate as to make my appearance in  our common sitting-room five minutes after my patron. There had been time  enough for him to examine the superscription and postmark of my letter. He was  whistling when I went into the room. People who have been looking at things  that don&rsquo;t belong to them always whistle.</p>
<p>I did not care to read Charlotte&rsquo;s first letter  with those hawk&rsquo;s eyes fixed upon me. So I just glanced at the dear  handwriting, as if running over an ordinary letter with the eye of  indifference, and then put the document into my pocket with the best assumption  of carelessness I was capable of. How I longed for the end of that tedious  meal, over which Captain Paget lingered in his usual epicurean fashion!</p>
<p>My friend Horatio has shown himself not a little  curious about my late absence from the joint domicile. I again resorted to the  Dorking fiction, &mdash; my aged aunt breaking fast, and requiring much propitiation  from a dutiful nephew with an eye to her testamentary arrangements. I had been  compelled to endow my shadowy relative with a comfortable little bit of money,  in order to account for my devotion; since the powerful mind of my Horatio  would have refused to grasp the idea of disinterested affection for an ancient  kinswoman.</p>
<p>There was an ominous twinkle in the Captain&rsquo;s sharp  gray eyes when I gave this account of my absence, and I sorely doubt his  acceptance of this second volume of the Dorking romance. Ah, what a life it is  we lead in the tents of Ishmael, the cast-away! through what tortuous pathways  wander the nomad tribes who call Hagar, the abandoned, their mother! what lies,  what evasions, what prevarications! Horatio Paget and I watch each other like  two cunning fencers, with a stereotyped smile upon our lips and an eager  restlessness in our eyes, and who shall say that one or other of our rapiers is  not poisoned, as in the famous duel before Claudius, usurper of Denmark? My  dear one&rsquo;s letter is all sweetness and love. She is coming home; and much as  she prefers Yorkshire to Bayswater, she is pleased to return for my sake &mdash; for  my sake. She leaves the pure atmosphere of that simple country home to become  the central point in a network of intrigue; and I am bound to keep the secret  so closely interwoven with her fate. I love her more truly, more purely than I  thought myself capable of loving; yet I can only approach her as the tool of  George Sheldon, a rapacious conspirator, bent on securing the hoarded thousands  of old John Haygarth.</p>
<p>Of all men upon this earth I should be the last to  underrate the advantages of wealth, &mdash; I who have been reared in the gutter,  which is Poverty&rsquo;s cradle. Yet I would fain Charlotte&rsquo;s fortune had come to her  in any other fashion than as the result of my work in the character of a  salaried private inquirer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="center"><strong><em><a name="BooktheSeventh"></a>Book the Seventh &mdash; Charlotte&rsquo;s Engagement</em></strong></h1>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter32"></a>Chapter 32<br>
  &ldquo;In Your Patience Ye Are Strong&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Miss Halliday returned to the gothic villa at  Bayswater with a bloom on her cheeks, and a brightness in her eyes, which  surpassed her wonted bloom and brightness, fair and bright as her beauty had  been from the hour in which she was created to charm mankind. She had been a  creature to adore even in the first dawn of infancy, and in her christening-hood  and toga of white satin had been a being to dream of. But now she seemed  invested all at once with a new loveliness &mdash; more spiritual, more pensive, than  the old.</p>
<p>Might not Valentine have cried, with the rapturous  pride of a lover: &ldquo;Look at the woman here with the new soul!&rdquo; and anon: &ldquo;This  new soul is mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was love that had imparted a new charm to Miss  Halliday&rsquo;s beauty. Diana wondered at the subtle change as her friend sat in her  favourite window on the morning after her return, looking dreamily out into the  blossomless garden, where evergreens of the darkest and spikiest character  stood up stern and straight against the cold gray sky. Diana had welcomed her  friend in her usual reserved manner, much to Charlotte&rsquo;s discomfiture. The girl  so yearned for a confidante. She had no idea of hiding her happiness from this  chosen friend, and waited eagerly for the moment in which she could put her  arms round Diana&rsquo;s neck and tell her what it was that had made Newhall so sweet  to her during this particular visit.</p>
<p>She sat in the window this morning thinking of  Valentine, and languishing to speak of him, but at a loss how to begin. There  are some people about whose necks the arms of affection can scarce entwine  themselves. Diana Paget sat at her eternal embroidery-frame, picking up beads  on her needle with the precision of some self-feeding machine. The little glass  beads made a hard clicking sound as they dropped from her needle, &mdash; a very  frosty, unpromising sound, as it seemed to Charlotte&rsquo;s hyper-sensitive ear.</p>
<p>There had been an unwonted reserve between the  girls since Charlotte&rsquo;s return, &mdash; a reserve which arose, on Miss Halliday&rsquo;s  part, from the contest between girlish shyness and the eager desire for a  confidante; and on the part of Miss Paget, from that gloomy discontent which  had of late possessed her.</p>
<p>She watched Charlotte furtively as she picked up  her beads &mdash; watched her wonderingly, unable to comprehend the happiness that  gave such spiritual brightness to her eyes. It was no longer the childlike  gaiety of heart which had made Miss Halliday&rsquo;s girlhood so pleasant. It was the  thoughtful, serene delight of womanhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can care very little for Valentine,&rdquo; Diana  thought, &ldquo;or she could scarcely seem so happy after such a long separation. I  doubt if these bewitching women who enchant all the world know what it is to  feel deeply. Happiness is a habit with this girl. Valentine&rsquo;s attentions were  very pleasant to her. The pretty little romance was very agreeable while it  lasted; but at the first interruption of the story she shuts the book, and  thinks of it no more. O, if my Creator had made <em>me</em> like that! If I could forget the days we spent together, and the  dream I dreamt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That never-to-be-forgotten vision came back to  Diana Paget as she sat at her work; and for a few minutes the clicking sound of  the beads ceased, while she waited with clasped hands until the shadows should  have passed before her eyes. The old dream came back to her like a picture,  bright with colour and light. But the airy habitation which she had built for  herself of old was no &ldquo;palace lifting to Italian heavens its marble roof.&rdquo; It  was only a commonplace lodging in a street running out of the Strand, with just  a peep of the river from a trim little balcony. An airy second-floor  sitting-room, with engraved portraits of the great writers on the newly-papered  walls: on one side an office-desk, on the other a work-table. The unpretending  shelter of a newspaper hack, who lives <em>&agrave;  jour la journ&eacute;e</em>, and whose wife must achieve wonders in the way of domestic  economy in order to eke out his modest earnings.</p>
<p>This was Diana Paget&rsquo;s vision of Paradise, and it  seemed only the brighter now that she felt it was never to be anything more  than a supernal picture painted on her brain.</p>
<p>After sitting silent for some little time, eager to  talk, but waiting to be interrogated, Charlotte was fain to break silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ask me whether I enjoyed myself in  Yorkshire, Di,&rdquo; she said, looking shyly down at the little bunch of charms and  lockets which employed her restless fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I, really?&rdquo; replied Diana, languidly; &ldquo;I  thought that was one of the stereotyped inquiries one always made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you wouldn&rsquo;t make stereotyped inquiries of <em>me</em>, Diana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I ought not to do so. But I think there are  times when one is artificial even with one&rsquo;s best friends. And you are my best  friend, Charlotte. I may as well say my only friend,&rdquo; the girl added, with a  laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana,&rdquo; cried Charlotte, reproachfully, &ldquo;why do  you speak so bitterly? You know how dearly I love you. I do, indeed, dear.  There is scarcely anything in this world I would not do for you. But I am not  your only friend. There is Mr. Hawkehurst, whom you have known so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Halliday&rsquo;s face was in a flame; and although  she bent very low to examine the golden absurdities hanging on her watch-chain,  she could not conceal her blushes from the eyes that were so sharpened by  jealousy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hawkehurst!&rdquo; cried Diana, with unspeakable  contempt. &ldquo;If I were drowning, do you think <em>he</em> would stretch out his hand to save me while you were within his sight? When he  comes to this house &mdash; he who has seen so much poverty, and misery, and shame,  and &mdash; happiness with me and mine &mdash; do you think he so much as remembers my  existence? Do you think he ever stops to consider whether I am that Diana Paget  who was once his friend and confidante and fellow-wayfarer and companion? or  only a lay figure dressed up to fill a vacant chair in your drawing-room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all very well to look at me reproachfully,  Charlotte. You must know that I am speaking the truth. You talk of friendship.  What is that word worth if it does not mean care and thought for another? Do  you imagine that Valentine Hawkehurst ever thinks of me, or considers me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte was fain to keep silence. She remembered how  very rarely, in those long afternoons at Newhall farm, the name of Diana Paget  had been mentioned. She remembered how, when she and Valentine were mapping out  the future so pleasantly, she had stopped in the midst of an eloquent bit of  word-painting, descriptive of the little suburban cottage they were to live in,  to dispose of Diana&rsquo;s fate in a sentence, &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;And dear Di can stop at the villa to take care of  mamma,&rdquo; she had said; whereupon Mr. Hawkehurst had assented, with a careless  nod, and the description of the ideal cottage had been continued.</p>
<p>Charlotte remembered this now with extreme  contrition. She had been so supremely happy, and so selfish in her happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Di,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;how selfish happy people are!&rdquo;  And then she stopped in confusion, perceiving that the remark had little  relevance to Diana&rsquo;s last observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine shall be your friend, dear,&rdquo; she said,  after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, you are beginning to answer for him already!&rdquo;  exclaimed Miss Paget, with increasing bitterness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana, why are you so unkind to me?&rdquo; Charlotte  cried, passionately. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that I am longing to confide in you? What  is it that makes you so bitter? You must know how truly I love you. And if Mr.  Hawkehurst is not what he once was to you, you must remember how cold and  distant you always are in your manner to him. I am sure, to hear you speak to  him, and to see you look at him sometimes, one would think he was positively  hateful to you. And I want you to like him a little for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Halliday left her seat by the window as she  said this, and went towards the table by which her friend was sitting. She  crept close to Diana, and with a half-frightened, half-caressing movement,  seated herself on the low ottoman at her feet, and, seated thus, possessed  herself of Miss Paget&rsquo;s cold hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to like Mr. Hawkehurst a little, Di,&rdquo;  she repeated, &ldquo;for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I will try to like him a little &mdash; for  your sake,&rdquo; answered<br>
  Miss Paget, in a very unsympathetic tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Di! tell me how it was he offended you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that he offended me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own manner, dear. You could never have been  so cold and distant with him &mdash; having known him so long, and endured so many  troubles in his company &mdash; if you had not been deeply offended by him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is your idea, Charlotte; but, you see, I am  very unlike you. I am fitful and capricious. I used to like Mr. Hawkehurst, and  now I dislike him. As to offence, his whole life has offended me, just as my  father&rsquo;s life has offended me, from first to last. I am not good and amiable  and loving, like you; but I hate deceptions and lies; above all, the lies that  some men traffic in day after day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Valentine&rsquo;s &mdash; was your father&rsquo;s life a very  bad one?&rdquo; Charlotte asked, trembling palpably, and looking up at Miss Paget&rsquo;s face  with anxious eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was a mean false life, &mdash; a life of trick  and artifice. I do not know the details of the schemes by which my father and  Valentine earned their daily bread &mdash; and my daily bread; but I know they  inflicted loss upon other people. Whether the wrong done was always done  deliberately and consciously upon Valentine&rsquo;s part, I cannot say. He may have  been only a tool of my father&rsquo;s. I hope he was, for the most part an  unconscious tool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said all this in a dreamy way, as if uttering  her own thoughts, rather than seeking to enlighten Charlotte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure he was an unconscious tool,&rdquo; cried that  young lady, with an air of conviction; &ldquo;it is not in his nature to do anything  false or dishonourable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! you know him very well, it seems,&rdquo; said  Diana.</p>
<p>Ah, what a tempest was raging in that proud  passionate heart! what a strife between the powers of good and evil! Pitying  love for Charlotte; tender compassion for her rival&rsquo;s childlike helplessness;  and unutterable sense of her own loss.</p>
<p>She had loved him so dearly, and he was taken from  her. There had been a time when he almost loved her &mdash; almost! Yes, it was the  remembrance of that which made the trial so bitter. The cup had approached her  lips, only to be dashed away for ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I ask in life except his love?&rdquo; she said  to herself. &ldquo;Of all the pleasures and triumphs which girls of my age enjoy, is  there one that I ever envied? No, I only sighed for his love. To live in a  lodging-house parlour with him, to sit by and watch him at his work, to drudge  for him, to bear with him &mdash; this was my brightest dream of earthly bliss; and  she has broken it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was thus Diana argued with herself, as she sat  looking down at the bright creature who had done her this worst, last wrong  which one woman can do to another. This passionate heart, which ached with such  cruel pain, was prone to evil, and to-day the scorpion Jealousy was digging his  sharp tooth into its very core. It was not possible for Diana Paget to feel  kindly disposed towards the girl whose unconscious hand had shattered the airy  castle of her dreams. Was it not a hard thing that the bright creature, whom  every one was ready to adore, must needs steal away this one heart?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has always been like this,&rdquo; thought Diana. &ldquo;The  story of David and Nathan is a parable that is perpetually being illustrated.  David is so rich &mdash; he is lord of incalculable flocks and herds; but he will not  be content till he has stolen the one little ewe lamb, the poor man&rsquo;s pet and  darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana,&rdquo; said Miss Halliday very softly, &ldquo;you are  so difficult to talk to this morning, and I have so much to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About your visit, or about Mr. Hawkehurst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About &mdash; Yorkshire,&rdquo; answered Charlotte, with the  air of a shy child who has made her appearance at dessert, and is asked whether  she will have a pear or a peach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Yorkshire!&rdquo; repeated Miss Paget, with a  little sigh of relief. &ldquo;I shall be very glad to hear about your Yorkshire  friends. Was the visit a pleasant one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very, very pleasant!&rdquo; answered Charlotte, dwelling  tenderly on the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How sentimental you have grown, Lotta! I think you  must have found a forgotten shelf of Minerva Press novels in some cupboard at  your aunt&rsquo;s. You have lost all your vivacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I?&rdquo; murmured Charlotte; &ldquo;and yet I am happier  than I was when I went away. Whom do you think I met at Newhall, Di?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not the slightest idea. My notions of  Yorkshire are very vague. I fancy the people amiable savages; just a little in  advance of the ancient Britons whom Julius Caesar came over to conquer. Whom  did you meet there? Some country squire, I suppose, who fell in love with your  bright eyes, and wished you to waste the rest of your existence in those  northern wilds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Paget was not a woman to bare her wounds for  the scrutiny of the friendliest eyes. Let the tooth of the serpent bite never  so keenly, she could meet her sorrows with a bold front. Was she not accustomed  to suffer &mdash; she, the scapegoat of defrauded nurses and indignant landladies,  the dependent and drudge of her kinswoman&rsquo;s gyn&aelig;ceum, the despised of her  father? The flavour of these waters was very familiar to her lips. The draught  was only a little more acrid, a little deeper, and habit had enabled her to  drain the cup without complaining, if not in a spirit of resignation. To-day  she had been betrayed into a brief outbreak of passion; but the storm had  passed, and a more observant person than Charlotte might have been deceived by  her manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you are my own Di again,&rdquo; cried Miss Halliday;  somewhat cynical at the best of times, but always candid and true.</p>
<p>Miss Paget winced ever so little as her friend said  this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear,&rdquo; continued Charlotte, with the faintest  spice of coquetry; &ldquo;it was not a Yorkshire squire. It was a person you know  very well; a person we have been talking of this morning. O, Di, you must  surely have understood me when I said I wanted you to like him for my sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine Hawkehurst!&rdquo; exclaimed Diana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else, you dear obtuse Di!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was in Yorkshire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear. It was the most wonderful thing that  ever happened. He marched up to Newhall gate one morning in the course of his  rambles, without having the least idea that I was to be found in the  neighbourhood. Wasn&rsquo;t it wonderful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could have taken him to Yorkshire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came on business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do I know? Some business of papa&rsquo;s, or of  George Sheldon&rsquo;s, perhaps. And yet that can&rsquo;t be. He is writing a book, I  think, about geology or archaeology &mdash; yes, that&rsquo;s it, archaeology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine Hawkehurst writing a book on archaeology!&rdquo;  cried Miss Paget.&ldquo;You must be dreaming, Charlotte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so? He does write, does he not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been reporter for a newspaper. But he is  the last person to write about archaeology. I think there must be some  mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, it may be so. I didn&rsquo;t pay much  attention to what he said about business. It seemed so strange for him to be  there, just as much at home as if he had been one of the family. O, Di, you  can&rsquo;t imagine how kind aunt Dorothy and uncle Joe were to him! They like him so  much &mdash; and they know we are engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Halliday said these last words almost in a  whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Diana, &ldquo;do you mean to say that  you have promised to marry this man, of whom you know nothing but what is  unfavourable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I know in his disfavour? Ah, Diana, how  unkind you are! and what a dislike you must have for poor Valentine! Of course,  I know he is not what people call a good match. A good match means that one is  to have a pair of horses, whose health is so uncertain that I am sure their  lives must be a burden to them, if we may judge by our horses; and a great many  servants, who are always conducting themselves in the most awful manner, if  poor mamma&rsquo;s experience is any criterion; and a big expensive house, which  nobody can be prevailed on to dust. No, Di! that is just the kind of life I  hate. What I should like is a dear little cottage at Highgate or Wimbledon, and  a tiny, tiny garden, in which Valentine and I could walk every morning before  he began his day&rsquo;s work, and where we could drink tea together on summer  evenings &mdash; a garden just large enough to grow a few rose-bushes. O. Di! do you  think I want to marry a rich man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Charlotte; but I should think you would like  to marry a good man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine is good. No one but a good man could  have been so happy as he seemed at Newhall farm. That simple country life could  not have been happiness for a bad man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was Valentine Hawkehurst really happy at  Newhall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really &mdash; really &mdash; really! Don&rsquo;t try to shake my  faith in him, Diana; it is not to be shaken. He has told me a little about the  past, though I can see that it pains him very much to speak of it. He has told  me of his friendless youth, spent amongst unprincipled people, and what a mere  waif and stray he was until he met me. And I am to be his pole-star, dear, to  guide him in the right path. Do you know, Di, I cannot picture to myself  anything sweeter than that &mdash; to be a good influence for the person one loves.  Valentine says his whole nature has undergone a change since he has known me.  What am I that I should work so good a change in my dear one? It is very  foolish, is it not, Di?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Charlotte,&rdquo; replied the voice of reason from  the lips of Miss Paget; &ldquo;it is all foolishness from beginning to end, and I can  foresee nothing but trouble as the result of such folly. What will your mamma  say to such an engagement? or what will Mr. Sheldon say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is the question,&rdquo; returned Charlotte,  very seriously. &ldquo;Dear mamma is one of the kindest creatures in the world, and  I&rsquo;m sure she would consent to anything rather than see me unhappy. And then,  you know, she likes Valentine very much, because he has given her orders for  the theatres, and all that kind of thing. But, whatever mamma thinks, she will  be governed by what Mr. Sheldon thinks; and of course he will be against our  marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our marriage!&rdquo; It was a settled matter, then &mdash; a  thing that was to be sooner or later; and there remained only the question as  to how and when it was to be. Diana sat like a statue, enduring her pain. So  may have suffered the Christian martyrs in their death-agony; so suffers a  woman when the one dear hope of her life is reft from her, and she dare not cry  aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sheldon is the last man in the world to permit  such a marriage,&rdquo; she said presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; replied Charlotte; &ldquo;but I am not going  to sacrifice Valentine for Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s pleasure. Mr. Sheldon has full power  over mamma and her fortune, but he has no real authority where I am concerned.  I am as free as air, Diana, and I have not a penny in the world. Is not that  delightful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl asked this question in all good faith,  looking up at her friend with a radiant countenance. What irony there was in  the question for Diana Paget, whose whole existence had been poisoned by the  lack of that sterling coin of the realm which seemed such sordid dross in the  eyes of Charlotte!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Charlotte?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, that even his worst enemies cannot accuse  Valentine of any mercenary feeling. He does not ask me to marry him for the  sake of my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he know your real position?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most fully. And now, Diana, tell me that you will  try to like him, for my sake, and that you will be kind, and will speak a good  word for me to mamma by-and-by, when I have told her all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you mean to tell her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Directly &mdash; or almost directly. I scarcely know how  to set about it. I am sure it has been hard enough to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor Charlotte! What an ungrateful wretch I  must be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Diana, you have no reason to be grateful.  I love you very dearly, and I could not live in this house without you. It is I  who have reason to be grateful, when I remember how you bear with mamma&rsquo;s  fidgety ways, and with Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s gloomy temper, and all for love of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lotta, for love of you,&rdquo; Miss Paget answered,  with a sigh; &ldquo;and I will do more than that for love of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had her arm round her happy rival&rsquo;s beautiful  head, and she was looking down at the sweet upturned face with supreme  tenderness. She felt no anger against this fair enslaver, who had robbed her of  her little lamb. She only felt some touch of anger against the Providence which  had decreed that the lamb should be so taken.</p>
<p>No suspicion of her friend&rsquo;s secret entered  Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s mind. In all their intercourse Diana had spoken very little  of Valentine; and in the little she had said there had been always the same  half-bitter, half-disdainful tone. Charlotte, in her simple candour, accepted  this tone as the evidence of Miss Paget&rsquo;s aversion to her father&rsquo;s <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Di does not like to see her father give so  much of his friendship to a stranger while she is neglected,&rdquo; thought Miss  Halliday; and having once jumped at this conclusion, she made no further effort  to penetrate the mysteries of Diana&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>She was less than ever inclined to speculation  about Diana&rsquo;s feelings now that she was in love, and blest with the sweet  consciousness that her love was returned. Tender and affectionate as she was,  she could not quite escape that taint of egotism which is the ruling vice of  fortunate lovers. Her mind was not wide enough to hold much more than one  image, which demanded so large a space.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter33"></a>Chapter 33<br>
  Mrs. Sheldon Accepts Her Destiny</h2>
<p>Miss Halliday had an interview with her mother that  evening in Mrs. Sheldon&rsquo;s dressing-room, while that lady was preparing for  rest, with considerable elaboration of detail in the way of hair-brushing, and  putting away of neck-ribbons and collars and trinkets in smart little boxes and  handy little drawers, all more or less odorous from the presence of dainty satin-covered  sachets. The sachets, and the drawers, and boxes, and trinkets were Mrs.  Sheldon&rsquo;s best anchorage in this world. Such things as these were the things  that made life worth endurance for this poor weak little woman; and they were  more real to her than her daughter, because more easy to realise. The beautiful  light-hearted girl was a being whose existence had been always something of a  problem for Georgina Sheldon. She loved her after her own feeble fashion, and  would have jealously asserted her superiority over every other daughter in the  universe; but the power to understand her or to sympathise with her had not  been given to that narrow mind. The only way in which Mrs. Sheldon&rsquo;s affection  showed itself was unquestioning indulgence and the bestowal of frivolous gifts,  chosen with no special regard to Charlotte&rsquo;s requirements, but rather because  they happened to catch Mrs. Sheldon&rsquo;s eye as they glittered or sparkled in the  windows of Bayswater repositories.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon happened to be dining out on this  particular evening. He was a guest at a great City feast, to which some of the  richest men upon &rsquo;Change had been bidden; so Miss Halliday had an excellent  opportunity for making her confession.</p>
<p>Poor Georgy was not a little startled by the  avowal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling Lotta!&rdquo; she screamed, &ldquo;do you think  your papa would ever consent to such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think my dear father would have consented to  anything likely to secure my happiness, mamma,&rdquo; the girl answered sadly.</p>
<p>She was thinking how different this crisis in her  life would have seemed if the father she had loved so dearly had been spared to  counsel her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not thinking of my poor dear first husband,&rdquo;  said Georgy. This numbering of her husbands was always unpleasant to Charlotte.  It seemed such a very business-like mode of description to be applied to the  father she so deeply regretted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of your step-papa,&rdquo; continued Mrs.  Sheldon. &ldquo;He would never consent to your marrying Mr. Hawkehurst, who really  seems to have nothing to recommend him except his good looks and an obliging  disposition with regard to orders for the theatres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not bound to consult my stepfather&rsquo;s wishes.  I only want to please you, mamma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, I cannot possibly consent to  anything that Mr. Sheldon disapproves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, mamma, dear kind mamma, do have an opinion of  your own for once in a way! I daresay Mr. Sheldon is the best possible judge of  everything connected with the Stock Exchange and the money-market; but don&rsquo;t  let him choose a husband for me. Let me have your approval, mamma, and I care  for no one else. I don&rsquo;t want to marry against your will. But I am sure you  like Mr. Hawkehurst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheldon shook her head despondingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well to like an agreeable young man  as an occasional visitor,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;especially when most of one&rsquo;s visitors  are middle-aged City people. But it is a very different thing when one&rsquo;s only  daughter talks of marrying him. I can&rsquo;t imagine what can have put such an idea  as marriage into your head. It is only a few months since you came home from  school; and I fancied that you would have stopped with me for years before you  thought of settling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Halliday made a wry face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear mamma,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to &lsquo;settle.&rsquo;  That is what one&rsquo;s housemaid says, isn&rsquo;t it, when she talks of leaving service  and marrying some young man from the baker&rsquo;s or the grocer&rsquo;s? Valentine and I  are not in a hurry to be married. I am sure, for my own part, I don&rsquo;t care how  long our engagement lasts. I only wish to be quite candid and truthful with you,  mamma; and I thought it a kind of duty to tell you that he loves me, and that &mdash;  I love him &mdash; very dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last words were spoken with extreme shyness.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheldon laid down her hair-brushes while she  contemplated her daughter&rsquo;s blushing face. Those blushes had become quite a  chronic affection with Miss Halliday of late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, good gracious me, Charlotte,&rdquo; she exclaimed,  growing peevish in her sense of helplessness, &ldquo;who is to tell Mr. Sheldon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no necessity for Mr. Sheldon to be enlightened  yet awhile, mamma. It is to you I owe duty and obedience &mdash; not to him. Pray  keep my secret, kindest and most indulgent of mothers, and &mdash; and ask Valentine  to come and see you now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask him to come and see me, Charlotte! You must  know very well that I never invite any one to dinner except at Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s  wish. I am sure I quite tremble at the idea of a dinner. There is such trouble  about the waiting, and such dreadful uncertainty about the cooking. And if one  has it all done by Birch&rsquo;s people, one&rsquo;s cook gives warning next morning,&rdquo;  added poor Georgy, with a dismal recollection of recent perplexities. &ldquo;I am  sure I often wish myself young again, in the dairy at Hyley farm, making  matrimony cakes for a tea-party, with a ring and a fourpenny-piece hidden in  the middle. I&rsquo;m sure the Hyley tea-parties were pleasanter than Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s  dinners, with those solemn City people, who can&rsquo;t exist without clear turtle  and red mullet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, mother dear, our lives were altogether happier  in those days. I delight in the Yorkshire tea-parties, and the matrimony cakes,  and all the talk and laughter about the fourpenny-piece and the ring. I  remember getting the fourpenny-piece at Newhall last year. And that means that  one is to die an old maid, you know. And now I am engaged. As to the dinners,  mamma, Mr. Sheldon may keep them all for himself and his City friends.  Valentine is the last person in the world to care for clear turtle. If you will  let him drop in sometimes of an afternoon &mdash; say once a week or so &mdash; when you,  and I, and Diana are sitting at our work in the drawing-room, and if you will  let him hand us our cups at our five-o&rsquo;clock tea, he will be the happiest of  men. He adores tea. You&rsquo;ll let him come, won&rsquo;t you, dear? O, mamma, I feel just  like a servant who asks to be allowed to see her &lsquo;young man.&rsquo; Will you let my  &lsquo;young man&rsquo; come to tea once in a way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Charlotte, I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mrs.  Sheldon, with increasing helplessness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a very dreadful position  for me to be placed in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite appalling, is it not, mamma? But then I  suppose it is a position that people afflicted with daughters must come to  sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it were the mere civility of asking him to  tea,&rdquo; pursued poor Georgy, heedless of this flippant interruption, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I  should be the last to make any objection. Indeed, I am under a kind of  obligation to Mr. Hawkehurst, for his polite attention has enabled us to go to  the theatres very often when your papa would not have thought of buying  tickets. But then, you see, Lotta, the question in point is not his coming to  our five-o&rsquo;clock tea &mdash; which seems really a perfect mockery to any one brought  up in Yorkshire &mdash; but whether you are to be engaged to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear mamma, <em>that</em> is not a question at all, for I am already engaged to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Charlotte&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think I could bring myself to disobey  you, dear mother,&rdquo; continued the girl tenderly; &ldquo;and if you tell me, of your  own free will, and acting on your conviction, that I am not to marry him, I  must bow my head to your decision, however hard it may seem. But one thing is  quite certain, mamma: I have given my promise to Valentine; and if I do not  marry him, I shall never marry at all; and then the dreadful augury of the  fourpenny-piece will be verified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Halliday pronounced this determination with a  decision of manner that quite overawed her mother. It had been the habit of  Georgy&rsquo;s mind to make a feeble protest against all the mutations of life, but  in the end to submit very quietly to the inevitable; and since Valentine  Hawkehurst&rsquo;s acceptance as Charlotte&rsquo;s future husband seemed inevitable, she  was fain to submit in this instance also.</p>
<p>Valentine was allowed to call at the Lawn, and was  received with a feeble, half-plaintive graciousness by the lady of the house.  He was invited to stop for the five-o&rsquo;clock tea, and availed himself  rapturously of this delightful privilege. His instinct told him what gentle  hand had made the meal so dainty and home-like, and for whose pleasure the  phantasmal pieces of bread-and-butter usually supplied by the trim parlour-maid  had given place to a salver loaded with innocent delicacies in the way of  pound-cake and apricot jam.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst did his uttermost to deserve so much  indulgence. He scoured London in search of free admissions for the theatres,  hunting &ldquo;Ragamuffins&rdquo; and members of the Cibber Club, and other privileged  creatures, at all their places of resort. He watched for the advent of novels  adapted to Georgy&rsquo;s capacity &mdash; lively records of croquet and dressing and love-making,  from smart young Amazons in the literary ranks, or deeply interesting romances  of the sensation school, with at least nine deaths in the three volumes, and a  comic housemaid, or a contumacious &ldquo;Buttons,&rdquo; to relieve the gloom by their  playful waggeries. He read Tennyson or Owen Meredith, or carefully selected  &ldquo;bits&rdquo; from the works of a younger and wilder bard, while the ladies worked  industriously at their prie-dieu chairs, or Berlin brioches, or Shetland  couvrepieds, as the case might be. The patroness of a fancy fair would scarcely  have smiled approvingly on the novel effects in <em>crochet &agrave; tricoter</em> produced by Miss Halliday during these pleasant  lectures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rows will come wrong,&rdquo; she said piteously,  &ldquo;and Tennyson&rsquo;s poetry is so very absorbing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst showed himself to be possessed of  honourable, not to say delicate, feelings in his new position. The gothic villa  was his paradise, and the gates had been freely opened to admit him whensoever  he chose to come. Georgy was just the sort of person from whom people take ells  after having asked for inches; and once having admitted Mr. Hawkehurst as a  privileged guest, she would have found it very difficult to place any  restriction upon the number of his visits. Happily for this much-perplexed matron,  Charlotte and her lover were strictly honourable. Mr. Hawkehurst never made his  appearance at the villa more than once in the same week, though the &ldquo;once a  week or so&rdquo; asked for by Charlotte might have been stretched to a wider  significance.</p>
<p>When Valentine obtained orders for the theatre, he  sent them by post, scrupulously refraining from making them the excuse for a  visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was all very well when I was a freebooter,&rdquo;  he said to himself, &ldquo;only admitted on sufferance, and liable to have the door  shut in my face any morning. But I am trusted now, and I must prove myself  worthy of my future mother-in-law&rsquo;s confidence. Once a week! One seventh day of  unspeakable happiness &mdash; bliss without alloy! The six other days are very long  and dreary. But then they are only the lustreless setting in which that jewel  the seventh shines so gloriously. Now, if I were Waller, what verses I would  sing about my love! Alas, I am only a commonplace young man, and can find no  new words in which to tell the old sweet story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the orders for stalls and private boxes were not  allowed to serve as an excuse for visits, they at least necessitated the  writing of letters; and no human being, except a lover, would have been able to  understand why such long letters must needs be written about such a very small  business. The letters secured replies; and when the order sent was for a box,  Mr. Hawkehurst was generally invited to occupy a seat in it. Ah, what did it  matter on those happy nights how hackneyed the plot of the play, how bald the  dialogue, how indifferent the acting! It was all alike delightful to those two  spectators; for a light that shone neither on earth nor sky brightened  everything they looked on when they sat side by side.</p>
<p>And during all these pleasant afternoons at the villa,  or evenings at the theatre, Diana Paget had to sit by and witness the happiness  which she had dreamed might some day be hers. It was a part of her duty to be  present on these occasions, and she performed that duty punctiliously. She  might have made excuses for absenting herself, but she was too proud to make  any such excuses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I such a coward as to tell a lie in order to  avoid a little pain more or less? If I say I have a headache, and stay in my  own room while he is here, will the afternoon seem any more pleasant or any  shorter to me? The utmost difference would be the difference between a dull  pain and a sharp pain; and I think the sharper agony is easier to bear.&rdquo; Having  argued with herself thus, Miss Paget endured her weekly martyrdom with Spartan  fortitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have I lost?&rdquo; she said to herself, as she  stole a furtive glance now and then at the familiar face of her old companion.  &ldquo;What is this treasure, the loss of which makes me seem to myself such an  abject wretch? Only the love of a man who at his best is not worthy of this  girl&rsquo;s pure affection, and at his worst must have been unworthy even of mine.  But then at his worst he is dearer to me than the best man who ever lived upon  this earth.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter34"></a>Chapter 34<br>
  Mr. Hawkehurst And Mr. George Sheldon Come To An Understanding</h2>
<p>There was no such thing as idleness for Valentine  Hawkehurst during these happy days of his courtship. The world was his oyster,  and that oyster was yet unopened. For some years he had been hacking and hewing  the shell thereof with the sword of the freebooter, to very little advantageous  effect. He now set himself seriously to work with the pickaxe of the  steady-going labourer. He was a secessionist from the great army of  adventurers. He wanted to enrol himself in the ranks of the respectable, the  plodders, the ratepayers, the simple citizens who love their wives and  children, and go to their parish church on Sundays. He had an incentive to  steady industry, which had hitherto been wanting in his life. He was beloved,  and any shame that came to him would be a still more bitter humiliation for the  woman who loved him.</p>
<p>He felt that the very first step in the difficult  path of respectability would be a step that must separate him from Captain  Paget; but just now separation from that gentleman seemed scarcely advisable.  If there was any mischief in that Ullerton expedition, any collusion between  the Captain and the Reverend Goodge, it would assuredly be well for Valentine  to continue a mode of life which enabled him to be tolerably well informed as  to the movements of the slippery Horatio. In all the outside positions of life  expedience must ever be the governing principle, and expedience forbade any  immediate break with Captain Paget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you do, keep your eye upon the Captain,&rdquo;  said George Sheldon, in one of many interviews, all bearing upon the Haygarth  succession. &ldquo;If there is any underhand work going on between him and Philip,  you must be uncommonly slow of perception if you can&rsquo;t ferret it out. I&rsquo;m very  sorry you met Charlotte Halliday in the north, for of course Phil must have  heard of your appearance in Yorkshire, and that will set him wondering at any  rate, especially as he will no doubt have heard the Dorking story from Paget.  He pretended he saw you leave town the day you went to Ullerton, but I am half  inclined to believe that was only a trap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Sheldon has heard of my  appearance in Yorkshire yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Miss Charlotte doesn&rsquo;t care to make a  confidant of her stepfather, I suppose. Keep her in that mind, Hawkehurst. If  you play your cards well, you ought to be able to get her to marry you on the  quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that would be possible. In fact, I  am sure
  Charlotte would not marry without her mother&rsquo;s consent,&rdquo; answered
  Valentine, thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of course that means my brother Philip&rsquo;s  consent,&rdquo; exclaimed George Sheldon, with contemptuous impatience. &ldquo;What a slow,  bungling fellow you are, Hawkehurst! Here is an immense fortune waiting for  you, and a pretty girl in love with you, and you dawdle and deliberate as if  you were going to the dentist&rsquo;s to have a tooth drawn. You&rsquo;ve fallen into a  position that any man in London might envy, and you don&rsquo;t seem to have the  smallest capability of appreciating your good luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps I am rather slow to realise the idea  of my good fortune,&rdquo; answered Valentine, still very thoughtfully. &ldquo;You see, in  the first place, I can&rsquo;t get over a shadowy kind of feeling with regard to that  Haygarthian fortune. It is too far away from my grasp, too large, too much of  the stuff that dreams and novels are made of. And, in the second place, I love  Miss Halliday so fondly and so truly that I don&rsquo;t like the notion of making my  marriage with her any part of the bargain between you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon contemplated his confederate with  unmitigated disdain. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try that sort of thing with me, Hawkehurst,&rdquo; he  said; &ldquo;that sentimental dodge may answer very well with some men, but I&rsquo;m about  the last to be taken in by it. You are playing fast-and-loose with me, and you  want to throw me over &mdash; as my brother Phil would throw me over, if he got the  chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not playing fast-and-loose with you,&rdquo; replied  Valentine, too disdainful of Mr. Sheldon for indignation. &ldquo;I have worked for  you faithfully, and kept your secret honourably, when I had every temptation to  reveal it. You drove your bargain with me, and I have performed my share of the  bargain to the letter. But if you think I am going to drive a bargain with you  about my marriage with Miss Halliday, you are very much mistaken. That lady  will marry me when she pleases, but she shall not be entrapped into a  clandestine marriage for your convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s your ultimatum, is it, Mr. Joseph  Surface?&rdquo; said the lawyer, biting his nails fiercely, and looking askant at his  ally, with angry eyes. &ldquo;I wonder you don&rsquo;t wind up by saying that the man who  could trade upon a virtuous woman&rsquo;s affection for the advancement of his  fortune, deserves to &mdash; get it hot, as our modern slang has it. Then I am to  understand that you decline to precipitate matters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I most certainly do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Haygarth business is to remain in abeyance  while Miss Halliday goes through the tedious formula of a sentimental  courtship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph! that&rsquo;s pleasant for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you make the advancement of Miss  Halliday&rsquo;s claims contingent on her marriage? Why not assert her rights at  once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I will not trust my brother Philip. The  day that you show me the certificate of your marriage with Charlotte Halliday  is the day on which I shall make my first move in this business. I told you the  other day that I would rather make a bargain with you than with my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what kind of bargain do you expect to make  with me when Miss
  Halliday is my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, Valentine Hawkehurst,&rdquo; replied the  lawyer, squaring his elbows upon his desk in his favourite attitude, and  looking across the table at his coadjutor; &ldquo;I like to be open and above-board  when I can, and I&rsquo;ll be plain with you in this matter. I want a clear half of  John Haygarth&rsquo;s fortune, and I think that I&rsquo;ve a very fair claim to that  amount. The money can only be obtained by means of the documents in my  possession, and but for me that money might have remained till doomsday  unclaimed and unthought of by the descendant of Matthew Haygarth. Look at it  which way you will, I think you&rsquo;ll allow that my demand is a just one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that it is unjust, though it certainly  seems a little extortionate,&rdquo; replied Valentine. &ldquo;However, if Charlotte were my  wife, and were willing to cede half the fortune, I&rsquo;m not the man to dispute the  amount of your reward. When the time comes for bargain-driving, you&rsquo;ll not find  me a difficult person to deal with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when may I expect your marriage with Miss  Halliday?&rdquo; asked George Sheldon, rapping his hard finger-nails upon the table  with suppressed impatience. &ldquo;Since you elect to conduct matters in the grand  style, and must wait for mamma&rsquo;s consent and papa&rsquo;s consent, and goodness knows  what else in the way of absurdity, I suppose the delay will be for an indefinite  space of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that. I&rsquo;m not likely to put off  the hour in which I shall call that dear girl my own. I asked her to be my wife  before I knew that she had the blood of Matthew Haygarth in her veins, and the  knowledge of her claim to this fortune does not make her one whit the dearer to  me, penniless adventurer as I am. If poetry were at all in your line, Mr.  Sheldon, you might know that a man&rsquo;s love for a good woman is generally better  than himself. He may be a knave and a scoundrel, and yet his love for that one  perfect creature may be almost as pure and perfect as herself. That&rsquo;s a  psychological mystery out of the way of Gray&rsquo;s Inn, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll oblige me by talking common sense for  about five minutes, you may devote your powerful intellect to the consideration  of psychological mysteries for a month at a stretch,&rdquo; exclaimed the aggravated  lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t you see how I struggle to be hard-headed  and practical!&rdquo; cried Valentine; &ldquo;but a man who is over head and ears in love  finds it rather hard to bring all his ideas to the one infallible grindstone.  You ask me when I am to marry Charlotte Halliday. To-morrow, if our Fates smile  upon us. Mrs. Sheldon knows of our engagement, and consents to it, but in some  manner under protest. I am not to take my dear girl away from her mother for  some time to come. The engagement is to be a long one. In the mean time I am  working hard to gain some kind of position in literature, for I want to be sure  of an income before I marry, without reference to John Haygarth; and I am a  privileged guest at the villa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my brother Phil has been told nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As yet nothing. My visits are paid while he is in  the City; and as I often went to the villa before my engagement, he is not  likely to suspect anything when he happens to hear my name mentioned as a  visitor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you really think he is in the dark &mdash; my  brother Philip, who can turn a man&rsquo;s brains inside out in half an hour&rsquo;s  conversation? Mark my words, Valentine Hawkehurst, that man is only playing  with you as a cat plays with a mouse. He used to see you and Charlotte together  before you went to Yorkshire, and he must have seen the state of the case quite  as plainly as I saw it. He has heard of your visits to the villa since your  return, and has kept a close account of them, and made his own deductions,  depend upon it. And some day, while you and pretty Miss Charlotte are enjoying  your fool&rsquo;s paradise, he will pounce upon you just as puss pounces on poor  mousy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was rather alarming, and Valentine felt that  it was very likely to be correct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sheldon may play the part of puss as he  pleases,&rdquo; he replied after a brief pause for deliberation; &ldquo;this is a case in  which he dare not show his claws. He has no authority to control Miss  Halliday&rsquo;s actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, but he would find means for  preventing her marriage if it was to his interest to do so. He is not <em>your</em> brother, you see, Mr. Hawkehurst;  but he is mine, and I know a good deal about him. His interest may not be  concerned in hindering his stepdaughter&rsquo;s marriage with a penniless scapegrace.  He may possibly prefer such a bridegroom as less likely to make himself  obnoxious by putting awkward questions about poor Tom Halliday&rsquo;s money, every  sixpence of which he means to keep, of course. If his cards are packed for that  kind of marriage, he&rsquo;ll welcome you to his arms as a son-in-law, and give you  his benediction as well as his stepdaughter. So I think if you can contrive to  inform him of your engagement, without letting him know of your visit to  Yorkshire, it might be a stroke of diplomacy. He might be glad to get rid of  the girl, and might hasten on the marriage of his own volition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might be glad to get rid of the girl.&rdquo; In the  ears of Valentine Hawkehurst this sounded rank blasphemy. Could there be any  one upon this earth, even a Sheldon, incapable of appreciating the privilege of  that divine creature&rsquo;s presence?</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter35"></a>Chapter 35<br>
  Mr. Sheldon Is Propitious</h2>
<p>It was not very long before Valentine Hawkehurst  had reason to respect the wisdom of his legal patron. Within a few days of his  interview with George Sheldon he paid his weekly visit to the villa. Things  were going very well with him, and life altogether seemed brighter than he had  ever hoped to find it. He had set himself steadily to work to win some kind of  position in literature. He devoted his days to diligent study in the  reading-room of the British Museum, his nights to writing for the magazines.  His acquaintance with press-men had stood him in good stead; and already he had  secured the prompt acceptance of his work in more than one direction. The young <em>litt&eacute;rateur</em> of the present day has  not such a very hard fight for a livelihood, if his pen has only a certain  lightness and dash, a rattling vivacity and airy grace. It is only the marvellous  boys who come to London with epic poems, Anglo-Saxon tragedies, or metaphysical  treatises in their portmanteaus, who must needs perish in their prime, or stoop  to the drudgery of office or counting-house.</p>
<p>Valentine Hawkehurst had no vague yearnings after  the fame of a Milton, no inner consciousness that he had been born to stamp out  the footprints of Shakespeare on the sands of time, no unhealthy hungering  after the gloomy grandeur of Byron. He had been brought up amongst people who  treated literature as a trade as well as an art; &mdash; and what art is not more or  less a trade? He knew the state of the market, and what kind of goods were  likely to go off briskly, and it was for the market he worked. When gray  shirtings were in active demand, he set his loom for gray shirtings; and when  the buyers clamoured for fancy goods, he made haste to produce that class of  fabrics. In this he proved himself a very low-minded and ignominious creature,  no doubt; but was not one Oliver Goldsmith glad to take any order which good  Mr. Newberry might give him, only writing the &ldquo;Traveller&rdquo; and the story of  Parson Primrose <em>pour se distraire</em>?</p>
<p>Love lent wings to the young essayist&rsquo;s pen. It is  to be feared that in roving among those shelves in Great Russell-street he  showed himself something of a freebooter, taking his &ldquo;bien&rdquo; wherever it was to  be found; but did not Moli&egrave;re frankly acknowledge the same practice? Mr.  Hawkehurst wrote about anything and everything. His brain must needs be a  gigantic storehouse of information, thought the respectful reader. He skipped  from Pericles to Cromwell, from Cleopatra to Mary Stuart, from Sappho to Madame  de Sabl&eacute;; and he wrote of these departed spirits with such a charming  impertinence, with such a delicious affectation of intimacy, that one would  have thought he had sat by Cleopatra as she melted her pearls, and stood  amongst the audience of Pericles when he pronounced his funeral oration. &ldquo;With  the De Sabl&eacute; and the Chevreuse, Ninon and Marion, Maintenon and La Valli&egrave;re,  Anne of Austria and the great Mademoiselle of France, he seemed to have lived  in daily companionship, so amply did he expatiate upon the smallest details of  their existences, so tenderly did he dwell on their vanished beauties, their  unforgotten graces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The work was light and pleasant; and the monthly  cheques from the proprietors of a couple of rival periodicals promised to  amount to the income which the adventurer had sighed for as he trod the  Yorkshire moorland. He had asked Destiny to give him Charlotte Halliday and  three hundred a year, and lo! while yet the wish was new, both these blessings  seemed within his grasp. It could scarcely be a matter for repining it the  Fates should choose to throw in an odd fifty thousand pounds or so.</p>
<p>But was not all this something too much of happiness  for a man whose feet had trodden in evil ways? Were not the Fates mocking this  travel-stained wayfarer with bright glimpses of a paradise whose gates he was  never to pass?</p>
<p>This was the question which Valentine Hawkehurst  was fain to ask himself sometimes; this doubt was the shadow which sometimes  made a sudden darkness that obscured the sunshine.</p>
<p>Happily for Charlotte&rsquo;s true lover, the shadow did  not often come between him and the light of those dear eyes which were his  pole-stars.</p>
<p>The December days were shortening as the year drew  to its close, and afternoon tea seemed more than ever delightful to Charlotte  and her betrothed, now that it could be enjoyed in the mysterious half light; a  glimmer of chill gray day looking coldly in at the unshrouded window like some  ghostly watcher envying these mortals their happiness, and the red glow of the  low fire reflected upon every curve and facet of the shining steel grate.</p>
<p>To sit by the fire at five o&rsquo;clock in the  afternoon, watching the changeful light upon Charlotte&rsquo;s face, the rosy glow  that seemed to linger caressingly on broad low brow and sweet ripe lips, the  deep shadows that darkened eyes and hair, was bliss unspeakable for Mr.  Hawkehurst. The lovers talked the prettiest nonsense to each other, while Mrs.  Sheldon dozed placidly behind the friendly shelter of a banner-screen hooked on  to the chimney-piece, or conversed with Diana in a monotonous undertone,  solemnly debating the relative wisdom of dyeing or turning in relation to a  faded silk dress.</p>
<p>Upon one special evening Valentine lingered just a  little longer than usual. Christmas was near at hand, and the young man had  brought his liege lady tribute in the shape of a bundle of Christmas  literature. Tennyson had been laid aside in favour of the genial Christmas  fare, which had the one fault, that it came a fortnight before the jovial  season, and in a manner fore-stalled the delights of that time-honoured period,  making the season itself seem flat and dull, and turkey and plum-pudding the  stalest commodities in the world when they did come. How, indeed, can a man do  full justice to his aunt Tabitha&rsquo;s plum-pudding, or his uncle Joe&rsquo;s renowned  rum-punch, if he has quaffed the steaming-bowl with the &ldquo;Seven Poor  Travellers,&rdquo; or eaten his Christmas dinner at the &ldquo;Kiddleawink&rdquo; a fortnight  beforehand? Are not the chief pleasures of life joys as perishable as the bloom  on a peach or the freshness of a rose?</p>
<p>Valentine had read the ghastliest of ghost-stories,  and the most humorous of word-pictures, for the benefit of the audience in Mrs.  Sheldon&rsquo;s drawing-room; and now, after tea, they sat by the fire talking of the  ghost-story, and discussing that unanswerable question about the possibility of  such spiritual appearances, which seems to have been debated ever since the  world began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Johnson believed in ghosts,&rdquo; said Valentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, please spare us Dr. Johnson,&rdquo; cried Charlotte,  with seriocomic intensity. &ldquo;What is it that obliges magazine-writers to be  perpetually talking about Dr. Johnson? If they must dig up persons from the  past, why can&rsquo;t they dig up newer persons than that poor ill-used doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened with a hoarse groan, and Mr.  Sheldon came into the room while Miss Halliday was making her playful protest.  She stopped, somewhat confused by that sudden entrance.</p>
<p>There is a statue of the Commandant in every house,  at whose coming hearts grow cold and lips are suddenly silent. It was the first  time that the master of the villa had interrupted one of these friendly  afternoon teas, and Mrs. Sheldon and her daughter felt that a domestic crisis  was at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried the stockbroker&rsquo;s strong hard  voice; &ldquo;you seem all in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a wax-match from a little gilt stand on the  mantelpiece and lighted two flaring lamps. He was the sort of man who is always  eager to light the gas when people are sitting in the gloaming, meditative and  poetical. He let the broad glare of common sense in upon their foolish musings,  and scared away Robin Goodfellow and the fairies by means of the Western  Gaslight Company&rsquo;s illuminating medium.</p>
<p>The light of those two flaring jets of gas revealed  Charlotte Halliday looking shyly at the roses on the carpet, and trifling  nervously with one of the show-books on the table. The same light revealed  Valentine Hawkehurst standing by the young lady&rsquo;s chair, and looking at Mr.  Sheldon with a boldness of countenance that was almost defiance. Poor Georgy&rsquo;s  face peered out from behind her favourite banner-screen, looking from one to  the other in evident alarm. Diana sat in her accustomed corner, watchful,  expectant, awaiting the domestic storm.</p>
<p>To the surprise of every one except Mr. Sheldon,  there was no storm, not even the lightest breeze that ever blew in domestic  hemispheres. The stockbroker saluted his stepdaughter with a friendly nod, and  greeted her lover with a significant grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, Hawkehurst?&rdquo; he said, in his  pleasantest manner. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an age since I&rsquo;ve seen you. You&rsquo;re going in for  literature, I hear; and a very good thing too, if you can make it pay. I  understand there are some fellows who really do make that sort of thing pay.  Seen my brother George lately? Yes, I suppose you and George are quite a Damon  and What&rsquo;s-his-name. You&rsquo;re going to dine here to-night, of course? I suppose  we may go in to dinner at once, eh, Georgy? &mdash; it&rsquo;s half-past six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst made some faint pretence of having a  particular engagement elsewhere; for, supposing Sheldon to be unconscious, he  scorned to profit by that gentleman&rsquo;s ignorance. And then, having faltered his  refusal, he looked at Charlotte, and Charlotte&rsquo;s eyes cried &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; as plainly  as such lovely eyes can speak. So the end of it was, that he stayed and partook  of the Sheldonian crimped skate, and the Sheldonian roast-beef and  tapioca-pudding, and tasted some especial Moselle, which, out of the kindliness  of his nature, Mr. Sheldon opened for his stepdaughter&rsquo;s betrothed.</p>
<p>After dinner there were oranges and crisp  uncompromising biscuits, that made an explosive noise like the breaking of  windows whenever any one ventured to tamper with them; item, a decanter of  sherry in a silver stand; item, a decanter of port, which Mr. Sheldon declared  to be something almost too good to be drunk, and to the merits of which  Valentine was supremely indifferent. The young man would fain have followed his  delight when she accompanied her mamma and Diana to the drawing-room; but Mr.  Sheldon detained him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want a few words with you, Hawkehurst,&rdquo; he said;  and Charlotte&rsquo;s cheeks flamed red as peonies at sound of this alarming  sentence. &ldquo;You shall go after the ladies presently, and they shall torture that  poor little piano to their hearts&rsquo; delight for your edification. I won&rsquo;t detain  you many minutes. You had really better try that port.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine closed the door upon the departing  ladies, and went back to his seat very submissively. If there were any battle  to be fought out between him and Philip Sheldon, the sooner the trumpet sounded  to arms the better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His remarkable civility almost inclines me to  think that he does really want to get rid of that dear girl,&rdquo; Valentine said to  himself, as he filled his glass and gravely awaited Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, my dear Hawkehurst,&rdquo; began that  gentleman, squaring himself in his comfortable arm-chair, and extending his  legs before the cheery fire, &ldquo;let us have a little friendly chat. I am not  given to beating about the bush, you know, and whatever I have to say I shall  say in very plain words. In the first place, I hope you have not so poor an  opinion of my perceptive faculties as to suppose that I don&rsquo;t see what is going  on between you and Miss Lotta yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Sheldon, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear what I have to say first, and make your  protestations afterwards. You needn&rsquo;t be alarmed; you won&rsquo;t find me quite as  bad as the stepmother one reads about in the story-books, who puts her  stepdaughter into a pie, and all that kind of thing. I suppose stepfathers have  been a very estimable class, by the way, as it is the stepmother who always  drops in for it in the story-books. You&rsquo;ll find me very easy to deal with, Mr.  Hawkehurst, always provided that you deal in a fair and honourable manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no wish to be underhand in my dealings,&rdquo;  Valentine said boldly. And indeed this was the truth. His inclination prompted  him to candour, even with Mr. Sheldon; but that fatal necessity which is the  governing principle of the adventurer&rsquo;s life obliged him to employ the arts of  finesse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; cried Mr. Sheldon, in the cheery, pleasant  tone of an easy-going man of the world, who is not too worldly to perform a  generous action once in a way. &ldquo;All I ask is frankness. You and Charlotte have  fallen in love with one another &mdash; why, I can&rsquo;t imagine, except on the  hypothesis that a decent-looking young woman and a decent-looking young man  can&rsquo;t meet half a dozen times without beginning to think of Gretna-green, or  St. George&rsquo;s, Hanover-square. Of course a marriage with you, looked at from a  common-sense point of view, would be about the worst thing that could happen to  my wife&rsquo;s daughter. She&rsquo;s a very fine girl&rdquo; (a man of the Sheldonian type would  call Aphrodit&eacute; herself a fine girl), &ldquo;and might marry some awfully rich City  swell with vineries and pineries and succession-houses at Tulse-hill or  Highgate, if I chose to put her in the way of that sort of thing. But then, you  see, the worst of it is, a man seldom comes to vineries and pineries at  Tulse-hill till he is on the shady side of forty; and as I am not in favour of  mercenary marriages, I don&rsquo;t care to force any of my City connection upon poor  Lotta. In the neighbourhood of the Stock Exchange there is no sharper man of  business than your humble servant; but I don&rsquo;t care to bring business habits to  Bayswater. Long before Lotta left school, I had made up my mind never to come  between her and her own inclination in the matrimonial line; therefore, if she  truly and honestly loves you, and if you truly and honestly love her, I am not  the man to forbid the bans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Sheldon, how shall I ever thank you  for this!&rdquo; cried Valentine, surprised into a belief in the purity of the  stockbroker&rsquo;s intentions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be in a hurry,&rdquo; replied that gentleman  coolly; &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t heard me out yet. Though I may consent to take the very  opposite line of conduct which I might be expected to take as a man of the  world, I am not going to allow you and Charlotte to make fools of yourselves.  There must be no love-in-a-cottage business, no marrying on nothing a year,  with the expectation that papa and mamma will make up the difference between  that and a comfortable income. In plain English, if I consent to receive you as  Charlotte&rsquo;s future husband, you and she must consent to wait until you can, to  my entire satisfaction, prove yourself in a position to keep a wife.&rdquo; Valentine  sighed doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think either Miss Halliday or I are in an  unreasonable hurry to begin life together,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully; &ldquo;but there  must be some fixed limit to our probation. I am afraid the waiting will be a  very long business, if I am to obtain a position that will satisfy you before I  ask my dear girl to share my fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are your prospects so very black?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; to my mind they seem wonderfully bright. But  the earnings of a magazine-writer will scarcely come up to your idea of an  independence. Just now I am getting about ten pounds a month. With industry, I  may stretch that ten to twenty; and with luck I might make the twenty into  thirty &mdash; forty &mdash; fifty. A man has only to achieve something like a reputation  in order to make a handsome living by his pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad to hear that,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon;  &ldquo;and when you can fairly demonstrate to me that you are earning thirty pounds a  month, you shall have my consent to your marriage with Charlotte, and I will do  what I can to give you a fair start in life. I suppose you know that she hasn&rsquo;t  a sixpence in the world, that she can call her own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a trying question for Valentine  Hawkehurst, and Mr. Sheldon looked at him with a sharp scrutinising glance as  he awaited a reply. The young man flushed crimson, and grew pale again before  he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have long been aware that Miss  Halliday has no legal claim on her father&rsquo;s fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you have hit the mark,&rdquo; cried Mr. Sheldon.  &ldquo;She has no claim to a sixpence in law; but to an honourable man that is not  the question. Poor Halliday&rsquo;s money amounted in all to something like eighteen  thousand pounds. That sum passed into my possession when I married my poor  friend&rsquo;s widow, who had too much respect for me to hamper my position as a man  of business by any legal restraints that would have hindered my making the  wisest use of her money. I have used that money, and I need scarcely tell you  that I have employed it with considerable advantage to myself and Georgy. I  therefore can afford to be generous, and I mean to be so; but the manner in  which I do things must be of my own choosing. My own children are dead, and  there is no one belonging to me that stands in Miss Halliday&rsquo;s way. When I die  she will inherit a handsome fortune. And if she marries with my approval, I  shall present her with a very comfortable dowry. I think you will allow that  this is fair enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be fairer or more generous,&rdquo; replied  Valentine with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s agreeable candour had entirely  subjugated him. Despite of all that George had said to his brother&rsquo;s prejudice,  he was ready to believe implicitly in Philip&rsquo;s fair dealing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in return for this I ask something on your  part,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon. &ldquo;I want you to give me your promise that you will take  no serious step without my knowledge. You won&rsquo;t steal a march upon me. You  won&rsquo;t walk off with Charlotte some fine morning and marry her at a  registry-office, or anything of that kind, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; answered Valentine resolutely, with a  very unpleasant recollection of his dealings with George Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your hand upon that,&rdquo; cried the  stockbroker.</p>
<p>Upon this the two men shook hands, and Valentine&rsquo;s  fingers were almost crushed in the cold hard grip of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s muscular  hand. And now there came upon Valentine&rsquo;s ear the sound of one of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s <em>Lieder ohne Worte</em>, tenderly played by  the gentle hands he knew so well. And the lover began to feel that he could no  longer sit sipping the stockbroker&rsquo;s port with a hypocritical pretence of  appreciation, and roasting himself before the blazing fire, the heat whereof  was multiplied to an insufferable degree by grate and fender of reflecting  steel.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon was not slow to perceive his guest&rsquo;s  impatience, and having made exactly the impression he wanted to make, was quite  willing that the interview should come to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better be off to the drawing-room,&rdquo; he  said, good naturedly; &ldquo;I see you are in that stage of the fever in which  masculine society is only a bore. You can go and hear Charlotte play, while I  read the evening papers and write a few letters. You can let her know that you  and I understand each other. Of course we shall see you very often. You&rsquo;ll eat  your Christmas turkey with us, and so on; and I shall trust to your honour for  the safe keeping of that promise you made me just now,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I shall keep an uncommonly close watch upon  you and the young lady, my friend,&rdquo; added that gentleman, communing with his  own thoughts as he crossed the smart little hall, where two Birmingham iron  knights in chain armour bestrode their gallant chargers, on two small tables of  sham malachite.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s library was not a very inspiring  apartment. His ideas of a <em>sanctum  sanctorum</em> did not soar above the commonplace. A decent square room,  furnished with plenty of pigeon-holes, a neat brass scale for the weighing of  letters, a copying-press, a waste-paper basket, a stout brass-mounted office  inkstand capable of holding a quart or so of ink, and a Post-office Directory,  were all he asked for his hours of leisure and meditation. In a handsome glazed  bookcase, opposite his writing-table, appeared a richly-bound edition of the <em>Waverley</em> <em>Novels</em>, Knight&rsquo;s <em>Shakespeare</em>,  Hume and Smollett, Fielding, Goldsmith, and Gibbon; but, except when Georgy  dusted the sacred volumes with her own fair hands, the glass doors of the  bookcase were never opened.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon turned on the gas, seated himself at  his comfortable writing-table, and took up his pen. A quire of office  note-paper, with his City address upon it, lay ready beneath his hand; but he  did not begin to write immediately. He sat for some time with his elbows on the  table, and his chin in his hands, meditating with dark fixed brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I trust her?&rdquo; he asked himself. &ldquo;Is it safe to  have her near me &mdash; after &mdash; after what she said to me in Fitzgeorge-street? Yes,  I think I can trust her, up to a certain point; but beyond that I must be on my  guard. She might be more dangerous than a stranger. One thing is quite clear &mdash;  she must be provided for somehow or other. The question is, whether she is to  be provided for in this house or out of it; and whether I can make her serve me  as I want to be served?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the gist of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s meditations; but  they lasted for some time. The question which he had to settle was an important  one, and he was too wise a man not to contemplate a subject from every possible  point of sight before arriving at his decision. He took a letter-clip from one  side of his table, and turned over several open letters in search of some  particular document.</p>
<p>He came at last to the letter he wanted. It was  written on very common note-paper, with brown-looking ink, and the penmanship  was evidently that of an uneducated person; but Mr. Sheldon studied its  contents with the air of a man who is dealing with no unimportant missive.</p>
<p>This was the letter which so deeply interested the  stockbroker: &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;HONORED SIR &mdash; This coms hopping that You and Your  Honored ladie are well has it leevs me tho nott so strong has i coud wish wich  his nott too bee expect at my time off life my pore neffew was tooke with the  tyfus last tewsday weak was giv over on thirsday and we hav berried him at  kensil grean Honored Mr. Sheldon I hav now no home my pore neece must go hout  into survis.

<p class="note">&ldquo;17 Litle Tottles-yarde lambeft.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">AN WOOLPER </p>
<p>&ldquo;No friend to help her in her old age,&rdquo; muttered  Mr. Sheldon; &ldquo;that means that she intends to throw herself upon me for the rest  of her life, and to put me to the expense of burying her when she is so  obliging as to die. Very pleasant, upon my word! A man has a servant in the  days of his poverty, pays her every fraction he owes her in the shape of wages,  and wishes her good speed when she goes to settle down among her relations; and  one fine morning, when he has got into a decent position, she writes to inform  him that her nephew is dead, and that she expects him to provide for her  forthwith. That is the gist of Mrs. Woolper&rsquo;s letter; and if it were not for  one or two considerations, I should be very much inclined to take a  business-like view of the case, and refer the lady to her parish. What are  poor-rates intended for, I should like to know, if a man who pays  four-and-twopence in the pound is to be pestered in this sort of way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Mr. Sheldon, having given vent to his  vexation by such reflections as these, set himself to examine the matter in  another light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must manage to keep sweet with Nancy Woolper  somehow or other, that&rsquo;s very clear; for a chattering old woman is about as  dangerous an enemy as a man can have. I might provide for her decently enough  out of doors for something like a pound a week; and that would be a cheap  enough way of paying off all old scores. But I&rsquo;m not quite clear that it would  be a safe way. A life of idleness might develop Mrs. Woolper&rsquo;s latent  propensity for gossip &mdash; and gossip is what I want to avoid. No, that plan won&rsquo;t  do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some moments Mr. Sheldon meditated silently,  with his brows fixed even more sternly than before. Then he struck his hand  suddenly on the morocco-covered table, and uttered his thoughts aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she shall come into the  house and serve my interests by keeping a sharp watch upon Charlotte Halliday.  There shall be no secret marriage between those two. No, my friend Valentine,  you may be a very clever fellow, but you are not quite clever enough to steal a  march upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having arrived at this conclusion, Mr. Sheldon  wrote a few lines to<br>
  Nancy Woolper, telling her to call upon him at the Lawn.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter36"></a>Chapter 36<br>
  Mr. Sheldon Is Benevolent</h2>
<p>Nancy Woolper had lost little of her activity  during the ten years that had gone by since she received her wages from Mr.  Sheldon, on his breaking up his establishment in Fitzgeorge-street. Her master  had given her the opportunity of remaining in his service, had she so pleased;  but Mrs. Woolper was a person of independent, not to say haughty, spirit, and  she had preferred to join her small fortunes with those of a nephew who was  about to begin business as a chandler and general dealer in a very small way,  rather than to submit herself to the sway of that lady whom she insisted on  calling Miss Georgy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so long since I&rsquo;ve been used to a missus,&rdquo;  she said, when announcing her decision to Mr. Sheldon, &ldquo;I doubt if I could do  with Miss Georgy&rsquo;s finnickin ways. I should feel tewed like, if she came into  the kitchen, worritin&rsquo; and asking questions. I&rsquo;ve been used to my own ways, and  I don&rsquo;t suppose I could do with hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Nancy departed, to enter on a career of unpaid  drudgery in the household of her kinsman, and to lose the last shilling of her  small savings in the futile endeavour to sustain the fortunes of the general  dealer. His death, following very speedily upon his insolvency, left the poor  soul quite adrift; and in this extremity she had been fain to make her appeal  to Mr. Sheldon. His reply came in due course, but not without upwards of a  week&rsquo;s delay; during which time Nancy Woolper&rsquo;s spirits sank very low, while a  dreary vision of a living grave &mdash; called a workhouse &mdash; loomed more and more  darkly upon her poor old eyes. She had well-nigh given up all hope of succour  from her old master when the letter came, and she was the more inclined to be  grateful for very small help after this interval of suspense. It was not  without strong emotion that Mrs. Woolper obeyed her old master&rsquo;s summons. She  had nursed the hard, cold man of the world whom she was going to see once more,  after ten years of severance; and though it was more difficult for her to  imagine that Philip Sheldon, the stockbroker, was the same Philip she had  carried in her stout arms, and hushed upon her breast forty years ago, than it  would have been to fancy the dead who had lived in those days restored to life  and walking by her side, still, she could not forget that such things had been,  and could not refrain from looking at her master with more loving eyes because  of that memory.</p>
<p>A strange dark cloud had arisen between her and her  master&rsquo;s image during the latter part of her service in Fitzgeorge-street; but,  little by little, the cloud had melted away, leaving the familiar image clear  and unshadowed as of old. She had suffered her mind to be filled by a suspicion  so monstrous, that for a time it held her as by some fatal spell; but with  reflection came the assurance that this thing could not be. Day by day she saw  the man whom she had suspected going about the common business of life, coldly  serene of aspect, untroubled of manner, confronting fortune with his head  erect, living quietly in the house where he had been wont to live, haunted by  no dismal shadows, subject to no dark hours of remorse, no sudden access of  despair, always equable, business-like, and untroubled; and she told herself  that such a man could not be guilty of the unutterable horror she had imagined.</p>
<p>For a year things had gone on thus, and then came  the marriage with Mrs. Halliday. Mr. Sheldon went down to Barlingford for the  performance of that interesting ceremony; and Nancy Woolper bade farewell to  the house in Fitzgeorge-street, and handed the key to the agent, who was to  deliver it in due course to Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s successor.</p>
<p>To-day, after a lapse of more than ten years, Mrs.  Woolper sat in the stockbroker&rsquo;s study, facing the scrutinising gaze of those  bright black eyes, which had been familiar to her of old, and which had lost  none of their cold glitter in the wear and tear of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think you can be of some use in the  house, as a kind of overlooker of the other servants, eh, Nancy &mdash; to prevent  waste, and gadding out of doors, and so on?&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon, interrogatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, sure, that I can, Mr. Philip,&rdquo; answered the  old woman promptly; &ldquo;and if I don&rsquo;t save you more money than I cost you, the  sooner you turn me out o&rsquo; doors the better. I know what London servants are,  and I know their ways; and if Miss Georgy doesn&rsquo;t take to the housekeeping, I  know as how things must be hugger-mugger-like below stairs, however smart and  tidy things may be above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Sheldon knows about as much of housekeeping  as a baby,&rdquo; replied Philip, with supreme contempt. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll not interfere with  you; and if you serve me faithfully&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I allers did, Mr. Philip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; I daresay you did. But I want faithful  service in the future as well as in the past. Of course you know that I have a  stepdaughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Halliday&rsquo;s little girl, as went to school at  Scarborough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same. But poor Tom&rsquo;s little girl is now a fine  young woman, and a source of considerable anxiety to me. I am bound to say she  is an excellent girl &mdash; amiable, obedient, and all that kind of thing; but she is  a girl, and I freely confess that I am not learned in the ways of girls; and  I&rsquo;m very much inclined to be afraid of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As how, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, Nancy, they come home from school  with their silly heads full of romantic stuff, fit for nothing but to read  novels and strum upon the piano; and before you know where you are, they fall  over head and ears in love with the first decent-looking young man who pays  them a compliment. At least, that&rsquo;s my experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning Miss Halliday, sir?&rdquo; asked Nancy, simply.  &ldquo;Has she fallen in love with some young chap?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has, and with a young chap who is not yet in a  position to support a wife. Now, if this girl were my own child, I should  decidedly set my face against this marriage; but as she is only my stepdaughter,  I wash my hands of all responsibility in the matter. &lsquo;Marry the man you have  chosen, my dear,&rsquo; say I; &lsquo;all I ask is, that you don&rsquo;t marry him until he can  give you a comfortable home.&rsquo; &lsquo;Very well, papa,&rsquo; says my young lady in her most  dutiful manner, and &lsquo;Very well, sir,&rsquo; says my young gentleman; and they both  declare themselves agreeable to any amount of delay, provided the marriage  comes off some time between this and doomsday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo; asked Nancy, rather at a loss to  understand why Philip Sheldon, the closest and most reserved of men, should  happen to be so confidential to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Nancy, what I want to prevent is any  underhand work. I know what very limited notions of honour young men are apt to  entertain nowadays, and how intensely foolish a boarding-school miss can be on  occasion. I don&rsquo;t want these young people to run off to Gretna-green some fine  morning, or to steal a march upon me by getting married on the sly at some  out-of-the-way church, after having invested their united fortunes in the  purchase of a special license. In plain words, I distrust Miss Halliday&rsquo;s  lover, and I distrust Miss Halliday&rsquo;s common sense; and I want to have a  sensible, sharp-eyed person in the house always on the look-out for any kind of  danger, and able to protect my stepdaughter&rsquo;s interests as well as my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the young lady&rsquo;s mamma, sir &mdash; she would look  after her daughter, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her mamma is foolishly indulgent, and about as  capable of taking care of her daughter as of sitting in Parliament. You  remember pretty Georgy Cradock, and you must know what she was &mdash; and what she  is. Mrs. Sheldon is the same woman as Georgy Cradock &mdash; a little older, and a  little more plump and rosy; but just as pretty, and just as useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interview was prolonged for some little time  after this, and it ended in a thorough understanding between Mr. Sheldon and  his old servant. Nancy Woolper was to re-enter that gentleman&rsquo;s service, and  over and above all ordinary duties, she was to undertake the duty of keeping a close  watch upon all the movements of Charlotte Halliday. In plain words, she was to  be a spy, a private detective, so far as this young lady was concerned; but Mr.  Sheldon was too wise to put his requirements into plain words, knowing that  even in the hour of her extremity Nancy Woolper would have refused to fill such  an office had she clearly understood the measure of its infamy.</p>
<p>Upon the day that followed his interview with Mrs.  Woolper, the stockbroker came home from the City an hour or two earlier than his  custom, and startled Miss Halliday by appearing in the garden where she was  walking alone, looking her brightest and prettiest in her dark winter hat and  jacket, and pacing briskly to and fro among the bare frost-bound patches of  earth that had once been flower-beds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wan&rsquo;t a few minutes&rsquo; quiet talk with you,  Lotta,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come into my study, where we&rsquo;re pretty  sure not to be interrupted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl blushed crimson as she acceded to this  request, being assured that Mr. Sheldon was going to discuss her matrimonial  engagement. Valentine had told her of that very satisfactory interview in the  dining-room, and from that time she had been trying to find an opportunity for  the acknowledgment of her stepfather&rsquo;s generosity. As yet the occasion had not  arisen. She did not know how to frame her thanksgiving, and she shrank shyly  from telling Mr. Sheldon how grateful she was to him for the liberality of mind  which had distinguished his conduct in this affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really ought to thank him,&rdquo; she said to herself  more than once. &ldquo;I was quite prepared for his doing his uttermost to prevent my  marriage with Valentine; and instead of that, he volunteers his consent, and  even promises to give us a fortune. &lsquo;I am bound to thank him for such generous  kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps there is no task more difficult than to  offer grateful tribute to a person whom one has been apt to think of with a  feeling very near akin to dislike. Ever since her mother&rsquo;s second marriage  Charlotte had striven against an instinctive distaste for Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s  society, and an innate distrust of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s affectionate regard for  herself; but now that he had proved his sincerity in this most important crisis  of her life, she awoke all at once to the sense of the wrong she had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am always reading the Sermon on the Mount, and  yet in my thoughts about Mr. Sheldon I have never been able to remember those  words, &lsquo;Judge not, that ye be not judged.&rsquo; His kindness touches me to the very  heart, and I feel it all the more keenly because of my injustice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She followed her stepfather into the prim little  study. There was no fire, and the room was colder than a vault on this bleak  December day. Charlotte shivered, and drew her jacket more tightly across her  chest as she perched herself on one of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s shining red morocco  chairs. &ldquo;The room strikes cold,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;very, very cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this there was a brief pause, during which  Mr. Sheldon took some papers from the pocket of his overcoat, and arranged them  on his desk with an absent manner, as if he were rather deliberating upon what  he was going to say than thinking of what he was doing. While he loitered thus  Charlotte found courage to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to thank you, Mr. Sheldon &mdash; papa,&rdquo; she  said, pronouncing the &ldquo;papa&rdquo; with some slight appearance of effort, in spite of  her desire to be grateful: &ldquo;I &mdash; I have been wishing to thank you for the last  day or two; only it seems so difficult sometimes to express one&rsquo;s self about  these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not deserve or wish for your thanks, my dear.  I have only done my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, indeed, you do deserve my thanks, and you  have them in all sincerity, papa. You have been very, very good to me &mdash; about &mdash;  about Valentine. I thought you would be sure to oppose our marriage on the  ground of imprudence, you know, and &mdash; &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do oppose your marriage in the present on the  ground of imprudence, and I am only consentient to it in the future on the  condition that Mr. Hawkehurst shall have secured a comfortable income by his  literary labours. He seems to be clever, and he promises fairly &mdash; &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes indeed, dear papa,&rdquo; cried the girl, pleased  by this meed of praise for her lover; &ldquo;he is more than clever. I am sure you  would say so if you had time to read his article on Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute; in the <em>Cheapside</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay it&rsquo;s very good, my dear; but I don&rsquo;t  care for Madame de
  S&eacute;vign&eacute; &mdash; &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or his sketch of Bossuet&rsquo;s career in the <em>Charing Cross</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, I do not even know who Bossuet was.  All I require from Mr. Hawkehurst is, that he shall earn a good income before  he takes you away from this house. You have been accustomed to a certain style  of living, and I cannot allow you to encounter a life of poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear papa, I am not in the least afraid of  poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay not, my dear. You have never been poor,&rdquo;  replied Mr. Sheldon, coolly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I am as much afraid of a  rattlesnake as the poor wretches who are accustomed to see one swinging by his  tail from the branch of a tree any day in the course of their travels. I have  only a vague idea that a cobra de capello is an unpleasant customer; but depend  upon it, those foreign fellows feel their blood stagnate and turn to ice at  sight of the cold slimy-looking monster. Poverty and I travelled the same road  once, and I know what the gentleman is. I don&rsquo;t want to meet him again.&rdquo; Mr.  Sheldon lapsed into silence after this. His last words had been spoken to  himself rather than to Charlotte, and the thoughts that accompanied them seemed  far from pleasant to him.</p>
<p>Charlotte sat opposite her stepfather, patiently  awaiting his pleasure. She looked at the gaudily-bound books behind the glass  doors, and wondered whether any one had ever opened any of the volumes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to read dear Sir Walter&rsquo;s stories  once more,&rdquo; she thought; &ldquo;there never, never was so sweet a romance as the  &lsquo;Bride of Lammermoor,&rsquo; and I cannot imagine that one could ever grow weary of  reading it. But to ask Mr. Sheldon for the key of that bookcase would be quite  impossible. I think his books must be copies of special editions, not meant to  be read. I wonder whether they are real books, or only upholsterer&rsquo;s dummies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then her fancies went vagabondising off to that  little archetype of a cottage on the heights of Wimbledon-common, in which she  and Valentine were to live when they were married. She was always furnishing  and refurnishing this cottage, building it up and pulling it down, as the  caprice of the moment dictated. Now it had bow-windows and white stuccoed walls  &mdash; now it was Elizabethan &mdash; now the simplest, quaintest, rose-embowered  cottager&rsquo;s dwelling, with diamond-paned casements, and deep thatch on the old  gray roof. This afternoon she amused herself by collecting a small library for  Valentine, while waiting Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s next observation. He was to have all her  favourite books, of course; and they were to be bound in the prettiest, most  girlish bindings. She could see the dainty volumes, primly ranged on the little  carved oak bookcase, which Valentine was to &ldquo;pick up&rdquo; in Wardour-street. She  fancied herself walking down that mart of bric-a-brac arm-in-arm with her  lover, intent on &ldquo;picking up.&rdquo; Ah, what happiness! what dear delight in the  thought! And O, of all the bright dreams we dream, how few are realised upon  this earth! Do they find their fulfilment in heaven, those visions of perfect  bliss?</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon looked up from his desk at last. Miss  Halliday remarked to herself that his face was pale and haggard in the chill  wintry sunlight; but she knew how hard and self-denying a life he led in his  stern devotion to business, and she was in no manner surprised to see him  looking ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to say a few words to you on a matter of  business, Lotta,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;and I must ask you to give me all your attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do so with pleasure, papa, but I am awfully  stupid about business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do my best to make matters simple. I  suppose you know what money your father left, including the sums his life had  been insured for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have heard mamma say it was eighteen  thousand pounds. I do so hate the idea of those insurances. It seems like the  price of a man&rsquo;s life, doesn&rsquo;t it? I daresay that is a very unbusiness-like way  of considering the question, but I cannot bear to think that we got money by  dear papa&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These remarks were too trivial for Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s  notice. He went on with what he had to say in the cold hard voice that was  familiar to his clerks and to the buyers and sellers of shares and stock who  had dealings with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father left eighteen thousand pounds; that  amount was left to your mother without reservation. When she married me,  without any settlement, that money became mine, in point of law &mdash; mine to  squander or make away with as I pleased. You know that I have made good use of  that money, and that your mother has had no reason to repent her confidence in my  honour and honesty. The time has now come in which that honour will be put to a  sharper test. You have no legal claim on so much as a shilling of your father&rsquo;s  fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, Mr. Sheldon,&rdquo; cried Charlotte,  eagerly, &ldquo;and Valentine knows also; and, believe me, I do not expect &mdash; &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to settle matters with my own conscience as  well as with your expectations, my dear Lotta,&rdquo; Mr. Sheldon said, solemnly.  &ldquo;Your father left you unprovided for; but as a man of honour I feel myself  bound to take care that you shall not suffer by his want of caution. I have  therefore prepared a deed of gift, by which I transfer to you five thousand  pounds, now invested in Unitas Bank shares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to give me five thousand pounds!&rdquo;  cried Charlotte, astounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without reservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to say that you will give me this fortune  when I marry, papa?&rdquo; said Charlotte, interrogatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall give it to you immediately,&rdquo; replied Mr.  Sheldon. &ldquo;I wish you to be thoroughly independent of me and my pleasure. You  will then understand, that if I insist upon the prudence of delay, I do so in  your interest and not in my own. I wish you to feel that if I am a hindrance to  your immediate marriage, it is not because I wish to delay the disbursement of  your dowry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Mr. Sheldon, O, papa, you are more than  generous &mdash; you are noble! It is not that I care for the money. O, believe me,  there is no one in the world who could care less for that than I do. But your  thoughtful kindness, your generosity, touches me to the very heart. O, please  let me kiss you, just as if you were my own dear father come back to life to  protect and guide me. I have thought you cold and worldly. I have done you so  much wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran to him, and wound her arms about his neck  before he could put her off, and lifted up her pretty rosy mouth to his dry hot  lips. Her heart was overflowing with generous emotion, her face beamed with a  happy smile. She was so pleased to find her mother&rsquo;s husband better than she  had thought him. But, to her supreme astonishment, he thrust her from him  roughly, almost violently, and looking up at his face she saw it darkened by a  blacker shadow than she had ever seen upon it before. Anger, terror, pain,  remorse, she knew not what, but an expression so horrible that she shrunk from  him with a sense of alarm, and went back to her chair, bewildered and  trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You frightened me, Mr. Sheldon,&rdquo; she said faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than you frightened me,&rdquo; answered the  stockbroker, walking to the window and taking his stand there, with his face  hidden from Charlotte. &ldquo;I did not know there was so much feeling in me. For  God&rsquo;s sake, let us have no sentiment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you angry with me just now?&rdquo; asked the girl,  falteringly, utterly at a loss to comprehend the change in her stepfather&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was not angry. I am not accustomed to these  strong emotions,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sheldon, huskily; &ldquo;I cannot stand them. Pray let  us avoid all sentimental discussion. I am anxious to do my duty in a  straightforward, business-like way. I don&rsquo;t want gratitude &mdash; or fuss. The five  thousand pounds are yours, and I am pleased to find you consider the amount  sufficient. And now I have only one small favour to ask of you in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be very ungrateful if I refused to do  anything you may ask,&rdquo; said Charlotte, who could not help feeling a little  chilled and disappointed by Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s stony rejection of her gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter is very simple. You are young, and  have, in the usual course of things, a long life before you. But &mdash; you know  there is always a &lsquo;but&rsquo; in these cases &mdash; a railway accident &mdash; a little  carelessness in passing your drawing-room fire some evening when you are  dressed in flimsy gauze or muslin &mdash; a fever &mdash; a cold &mdash; any one of the many  dangers that lie in wait for all of us, and our best calculations are  falsified. If you were to marry and die childless, that money would go to your  husband, and neither your mother nor I would ever touch a sixpence of it. Now  as the money, practically, belongs to your mother, I consider that this contingency  should be provided against &mdash; in her interests as well as in mine. In plain  words, I want you to make a will leaving that money to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite ready to do so,&rdquo; replied Charlotte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, my dear. I felt assured that you would  take a sensible view of the matter. If you marry your dear Mr. Hawkehurst, have  a family by-and-by, we will throw the old will into the fire and make a new  one; but in the mean time it&rsquo;s just as well to be on the safe side. You shall  go into the City with me to-morrow morning, and shall execute the will at my  office. It will be the simplest document possible &mdash; as simple as the will made  by old Serjeant Crane, in which he disposed of half a million of money in half  a dozen lines &mdash; at the rate of five thousand pounds per word. After we&rsquo;ve  settled that little matter, we can arrange the transfer of the shares. The  whole affair won&rsquo;t occupy an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do whatever you wish,&rdquo; said Charlotte,  meekly. She was not at all elated by the idea of coming suddenly into  possession of five thousand pounds; but she was very much impressed by the new  view of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s character afforded her by his conduct of to-day. And then  her thoughts, constant to one point as the needle to the pole, reverted to her  lover, and she began to think of the effect her fortune might have upon his  prospects. He might go to the bar, he might work and study in pleasant Temple  chambers, with wide area windows overlooking the river, and read law-books in  the evening at the Wimbledon cottage for a few delightful years, at the end of  which he would of course become Lord Chancellor. That he should devote such  intellect and consecrate such genius as his to the service of his country&rsquo;s  law-courts, and <em>not</em> ultimately seat  himself on the Woolsack, was a contingency not to be imagined by Miss Halliday.  Ah, what would not five thousand pounds buy for him! The cottage expanded into  a mansion, the little case of books developed into a library second only to  that of the Duc d&rsquo;Aumale, a noble steed waited at the glass door of the  vestibule to convey Mr. Hawkehurst to the Temple, before the minute-hand of Mr.  Sheldon&rsquo;s stern skeleton clock had passed from one figure to another: so great  an adept was this young lady in the art of castle-building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to tell mamma about this conversation?&rdquo; asked  Charlotte, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, I think not,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sheldon,  thoughtfully. &ldquo;These family arrangements cannot be kept too quiet. Your mamma  is a talking person, you know, Charlotte; and as we don&rsquo;t want every one in  this part of Bayswater to know the precise amount of your fortune, we may as  well let matters rest as they are. Of course you would not wish Mr. Hawkehurst  to be enlightened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For several reasons. First and foremost, it must  be pleasant to you to be sure that he is thoroughly disinterested. I have told  him that you will get something as a gift from me; but he may have implied that  the something would be little more than a couple of hundreds to furnish a  house. Secondly, it must be remembered, that he has been brought up in a bad  school, and the best way to make him self-reliant and industrious is to let him  think he has nothing but his own industry to depend upon. I have set him a  task. When he has accomplished that, he shall have you and your five thousand  pounds to boot. Till then I should strongly advise you to keep this business a  secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Charlotte, meditatively; &ldquo;I think  you are right. It would have been very nice to tell him of your kindness; but I  want to be quite sure that he loves me for myself alone &mdash; from first to last &mdash;  without one thought of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is wise,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon, decisively; and  thus ended the interview.</p>
<p>Charlotte accompanied her stepfather to the city  early next morning, and filled in the blanks in a lithographed form, prepared  for the convenience of such testators as, being about to dispose of their  property, do not care to employ the services of a legal adviser.</p>
<p>The will seemed to Charlotte the simplest possible  affair. She bequeathed all her property, real and personal, to Philip Sheldon,  without reserve. But as her entire fortune consisted of the five thousand  pounds just given her by that gentleman, and as her personal property was  comprised in a few pretty dresses and trinkets, and desks and workboxes, she  could not very well object to such an arrangement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, mamma would have all my books and  caskets, and boxes and things,&rdquo; she said thoughtfully; &ldquo;and I should like Diana  Paget to have some of my jewellery, please, Mr. Sheldon. Mamma has plenty, you  know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no occasion to talk of that, Charlotte,&rdquo;  replied the stockbroker. &ldquo;This will is only a matter of form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon omitted to inform his stepdaughter that  the instrument just executed would, upon her wedding-day, become so much waste  paper, an omission that was not in harmony with the practical and careful  habits of that gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that it is only a form,&rdquo; replied  Charlotte; &ldquo;but, after making a will, one feels as if one was going to die. At  least I do. It seems a kind of preparation for death. I don&rsquo;t wonder people  rather dislike doing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only foolish people who dislike doing it,&rdquo;  said Mr. Sheldon, who was in his most practical mood to-day. &ldquo;And now we will  go and arrange a more agreeable business &mdash; the transfer of the shares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this, there was a little commercial juggling,  in the form of signing and countersigning, which, was quite beyond Charlotte&rsquo;s  comprehension: which operation being completed, she was told that she was owner  of five thousand pounds in Unitas Bank shares, and that the dividends accruing  from time to time on those shares would be hers to dispose of as she pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The income arising from your capital will be more  than you can spend so long as you remain under my roof,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon. &ldquo;I  should therefore strongly recommend you to invest your dividends as they arise,  and thus increase your capital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are so kind and thoughtful,&rdquo; murmured  Charlotte; &ldquo;I shall always be pleased to take your advice.&rdquo; She was strongly  impressed by the kindness of the man her thoughts had wronged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How difficult it is to understand these reserved,  matter-of-fact people!&rdquo; she said to herself. Because my stepfather does not  talk sentiment, I have fancied him hard and worldly; and yet he has proved  himself as capable of doing a noble action as if he were the most poetical of  mankind.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheldon had been told that Charlotte was going  into the City to choose a new watch, wherewith to replace the ill-used little  Geneva toy that had been her delight as a schoolgirl; and as Charlotte brought  home a neat little English-made chronometer from a renowned emporium on  Ludgate-hill, the simple matron accepted this explanation in all good faith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure, Lotta, you must confess your stepfather  is kindness itself in most matters,&rdquo; said Georgy, after an admiring examination  of the new watch. &ldquo;When I think how kindly he has taken this business about Mr.  Hawkehurst, and how disinterested he has proved himself in his ideas about your  marriage, I really am inclined to think him the best of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Georgy said this with an air of triumph. She could  not forget that there were people in Barlingford who had said hard things about  Philip Sheldon, and had prophesied unutterable miseries for herself and her  daughter as the bitter consequence of the imprudence she had been guilty of in  her second marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has indeed been very good, mamma,&rdquo; Charlotte  replied gravely, &ldquo;and, believe me, I am truly grateful. He does not like fuss  or sentiment; but I hope he knows that I appreciate his kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter37"></a>Chapter 37<br>
  Riding The High Horse</h2>
<p>Never, in his brightest dreams, had Valentine  Hawkehurst imagined the stream of life so fair and sunny a river as it seemed  to him now. Fortune had treated him so scurvily for seven-and-twenty years of  his life, only to relent of a sudden and fling all her choicest gifts into his  lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be the prince in the fairy tale who begins  life as a revolting animal of the rhinoceros family, and ends by marrying the  prettiest princess in Elfindom,&rdquo; he said to himself gaily, as he paced the  broad walks of Kensington-gardens, where the bare trees swung their big black  branches in the wintry blast, and the rooks cawed their loudest at close of the  brief day.</p>
<p>What, indeed, could this young adventurer demand  from benignant Fortune above and beyond the blessings she had given him? The  favoured suitor of the fairest and brightest woman he had ever looked upon,  received by her kindred, admitted to her presence, and only bidden to serve a  due apprenticeship before he claimed her as his own for ever. What more could  he wish? what further boon could he implore from the Fates?</p>
<p>Yes, there was one thing more &mdash; one thing for which  Mr. Hawkehurst pined, while most thankful for his many blessings. He wanted a  decent excuse for separating himself most completely from Horatio Paget. He  wanted to shake himself free from all the associations of his previous  existence. He wanted to pass through the waters of Jordan, and to emerge  purified, regenerate, leaving his garments on the furthermost side of the  river; and, with all other things appertaining to the past, he would fain have  rid himself of Captain Paget.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Be sure your sin will find you out,&rsquo;&rdquo; mused the  young man; &ldquo;and having found you, be sure that it will stick to you like a  leech, if your sin takes the shape of an unprincipled acquaintance, as it does  in my case. I may try my hardest to cut the past, but will Horatio Paget let me  alone in the future? I doubt it. The bent of that man&rsquo;s genius shows itself in  his faculty for living upon other people. He knows that I am beginning to earn  money regularly, and has begun to borrow of me already. When I can earn more,  he will want to borrow more; and although it is very sweet to work for  Charlotte Halliday, it would not be by any means agreeable to slave for my  friend Paget. Shall I offer him a pound a week, and ask him to retire into the  depths of Wales or Cornwall, amend his ways, and live the life of a repentant  hermit? I think I could bring myself to sacrifice the weekly sovereign, if  there were any hope that Horatio Paget could cease to be &mdash; Horatio Paget, on  this side the grave. No, I have the misfortune to be intimately acquainted with  the gentleman. When he is in the swim, as he calls it, and is earning money on  his own account, he will give himself cosy little dinners and four-and-sixpenny  primrose gloves; and when he is down on his luck, he will come whining to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was by no means a pleasant idea to Mr.  Hawkehurst. In the old days he had been distinguished by all the Bohemian&rsquo;s  recklessness, and even more than the Bohemian&rsquo;s generosity in his dealings with  friend or companion. But now all was changed. He was no longer reckless. A  certain result was demanded from him as the price of Charlotte Halliday&rsquo;s hand,  and he set himself to accomplish his allotted task with all due forethought and  earnestness of purpose. He had need even to exercise restraint over himself,  lest, in his eagerness, he should do too much, and so lay himself prostrate  from the ill effects of overwork; so anxious was he to push on upon the road  whose goal was so fair a temple, so light seemed that labour of love which was  performed for the sake of Charlotte.</p>
<p>He communed with himself very often on the subject  of that troublesome question about Captain Paget. How was he to sever his frail  skiff from that rakish privateer? What excuse could he find for renouncing his  share in the Omega-street lodgings, and setting up a new home elsewhere?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Policy might prompt me to keep my worthy friend  under my eye,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;in order that I may be sure there is no  underhand work going on between him and Philip Sheldon. But I can scarcely  believe that Philip Sheldon has any inkling about the Haygarthian fortune. If  he had, he would surely not receive me as Charlotte&rsquo;s suitor. What possible  motive could he have for doing so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a question which Mr. Hawkehurst had  frequently put to himself; for his confidence in Mr. Sheldon was not of that  kind which asks no questions. Even while most anxious to believe in that  gentleman&rsquo;s honesty of purpose, he was troubled by occasional twinges of  unbelief.</p>
<p>During the period which had elapsed since his  return from Yorkshire, he had been able to discover nothing of any sinister  import from the proceedings of Captain Paget. That gentleman appeared to be  still engaged upon the promoting business, although by no means so profitably  as heretofore. He went into the City every day, and came home in the evening  toilworn and out of spirits. He talked freely of his occupation &mdash; how he had  done much or done nothing, during the day; and Valentine was at a loss to  perceive any further ground for the suspicion that had arisen in his mind after  the meeting at the Ullerton station, and the shuffling of the sanctimonious  Goodge with regard to Mrs. Rebecca Haygarth&rsquo;s letters.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst therefore determined upon boldly  cutting the knot that tied him to the familiar companion of his wanderings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tired of watching and suspecting,&rdquo; he said to  himself. &ldquo;If my dear love has a right to this fortune, it will surely come to  her; or if it should never come, we can live very happily without it. Indeed,  for my own part, I am inclined to believe that I should be prouder and happier  as the husband of a dowerless wife, than as prince-consort to the heiress of  the Haygarths. We have built up such a dear, cheery, unpretentious home for  ourselves in our talk of the future, that I doubt if we should care to change  it for the stateliest mansion in Kensington Palace-gardens or Belgrave-square.  My darling could not be my housekeeper, and make lemon cheese-cakes in her own  pretty little kitchen, if we lived in Belgrave-square; and how could she stand  at one of those great Birmingham ironwork gates in the Palace-gardens to watch  me ride away to my work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To a man as deeply in love as Mr. Hawkehurst, the  sordid dross which other people prize so highly is apt to become daily more  indifferent; a kind of colour-blindness comes over the vision of the true  lover, and the glittering yellow ore seems only so much vulgar earth, too mean  a thing to be regarded by any but the mean of soul. Thus it was that Mr.  Hawkehurst relaxed his suspicion of Captain Paget, and neglected his patron and  ally of Gray&rsquo;s Inn, much to the annoyance of that gentleman, who tormented the  young man with little notes demanding interviews.</p>
<p>These interviews had of late been far from  agreeable to either of the allies. George Sheldon urged the necessity of an  immediate marriage; Valentine declined to act in an underhand manner, after the  stockbroker&rsquo;s unexpected generosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Generosity!&rdquo; echoed George Sheldon, when Valentine  had given him this point-blank refusal at the close of a stormy argument.  &ldquo;Generosity! My brother Phil&rsquo;s generosity! Egad, that is about the best thing  I&rsquo;ve heard for the last ten years. If I pleased, Mr. Valentine Hawkehurst, I  could tell you something about my brother which would enable you to estimate  his generosity at its true value. But I don&rsquo;t please; and if you choose to run  counter to me and my interests, you must pay the price of your folly. You may  think yourself uncommonly lucky if the price isn&rsquo;t a stiff one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am prepared to abide by my decision,&rdquo; answered  Valentine. &ldquo;Miss Halliday without a shilling is so dear to me, that I don&rsquo;t  care to commit a dishonourable action in order to secure my share of the  fortune she may claim. I turned over a new leaf on the day when I first knew  myself possessed of her affection. I don&rsquo;t want to go back to the old leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Sheldon gave himself an impatient shrug. &ldquo;I  have heard of a great many fools,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I never heard of a fool who  would play fast-and-loose with a hundred thousand pounds, and until to-day I  couldn&rsquo;t have believed there was such an animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst did not deign to notice this remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do be reasonable, Sheldon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You ask me  to do what my sense of right will not permit me to do, and you ask me that  which I fully believe to be impossible. I cannot for a moment imagine that any  persuasion of mine would induce Charlotte to consent to a secret marriage,  after your brother&rsquo;s fair and liberal conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; cried George, with savage  impatience; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my brother Phil all over. He is so honourable, so plain and  straightforward in all his dealings, that he would get the best of Lucifer  himself in a bargain. I tell you, Hawkehurst, you don&rsquo;t know how deep he is &mdash;  as deep as the bottomless pit, by Jove! His very generosity makes me all the  more afraid of him. I don&rsquo;t understand his game. If he consented to your  marriage in order to get rid of Charlotte, he would let you marry her off-hand;  but instead of doing that, he makes conditions which must delay your marriage  for years. There is the point that bothers me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better pursue your own course, without  reference to me or my marriage with Miss Halliday,&rdquo; said Valentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is exactly what I must do. I can&rsquo;t leave the  Haygarth estate to the mercy of Tom, Dick, and Harry, while you try to earn  thirty pounds a month by scribbling for the magazines. I must make my bargain  with Philip instead of with you, and I can tell you that you&rsquo;ll be the loser by  the transaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. You see, you don&rsquo;t quite understand  my brother Phil. If this money gets into his hands, be sure some of it will  stick to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should the money get into his hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, so long as Charlotte Halliday is under  his roof, she is, to a certain extent, under his authority. And then, I tell  you again, there is no calculating the depth of that man. He has thrown dust in  your eyes already. He will make that poor girl believe him the most  disinterested of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can warn her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; as I have warned you. To what purpose? You  are inclined to believe in Phil rather than to believe in me, and you will be  so inclined to the end of the chapter. You remember that man Palmer, at Rugely,  who used to go to church, and take the sacrament?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; of course I remember that case. What of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, people believed in him, you know, and thought  him a jolly good fellow, up to the time when they discovered that he had  poisoned a few of his friends in a quiet gentlemanly way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst smiled at the irrelevance of this  remark. He could not perceive the connection of ideas between Palmer the Rugely  poisoner, and Philip Sheldon the stockbroker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was an extreme case,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; of course that was an extreme case,&rdquo; answered  George, carelessly. &ldquo;Only it goes far to prove that a man may be gifted with a  remarkable genius for throwing dust in the eyes of his fellow-creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no further disputation between the lawyer  and Valentine. George Sheldon began to understand that a secret marriage was  not to be accomplished in the present position of affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am half inclined to suspect that Phil knows  something about that money,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;and is playing some artful  game of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case your better policy would be to take  the initiative,&rdquo; answered Valentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no other course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will Charlotte know &mdash; will she know that I  have been concerned in this business?&rdquo; asked Valentine, growing very pale all  of sudden. He was thinking how mean he must appear in Miss Halliday&rsquo;s eyes, if  she came to understand that he had known her to be John Haygarth&rsquo;s heiress at  the time he won from her the sweet confession of her love. &ldquo;Will she ever believe  how pure and true my love has been, if she comes to know this?&rdquo; he asked  himself despairingly, while George Sheldon deliberated in silence for a few  moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She need know nothing until the business comes to  a head,&rdquo; replied George at last. &ldquo;You see, there may be no resistance on the  part of the Crown lawyers; and, in that case, Miss Halliday will get her rights  after a moderate amount of delay. But if they choose to dispute her claim, it  will be quite another thing &mdash; Halliday <em>versus</em> the Queen, and so on &mdash; with no end of swell Q.C.&rsquo;s against us. In the latter  case you&rsquo;ll have to put all your adventures at Ullerton and Huxter&rsquo;s Cross into  an affidavit, and Miss H. must know everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and then she will think &mdash; ah, no; I do not  believe she can misunderstand me, come what may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All doubt and difficulty might be avoided if you  would manage a marriage on the quiet off-hand,&rdquo; said George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you again that I cannot do that; and that,  even if it were possible, I would not attempt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it. You elect to ride the high horse; take  care that magnificent animal doesn&rsquo;t give you an ugly tumble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can take my chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I must take my chance against that brother of  mine. The winning cards are all in my own hand this time, and it will be uncommonly  hard if he gets the best of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this the two gentlemen parted. Valentine went to  look at a bachelor&rsquo;s lodging in the neighbourhood of the Edgeware-road, which  he had seen advertised in that morning&rsquo;s Times; and George Sheldon started for  Bayswater, where he was always sure of a dinner and a liberal allowance of good  wine from the hospitality of his prosperous kinsman.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter38"></a>Chapter 38<br>
  Mr. Sheldon Is Prudent</h2>
<p>Valentine found the apartments near the  Edgeware-road in every manner eligible. The situation was midway between his  reading-room in Great Russell-street and the abode of his delight &mdash; a half-way  house on the road between business and pleasure. The terms were very moderate,  the rooms airy and pleasant; so he engaged them forthwith, his tenancy to commence  at the end of the following week; and having settled this matter, he went back  to Omega-street, bent on dissolving partnership with the Captain in a civil but  decided manner.</p>
<p>A surprise, and a very agreeable one, awaited him  at Chelsea. He found the sitting-room strewn with Captain Paget&rsquo;s personal  property, and the Captain on his knees before a portmanteau, packing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just in time to give me a hand, Val,&rdquo; he  said in his most agreeable manner. &ldquo;I begin to find out my age when I put my  poor old bones into abnormal attitudes. I daresay packing a trunk or two will  be only child&rsquo;s-play to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pack half a dozen trunks if you like,&rdquo;  replied Valentine. &ldquo;But what is the meaning of this sudden move? I did not know  you were going to leave town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did I when you and I breakfasted together.  I got an unexpected offer of a very decent position abroad this morning; a kind  of agency, that will be much better than the hand-to-mouth business I&rsquo;ve been  doing lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of agency, and where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so far as I can make out at present, it is  something in the steam navigation way. My head-quarters will be at Rouen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rouen! Well, it&rsquo;s a pleasant lively old city  enough, and as medi&aelig;val as one of Sir Walter&rsquo;s novels, provided they haven&rsquo;t  Haussmanised it by this time. I am very glad to hear you have secured a  comfortable berth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am not sorry to leave England, Val,&rdquo;  answered the Captain, in rather a mournful tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I think it&rsquo;s time you and I parted  company. Our association begins to be rather disadvantageous to you, Val. We&rsquo;ve  had our ups and downs together, and we&rsquo;ve got on very pleasantly, take it for  all in all. But now that you&rsquo;re settling down as a literary man, engaged to  that young woman, hand-in-glove with Philip Sheldon, and so on, I think it&rsquo;s  time for me to take myself off. I&rsquo;m not wanted; and sooner or later I should  begin to feel myself in the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain grew quite pathetic as he said this;  and little pangs of remorse shot through Valentine&rsquo;s heart as he remembered how  eager he had been to rid himself of this Old Man of the Mountain. And here was  the poor old creature offering to take himself out of the way of his own  accord.</p>
<p>Influenced by this touch of remorse, Mr. Hawkehurst  held out his hand, and grasped that of his comrade and patron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you may do well, in some &mdash; comfortable kind  of business,&rdquo; he said heartily. That adjective &ldquo;comfortable&rdquo; was a hasty  substitute for the adjective &ldquo;honest,&rdquo; which had been almost on his lips as he  uttered his friendly wish. He was too well disposed to all the world not to  feel profound pity for this white-headed old man, who for so many years had  eaten the bread of rogues and scoundrels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he cried cheerily, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take all the  packing off your hands, Captain; and we&rsquo;ll eat our last dinner and drink our  last bottle of sparkling together at my expense, at any place you please to  name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say Blanchard&rsquo;s,&rdquo; replied Horatio Paget. &ldquo;I like a  corner-window, looking out upon the glare and bustle of Regent-street. It reminds  one just a little of the Maison Dor&eacute;e and the boulevard. We&rsquo;ll drink Charlotte  Halliday&rsquo;s health, Val, in bumpers. She&rsquo;s a charming young person, and I only  wish she were an heiress, for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes of the two men met as the Captain said this;  and there was a twinkle in the cold gray orbs of that gentleman which had a  very unpleasant effect upon Valentine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What treachery is he engaged in now?&rdquo; he asked  himself. &ldquo;I know that look in my Horatio&rsquo;s eyes; and I know it always means  mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Sheldon made his appearance at the Lawn five  minutes after his brother came home from the City. He entered the domestic  circle in his usual free-and-easy manner, knowing himself to be endured, rather  than liked, by the two ladies, and to be only tolerated as a necessary evil by  the master of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve dropped in to eat a chop with you, Phil,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;in order to get an hour&rsquo;s comfortable talk after dinner. There&rsquo;s no  saying half a dozen consecutive words to you in the City, where your clerks seem  to spend their lives in bouncing in upon you when you don&rsquo;t want them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was very little talk during dinner. Charlotte  and her stepfather were thoughtful. Diana was chiefly employed in listening to  the <em>sotto voce</em> inanities of Mrs.  Sheldon, for whom the girl showed herself admirably patient. Her forbearance  and gentleness towards Georgy constituted a kind of penitential sacrifice, by  which she hoped to atone for the dark thoughts and bitter feelings that  possessed her mind during those miserable hours in which she was obliged to  witness the happiness of Charlotte and her lover.</p>
<p>George Sheldon devoted himself chiefly to his  dinner and a certain dry sherry, which he particularly affected. He was a man  who would have dined and enjoyed himself at the table of Judas Iscariot,  knowing the banquet to be provided out of the thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as good a pheasant as I ever ate, Phil,&rdquo; he  said, after winding up with the second leg of the bird in question. &ldquo;No,  Georgy; no macaroni, thanks. I don&rsquo;t care about kickshaws after a good dinner.  Has Hawkehurst dined with you lately, by the way, Phil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte blushed red as the holly-berries that  decorated the chandelier. It was Christmas-eve, and her own fair hands had  helped to bedeck the rooms with festal garlands of evergreen and holly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He dines with us to-morrow,&rdquo; replied the  stockbroker. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come, I suppose, as usual, George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I shall be very glad, if I&rsquo;m not in the  way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Sheldon murmured some conventional  protestation of the unfailing delight afforded to her by George&rsquo;s society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;re always glad to see you,&rdquo; said  Philip in his most genial manner; &ldquo;and now, if you&rsquo;ve anything to say to me  about business, the sooner you begin the better. &mdash; You and the girls needn&rsquo;t  stay for dessert, Georgy. Almonds and raisins can&rsquo;t be much of a novelty to  you; and as none of you take any wine, there&rsquo;s not much to stop for. George and  I will come in to tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ladies departed, by no means sorry to return to  their Berlin-wool and piano. Diana took up her work with that saintly patience  with which she performed all the duties of her position; and Charlotte seated  herself before the piano, and began to play little bits of waltzes, and odds  and ends of polkas, in a dreamy mood, and with a slurring over of dominant bass  notes, which would have been torture to a musician&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>She was wondering whether Valentine would call that  evening, Christmas-eve &mdash; a sort of occasion for congratulation of some kind  from her lover, she fancied. It was the first Christmas-eve on which she had  been &ldquo;engaged.&rdquo; She looked back to the same period last year, and remembered  herself sitting in that very room strumming on that very piano, and unconscious  that there was such a creature as Valentine Hawkehurst upon this earth. And,  strange to say, even in that benighted state, she had been tolerably happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, George,&rdquo; said Mr. Sheldon, when the brothers  had filled their glasses and planted their chairs on the opposite sides of the  hearth-rug, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the nature of this business that you want to talk about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is a business of considerable importance,  in which you are only indirectly concerned. The actual principal in the affair  is your stepdaughter, Miss Halliday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You know how you have always ridiculed my  fancy for hunting up heirs-at-law and all that kind of thing, and you know how  I have held on, hoping against hope, starting on a new scent when the old scent  failed, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have got a chance at last, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that I have, and a tolerably good one;  and I think you will own that it is rather extraordinary that my first lucky  hit should bring luck your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is to say, to my stepdaughter?&rdquo; remarked Mr.  Sheldon, without any appearance of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said George, somewhat disconcerted by  his brother&rsquo;s coolness. &ldquo;I have lately discovered that Miss Halliday is  entitled to a certain sum of money, and I pledge myself to put her in  possession of that money &mdash; on one condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That she executes a deed promising to give me half  of the amount she may recover by my agency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose she can recover it without your agency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I defy her to do. She does not even know that  she has any claim to the amount in question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure of that. Or even supposing she  knows nothing, do you think her friends are as ignorant as she is? Do you think  me such a very bad man of business as to remain all this time unaware of the  fact that my stepdaughter, Charlotte Halliday, is next of kin to the Rev. John  Haygarth, who died intestate, at Tilford Haven, in Kent, about a year ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a cannon-shot that almost knocked George  Sheldon off his chair; but after that first movement of surprise, he gave a  sigh, or almost a groan, expressive of resignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egad, Phil Sheldon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ought not to be  astonished at this. Knowing you as well as I do, I must have been a confounded  fool not to expect some kind of underhand work from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by underhand work?&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.  Sheldon. &ldquo;The same newspapers that were open to you were open to me, and I had  better opportunities for tracking my stepdaughter&rsquo;s direct descent from John  Haygarth&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you discover Miss Halliday&rsquo;s descent from  Matthew Haygarth?&rdquo; asked George, very meekly. He was quite crestfallen. He  began to feel that his brother would have the upper hand of him in this  business as in all other business of this world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my secret,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sheldon, with  agreeable tranquillity of manner. &ldquo;You have kept your secrets, and I shall keep  mine. Your policy has been the policy of distrust. Mine shall be the same. When  you were starting this affair, I offered to go into it with you &mdash; to advance  whatever money you needed, in a friendly manner. You declined my offer, and  chose to go in for the business on your own hook. You have made a very good  thing for yourself, no doubt; but you are not quite clever enough to keep me  altogether in the dark in a matter which concerns a member of my own family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said George, with a sigh, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where you  hold the winning cards. Miss Halliday is your ace of trumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, I shall know how to hold my  strength in reserve, and when to play my leading trump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how to collar my king,&rdquo; muttered George  between his set teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; exclaimed Philip presently, &ldquo;we may as well  discuss this matter in a friendly spirit. What do you mean to propose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only one proposition to make,&rdquo; answered the  lawyer, with decision. &ldquo;I hold every link of the chain of evidence, without  which Miss Halliday might as well be a native of the Fiji islands for any claim  she can assert to John Haygarth&rsquo;s estate. I am prepared to carry this matter  through; but I will only do it on the condition that I receive half the fortune  recovered from the Crown by Miss Halliday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very moderate demand, upon my word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay I shall be able to make my bargain with  Miss Halliday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sheldon; &ldquo;and I shall be able to get  that bargain set aside as illegal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt that. I have a deed of agreement drawn up  here which would hold water in any court of equity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And hereupon Mr. Sheldon the younger produced and  read aloud one of those dry as dust documents by which the legal business of  life is carried on. It was a deed to be executed by Charlotte Halliday,  spinster, of Bayswater, on the one part, and George Sheldon, solicitor, of  Gray&rsquo;s Inn, on the other part; and it gave to the said George Sheldon, as  securely as any deed can give anything, one half of any property, not now in  her possession or control, which the said Charlotte Halliday might obtain by  the agency of the above-mentioned George Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray, who is to find the costs for this  business?&rdquo; asked the stockbroker. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel by any means disposed to stake  my money on such a hazardous game. Who knows what other descendants of Matthew  Haygarth may be playing at hide-and-seek in the remotest corners of the earth,  ready to spring out upon us when we&rsquo;ve wasted a small fortune upon  law-proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t ask you to risk your money,&rdquo; replied  George, with sullen dignity. &ldquo;I have friends who will back me when they see  that agreement executed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, all you have to do is to alter  your half share to one-fifth, and I will undertake that Miss Halliday shall  sign the agreement before the week is out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One-fifth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear George. Twenty thousand pounds will  pay you very handsomely for your trouble. I cannot consent to Miss Halliday  ceding more than a fifth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fig for your consent! The girl is of age, and  can act upon her own hook. I shall go to Miss Halliday herself,&rdquo; exclaimed the  indignant lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no, you won&rsquo;t. You must know the danger of  running counter to me in this business. That agreement is all very well; but  there is no kind of document more easy to upset if one only goes about it in  the right way. Play your own game, and I will upset that agreement, as surely  as I turn this wine-glass bowl downwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s action and Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s look  expressed a determination which George knew how to estimate by the light of  past experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a hard thing to find you against me, after  the manner in which I have toiled and slaved for your stepdaughter&rsquo;s  interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am bound to hold my stepdaughter&rsquo;s interests  paramount over every consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, paramount over brotherly feeling and all that  sort of thing.
  I say that it is more than hard that you should be against me,
  considering the special circumstances and the manner in whichc
  I have kept my own counsel &mdash; &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will take a fifth share, or nothing, George,&rdquo;  said Mr. Sheldon, with a threatening contraction of his black brows. &ldquo;If I have  any difficulty in arranging matters with you, I will go into this affair  myself, and carry it through without your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I defy you to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better not defy me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray how much do you expect to get out of Miss  Halliday&rsquo;s fortune?&rdquo; demanded the aggravated George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my business,&rdquo; answered Philip. &ldquo;And now we  had better go into the drawing-room for our tea. O, by the bye, George,&rdquo; he  added, carelessly, &ldquo;as Miss Halliday is quite a child in all business matters,  she had better be treated like a child. I shall tell her that she has a claim  to a certain sum of money; but I shall not tell her what sum. Her  disappointment will be less in the event of a failure, if her expectations are  not large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are always so considerate, my dear Phil,&rdquo; said  George, with a malignant grin. &ldquo;May I ask how it is you have taken it into your  head to play the benevolent father in the matter of Valentine Hawkehurst and  Miss Halliday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can it signify to me whom my stepdaughter  marries?&rdquo; asked Philip, coolly. &ldquo;Of course I wish her well; but I will not have  the responsibility of controlling her choice. If this young man suits her, let  her marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially when he happens to suit <em>you</em> so remarkably well. I think I can  understand your tactics, Phil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must understand or misunderstand me, just as  you please. And now come to tea.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter39"></a>Chapter 39<br>
  Christmas Peace</h2>
<p>Valentine Hawkehurst did not make his appearance at  the Lawn on Christmas-eve. He devoted that evening to the service of his old  ally. He performed all friendly offices for the departing Captain, dined with  him very pleasantly in Regent-street, and accompanied him to the London-bridge  terminus, where he beheld the voyager comfortably seated in a second-class  carriage of the night-train for Newhaven.</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst had seen the Captain take a through  ticket for Rouen, and he saw the train leave the terminus. This he held to be  ocular demonstration of the fact that Captain Paget was really going to the  Gallic Manchester.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sort of customer is so uncommonly slippery,&rdquo;  the young man said to himself as he left the station; &ldquo;nothing but the evidence  of my own eyes would have convinced me of my friend&rsquo;s departure. How pure and  fresh the London atmosphere seems now that the perfume of Horatio Paget is out  of it! I wonder what he is going to do at Rouen? Very little good, I daresay.  But why should I wonder about him, or trouble myself about him? He is gone, and  I have set myself free from the trammels of the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The next day was Christmas-day. Mr. Hawkehurst  recited scraps of Milton&rsquo;s glorious hymn as he made his morning toilet. He was  very happy. It was the first Christmas morning on which he had ever awakened  with this sense of supreme happiness, or with the consciousness that the day  was brighter, or grander, or more holy than other days. It seemed to him  to-day, more than ever, that he was indeed a regenerate creature, purified by  the influence of a good woman&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>He looked back at his past existence, and the  vision of many Christmas-days arose before him: a Christmas in Paris, amidst  unutterable rain and mud; a Christmas-night spent in roaming the Boulevards,  and in the consumption of cognac and tobacco at a third-rate caf&eacute;; a Christmas  in Germany; more than one Christmas in the Queen&rsquo;s Bench; one especially dreary  Christmas in a long bare ward at Whitecross-street, &mdash; how many varied scenes  and changing faces arose before his mental vision associated with that festive  time! And yet among them all there was not one on which there shone the  faintest glimmer of that holy light which makes the common holiday a sacred  season.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant thing to breakfast without the  society of the brilliant Horatio, whose brilliancy was apt to appear somewhat  ghastly at that early period of the morning. It was pleasant to loiter over the  meal, now meditating on the happy future, now dipping into a tattered copy of  Southey&rsquo;s &ldquo;Doctor;&rdquo; with the consciousness that the winds and waves had by this  time wafted Captain Paget to a foreign land.</p>
<p>Valentine was to spend the whole of Christmas-day  with Charlotte and her kindred. He was to accompany them to a fashionable  church in the morning, to walk with them after church, to dine and tell  ghost-stories in the evening. It was to be his first day as a recognised member  of that pleasant family at Bayswater; and in the fulness of his heart he felt  affectionately disposed to all his adopted relations; even to Mr. Sheldon,  whose very noble conduct had impressed him strongly, in spite of the bitter  sneers and covert slanders of George. Charlotte had told her lover that her  stepfather was a very generous and disinterested person, and that there was a  secret which she would have been glad to tell him, had she not been pledged to  hold it inviolate, that would have gone far to place Mr. Sheldon in a very  exalted light before the eyes of his future son-in-law.</p>
<p>And then Miss Halliday had nodded and smiled, and  had informed her lover, with a joyous little laugh, that he should have a horse  to ride, and an edition of Grote&rsquo;s &ldquo;Greece&rdquo; bound in dark-brown calf with  bevelled edges, when they were married; this work being one which the young  author had of late languished to possess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear foolish Lotta, I fear there will be a new  history of Greece, based on new theories, before that time comes,&rdquo; said the  lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no, indeed; that time will come very soon. See  how industriously you work, and how well you succeed. The magazine people will  soon give you thirty pounds a month. Or who knows that you may not write some  book that will make you suddenly famous, like Byron, or the good-natured fat  little printer who wrote those long, long, long novels that no one reads  nowadays?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Influenced by Charlotte&rsquo;s hints about her  stepfather, Mr. Hawkehurst&rsquo;s friendly feeling for that gentleman grew stronger,  and the sneers and innuendoes of the lawyer ceased to have the smallest power  over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man is such a thorough-going schemer himself,  that he cannot bring himself to believe in another man&rsquo;s honesty,&rdquo; thought Mr.  Hawkehurst, while meditating upon his experience of the two brothers. &ldquo;So far  as I have had any dealings with Philip Sheldon, I have found him  straightforward enough. I can imagine no hidden motive for his conduct in  relation to Charlotte. The test of his honesty will be the manner in which he  is acted upon by Charlotte&rsquo;s position as claimant of a great fortune. Will he  throw me overboard, I wonder? or will my dear one believe me an adventurer and  fortune-hunter? Ah, no, no, no; I do not think in all the complications of life  there could come about a state of events which would cause my Charlotte to  doubt me. There is no clairvoyance so unerring as true love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hawkehurst had need of such philosophy as this  to sustain him in the present crisis of his life. He was blest with a pure  delight which excelled his wildest dreams of happiness; but he was not blest  with any sense of security as to the endurance of that exalted state of bliss.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheldon would learn Charlotte&rsquo;s position, would  doubtless extort from his brother the history of those researches in which  Valentine had been engaged; and then, what then? Alas! hereupon arose  incalculable dangers and perplexities.</p>
<p>Might not the stockbroker, as a man of the world,  take a sordid view of the whole transaction, and consider Valentine in the  light of a shameless adventurer, who had traded on his secret knowledge in the  hope of securing a rich wife? Might he not reveal all to Charlotte, and attempt  to place her lover before her in this most odious aspect? She would not believe  him base; her faith would be unshaken, her love unchanged; but it was odious,  it was horrible, to think that her ears should be sullied, her tender heart  fluttered, by the mere suggestion of such baseness.</p>
<p>It was during the Christmas-morning sermon that Mr.  Hawkehurst permitted his mind to be disturbed by these reflections. He was  sitting next his betrothed, and had the pleasure of contemplating her fair  girlish face, with the rosy lips half parted in reverent attention as she  looked upward to her pastor. After church there was the walk home to the Lawn:  and during this rapturous promenade Valentine put away from him all shadow of  doubt and fear, in order to bask in the full sunshine of his Charlotte&rsquo;s  presence. Her pretty gloved hand rested confidingly on his arm, and the supreme  privilege of carrying a dainty blue-silk umbrella and an ivory-bound  church-service was awarded him. With what pride he accepted the duty of  convoying his promised wife over the muddy crossings! Those brief journeys  seemed to him in a manner typical of their future lives. She was to travel  dry-shod over the miry ways of this world, supported by his strong arm. How  fondly he surveyed her toilet! and what a sudden interest he felt in the  fashions, that had until lately seemed so vulgar and frivolous!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never denounce the absurdity of those  little bonnets again, Lotta,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;that conglomeration of black velvet  and maiden&rsquo;s-hair fern is divine. Do you know that in some places they call  that fern Maria&rsquo;s hair, and hold it sacred to the mother of Him who was born  to-day? so you see there is an artistic fitness in your head-dress. Yes, your  bonnet is delicious, darling; and though the diminutive size of that velvet  jacket would lead me to suppose you had borrowed it from some juvenile sister,  it seems the very garment of all garments best calculated to render you just  one hair&rsquo;s-breadth nearer perfection than you were made by Nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine, don&rsquo;t be ridiculous!&rdquo; giggled the young  lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I help being ridiculous? Your presence  acts upon my nerves like laughing-gas. Ah, you do not know what cares and  perplexities I have to make me serious. Charlotte,&rdquo; exclaimed the young man,  with sudden energy, &ldquo;do you think you could ever come to distrust me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valentine! Do I think I shall ever be Queen of  England? One thing is quite as likely as the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear angel, if you will only believe in me  always, there is no power upon earth that can make us unhappy. Suppose you  found yourself suddenly possessed of a great fortune, Charlotte; what would you  do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would buy you a library as good as that in the  British Museum; and then you would not want to spend the whole of your  existence in Great Russell-street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you had a great fortune, Lotta, don&rsquo;t you  think you would be very much disposed to leave me to plod on at my desk in  Great Russell-street? Possessed of wealth, you would begin to languish for  position; and you would allow Mr. Sheldon to bring you some suitor who could  give you a name and a rank in society worthy of an angelic creature with a  hundred thousand pounds or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should do nothing of the kind. I do not care for  money. Indeed, I should be almost sorry to be very rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, dearest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, if I were very rich, we could not live in  the cottage at
  Wimbledon, and I could not make lemon cheese-cakes for your dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My own true-hearted darling!&rdquo; cried Valentine;  &ldquo;the taint of worldliness can never touch your pure spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were at the gates of Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s domain by  this time. Diana and Georgy had walked behind the lovers, and had talked a  little about the sermon, and a good deal about the bonnets; poor Diana doing  her very uttermost to feign an interest in the finery that had attracted Mrs.  Sheldon&rsquo;s wandering gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I should have thought you couldn&rsquo;t fail to  see it,&rdquo; said the elder lady, as they approached the gate; &ldquo;a leghorn, very  small, with holly-berries and black ribbon &mdash; quite French, you know, and <em>so</em> stylish. I was thinking, if I had my  Tuscan cleaned and altered, it might &mdash; &mdash;&rdquo; And here the conversation became  general, as the family party entered the drawing-room, where Mr. Sheldon was  reading his paper by a roaring fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking about the bonnets, as per usual,&rdquo; said the  stockbroker. &ldquo;What an enormous amount of spiritual benefit you women must  derive from church-going! &mdash; Consols have fallen another eighth since Tuesday  afternoon, George,&rdquo; added Mr. Sheldon, addressing himself to his brother, who  was standing on the hearth-rug, with his elbow on the chimney-piece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consols are your &lsquo;bonnets,&rsquo; papa,&rdquo; cried  Charlotte, gaily; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is a day upon which you do not talk  about their having gone up, or gone down, or gone somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After luncheon the lovers went for a walk in  Kensington-gardens, with
  Diana Paget to play propriety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will come with us, won&rsquo;t you, dear
  Di?&rdquo; pleaded Charlotte. &ldquo;You have been looking pale and ill lately, and
  I am sure a walk will do you good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine seconded his liege lady&rsquo;s request; and  the three spent a couple of hours pacing briskly to and fro in the lonelier  parts of the gardens, leaving the broad walks for the cockneys, who mustered  strong upon this seasonable Christmas afternoon.</p>
<p>For two out of those three that wintry walk was  rapture only too fleeting. For the third it was passive endurance. The agonies  that had but lately rent Diana&rsquo;s breast when she had seen those two together no  longer tortured her. The scorpion sting was beginning to lose its venomous  power. She suffered still, but her suffering was softened by resignation. There  is a limit to the capacity for pain in every mind. Diana had borne her share of  grief; she had, in Homeric phrase, satiated herself with anguish and tears; and  to those sharp throes and bitter torments there had succeeded a passive sense  of sorrow that was almost peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have lost him,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;Life can  never bring me much joy; but I should be worse than weak if I spent my  existence in the indulgence of my sorrow. I should be one of the vilest  wretches upon this earth if I could not teach myself to witness the happiness  of my friend without repining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Paget had not arrived at this frame of mind  without severe struggles. Many times, in the long wakeful nights, in the slow,  joyless days, she had said to herself, &ldquo;Peace, peace, when there was no peace.&rdquo;  But at last the real peace, the true balm of Gilead, was given in answer to her  prayers, and the weary soul tasted the sweetness of repose. She had wrestled  with, and had vanquished, the demon.</p>
<p>To-day, as she walked beside the lovers, and  listened to their happy frivolous talk, she felt like a mother who had seen the  man she loved won from her by her own daughter, and who had resigned herself to  the ruin of all her hopes for love of her child.</p>
<p>There was more genial laughter and pleasant  converse at Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s dinner-table that evening than was usual at that  hospitable board; but the stockbroker himself contributed little to the  merriment of the party. He was quiet, and even thoughtful, and let the talk and  laughter go by him without any attempt to take part in it. After dinner he went  to his own room; while Valentine and the ladies sat round the fire in the  orthodox Christmas manner, and after a good deal of discursive conversation, subsided  into the telling of ghost-stories.</p>
<p>George Sheldon sat apart from the circle, turning  over the books upon the table, or peering into a stereoscope with an evident  sense of weariness. This kind of domestic evening was a manner of life which  Mr. Sheldon of Gray&rsquo;s Inn denounced as &ldquo;slow;&rdquo; and he submitted himself to the  endurance of it this evening only because he did not know where else to bestow  his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think papa cares much about ghost-stories,  does he, uncle George?&rdquo; Charlotte asked, by way of saying something to the  gentleman, who seemed so very dreary as he sat yawning over the books and  stereoscopes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose he does, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think he believes in ghosts?&rdquo; the young  lady demanded, laughingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am sure he doesn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied George, very  seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, how seriously you say that!&rdquo; cried Charlotte,  a little startled by George Sheldon&rsquo;s manner, in which there had been an  earnestness not quite warranted by the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of your father &mdash; not my brother  Phil. He died in Philip&rsquo;s house, you know; and if Phil believed in ghosts, he  would scarcely have liked living in that house afterwards, you see, and so on.  But he went on living there for a twelvemonth longer. It seemed just as good as  any other house to him, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hereupon Georgy dissolved into tears, and told the  company how she had fled, heartbroken, from the house in which her first  husband had died, immediately after the funeral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m sure the gentlemanly manner in which your  step-papa behaved during all that dreadful time, Charlotte, is beyond all  praise,&rdquo; continued the lady, turning to her daughter; &ldquo;so thoughtful, so kind,  so patient. What I should have done if poor Tom&rsquo;s illness had happened in a  strange house, I don&rsquo;t know. And I have no doubt that the new doctor, Mr.  Burkham, did his duty, though his manner was not as decided as I should have  wished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Burkham!&rdquo; cried Valentine. &ldquo;What Burkham is  that? We&rsquo;ve a member of the Ragamuffins called Burkham, a surgeon, who does a  little in the literary line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mr. Burkham who attended my poor dear husband  was a very young man,&rdquo; answered Georgy; &ldquo;a fair man, with a fresh colour and a  hesitating manner. I should have been so much better satisfied if he had been  older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the man,&rdquo; said Valentine. &ldquo;The Burkham I  know is fresh-coloured and fair, and cannot be much over thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you and he particularly intimate?&rdquo; asked  George Sheldon, carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O dear no, not at all. We speak to each other when  we happen to meet &mdash; that&rsquo;s all. He seems a nice fellow enough; and he evidently  hasn&rsquo;t much practice, or he couldn&rsquo;t afford to be a Ragamuffin, and to write  farces. He looks to me exactly the kind of modest deserving man who ought to  succeed, and who so seldom does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all that was said about Mr. Burkham; but  there was no more talk of ghost-stories, and a temporary depression fell upon  the little assembly. The memory of her father had always a saddening influence  on Charlotte; and it needed many tender <em>sotto-voce</em> speeches from Valentine to bring back the smiles to her fair young face.</p>
<p>The big electro-plated tea-tray and massive silver  teapot made their appearance presently, and immediately after came Mr. Sheldon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to have a little talk with you after tea,  Hawkehurst,&rdquo; he said, as he took his own cup from Georgy&rsquo;s hand, and proceeded  to imbibe the beverage standing. &ldquo;If you will come out into the garden and have  a cigar, I can say all I have to say in a very few minutes; and then we can  come in here for a rubber. Georgy is a very decent player; and my brother  George plays as good a hand at whist as any man at the Conservative or the  Reform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valentine&rsquo;s heart sank within him. What could Mr.  Sheldon want with a few minutes&rsquo; talk, if not to revoke his gracious permission  of some days before &mdash; the permission that had been accorded in ignorance of  Charlotte&rsquo;s pecuniary advantages? The young man looked very pale as he went to  smoke his cigar in Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s garden. Charlotte followed him with anxious  eyes, and wondered at the sudden gravity of his manner. George Sheldon also was  puzzled by his brother&rsquo;s desire for a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What new move is Phil going to make?&rdquo; he asked  himself. The two men lit their cigars, and got them well under weigh before Mr.  Sheldon began to talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I gave my consent to receive you as Miss  Halliday&rsquo;s suitor, my dear Hawkehurst,&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;I told you that I  was acting as very few men of the world would act, and I only told you the  truth. Since giving you that consent I have made a very startling discovery,  and one that places me in quite a new position in regard to this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Hawkehurst, I have become aware of the  fact that Miss Halliday, the girl whom I thought entirely dependent upon my  generosity, is heir-at-law to a large fortune. You will, of course, perceive  how entirely this alters the position of affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do perceive,&rdquo; Valentine answered earnestly; &ldquo;but  I trust you will believe that I had not the faintest idea of Miss Halliday&rsquo;s  position when I asked her to be my wife. As to my love for her, I can scarcely  tell you when that began; but I think it must have dated from the first hour in  which I saw her, for I can remember no period at which I did <em>not</em> love her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did not believe you superior to any mercenary  motives, you would not have been under my roof to-day, Mr. Hawkehurst,&rdquo; said  the stockbroker, with extreme gravity. &ldquo;The discovery of my stepdaughter&rsquo;s  position gives me no pleasure. Her claim to this wealth only increases my  responsibility with regard to her, and responsibility is what I would willingly  avoid. After all due deliberation, therefore, I have decided that this  discovery need make no alteration in your position as Charlotte&rsquo;s future  husband. If you were worthy of her when she was without a fortune, you are not  less worthy now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sheldon,&rdquo; cried Valentine, with considerable  emotion, &ldquo;I did not expect so much generosity at your hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the stockbroker, &ldquo;the popular idea of  a business man is not particularly agreeable. I do not, however, pretend to  anything like generosity; I wish to take a common-sense view of the affair, but  not an illiberal one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have shown so much generosity of feeling, that  I can no longer sail under false colours,&rdquo; said Valentine, after a brief pause.  &ldquo;Until a day or two ago I was bound to secrecy by a promise made to your  brother. But his communication of Miss Halliday&rsquo;s rights to you sets me at  liberty, and I must tell you that which may possibly cause you to withdraw your  confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hereupon Mr. Hawkehurst revealed his share in the  researches that had resulted in the discovery of Miss Halliday&rsquo;s claim to a  large fortune. He entered into no details. He told Mr. Sheldon only that he had  been the chief instrument in the bringing about of this important discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only repeat what I said just now,&rdquo; he added,  in conclusion. &ldquo;I have loved Charlotte Halliday from the beginning of our  acquaintance, and I declared myself some days before I discovered her position.  I trust this confession will in nowise alter your estimate of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a poor return for your candour if I  were to doubt your voluntary statement, Hawkehurst,&rdquo; answered the stockbroker.  &ldquo;No; I shall not withdraw my confidence. And if your researches should  ultimately lead to the advancement of my stepdaughter, there will be only  poetical justice in your profiting more or less by that advancement. In the  mean time we cannot take matters too quietly. I am not a sanguine person, and I  know how many hearts have been broken by the High Court of Chancery. This grand  discovery of yours may result in nothing but disappointment and waste of money,  or it may end as pleasantly as my brother and you seem to expect. All I ask is,  that poor Charlotte&rsquo;s innocent heart may not be tortured by a small lifetime of  suspense. Let her be told nothing that can create hope in the present or  disappointment in the future. She appears to be perfectly happy in her present  position, and it would be worse than folly to disturb her by vague expectations  that may never be realised. She will have to make affidavits, and so on,  by-and-by, I daresay; and when that time comes she must be told there is some  kind of suit pending in which she is concerned. But she need not be told how  nearly that suit concerns her, or the extent of her alleged claim. You see, my  dear sir, I have seen so much of this sort of thing, and the misery involved in  it, that I may be forgiven if I am cautious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was putting the whole affair in a new light.  Until this moment Valentine had fancied that, the chain of evidence once  established, Charlotte&rsquo;s claim had only to be asserted in order to place her in  immediate possession of the Haygarth estate. But Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s cool and  matter-of-fact discussion of the subject implied all manner of doubt and difficulty,  and the Haygarthian thousands seemed carried away to the most remote and  shadowy regions of Chanceryland, as by the waves of some legal ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you really think it would be better not to  tell Charlotte?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of it. If you wish to preserve her from  all manner of worry and annoyance, you will take care to keep her in the dark  until the affair is settled &mdash; supposing it ever should be settled. I have known  such an affair to outlast the person interested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take a very despondent view of the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take a practical view of it. My brother George  is a monomaniac on the next-of-kin subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot quite reconcile myself to the idea of  concealing the truth from Charlotte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is because you do not know the world as well  as I do,&rdquo; answered
  Mr. Sheldon, coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine that the idea of this claim would  have any disturbing influence upon her,&rdquo; Valentine argued, thoughtfully. &ldquo;She  is the last person in the world to care about money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps so. But there is a kind of intoxication in  the idea of a large fortune &mdash; an intoxication that no woman of Charlotte&rsquo;s age  could stand against. Tell her that she has a claim to considerable wealth, and  from that moment she will count upon the possession of that wealth, and shape  all her plans for the future upon that basis. &lsquo;When I get my fortune, I will do  this, that, and the other.&rsquo; <em>That</em> is  what she will be continually saying to herself; and by-and-by, when the affair  results in failure, as it very likely will, there will remain a sense of  disappointment which will last for a lifetime, and go far to embitter all the  ordinary pleasures of her existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am inclined to think you are right,&rdquo; said  Valentine, after some little deliberation. &ldquo;My darling girl is perfectly happy  as it is. It may be wisest to tell her nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure of that,&rdquo; replied Mr. Sheldon. &ldquo;Of  course her being enlightened or not can be in no way material to me. It is a  subject upon which I can afford to be entirely disinterested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take your advice, Mr. Sheldon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it. In that case matters will remain <em>in statu quo</em>. You will be received in  this house as my stepdaughter&rsquo;s future husband, and it is an understood thing  that your marriage is not to take place without due consultation with me. I am  to have a voice in the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most decidedly. It is only right that you should  be deferred to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brought the interview to a close very  pleasantly. The gentlemen went back to the house, and Valentine found himself  presently seated at a whist-table with the brothers Sheldon, and Georgy, who  played very well, in a feeble kind of way, holding religiously by all the  precepts of Hoyle, and in evident fear of her husband and brother-in-law.  Charlotte and Diana played duets while the whist progressed, with orthodox  silence and solemnity on the part of the four players. Valentine&rsquo;s eyes  wandered very often to the piano, and he was in nowise sorry when the  termination of a conquering rubber set him at liberty. He contrived to secure a  brief <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em> with Charlotte  while he helped her in the arrangement of the books on the music-stand, and  then the shrill chime of the clock on the mantelpiece, and an audible yawn from  Philip Sheldon, told him that he must go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Providence has been very good to us,&rdquo; he said, in  an undertone, as he bade Miss Halliday good night. &ldquo;Your stepfather&rsquo;s conduct  is all that is kind and thoughtful, and there is not a cloud upon our future.  Good night, and God bless you, my dearest! I think I shall always consider this  my first Christmas-day. I never knew till to-day how sweet and holy this  anniversary can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked to Cumberland-gate in company with George  Sheldon, who preserved a sulky gravity, which was by no means agreeable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have chosen your own course,&rdquo; he said at  parting, &ldquo;and I only hope the result may prove your wisdom. But, as I think I  may have remarked before, you don&rsquo;t know my brother Phil as well as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother has behaved with such extreme candour  and good feeling towards me, that I would really rather not hear any of your  unpleasant innuendoes against him. I hate that &lsquo;I could an if I would&rsquo; style of  talk, and while I occupy my present position in your brother&rsquo;s house I cannot  consent to hear anything to his discredit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a very tall animal you&rsquo;ve taken to riding  lately, my friend Hawkehurst,&rdquo; said George, &ldquo;and when a man rides the high  horse with me I always let him have the benefit of his <em>monture</em>. You have served yourself without consideration for me, and  I shall not trouble myself in the future with any regard for you or your  interests. But if harm ever comes to you or yours, through my brother Philip,  remember that I warned you. Good night.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>In Charlotte&rsquo;s room the cheery little fire burned  late upon that frosty night, while the girl sat in her dressing-gown dreamily  brushing her soft brown hair, and meditating upon the superhuman merits and  graces in her lover.</p>
<p>It was more than an hour after the family had  retired, when there came a cautious tapping at Charlotte&rsquo;s door. &ldquo;It is only I,  dear,&rdquo; said a low voice; and before Charlotte could answer, the door was  opened, and Diana came in, and went straight to the hearth, by which her friend  was sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so wakeful to-night, Lotta,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and  the light under your door tempted me to come in for a few minutes&rsquo; chat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest Di, you know how glad I always am to  see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I know that you are only too good to me  &mdash; and I have been so wayward, so ungracious. O, Charlotte, I know my coldness  has wounded you during the last few months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been just a little hurt now and then, dear,  when you have seemed not to care for me, or to sympathise with me in all my  joys and sorrows; but then it has been selfish of me to expect so much  sympathy, and I know that, if your manner is cold, your heart is noble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Lotta, it is not noble. It is a wicked heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Miss Paget, kneeling by her friend&rsquo;s  chair, and speaking with suppressed energy; &ldquo;it has been a wicked heart &mdash;  wicked because your happiness has been torture to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, my dearest one, do not look at me with those  innocent, wondering eyes. You will hate me, perhaps, when you know all. O, no,  no, no, you will not hate &mdash; you will pity and forgive me. I loved him, dear; he  was my companion, my only friend; and there was a time &mdash; long ago &mdash; before he  had ever seen your face, when I fancied that he cared for me, and would get to  love me &mdash; as I loved him &mdash; unasked, uncared for. O, Charlotte, you can never  know what I have suffered. It is not in your nature to comprehend what such a  woman as I can suffer. I loved him so dearly, I clung so wickedly, so madly to  my old hopes, my old dreams, long after they had become the falsest hopes, the  wildest dreams that ever had power over a distracted mind. But, my darling, it is  past, and I come to you on this Christmas night to tell you that I have  conquered my stubborn heart, and that from this time forward there shall be no  cloud between you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diana, my dear friend, my poor girl!&rdquo; cried  Charlotte, quite overcome, &ldquo;you loved him, you &mdash; as well as I &mdash; and I have  robbed you of his heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Charlotte, it was never mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You loved him &mdash; all the time you spoke so harshly  of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I seemed most harsh, I loved him most. But do  not look at me with such distress in your sweet face, my dear. I tell you that  the worst pain is past and gone. The rest is very easy to bear, and to outlive.  These things do not last for ever, Charlotte, whatever the poets and novelists  may tell us. If I had not lived through the worst, I should not be here  to-night, with your arm round my neck and his name upon my lips. I have never  wished you joy until to-night, Charlotte, and now for the first time I can wish  you all good things, in honesty and truth. I have conquered myself. I do not say  that to me Valentine Hawkehurst can ever be quite what other men are. I think  that to the end of my life there will be a look in his face, a tone of his  voice, that will touch me more deeply than any other look or tone upon earth;  but my love for you has overcome my love for him, and there is no hidden  thought in my mind to-night, as I sit here at your feet, and pray for God&rsquo;s  blessing on your choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling Diana, I know not how to thank you, how  to express my faith and my love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if I am worthy of your love, dear; but,  with God&rsquo;s help, I will be worthy of your trust; and if ever there should come  a day in which my love can succour or my devotion serve you, there shall be no  lack of either. Listen, dear; there are the waits playing the sweet Christmas  hymn. Do you remember what Shakespeare says about the &lsquo;bird of dawning&rsquo; singing  all night long, and how no evil spirit roams abroad at this dear season, &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;So hallowed and so gracious is the time?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have conquered my evil spirit, Lotta, and there  shall be peace and true love between us for evermore, shall there not, dearest  friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thus ends the story of Diana Paget&rsquo;s girlish  love &mdash; the love that had grown up in secret, to be put away from her heart in  silence, and buried with the dead dreams and fancies that had fostered it. For  her to-night the romance of life closed for ever. For Charlotte the sweet story  was newly begun, and the opening chapters were very pleasant &mdash; the mystic  volume seemed all delight. Blessed with her lover&rsquo;s devotion, her mother&rsquo;s  approval, and even Mr. Sheldon&rsquo;s benign approbation, what more could she ask  from Providence &mdash; what lurking dangers could she fear &mdash; what storm-cloud could  she perceive upon the sunlit heavens?</p>
<p>There was a cloud, no bigger than a man&rsquo;s hand, but  the harbinger of tempest and terror. It yet remains to be shown what form that  cloud assumed, and from what quarter the tempest came. The history of Charlotte  Halliday has grown upon the writer; and the completion of that history, with  the fate of John Haygarth&rsquo;s fortune, will be found under the title of,  CHARLOTTE&rsquo;S INHERITANCE.</p>
