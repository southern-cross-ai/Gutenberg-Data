     id="ch-01"></a>I. &mdash; MEET DR THORNDYKE</h2>

  <h3>A FASCINATING INSIGHT INTO THE CHARACTER WRITTEN BY THE AUTHOR</h3>

  <p class="first">MY subject is Dr. John Thorndyke, the hero or central
  character of most of my detective stories. So I'll give you a short account
  of his real origin; of the way in which he did in fact come into
  existence.</p>

  <p>To discover the origin of John Thorndyke I have to reach back into the
  past for at least fifty years, to the time when I was a medical student
  preparing for my final examination. For reasons which I need not go into I
  gave rather special attention to the legal aspects of medicine and the
  medical aspects of law. And as I read my text-books, and especially the
  illustrative cases, I was profoundly impressed by their dramatic quality.
  Medical jurisprudence deals with the human body in its relation to all kinds
  of legal problems. Thus its subject matter includes all sorts of crime
  against the person and all sorts of violent death and bodily injury: hanging,
  drowning, poisons and their effects, problems of suicide and homicide, of
  personal identity and survivorship, and a host of other problems of the
  highest dramatic possibilities, though not always quite presentable for the
  purposes of fiction. And the reported cases which were given in illustration
  were often crime stories of the most thrilling interest. Cases of disputed
  identity such as the Tichbourne Case, famous poisoning cases such as the
  Rugeley Case and that of Madeline Smith, cases of mysterious disappearance or
  the detection of long-forgotten crimes such as that of Eugene Aram; all
  these, described and analysed with strict scientific accuracy, formed the
  matter of Medical Jurisprudence which thrilled me as I read and made an
  indelible impression.</p>

  <p>But it produced no immediate results. I had to pass my examinations and
  get my diploma, and then look out for the means of earning my living. So all
  this curious lore was put away for the time being in the pigeon-holes of my
  mind&mdash;which Dr. Freud would call the Unconscious&mdash;not forgotten,
  but ready to come to the surface when the need for it should arise. And there
  it reposed for some twenty years, until failing health compelled me to
  abandon medical practice and take to literature as a profession.</p>

  <p>It was then that my old studies recurred to my mind. A fellow doctor,
  Conan Doyle, had made a brilliant and well-deserved success by the creation
  of the immortal Sherlock Holmes. Considering that achievement, I asked myself
  whether it might not be possible to devise a detective story of a slightly
  different kind; one based on the science of Medical Jurisprudence, in which,
  by the sacrifice of a certain amount of dramatic effect, one could keep
  entirely within the facts of real life, with nothing fictitious excepting the
  persons and the events. I came to the conclusion that it was, and began to
  turn the idea over in my mind.</p>

  <p>But I think that the influence which finally determined the character of
  my detective stories, and incidentally the character of John Thorndyke,
  operated when I was working at the Westminster Ophthalmic Hospital. There I
  used to take the patients into the dark room, examine their eyes with the
  ophthalmoscope, estimate the errors of refraction, and construct an
  experimental pair of spectacles to correct those errors. When a perfect
  correction had been arrived at, the formula for it was embodied in a
  prescription which was sent to the optician who made the permanent
  spectacles.</p>

  <p>Now when I was writing those prescriptions it was borne in on me that in
  many cases, especially the more complex, the formula for the spectacles, and
  consequently the spectacles themselves, furnished an infallible record of
  personal identity. If, for instance, such a pair of spectacles should have
  been found in a railway carriage, and the maker of those spectacles could be
  found, there would be practically conclusive evidence that a particular
  person had travelled by that train. About that time I drafted out a story
  based on a pair of spectacles, which was published some years later under the
  title of <i>The Mystery of 31 New Inn</i>, and the construction of that story
  determined, as I have said, not only the general character of my future work
  but of the hero around whom the plots were to be woven. But that story
  remained for some years in cold storage. My first published detective novel
  was <i>The Red Thumb-mark</i>, and in that book we may consider that John
  Thorndyke was born. And in passing on to describe him I may as well explain
  how and why he came to be the kind of person that he is.</p>

  <p>I may begin by saying that he was not modelled after any real person. He
  was deliberately created to play a certain part, and the idea that was in my
  mind was that he should be such a person as would be likely and suitable to
  occupy such a position in real life. As he was to be a medico-legal expert,
  he had to be a doctor and a fully trained lawyer. On the physical side I
  endowed him with every kind of natural advantage. He is exceptionally tall,
  strong, and athletic because those qualities are useful in his vocation. For
  the same reason he has acute eyesight and hearing and considerable general
  manual skill, as every doctor ought to have. In appearance he is handsome and
  of an imposing presence, with a symmetrical face of the classical type and a
  Grecian nose. And here I may remark that his distinguished appearance is not
  merely a concession to my personal taste but is also a protest against the
  monsters of ugliness whom some detective writers have evolved.</p>

  <p>These are quite opposed to natural truth. In real life a first-class man
  of any kind usually tends to be a good-looking man.</p>

  <p>Mentally, Thorndyke is quite normal. He has no gifts of intuition or other
  supernormal mental qualities. He is just a highly intellectual man of great
  and varied knowledge with exceptionally acute reasoning powers and endowed
  with that invaluable asset, a scientific imagination (by a scientific
  imagination I mean that special faculty which marks the born investigator;
  the capacity to perceive the essential nature of a problem before the
  detailed evidence comes into sight). But he arrives at his conclusions by
  ordinary reasoning, which the reader can follow when he has been supplied
  with the facts; though the intricacy of the train of reasoning may at times
  call for an exposition at the end of the investigation.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke has no eccentricities or oddities which might detract from the
  dignity of an eminent professional man, unless one excepts an unnatural
  liking for Trichinopoly cheroots. In manner he is quiet, reserved and
  self-contained, and rather markedly secretive, but of a kindly nature, though
  not sentimental, and addicted to occasional touches of dry humour. That is
  how Thorndyke appears to me.</p>

  <p>As to his age. When he made his first bow to the reading public from the
  doorway of Number 4 King's Bench Walk he was between thirty-five and forty.
  As that was thirty years ago, he should now be over sixty-five. But he isn't.
  If I have to let him "grow old along with me" I need not saddle him with the
  infirmities of age, and I can (in his case) put the brake on the passing
  years. Probably he is not more than fifty after all!</p>

  <p>Now a few words as to how Thorndyke goes to work. His methods are rather
  different from those of the detectives of the Sherlock Holmes school. They
  are more technical and more specialized. He is an investigator of crime but
  he is not a detective. The technique of Scotland Yard would be neither
  suitable nor possible to him. He is a medico-legal expert, and his methods
  are those of medico-legal science. In the investigation of a crime there are
  two entirely different methods of approach. One consists in the careful and
  laborious examination of a vast mass of small and commonplace detail:
  inquiring into the movements of suspected and other persons; interrogating
  witnesses and checking their statements particularly as to times and places;
  tracing missing persons, and so forth&mdash;the aim being to accumulate a
  great body of circumstantial evidence which will ultimately disclose the
  solution of the problem. It is an admirable method, as the success of our
  police proves, and it is used with brilliant effect by at least one of our
  contemporary detective writers. But it is essentially a police method.</p>

  <p>The other method consists in the search for some fact of high evidential
  value which can be demonstrated by physical methods and which constitutes
  conclusive proof of some important point. This method also is used by the
  police in suitable cases. Finger-prints are examples of this kind of
  evidence, and another instance is furnished by the Gutteridge murder. Here
  the microscopical examination of a cartridge-case proved conclusively that
  the murder had been committed with a particular revolver; a fact which
  incriminated the owner of that revolver and led to his conviction.</p>

  <p>This is Thorndyke's procedure. It consists in the interrogation of things
  rather than persons; of the ascertainment of physical facts which can be made
  visible to eyes other than his own. And the facts which he seeks tend to be
  those which are apparent only to the trained eye of the medical
  practitioner.</p>

  <p>I feel that I ought to say a few words about Thorndyke's two satellites,
  Jervis and Polton. As to the former, he is just the traditional narrator
  proper to this type of story. Some of my readers have complained that Dr.
  Jervis is rather slow in the uptake. But that is precisely his function. He
  is the expert misunderstander. His job is to observe and record all the
  facts, and to fail completely to perceive their significance. Thereby he
  gives the reader all the necessary information, and he affords Thorndyke the
  opportunity to expound its bearing on the case.</p>

  <p>Polton is in a slightly different category. Although he is not drawn from
  any real person, he is associated in my mind with two actual individuals. One
  is a Mr. Pollard, who was the laboratory assistant in the hospital museum
  when I was a student, and who gave me many a valuable tip in matters of
  technique, and who, I hope, is still to the good. The other was a watch- and
  clock-maker of the name of Parsons &mdash;familiarly known as Uncle
  Parsons&mdash;who had premises in a basement near the Royal Exchange, and who
  was a man of boundless ingenuity and technical resource. Both of these I
  regard as collateral relatives, so to speak, of Nathaniel Polton. But his
  personality is not like either. His crinkly countenance is strictly his own
  copyright.</p>

  <p>To return to Thorndyke, his rather technical methods have, for the
  purposes of fiction, advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that his
  facts are demonstrably true, and often they are intrinsically interesting.
  The disadvantage is that they are frequently not matters of common knowledge,
  so that the reader may fail to recognize them or grasp their significance
  until they are explained. But this is the case with all classes of fiction.
  There is no type of character or story that can be made sympathetic and
  acceptable to every kind of reader. The personal equation affects the reading
  as well as the writing of a story.</p>

     id="ch-02"></a>II. &mdash; THE EYE OF OSIRIS</h2>

  <h3>CHAPTER I. THE VANISHING MAN</h3>

  <p class="first">THE SCHOOL of St Margaret's Hospital was fortunate in its
  lecturer on Medical Jurisprudence, or Forensic Medicine, as it is sometimes
  described. At some schools the lecturer on this subject is appointed
  apparently for the reason that he lacks the qualifications to lecture on any
  other. But with us it was very different: John Thorndyke was not only an
  enthusiast, a man of profound learning and great reputation, but he was an
  exceptional teacher, lively and fascinating in style and of endless
  resources. Every remarkable case that had ever been reported he appeared to
  have at his fingers' ends; every fact&mdash;chemical, physical, biological,
  or even historical&mdash;that could in any way be twisted into a medico-legal
  significance, was pressed into his service; and his own varied and curious
  experiences seemed as inexhaustible as the widow's cruse. One of his
  favourite devices for giving life and interest to a rather dry subject was
  that of analysing and commenting upon contemporary cases as reported in the
  papers (always, of course, with a due regard to the legal and social
  proprieties); and it was in this way that I first became introduced to the
  astonishing series of events that was destined to exercise so great an
  influence on my own life.</p>

  <p>The lecture which had just been concluded had dealt with the rather
  unsatisfactory subject of survivorship. Most of the students had left the
  theatre, and the remainder had gathered round the lecturer's table to listen
  to the informal comments that Dr. Thorndyke was wont to deliver on these
  occasions in an easy, conversational manner, leaning against the edge of the
  table and apparently addressing his remarks to a stick of blackboard chalk
  that he held in his fingers.</p>

  <p>'The problem of survivorship,' he was saying, in reply to a question put
  by one of the students, 'ordinarily occurs in cases where the bodies of the
  parties are producible, or where, at any rate, the occurrence of death and
  its approximate time are actually known. But an analogous difficulty may
  arise in a case where the body of one of the parties is not forthcoming, and
  the fact of death may have to be assumed on collateral evidence.</p>

  <p>'Here, of course, the vital question to be settled is, what is the latest
  instant at which it is certain that this person was alive? And the settlement
  of that question may turn on some circumstance of the most trivial and
  insignificant kind. There is a case in this morning's paper which illustrates
  this. A gentleman has disappeared rather mysteriously. He was last seen by
  the servant of a relative at whose house he had called. Now, if this
  gentleman should never reappear, dead or alive, the question as to what was
  the latest moment at which he was certainly alive will turn upon the further
  question: "Was he or was he not wearing a particular article of jewellery
  when he called at the relative's house?"'</p>

  <p>He paused with a reflective eye bent upon the stump of chalk he still
  held; then, noting the expectant interest with which we were regarding him,
  he resumed:</p>

  <p>'The circumstances in this case are very curious; in fact, they are highly
  mysterious; and if any legal issues should arise in respect of them, they are
  likely to yield some very remarkable complications. The gentleman who has
  disappeared, Mr. John Bellingham, is a man well known in archaeological
  circles. He recently returned from Egypt, bringing with him a very fine
  collection of antiquities&mdash;some of which, by the way, he has presented
  to the British Museum, where they are now on view&mdash;and having made this
  presentation, he appears to have gone to Paris on business. I may mention
  that the gift consisted of a very fine mummy and a complete set of
  tomb-furniture. The latter, however, had not arrived from Egypt at the time
  when the missing man left for Paris, but the mummy was inspected on the
  fourteenth of October at Mr. Bellingham's house by Dr. Norbury of the British
  Museum, in the presence of the donor and his solicitor, and the latter was
  authorised to hand over the complete collection to the British Museum
  authorities when the tomb-furniture arrived; which he has since done.</p>

  <p>'From Paris he seems to have returned on the twenty-third of November, and
  to have gone direct to Charing Cross to the house of a relative, a Mr. Hurst,
  who is a bachelor and lives at Eltham. He appeared at the house at twenty
  minutes past five, and as Mr. Hurst had not yet come down from town and was
  not expected until a quarter to six, he explained who he was and said he
  would wait in the study and write some letters. The housemaid accordingly
  showed him into the study, furnished him with writing materials, and left
  him.</p>

  <p>'At a quarter to six Mr. Hurst let himself in with his latchkey, and
  before the housemaid had time to speak to him he had passed through into the
  study and shut the door.</p>

  <p>'At six o'clock, when the dinner bell was rung, Mr. Hurst entered the
  dining-room alone, and observing the table was laid for two, asked the
  reason.</p>

  <p>'"I thought Mr. Bellingham was staying to dinner, sir," was the
  housemaid's reply.</p>

  <p>'"Mr. Bellingham!" exclaimed the astonished host. "I didn't know he was
  here. Why was I not told?"</p>

  <p>'"I thought he was in the study with you, sir," said the housemaid.</p>

  <p>'On this a search was made for the visitor, with the result that he was
  nowhere to be found. He had disappeared without leaving a trace, and what
  made the incident more odd was that the housemaid was certain that he had not
  gone out by the front door. For since neither she nor the cook was acquainted
  with Mr. John Bellingham, she had remained the whole time either in the
  kitchen, which commanded a view of the front gate, or in the dining-room,
  which opened into the hall opposite the study door. The study itself has a
  French window opening on a narrow grass plot, across which is a side-gate
  that opens into an alley; and it appears that Mr. Bellingham must have made
  his exit by this rather eccentric route. At any rate&mdash;and this is the
  important fact&mdash;he was not in the house, and no one had seen him leave
  it.</p>

  <p>'After a hasty meal Mr. Hurst returned to town and called at the office of
  Mr. Bellingham's solicitor and confidential agent, a Mr. Jellicoe, and
  mentioned the matter to him. Mr. Jellicoe knew nothing of his client's return
  from Paris, and the two men at once took the train down to Woodford, where
  the missing man's brother, Mr. Godfrey Bellingham, lives. The servant who
  admitted them said that Mr. Godfrey was not at home, but that his daughter
  was in the library, which is a detached building situated in a shrubbery
  beyond the garden at the back of the house. Here the two men found, not only
  Miss Bellingham, but also her father, who had come in by the back gate.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Godfrey and his daughter listened to Mr. Hurst's story with the
  greatest surprise, and assured him that they had neither seen nor heard
  anything of John Bellingham.</p>

  <p>'Presently the party left the library to walk up to the house; but only a
  few feet from the library door Mr. Jellicoe noticed an object lying in the
  grass and pointed it out to Mr. Godfrey.</p>

  <p>'The latter picked it up, and they all recognised it as a scarab which Mr.
  John Bellingham had been accustomed to wear suspended from his watch-chain.
  There was no mistaking it. It was a very fine scarab of the eighteenth
  dynasty fashioned of lapis lazuli and engraved with the cartouche of
  Amenhotep III. It had been suspended by a gold ring fastened to a wire which
  passed through the suspension hole, and the ring, though broken, was still in
  position.</p>

  <p>'This discovery of course only added to the mystery, which was still
  further increased when, on inquiry, a suit-case bearing the initials J. B.
  was found to be unclaimed in the cloak-room at Charing Cross. Reference to
  the counterfoil of the ticket-book showed that it had been deposited about
  the time of the arrival of the Continental express on the twenty-third of
  November, so that its owner must have gone straight on to Eltham.</p>

  <p>'That is how the affair stands at present, and, should the missing man
  never reappear or should his body never be found, the question, as you see,
  which will be required to be settled is, "What is the exact time and place,
  when and where, he was last known to be alive!" As to the place, the
  importance of the issues involved in that question are obvious and we need
  not consider them. But the question of time has another kind of significance.
  Cases have occurred, as I pointed out in the lecture, in which proof of
  survivorship by less than a minute has secured succession to property. Now,
  the missing man was last seen alive at Mr. Hurst's house at twenty minutes
  past five on the twenty-third of November. But he appears to have visited his
  brother's house at Woodford, and, since nobody saw him at that house, it is
  at present uncertain whether he went there before calling on Mr. Hurst. If he
  went there first, then twenty minutes past five on the evening of the
  twenty-third is the latest moment at which he is known to have been alive;
  but if he went there after, there would have to be added to this time the
  shortest time possible in which he could travel from the one house to the
  other.</p>

  <p>'But the question as to which house he visited first hinges on the scarab.
  If he was wearing the scarab when he arrived at Mr. Hurst's house, it would
  be certain that he went there first; but if it was not then on his
  watch-chain, a probability would be established that he went first to
  Woodford. Thus, you see, a question which may conceivably become of the most
  vital moment in determining the succession of property turns on the
  observation or non-observation by this housemaid of an apparently trivial and
  insignificant fact.'</p>

  <p>'Has the servant made any statement on this subject, sir?' I ventured to
  enquire.</p>

  <p>'Apparently not,' replied Dr. Thorndyke; 'at any rate, there is no
  reference to any such statement in the newspaper report, though otherwise,
  the case is reported in great detail; indeed, the wealth of detail, including
  plans of the two houses, is quite remarkable and well worth noting as being
  in itself a fact of considerable interest.'</p>

  <p>'In what respect, sir, is it of interest?' one of the students asked.</p>

  <p>'Ah,' replied Dr. Thorndyke, 'I think I must leave you to consider that
  question yourself. This is an untried case, and we mustn't make free with the
  actions and motives of individuals.'</p>

  <p>'Does the paper give any description of the missing man, sir?' I
  asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes; quite an exhaustive description. Indeed, it is exhaustive to the
  verge of impropriety, considering that the man may turn up alive and well at
  any moment. It seems that he has an old Pott's fracture of the left ankle, a
  linear, longitudinal scar on each knee&mdash;origin not stated, but easily
  guessed at&mdash;and that he has tattooed on his chest in vermilion a very
  finely and distinctly executed representation of the symbolical Eye of
  Osiris&mdash;or Horus or Ra, as the different authorities have it. There
  certainly ought to be no difficulty in identifying the body. But we hope that
  it will not come to that.</p>

  <p>'And now I must really be running away, and so must you; but I would
  advise you all to get copies of the paper and file them when you have read
  the remarkably full details. It is a most curious case, and it is highly
  probable that we shall hear of it again. Good afternoon, gentlemen.'</p>

  <p>Dr Thorndyke's advice appealed to all who heard it, for medical
  jurisprudence was a live subject at St Margaret's, and all of us were keenly
  interested in it. As a result, we sallied forth in a body to the nearest
  newsvendor's, and, having each provided himself with a copy of the Daily
  Telegraph, adjourned together to the Common Room to devour the report and
  thereafter to discuss the bearings of the case, unhampered by those
  considerations of delicacy that afflicted our more squeamish and scrupulous
  teacher.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER II. THE EAVESDROPPER</h3>

  <p>IT IS one of the canons of correct conduct, scrupulously adhered to (when
  convenient) by all well-bred persons, that an acquaintance should be
  initiated by a proper introduction. To this salutary rule, which I have
  disregarded to the extent of an entire chapter, I now hasten to conform; and
  the more so inasmuch as nearly two years have passed since my first informal
  appearance.</p>

  <p>Permit me then, to introduce Paul Berkeley, MB, etc., recently&mdash;very
  recently&mdash;qualified, faultlessly attired in the professional frock-coat
  and tall hat, and, at the moment of introduction, navigating with anxious
  care a perilous strait between a row of well-filled coal-sacks and a colossal
  tray piled high with kidney potatoes.</p>

  <p>The passage of this strait landed me on the terra firma of Fleur-de-Lys
  Court, where I halted for a moment to consult my visiting list. There was
  only one more patient for me to see this morning, and he lived at 49,
  Nevill's Court, wherever that might be. I turned for information to the
  presiding deity of the coal shop.</p>

  <p>'Can you direct me, Mrs. Jablett, to Nevill's Court?'</p>

  <p>She could and she did, grasping me confidentially by the arm (the mark
  remained on my sleeve for weeks) and pointing a shaking forefinger at the
  dead wall ahead. 'Nevill's Court', said Mrs. Jablett, 'is a alley, and you
  goes into it through a archway. It turns out on Fetter Lane on the right and
  as you goes up, oppersight Bream's Buildings.'</p>

  <p>I thanked Mrs. Jablett and went on my way, glad that the morning round was
  nearly finished, and vaguely conscious of a growing appetite and of a desire
  to wash in hot water.</p>

  <p>The practice which I was conducting was not my own. It belonged to poor
  Dick Barnard, an old St Margaret's man of irrepressible spirits and
  indifferent physique, who had started only the day before for a trip down the
  Mediterranean on board a tramp engaged in the currant trade; and this, my
  second morning's round, was in some sort a voyage of geographical
  discovery.</p>

  <p>I walked on briskly up Fetter Lane until a narrow arched opening, bearing
  the superscription 'Nevill's Court', arrested my steps, and here I turned to
  encounter one of those surprises that lie in wait for the traveller in London
  by-ways. Expecting to find the grey squalor of the ordinary London court, I
  looked out from under the shadow of the arch past a row of decent little
  shops through a vista full of light and colour&mdash;a vista of ancient,
  warm-toned roofs and walls relieved by sunlit foliage. In the heart of London
  a tree is always a delightful surprise; but here were not only trees, but
  bushes and even flowers. The narrow footway was bordered by little gardens,
  which, with their wooden palings and well-kept shrubs, gave to the place an
  air of quaint and sober rusticity; and even as I entered a bevy of workgirls,
  with gaily-coloured blouses and hair aflame in the sunlight, brightened up
  the quiet background like the wild flowers that sprangle a summer
  hedgerow.</p>

  <p>In one of the gardens I noticed that the little paths were paved with what
  looked like circular tiles, but which, on inspection, I found to be
  old-fashioned stone ink-bottles, buried bottom upwards; and I was meditating
  upon the quaint conceit of the forgotten scrivener who had thus adorned his
  habitation&mdash;a law-writer perhaps or an author, or perchance even a
  poet&mdash;when I perceived the number that I was seeking inscribed on a
  shabby door in a high wall. There was no bell or knocker, so, lifting the
  latch, I pushed the door open and entered.</p>

  <p>But if the court itself had been a surprise, this was a positive wonder, a
  dream. Here, within earshot of the rumble of Fleet Street, I was in an
  old-fashioned garden enclosed by high walls and, now that the gate was shut,
  cut off from all sight and knowledge of the urban world that seethed without.
  I stood and gazed in delighted astonishment. Sun-gilded trees and flower beds
  gay with blossom; lupins, snapdragons, nasturtiums, spiry foxgloves, and
  mighty hollyhocks formed the foreground; over which a pair of sulphur-tinted
  butterflies flitted, unmindful of a buxom and miraculously clean white cat
  which pursued them, dancing across the borders and clapping her snowy paws
  fruitlessly in mid-air. And the background was no less wonderful; a grand old
  house, dark-eaved and venerable, that must have looked down on this garden
  when ruffled dandies were borne in sedan chairs through the court, and gentle
  Izaak Walton, stealing forth from his shop in Fleet Street, strolled up
  Fetter Lane to 'go a-angling' at Temple Mills.</p>

  <p>So overpowered was I by this unexpected vision that my hand was on the
  bottom knob of a row of bell-pulls before I recollected myself; and it was
  not until a most infernal jangling from within recalled me to my business
  that I observed underneath it a small brass plate inscribed 'Miss Oman'.</p>

  <p>The door opened with some suddenness and a short, middle-aged woman
  surveyed me hungrily.</p>

  <p>'Have I rung the wrong bell?' I asked&mdash;foolishly enough, I must
  admit.</p>

  <p>'How can I tell?' she demanded. 'I expect you have. It's the sort of thing
  a man would do&mdash;ring the wrong bell and then say he's sorry.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't go as far as that,' I retorted. 'It seems to have had the
  desired effect, and I've made your acquaintance into the bargain.'</p>

  <p>'Whom do you want to see?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Bellingham.'</p>

  <p>'Are you the doctor?'</p>

  <p>'I'm a doctor.'</p>

  <p>'Follow me upstairs,' said Miss Oman, 'and don't tread on the paint.'</p>

  <p>I crossed the spacious hall, and, preceded by my conductress, ascended a
  noble oak staircase, treading carefully on a ribbon of matting that ran up
  the middle. On the first-floor landing Miss Oman opened a door and, pointing
  to the room, said, 'Go in there and wait; I'll tell her you're here.'</p>

  <p>'I said Mr. Bellingham&mdash;' I began; but the door slammed on me, and
  Miss Oman's footsteps retreated rapidly down the stairs.</p>

  <p>It was at once obvious to me that I was in a very awkward position. The
  room into which I had been shown communicated with another, and though the
  door of communication was shut, I was unpleasantly aware of a conversation
  that was taking place in the adjoining room. At first, indeed, only a vague
  mutter, with a few disjointed phrases, came through the door, but suddenly an
  angry voice rang out clear and painfully distinct:</p>

  <p>'Yes, I did! And I say it again. Bribery! Collusion! That's what it
  amounts to. You want to square me!'</p>

  <p>'Nothing of the kind, Godfrey,' was the reply in a lower tone; but at this
  point I coughed emphatically and moved a chair, and the voices subsided once
  more into an indistinct murmur.</p>

  <p>To distract my attention from my unseen neighbours I glanced curiously
  about the room and speculated upon the personal ties of its occupants. A very
  curious room it was, with its pathetic suggestion of decayed splendour and
  old-world dignity; a room full of interest and character and of contrasts and
  perplexing contradictions. For the most part it spoke of unmistakable though
  decent poverty. It was nearly bare of furniture, and what little there was
  was of the cheapest&mdash;a small kitchen table and three Windsor chairs (two
  of them with arms); a threadbare string carpet on the floor, and a cheap
  cotton cloth on the table; these, with a set of bookshelves, frankly
  constructed of grocer's boxes, formed the entire suite. And yet, despite its
  poverty, the place exhaled an air of homely if rather ascetic comfort, and
  the taste was irreproachable. The quiet russet of the table-cloth struck a
  pleasant harmony with the subdued bluish green of the worn carpet; the
  Windsor chairs and the legs of the table had been carefully denuded of their
  glaring varnish and stained a sober brown; and the austerity of the whole was
  relieved by a ginger jar filled with fresh-cut flowers and set in the middle
  of the table.</p>

  <p>But the contrasts of which I have spoken were most singular and puzzling.
  There were the bookshelves, for instance, home made and stained at the cost
  of a few pence, but filled with recent and costly new works on archaeology
  and ancient art. There were the objects on the mantelpiece: a facsimile in
  bronze&mdash;not bronze plaster&mdash;of the beautiful head of Hypnos and a
  pair of fine Ushabti figures. There were the decorations of the walls, a
  number of etchings&mdash;signed proofs, every one of them&mdash;of Oriental
  subjects, and a splendid facsimile reproduction of an Egyptian papyrus. It
  was incongruous in the extreme, this mingling of costly refinements with the
  barest and shabbiest necessaries of life, of fastidious culture with manifest
  poverty. I could make nothing of it. What manner of man, I wondered, was this
  new patient of mine? Was he a miser, hiding himself and his wealth in this
  obscure court? An eccentric savant? A philosopher? Or&mdash;more
  probably&mdash;a crank? But at this point my meditations were interrupted by
  the voice from the adjoining room, once more raised in anger.</p>

  <p>'Tut I say that you are making an accusation! You are implying that I made
  away with him.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' was the reply; 'but I repeat that it is your business to
  ascertain what has become of him. The responsibility rests upon you.'</p>

  <p>'Upon me!' rejoined the first voice. 'And what about you? Your position is
  a pretty fishy one if it comes to that.'</p>

  <p>'What!' roared the other. 'Do you insinuate that I murdered my own
  brother?'</p>

  <p>During this amazing colloquy I had stood gaping with sheer astonishment.
  Suddenly I recollected myself, and dropping into a chair, set my elbows on my
  knees and clapped my hands over my ears; and thus I must have remained for a
  full minute when I became aware of the closing of a door behind me.</p>

  <p>I sprang to my feet and turned in some embarrassment (for I must have
  looked unspeakably ridiculous) to confront the sombre figure of a rather tall
  and strikingly handsome girl, who, as she stood with her hand on the knob of
  the door, saluted me with a formal bow. In an instantaneous glance I noted
  how perfectly she matched her strange surroundings. Black-robed,
  black-haired, with black-grey eyes and a grave sad face of ivory pallor, she
  stood, like one of old Terboch's portraits, a harmony in tones so low as to
  be but a step removed from monochrome. Obviously a lady in spite of the worn
  and rusty dress, and something in the poise of the head and the set of the
  straight brows hinted at a spirit that adversity had hardened rather than
  broken.</p>

  <p>'I must ask you to forgive me for keeping you waiting,' she said; and as
  she spoke a certain softening at the corners of the austere mouth reminded me
  of the absurd position in which she had found me.</p>

  <p>I murmured that the trifling delay was of no consequence whatever; that I
  had, in fact, been rather glad of the rest; and I was beginning somewhat
  vaguely to approach the subject of the invalid when the voice from the
  adjoining room again broke forth with hideous distinctness.</p>

  <p>'I tell you I'll do nothing of the kind! Why, confound you, it's nothing
  less than a conspiracy that you're proposing!'</p>

  <p>Miss Bellingham&mdash;as I assumed her to be&mdash;stepped quickly across
  the floor, flushing angrily, as well she might; but, as she reached the door,
  it flew open and a small, spruce, middle-aged man burst into the room.</p>

  <p>'Your father is mad, Ruth!' he exclaimed; 'absolutely stark mad! And I
  refuse to hold any further communication with him.'</p>

  <p>'The present interview was not of his seeking,' Miss Bellingham replied
  coldly.</p>

  <p>'No, it was not,' was the wrathful rejoinder; 'it was my mistaken
  generosity. But there&mdash;what is the use of talking? I've done my best for
  you and I'll do no more. Don't trouble to let me out; I can find my way.
  Good-morning.' With a stiff bow and a quick glance at me, the speaker strode
  out of the room, banging the door after him.</p>

  <p>'I must apologise for this extraordinary reception,' said Miss Bellingham;
  'but I believe medical men are not easily astonished. I will introduce you to
  your patient now.' She opened the door and, as I followed her into the
  adjoining room, she said: 'Here is another visitor for you, dear.
  Doctor&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Berkeley,' said I. 'I am acting for my friend Doctor Barnard.'</p>

  <p>The invalid, a fine-looking man of about fifty-five, who sat propped up in
  bed with a pile of pillows, held out an excessively shaky hand, which I
  grasped cordially, making a mental note of the tremor.</p>

  <p>'How do you do, sir?' said Mr. Bellingham. 'I hope Doctor Barnard is not
  ill.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, no,' I answered; 'he has gone for a trip down the Mediterranean on a
  currant ship. The chance occurred rather suddenly, and I bustled him off
  before he had time to change his mind. Hence my rather unceremonious
  appearance, which I hope you will forgive.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' was the hearty response. 'I'm delighted to hear that you
  sent him off; he wanted a holiday, poor man. And I am delighted to make your
  acquaintance, too.'</p>

  <p>'It is very good of you,' I said; whereupon he bowed as gracefully as a
  man may who is propped up in bed with a heap of pillows; and having thus
  exchanged broadsides of civility, so to speak, we&mdash;or, at least,
  I&mdash;proceeded to business.</p>

  <p>'How long have you been laid up?' I asked cautiously, not wishing to make
  too evident the fact that my principal had given me no information respecting
  his case.</p>

  <p>'A week to-day,' he replied. 'Thefons et origo mail was a hansom-cab which
  upset me opposite the Law Courts&mdash;sent me sprawling in the middle of the
  road. My own fault, of course&mdash;at least, the cabby said so, and I
  suppose he knew. But that was no consolation to me.'</p>

  <p>'Were you hurt much?'</p>

  <p>'No, not really; but the fall bruised my knee rather badly and gave me a
  deuce of a shake up. I'm too old for that sort of thing, you know.'</p>

  <p>'Most people are,' said I.</p>

  <p>'True; but you can take a cropper more gracefully at twenty than at
  fifty-five. However, the knee is getting on quite well&mdash;you shall see it
  presently&mdash;and you observe that I am giving it complete rest. But that
  isn't the whole of the trouble or the worst of it. It's my confounded nerves.
  I'm as irritable as the devil and as nervous as a cat. And I can't get a
  decent night's rest.'</p>

  <p>I recalled the tremulous hand that he had offered me. He did not look like
  a drinker, but still&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Do you smoke much?' I inquired diplomatically.</p>

  <p>He looked at me slyly and chuckled. 'That's a very delicate way to
  approach the subject, Doctor,' he said. 'No, I don't smoke much, and I don't
  crook my little finger. I saw you look at my shaky hand just now&mdash;oh,
  it's all right; I'm not offended. It's a doctor's business to keep lifting
  his eyelids. But my hand is steady enough as a rule, when I'm not upset, but
  the least excitement sets me shaking like a jelly. And the fact is that I
  have just had a deucedly unpleasant interview&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I think,' Miss Bellingham interrupted, 'Doctor Berkeley and, in fact, the
  neighbourhood at large, are aware of the fact.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Bellingham laughed rather shamefacedly. 'I'm afraid I did lose my
  temper,' he said; 'but I am always an impulsive old fellow, Doctor, and when
  I'm put out I'm apt to speak my mind&mdash;a little too bluntly perhaps.'</p>

  <p>'And audibly,' his daughter added. 'Do you know that Doctor Berkeley was
  reduced to the necessity of stopping his ears?' She glanced at me as she
  spoke, with something like a twinkle in her solemn grey eyes.</p>

  <p>'Did I shout?' Mr. Bellingham asked, not very contritely, I thought,
  though he added: 'I'm very sorry, my dear; but it won't happen again. I think
  we've seen the last of that good gentleman.'</p>

  <p>'I am sure I hope so,' she rejoined, adding: 'And now I will leave you to
  your talk; I shall be in the next room if you should want me.'</p>

  <p>I opened the door for her, and when she had passed out with a stiff little
  bow I seated myself by the bedside and resumed the consultation. It was
  evidently a case of breakdown, to which the cab accident had, no doubt,
  contributed. As to the other antecedents, they were of no concern of mine,
  though Mr. Bellingham seemed to think otherwise, for he resumed: 'That cab
  business was the last straw, you know, and it finished me off, but I have
  been going down the hill for a long time. I've had a lot of trouble during
  the last two years. But I suppose I oughtn't to pester you with the details
  of my personal affairs.'</p>

  <p>'Anything that bears on your present state of health is of interest to me
  if you don't mind telling me it,' I said.</p>

  <p>'Mind!' he exclaimed. 'Did you ever meet an invalid who didn't enjoy
  talking about his own health? It's the listener who minds, as a rule.'</p>

  <p>'Well, the present listener doesn't,' I said.</p>

  <p>'Then,' said Mr. Bellingham, 'I'll treat myself to the luxury of telling
  you all my troubles; I don't often get the chance of a confidential grumble
  to a responsible man of my own class. And I really have some excuses for
  railing at Fortune, as you will agree when I tell you that, a couple of years
  ago, I went to bed one night a gentleman of independent means and excellent
  prospects and woke up in the morning to find myself practically a beggar. Not
  a cheerful experience that, you know, at my time of life, eh?'</p>

  <p>'No,' I agreed, 'not at any other.'</p>

  <p>'And that was not all,' he continued; 'For at the same moment I lost my
  brother, my dearest, kindest friend. He disappeared&mdash;vanished off the
  face of the earth; but perhaps you have heard of the affair. The confounded
  papers were full of it at the time.'</p>

  <p>He paused abruptly, noticing, no doubt, a sudden change in my face. Of
  course, I recollected the case now. Indeed, ever since I had entered the
  house some chord of memory had been faintly vibrating, and now his last words
  had struck out the full note.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I said, 'I remember the incident, though I don't suppose I should
  but for the fact that our lecturer on medical jurisprudence drew my attention
  to it.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed,' said Mr. Bellingham, rather uneasily, as I fancied. 'What did he
  say about it?'</p>

  <p>'He referred to it as a case that was calculated to give rise to some very
  pretty legal complications.'</p>

  <p>'By Jove!' exclaimed Bellingham, 'that man was a prophet! Legal
  complications, indeed! But I'll be bound he never guessed at the sort of
  infernal tangle that has actually gathered round the affair. By the way, what
  was his name?'</p>

  <p>'Thorndyke,' I replied. 'Doctor John Thorndyke.'</p>

  <p>'Thorndyke,' Mr. Bellingham repeated in a musing, retrospective tone. 'I
  seem to remember the name. Yes, of course. I have heard a legal friend of
  mine, a Mr. Marchmont, speak of him in reference to the case of a man whom I
  knew slightly years ago&mdash;a certain Jeffrey Blackmore, who also
  disappeared very mysteriously. I remember now that Dr. Thorndyke unravelled
  that case with most remarkable ingenuity.'</p>

  <p>'I daresay he would be very much interested to hear about your case,' I
  suggested.</p>

  <p>'I daresay he would,' was the reply; 'but one can't take up a professional
  man's time for nothing, and I couldn't afford to pay him. And that reminds me
  that I'm taking up your time by gossiping about purely personal affairs.'</p>

  <p>'My morning round is finished,' said I, 'and, moreover, your personal
  affairs are highly interesting. I suppose I mustn't ask what is the nature of
  the legal entanglement?'</p>

  <p>'Not unless you are prepared to stay here for the rest of the day and go
  home a raving lunatic. But I'll tell you this much: the trouble is about my
  poor brother's will. In the first place it can't be administered because
  there is not sufficient evidence that my brother is dead; and in the second
  place, if it could, all the property would go to people who were never
  intended to benefit. The will itself is the most diabolically exasperating
  document that was ever produced by the perverted ingenuity of a wrong-headed
  man. That's all. Will you have a look at my knee?'</p>

  <p>As Mr. Bellingham's explanation (delivered in a rapid crescendo and ending
  almost in a shout) had left him purple-faced and trembling, I thought it best
  to bring our talk to an end. Accordingly I proceeded to inspect the injured
  knee, which was now nearly well, and to overhaul my patient generally; and
  having given him detailed instructions as to his general conduct, I rose and
  took my leave.</p>

  <p>'And remember,' I said as I shook his hand, 'no tobacco, no coffee, no
  excitement of any kind. Lead a quiet, bovine life.'</p>

  <p>'That's all very well,' he grumbled, 'but supposing people come here and
  excite me?'</p>

  <p>'Disregard them,' said I, 'and read Whitaker's Almanack.' And with this
  parting advice I passed out into the other room.</p>

  <p>Miss Bellingham was seated at the table with a pile of blue-covered
  notebooks before her, two of which were open, displaying pages closely
  written in a small, neat handwriting. She rose as I entered and looked at me
  inquiringly.</p>

  <p>'I heard you advising my father to read Whitaker's Almanack,' she said.
  'Was that a curative measure?'</p>

  <p>'Entirely,' I replied. 'I recommended it for its medicinal virtues, as an
  antidote to mental excitement.'</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly. 'It certainly is not a highly emotional book,' she
  said, and then asked: 'Have you any other instructions to give?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I might give the conventional advice&mdash;to maintain a cheerful
  outlook and avoid worry; but I don't suppose you would find it very
  helpful.'</p>

  <p>'No,' she answered bitterly; 'it is a counsel of perfection. People in our
  position are not a very cheerful class, I'm afraid; but still they don't seek
  out worries from sheer perverseness. The worries come unsought. But, of
  course, you can't enter into that.'</p>

  <p>'I can't give you any practical help, I fear, though I do sincerely hope
  that your father's affairs will straighten themselves out soon.'</p>

  <p>She thanked me for my good wishes and accompanied me down to the street
  door, where, with a bow and a rather stiff handshake, she gave me my
  conge.</p>

  <p>Very ungratefully the noise of Fetter Lane smote on my ears as I came out
  through the archway, and very squalid and unrestful the little street looked
  when contrasted with the dignity and monastic quiet of the old garden. As to
  the surgery, with its oilcloth floor and walls made hideous with gaudy
  insurance show-cards in sham gilt frailties, its aspect was so revolting that
  I flew to the day-book for distraction, and was still busily entering the
  morning's visits when the bottle-boy, Adolphus, entered stealthily to
  announce lunch.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER III. JOHN THORNDYKE</h3>

  <p>THAT THE character of an individual tends to be reflected in his dress is
  a fact familiar to the least observant. That the observation is equally
  applicable to aggregates of men is less familiar, but equally true. Do not
  the members of the fighting professions, even to this day, deck themselves in
  feathers, in gaudy colours and gilded ornaments, after the manner of the
  African war-chief or the Redskin 'brave', and thereby indicate the place of
  war in modern civilisation? Does not the Church of Rome send her priests to
  the altar in habiliments that were fashionable before the fall of the Roman
  Empire, in token of her immovable conservatism? And, lastly, does not the
  Law, lumbering on in the wake of progress, symbolise its subjection to
  precedent by head-gear reminiscent of the good days of Queen Anne?</p>

  <p>I should apologise for obtruding upon the reader these somewhat trite
  reflections; which were set going by the quaint stock-in-trade of the
  wig-maker's shop in the cloisters of the Inner Temple, whither I strayed on a
  sultry afternoon in quest of shade and quiet. I had halted opposite the
  little shop window, and, with my eyes bent dreamily on the row of wigs, was
  pursuing the above train of thought when I was startled by a deep voice
  saying softly in my ear: 'I'd have the full-bottomed one if I were you.'</p>

  <p>I turned swiftly and rather fiercely, and looked into the face of my old
  friend and fellow-student, Jervis, behind whom, regarding us with a sedate
  smile, stood my former teacher, Dr. John Thorndyke. Both men greeted me with
  a warmth that I felt to be very flattering, for Thorndyke was quite a great
  personage, and even Jervis was several years my academic senior.</p>

  <p>'You are coming in to have a cup of tea with us, I hope,' said Thorndyke;
  and as I assented gladly, he took my arm and led me across the court in the
  direction of the Treasury.</p>

  <p>'But why that hungry gaze at those forensic vanities, Berkeley?' he asked.
  'Are you thinking of following my example and Jervis's&mdash;deserting the
  bedside for the Bar?'</p>

  <p>'What! Has Jervis gone in for the law?' I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>'Bless you, yes!' replied Jervis. 'I have become parasitical on Thorndyke!
  "The big fleas have little fleas", you know. I am the additional fraction
  trailing after the whole number in the rear of a decimal point.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you believe him, Berkeley,' interposed Thorndyke. 'He is the brains
  of the firm. I supply the respectability and moral worth. But you haven't
  answered my question. What are you doing here on a summer afternoon staring
  into a wig-maker's window?'</p>

  <p>'I am Barnard's locum; he is in practice in Fetter Lane.'</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Thorndyke; 'we meet him occasionally, and very pale and
  peaky he has been looking of late. Is he taking a holiday?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He has gone for a trip to the Isles of Greece in a currant
  ship.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' said Jervis, 'you are actually a local GP. I thought you were
  looking beastly respectable.'</p>

  <p>'And judging from your leisured manner when we encountered you,' added
  Thorndyke, 'the practice is not a strenuous one. I suppose it is entirely
  local?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I replied. 'The patients mostly live in the small streets and
  courts within a half-mile radius of the surgery, and the abodes of some of
  them are pretty squalid. Oh! and that reminds me of a very strange
  coincidence. It will interest you, I think.'</p>

  <p>'Life is made up of strange coincidences,' said Thorndyke. 'Nobody but a
  reviewer of novels is ever really surprised at a coincidence. But what is
  yours?'</p>

  <p>'It is connected with a case that you mentioned to us at the hospital
  about two years ago, the case of a man who disappeared under rather
  mysterious circumstances. Do you remember it? The man's name was
  Bellingham.'</p>

  <p>'The Egyptologist? Yes, I remember the case quite well. What about
  it?'</p>

  <p>'The brother is a patient of mine. He is living in Nevill's Court with his
  daughter, and they seem to be as poor as church mice.'</p>

  <p>'Really,' said Thorndyke, 'this is quite interesting. They must have come
  down in the world rather suddenly. If I remember rightly, the brother was
  living in a house of some pretensions standing in its own grounds.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, that is so. I see you recollect all about the case.'</p>

  <p>'My dear fellow,' said Jervis, 'Thorndyke never forgets a likely case. He
  is a sort of medico-legal camel. He gulps down the raw facts from the
  newspapers or elsewhere, and then, in his leisure moments, he calmly
  regurgitates them and has a quiet chew at them. It is a quaint habit. A case
  crops up in the papers or in one of the courts, and Thorndyke swallows it
  whole. Then it lapses and every one forgets it. A year or two later it crops
  up in a new form, and, to your astonishment, you find that Thorndyke has got
  it all cut and dried. He has been ruminating on it periodically in the
  interval.'</p>

  <p>'You notice,' said Thorndyke, 'that my learned friend is pleased to
  indulge in mixed metaphors. But his statement is substantially true, though
  obscurely worded. You must tell us more about the Bellinghams when we have
  fortified you with a cup of tea.'</p>

  <p>Our talk had brought us to Thorndyke's chambers, which were on the first
  floor of No. 5A, King's Bench Walk, and as we entered the fine, spacious,
  panelled room we found a small, elderly man, neatly dressed in black, setting
  out the tea-service on the table. I glanced at him with some curiosity. He
  hardly looked like a servant, in spite of his neat, black clothes: in fact,
  his appearance was rather puzzling, for while his quiet dignity and his
  serious, intelligent face suggested some kind of professional man, his neat,
  capable hands were those of a skilled mechanic.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke surveyed the tea-tray thoughtfully and then looked at his
  retainer. 'I see you have put three tea-cups, Polton,' he said. 'Now, how did
  you know I was bringing some one in to tea?'</p>

  <p>The little man smiled a quaint, crinkly smile of gratification as he
  explained:</p>

  <p>'I happened to look out of the laboratory window as you turned the corner,
  sir.'</p>

  <p>'How disappointingly simple,' said Jervis. 'We were hoping for something
  abstruse and telepathic.'</p>

  <p>'Simplicity is the soul of efficiency, sir,' replied Polton as he checked
  the tea-service to make sure that nothing was forgotten, and with this
  remarkable aphorism he silently evaporated.</p>

  <p>'To return to the Bellingham case,' said Thorndyke, when he had poured out
  the tea. 'Have you picked up any facts relating to the parties&mdash;and
  facts, I mean, of course, that it would be proper for you to mention?'</p>

  <p>'I have learned one or two things that there is no harm in repeating. For
  instance, I gather that Godfrey Bellingham&mdash;my patient&mdash;lost all
  his property quite suddenly about the time of the disappearance.'</p>

  <p>'That is really odd,' said Thorndyke. 'The opposite condition would be
  quite understandable, but one doesn't see exactly how this can have happened,
  unless there was an allowance of some sort.'</p>

  <p>'No, that was what struck me. But there seem to be some queer features in
  the case, and the legal position is evidently getting complicated. There is a
  will, for example, which is giving trouble.'</p>

  <p>'They will be hardly able to administer the will without either proof or
  presumption of death,' Thorndyke remarked.</p>

  <p>'Exactly. That's one of the difficulties. Another is that there seems to
  be some fatal drafting of the will itself. I don't know what it is, but I
  expect I shall hear sooner or later. By the way, I mentioned the interest
  that you have taken in the case, and I think Bellingham would have liked to
  consult you, but, of course, the poor devil has no money.'</p>

  <p>'That is awkward for him if the other interested parties have, There will
  probably be legal proceedings of some kind, and as the law takes no account
  of poverty, he is likely to go to the wall. He ought to have advice of some
  sort.'</p>

  <p>'I don't see how he is to get it,' said I.</p>

  <p>'Neither do I,' Thorndyke admitted. 'There are no hospitals for
  impecunious litigants; it is assumed that only persons of means have a right
  to go to law. Of course, if we knew the man and the circumstances we might be
  able to help him; but for all we know to the contrary, he may be an arrant
  scoundrel.'</p>

  <p>I had recalled the strange conversation that I had overheard, and wondered
  what Thorndyke would have thought of it if it had been allowable for me to
  repeat it. Obviously it was not, however, and I could only give my own
  impressions.</p>

  <p>'He doesn't strike me as that,' I said; 'but, of course, one never knows.
  Personally, he impressed me rather favourably, which is more than the other
  man did.'</p>

  <p>'What other man?' asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'There was another man in the case, wasn't there? I forget his name. I saw
  him at the house and didn't much like the look of him. I suspect he's putting
  some sort of pressure on Bellingham.'</p>

  <p>'Berkeley knows more about this than he's telling us,' said Jervis. 'Let
  us look up the report and see who this stranger is.' He took down from a
  shelf a large volume of newspaper cuttings and laid it on the table.</p>

  <p>'You see,' said he, as he ran his finger down the index. 'Thorndyke files
  all the cases that are likely to come to something, and I know he had
  expectations regarding this one. I fancy he had some ghoulish hope that the
  missing gentleman's head might turn up in somebody's dust-bin. Here we are;
  the other man's name is Hurst. He is apparently a cousin, and it was at his
  house the missing man was last seen alive.'</p>

  <p>'So you think Mr. Hurst is moving in the matter?' said Thorndyke, when he
  had glanced over the report.</p>

  <p>'That is my impression,' I replied, 'though I really know nothing about
  it.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Thorndyke, 'if you should learn what is being done and should
  have permission to speak of it, I shall be very interested to hear how the
  case progresses; and if an unofficial opinion on any point would be of
  service, I think there would be no harm in giving it.'</p>

  <p>'It would certainly be of great value if the other parties are taking
  professional advice,' I said; and then, after a pause, I asked: 'Have you
  given this case much consideration?'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected. 'No,' he said, 'I can't say that I have. I turned it
  over rather carefully when the report first appeared, and I have speculated
  on it occasionally since. It is my habit, as Jervis was telling you, to
  utilise odd moments of leisure (such as a railway journey, for instance) by
  constructing theories to account for the facts of such obscure cases as have
  come to my notice. It is a useful habit, I think, for, apart from the mental
  exercise and experience that one gains from it, an appreciable portion of
  these cases ultimately comes into my hands, and then the previous
  consideration of them is so much time gained.'</p>

  <p>'Have you formed any theory to account for the facts in this case?' I
  asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes; I have several theories, one of which I especially favour, and I am
  awaiting with great interest such new facts as may indicate to me which of
  these theories is probably the correct one.'</p>

  <p>'It's no use your trying to pump him, Berkeley,' said Jervis. 'He is
  fitted with an information valve that opens inwards. You can pour in as much
  as you like, but you can't get any out.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled. 'My learned friend is, in the main, correct,' he said.
  'You see, I may be called upon any day to advise on this case, in which event
  I should feel remarkably foolish if I had already expounded my views in
  detail. But I should like to hear what you and Jervis make of the case as
  reported in the newspapers.'</p>

  <p>'There now,' exclaimed Jervis, 'what did I tell you? He wants to suck your
  brains.'</p>

  <p>'As far as my brain is concerned,' I said, 'the process of suction isn't
  likely to yield much except vacuum, so I will resign in favour of you. You
  are a full-blown lawyer, whereas I am only a simple GP.'</p>

  <p>Jervis filled his pipe with deliberate care and lighted it. Then, blowing
  a slender stream of smoke into the air, he said:</p>

  <p>'If you want to know what I make of the case from that report, I can tell
  you in one word&mdash;nothing. Every road seems to end in a cul-de-sac.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, come!' said Thorndyke, 'this is mere laziness. Berkeley wants to
  witness a display of your forensic wisdom. A learned counsel may be in a
  fog&mdash;he very often is&mdash;but he doesn't state the fact baldly; he
  wraps it up in a decent verbal disguise. Tell us how you arrive at your
  conclusion. Show us that you have really weighed the facts.'</p>

  <p>'Very well,' said Jervis, 'I will give you a masterly analysis of the
  case&mdash;leading to nothing.' He continued to puff at his pipe for a time
  with slight embarrassment, as I thought&mdash;and I fully sympathised with
  him. Finally he blew a little cloud and commenced:</p>

  <p>'The position appears to be this: Here is a man seen to enter a certain
  house, who is shown into a certain room, and shut in. He is not seen to come
  out, and yet, when the room is next entered, it is found to be empty; and
  that man is never seen again, alive or dead. That is a pretty tough
  beginning.</p>

  <p>'Now, it is evident that one of three things must have happened. Either he
  must have remained in that room, or at least in that house, alive; or he must
  have died, naturally or otherwise, and his body have been concealed; or he
  must have left the house unobserved. Let us take the first case. Now, he
  couldn't have remained alive in the house for two years. This affair happened
  nearly two years ago. He would have been noticed. The servants, for instance,
  when cleaning out the rooms, would have observed him.'</p>

  <p>Here Thorndyke interposed with an indulgent smile at his junior: 'My
  learned friend is treating the inquiry with unbecoming levity. We accept the
  conclusion that the man did not remain in the house alive.'</p>

  <p>'Very well. Then did he remain in it dead? Apparently not. The report says
  that as soon as the man was missed, Hurst and the servants together searched
  the house thoroughly. But there had been no time or opportunity to dispose of
  the body, whence the only possible conclusion is that the body was not there.
  Moreover, if we admit the possibility of his having been murdered&mdash;for
  that is what concealment of the body would imply&mdash;there is the question:
  Who could have murdered him? Not the servants, obviously, and as to
  Hurst&mdash;well, of course, we don't know what his relations with the
  missing man may have been&mdash;at least, I don't.'&mdash;</p>

  <p>'Neither do I,' said Thorndyke. 'I know nothing beyond what is in the
  newspaper report and what Berkeley has told us.'</p>

  <p>'Then we know nothing. He may have had a motive for murdering the man or
  he may not. The point is that he doesn't seem to have had the opportunity.
  Even if we suppose that he managed to conceal the body temporarily, still
  there was the final disposal of it. He couldn't have buried it in the garden
  with the servants about; neither could he have burned it. The only
  conceivable method by which he could have got rid of it would have been that
  of cutting it up into fragments and burying the dismembered parts in some
  secluded spots or dropping them into ponds or rivers. But no remains of the
  kind have been found, as some of them probably would have been by now, so
  that there is nothing to support this suggestion; indeed, the idea of murder,
  in this house at least, seems to be excluded by the search that was made the
  instant the man was missed.</p>

  <p>'Then to take the third alternative: Did he leave the house unobserved?
  Well, it is not impossible, but it would be a queer thing to do. He may have
  been an impulsive or eccentric man. We can't say. We know nothing about him.
  But two years have clasped and he has never turned up, so that if he left the
  house secretly he must have gone into hiding and be hiding still. Of course,
  he may have been the sort of lunatic who would behave in that manner or he
  may not. We have no information as to his personal character.</p>

  <p>'Then there is the complication of the scarab that was picked up in the
  grounds of his brother's house at Woodford. That seems to show that he
  visited that house at some time. But no one admits having seen him there; and
  it is uncertain, therefore, whether he went first to his brother's house or
  to Hurst's. If he was wearing the scarab when he arrived at the Eltham house,
  he must have left that house unobserved and gone to Woodford; but if he was
  not wearing it he probably went from Woodford to Eltham, and there finally
  disappeared. As to whether he was or was not wearing the scarab when he was
  last seen alive by Hurst's housemaid, there is at present no evidence.</p>

  <p>'If he went to his brother's house after his visit to Hurst, the
  disappearance is more understandable if we don't mind flinging accusations of
  murder about rather casually; for the disposal of the body would be much less
  difficult in that case. Apparently no one saw him enter the house, and, if he
  did enter, it was by a back gate which communicated with the library&mdash;a
  separate building some distance from the house. In that case it would have
  been physically possible for the Bellinghams to have made away with him.
  There was plenty of time to dispose of the body unobserved&mdash;temporarily,
  at any rate. Nobody had seen him come to the house, and nobody knew that he
  was there&mdash;if he was there; and apparently no search was made either at
  the time or afterwards. In fact, if it could be shown that the missing man
  left Hurst's house alive, or that he was wearing the scarab when he arrived
  there, things would look rather fishy for the Bellinghams&mdash;for, of
  course, the girl must have been in it if the father was. But there's the
  crux: there is no proof that the man ever did leave Hurst's house alive. And
  if he didn't&mdash;but there! as I said at first, whichever turning you take,
  you find that it ends in a blind alley.'&mdash;</p>

  <p>'A lame ending to a masterly exposition,' was Thorndyke's comment.</p>

  <p>'I know,' said Jervis. 'But what would you have? There are quite a number
  of possible solutions, and one of them must be the true one. But how are we
  to judge which it is? I maintain that until we know something of the parties
  and the financial and other interests involved we have no data.'</p>

  <p>'There,' said Thorndyke, 'I disagree with you entirely. I maintain that we
  have ample data. You say that we have no means of judging which of the
  various possible solutions is the true one; but I think that if you read the
  report carefully and thoughtfully you will find that the facts now known
  point clearly to one explanation, and one only. It may not be the true
  explanation, and I don't suppose it is. But we are now dealing with the
  matter speculatively, academically, and I contend that our data yield a
  definite conclusion. What do you say, Berkeley?'</p>

  <p>'I say that it is time for me to be off; the evening consultations begin
  at half-past six.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Thorndyke, 'don't let us keep you from your duties, with poor
  Barnard currant-picking in the Grecian Isles. But come in and see us again.
  Drop in when you like after your work is done. You won't be in our way even
  if we are busy, which we very seldom are after eight o'clock.'</p>

  <p>I thanked Dr. Thorndyke most heartily for making me free of his chambers
  in this hospitable fashion and took my leave, setting forth homewards by way
  of Middle Temple Lane and the Embankment; not a very direct route for Fetter
  Lane, it must be confessed; but our talk had revived my interest in the
  Bellingham household and put me in a reflective vein.</p>

  <p>From the remarkable conversation that I had overheard it was evident that
  the plot was thickening. Not that I supposed that these two respectable
  gentlemen really suspected one another of having made away with the missing
  man; but still, their unguarded words, spoken in anger, made it clear that
  each had allowed the thought of sinister possibilities to enter his
  mind&mdash;a dangerous condition that might easily grow into actual
  suspicion. And then the circumstances really were highly mysterious, as I
  realised with especial vividness now after listening to my friend's analysis
  of the evidence.</p>

  <p>From the problem itself my mind travelled, not for the first time during
  the last few days, to the handsome girl, who had seemed in my eyes the
  high-priestess of this temple of mystery in the quaint little court. What a
  strange figure she had made against this strange background, with her quiet,
  chilly, self-contained manner, her pale face, so sad and worn, her black,
  straight brows and solemn grey eyes, so inscrutable, mysterious, Sibylline. A
  striking, even impressive, personality this, I reflected, with something in
  it sombre and enigmatic that attracted and yet repelled.</p>

  <p>And here I recalled Jervis's words: 'The girl must have been in it if the
  father was.' It was a dreadful thought, even though only speculatively
  uttered, and my heart rejected it; rejected it with indignation that rather
  surprised me. And this notwithstanding that the sombre black-robed figure
  that my memory conjured up was one that associated itself with the idea of
  mystery and tragedy.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IV. LEGAL COMPLICATIONS AND A JACKAL</h3>

  <p>MY MEDITATIONS brought me by a circuitous route, and ten minutes late, to
  the end of Fetter Lane, where, exchanging my rather abstracted air for the
  alert manner of a busy practitioner, I strode briskly forward and darted into
  the surgery with knitted brows, as though just released from an anxious case.
  But there was only one patient waiting, and she saluted me as I entered with
  a snort of defiance.</p>

  <p>'Here you are, then?' said she.</p>

  <p>'You are perfectly correct, Miss Oman,' I replied; 'in fact, you have put
  the case in a nutshell. What can I have the pleasure of doing for you?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing,' was the answer. 'My medical adviser is a lady; but I've brought
  a note from Mr. Bellingham. Here it is,' and she thrust the envelope into my
  hand.</p>

  <p>I glanced through the note and learned that my patient had had a couple of
  bad nights and a very harassing day. 'Could I have something to give me a
  night's rest?' it concluded.</p>

  <p>I reflected for a few moments. One is not very ready to prescribe sleeping
  draughts for unknown patients, but still, insomnia is a very distressing
  condition. In the end I temporised with a moderate dose of bromide, deciding
  to call and see if more energetic measures were necessary.</p>

  <p>'He had better take a dose of this at once, Miss Oman,' said I, as I
  handed her the bottle, 'and I will look in later and see how he is.'</p>

  <p>'I expect he will be glad to see you,' she answered, 'for he is all alone
  to-night and very dumpy. Miss Bellingham is out. But I must remind you that
  he's a poor man and pays his way. You must excuse my mentioning it.'</p>

  <p>'I am much obliged to you for the hint, Miss Oman,' I rejoined. 'It isn't
  necessary for me to see him, but I should like just to look in and have a
  chat.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, it will do him good. You have your points, though punctuality
  doesn't seem to be one of them,' and with this parting shot Miss Oman bustled
  away.</p>

  <p>Half-past eight found me ascending the great, dim staircase the house in
  Nevill's Court preceded by Miss Oman, by whom I was ushered into the room.
  Mr. Bellingham, who had just finished some sort of meal, was sitting hunched
  up in his chair gazing gloomily into the empty grate. He brightened up as I
  entered, but was evidently in very low spirits.</p>

  <p>'I didn't mean to drag you out after your day's work was finished,' he
  said, 'though I am very glad to see you.'</p>

  <p>'You haven't dragged me out. I heard you were alone, so I just dropped in
  for a few minutes' gossip.'</p>

  <p>'That is really kind of you,' he said heartily. 'But I'm afraid you'll
  find me rather poor company. A man who is full of his own highly disagreeable
  affairs is not a desirable companion.'</p>

  <p>'You mustn't let me disturb you if you'd rather be alone,' said I, with a
  sudden fear that I was intruding.</p>

  <p>'Oh, you won't disturb me,' he replied; adding, with a laugh: 'It's more
  likely to be the other way about. In fact, if I were not afraid of boring you
  to death I would ask you to let me talk my difficulties over with you.'</p>

  <p>'You won't bore me,' I said. 'It is generally interesting to share another
  man's experiences without their inconveniences. "The proper study of mankind
  is&mdash;man," you know, especially to a doctor.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Bellingham chuckled grimly. 'You make me feel like a microbe,' he
  said. 'However, if you would care to take a peep at me through your
  microscope, I will crawl on to the stage for your inspection, though it is
  not my actions that furnish the materials for your psychological studies. It
  is my poor brother who is the Deus ex machina, who, from his unknown grave,
  as I fear, pulls the strings of this infernal puppet-show.'</p>

  <p>He paused and for a space gazed thoughtfully into the grate as if he had
  forgotten my presence. At length he looked up and resumed:</p>

  <p>'It is a curious story, Doctor&mdash;a very curious story. Part of it you
  know&mdash;the middle part. I will tell you it from the beginning, and then
  you will know as much as I do; for, as to the end, that is known to no one.
  It is written, no doubt, in the book of destiny, but the page has yet to be
  turned.</p>

  <p>'The mischief began with my father's death. He was a country clergyman of
  very moderate means, a widower with two children, my brother John and me. He
  managed to send us both to Oxford, after which John went into the Foreign
  Office and I was to have gone into the Church. But I suddenly discovered that
  my views on religion had undergone a change that made this impossible, and
  just about this time my father came into a quite considerable property. Now,
  as it was his expressed intention to leave the estate equally divided between
  my brother and me, there was no need for me to take up any profession for a
  livelihood. Archaeology was already the passion of my life, and I determined
  to devote myself henceforth to my favourite study, in which, by the way, I
  was following a family tendency; for my father was an enthusiastic student of
  ancient Oriental history, and John was, as you know, an ardent
  Egyptologist.</p>

  <p>'Then my father died quite suddenly, and left no will. He had intended to
  have one drawn up, but had put it off until it was too late. And since nearly
  all the property was in the form of real estate, my brother inherited
  practically the whole of it. However, in deference to the known wishes of my
  father, he made me an allowance of five hundred a year, which was about a
  quarter of the annual income. I urged him to assign me a lump sum, but he
  refused to do this. Instead, he instructed his solicitor to pay me an
  allowance in quarterly instalments during the rest of his life; and it was
  understood that, on his death, the entire estate should devolve on me, or if
  I died first, on my daughter, Ruth. Then, as you know, he disappeared
  suddenly, and as the circumstances suggested that he was dead, and there was
  no evidence that he was alive, his solicitor&mdash;a Mr. Jellicoe&mdash;found
  himself unable to continue the payment of the allowance. On the other hand,
  as there was no positive evidence that my brother was dead, it was impossible
  to administer the will.'</p>

  <p>'You say the circumstances suggested that your brother was dead. What
  circumstances were they?'</p>

  <p>'Principally the suddenness and completeness of the disappearance. His
  luggage, as you may remember, was found lying unclaimed at the railway
  station; and there was another circumstance even more suggestive. My brother
  drew a pension from the Foreign Office, for which he had to apply in person,
  or, if abroad, produce proof that he was alive on the date when the payment
  became due. Now, he was exceedingly regular in this respect; in fact, he had
  never been known to fail, either to appear in person or to transmit the
  necessary documents to his agent, Mr. Jellicoe. But from the moment when he
  vanished so mysteriously to the present day, nothing whatever has been heard
  of him.'</p>

  <p>'It's a very awkward position for you,' I said, 'but I should think there
  will not be much difficulty in obtaining the permission of the Court to
  presume death and to proceed to prove the will.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Bellingham made a wry face. 'I expect you are right,' he said, 'but
  that doesn't help me much. You see, Mr. Jellicoe, having waited a reasonable
  time for my brother to reappear, took a very unusual but, I think, in the
  special circumstances, a very proper step: he summoned me and the other
  interested party to his office and communicated to us the provisions of the
  will. And very extraordinary provisions they turned out to be. I was
  thunderstruck when I heard them. And the exasperating thing is that I feel
  sure my poor brother imagined that he had made everything perfectly safe and
  simple.'</p>

  <p>'They generally do,' I said, rather vaguely.</p>

  <p>'I suppose they do,' said Mr. Bellingham; 'but poor John has made the most
  infernal hash of his will, and I am certain that he has utterly defeated his
  own intentions. You see, we are an old London family. The house in Queen
  Square where my brother nominally lived, but actually kept his collection,
  has been occupied by us for generations, and most of the Bellinghams are
  buried in St George's burial-ground close by, though some members of the
  family are buried in other churchyards in the neighbourhood. Now, my
  brother&mdash;who, by the way, was a bachelor&mdash;had a strong feeling for
  the family traditions, and he stipulated, not unnaturally, in his will that
  he should be buried in St George's burial-ground among his ancestors, or, at
  least, in one of the places of burial appertaining to his native parish. But
  instead of simply expressing the wish and directing his executors to carry it
  out, he made it a condition affecting the operation of the will.'</p>

  <p>'Affecting it in what respect?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'In a very vital respect,' answered Mr. Bellingham. 'The bulk of the
  property he bequeathed to me, or if I predeceased him, to my daughter Ruth.
  But the bequest was subject to the condition I have mentioned&mdash;that he
  should be buried in a certain place&mdash;and if that condition was not
  fulfilled, the bulk of the property was to go to my cousin, George
  Hurst.'</p>

  <p>'But in that case,' said I, 'as you can't produce the body, neither of you
  can get the property.'</p>

  <p>'I am not so sure of that,' he replied. 'If my brother is dead, it is
  pretty certain that he is not buried in St George's or any of the other
  places mentioned, and the fact can easily be proved by; production of the
  registers. So that a permission to presume death would result in the handing
  over to Hurst of almost the entire estate.'</p>

  <p>'Who is the executor?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Ah!' he exclaimed, 'there is another muddle. There are two executors;
  Jellicoe is one, and the other is the principal beneficiary&mdash;Hurst or
  myself, as the case may be. But, you see, neither of us can become an
  executor until the Court has decided which of us is the principal
  beneficiary.'</p>

  <p>'But who is to apply to the Court? I thought that was the business of the
  executors.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly, that is Hurst's difficulty. We were discussing it when you
  called the other day, and a very animated discussion it was,' he '. added,
  with a grim smile. 'You see, Jellicoe naturally refuses to move in the matter
  alone. He says he must have the support of the other executor. But Hurst is
  not at present the other executor; neither am I. But the two of us together
  are the co-executor, since the duty devolves upon one or other of us, in any
  case.'</p>

  <p>'It's a complicated position,' I said.</p>

  <p>'It is; and the complication has elicited a very curious proposal from
  Hurst. He points out&mdash;quite correctly, I am afraid&mdash;that as the
  conditions as to burial have not been complied with, the property must come
  to him, and he proposes a very neat little arrangement, which is this: That I
  shall support him and Jellicoe in their application for permission to presume
  death and to administer the will, and that he shall pay me four hundred a
  year for life; the arrangement to hold good in all eventualities.'</p>

  <p>'What does he mean by that?'</p>

  <p>'He means,' said Bellingham, fixing me with a ferocious scowl, 'that if
  the body should turn up at any future time, so that the conditions as to
  burial should be able to be carried out, he should still retain the property
  and pay me the four hundred a year.'&mdash;</p>

  <p>'The deuce!' said I. 'He seems to know how to drive a bargain.'</p>

  <p>'His position is that he stands to lose four hundred a year for the term
  of my life if the body is never found, and he ought to stand to win if it
  is.'</p>

  <p>'And I gather that you have refused this offer?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; very emphatically, and my daughter agrees with me; but I am not sure
  that I have done the right thing. A man should think twice, I suppose, before
  he burns his boats.'</p>

  <p>'Have you spoken to Mr. Jellicoe about the matter?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I have been to see him to-day. He is a cautious man, and he doesn't
  advise me one way or the other. But I think he disapproves of my refusal; in
  fact, he remarked that a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,
  especially when the whereabouts of the bush is unknown.'</p>

  <p>'Do you think he will apply to the Court without your sanction?'</p>

  <p>'He doesn't want to; but I suppose, if Hurst puts pressure on him, he will
  have to. Besides, Hurst, as an interested party, could apply on his own
  account, and after my refusal he probably will; at least, that is Jellicoe's
  opinion.'</p>

  <p>'The whole thing is a most astonishing muddle,' I said, 'especially when
  one remembers that your brother had a lawyer to advise him. Didn't Mr.
  Jellicoe point out to him how absurd the provisions were?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, he did. He tells me that he implored my brother to let him draw up a
  will embodying the matter in a reasonable form. But John wouldn't listen to
  him. Poor old fellow! he could be very pigheaded when he chose.'</p>

  <p>'And is Hurst's proposal still open?'</p>

  <p>'No, thanks to my peppery temper. I refused it very definitely, and sent
  him off with a flea in his ear. I hope I have not made a false step; I was
  quite taken by surprise when Hurst made the proposal and got rather angry.
  You remember, my brother was last seen alive at Hurst's house&mdash;but
  there, I oughtn't to talk like that, and I oughtn't to pester you with my
  confounded affairs when you come in for a friendly chat, though I gave you
  fair warning, you remember.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, but you have been highly entertaining. You don't realise what an
  interest I take in your case.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Bellingham laughed somewhat grimly. 'My case!' he repeated. 'You speak
  as if I were some rare and curious sort of criminal lunatic. However, I'm
  glad you find me amusing. It's more than I find myself.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't say amusing; I said interesting. I view you with deep respect as
  the central figure of a stirring drama. And I am not the only person who
  regards you in that light. Do you remember my speaking to you of Doctor
  Thorndyke?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course I do.'</p>

  <p>'Well, oddly enough, I met him this afternoon and we had a long talk at
  his chambers. I took the liberty of mentioning that I had made your
  acquaintance. Did I do wrong?'</p>

  <p>'No. Certainly not. Why shouldn't you tell him? Did he remember my
  infernal case, as you call it?'</p>

  <p>'Perfectly, in all its details. He is quite an enthusiast, you know, and
  uncommonly keen to hear how the case develops.'</p>

  <p>'So am I, for that matter,' said Mr. Bellingham.</p>

  <p>'I wonder,' said I, 'if you would mind my telling him what you have told
  me to-night? It would interest him enormously.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Bellingham reflected for a while with his eyes fixed on the empty
  grate. Presently he looked up, and said slowly:</p>

  <p>'I don't know why I should. It's no secret; and if it were, I hold no
  monopoly on it. No; tell him, if you think he'd care to hear about it.'</p>

  <p>'You needn't be afraid of his talking,' I said. 'He's as close as an
  oyster; and the facts may mean more to him than they do to us. He may be able
  to give a useful hint or two.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I'm not going to pick his brains,' Mr. Bellingham said quickly and
  with some wrath. 'I'm not the sort of man who goes round cadging for free
  professional advice. Understand that, Doctor?'</p>

  <p>'I do,' I answered hastily. 'That wasn't what I meant at all. Is that Miss
  Bellingham coming in? I heard the front door shut.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, that will be my girl, I expect; but don't run away. You're not
  afraid of her, are you?' he added as I hurriedly picked up my hat.</p>

  <p>'I'm not sure that I'm not,' I answered. 'She is rather a majestic young
  lady.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Bellingham chuckled and smothered a yawn, and at that moment his
  daughter entered the room; and, in spite of her shabby black dress and a
  shabbier handbag that she carried, I thought her appearance and manner fully
  justified my description.</p>

  <p>'You come in, Miss Bellingham,' I said as she shook my hand with cool
  civility, 'to find your father yawning and me taking my departure. So I have
  my uses, you see. My conversation is the infallible cure for insomnia.'</p>

  <p>Miss Bellingham smiled. 'I believe I am driving you away,' she said.</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' I replied hastily. 'My mission was accomplished, that was
  all.'</p>

  <p>'Sit down for a few moments, Doctor,' urged Mr. Bellingham, 'and let Ruth
  sample the remedy. She will be affronted if you run away as soon as she comes
  in.'</p>

  <p>'Well, you mustn't let me keep you up,' I said.</p>

  <p>'Oh, I'll let you know when I fall asleep,' he replied, with a chuckle;
  and with this understanding I sat down again&mdash;not at all
  unwillingly.</p>

  <p>At this moment Miss Oman entered with a small tray and a smile of which I
  should not have supposed her capable.</p>

  <p>'You'll take your toast and cocoa while they're hot, dear, won't you?' she
  said coaxingly.</p>

  <p>'Yes, I will, Phyllis, thank you,' Miss Bellingham answered. 'I am only
  just going to take off my hat,' and she left the room, followed by the
  astonishingly transfigured spinster.</p>

  <p>She returned almost immediately as Mr. Bellingham was in the midst of a
  profound yawn, and sat down to her frugal meal, when her father mystified me
  considerably by remarking:</p>

  <p>'You're late to-night, chick. Have the Shepherd Kings been giving
  trouble?'</p>

  <p>'No,' she replied; 'but I thought I might as well get them done. So I
  dropped in at the Ormond Street library on my way home and finished
  them.'</p>

  <p>'Then they are ready for stuffing now?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.' As she answered she caught my astonished eye (for a stuffed
  Shepherd King is undoubtedly a somewhat surprising phenomenon) and laughed
  softly.</p>

  <p>'We mustn't talk in riddles like this,' she said, 'before Doctor Berkeley,
  or he will turn us both into pillars of salt. My father is referring to my
  work,' she explained to me.</p>

  <p>'Are you a taxidermist, then?' I asked.</p>

  <p>She hastily set down the cup that she was raising to her lips and broke
  into a ripple of quiet laughter.</p>

  <p>'I am afraid my father has misled you with his irreverent expressions. He
  will have to atone by explaining.'</p>

  <p>'You see, Doctor,' said Mr. Bellingham, 'Ruth is a literary
  searcher&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh, don't call me a searcher!' Miss Bellingham protested. 'It suggests
  the female searcher at a police-station. Say investigator.'</p>

  <p>'Very well, investigator or investigatrix, if you like. She hunts up
  references and bibliographies at the Museum for people who are writing books.
  She looks up everything that has been written on a given subject, and then,
  when she has crammed herself to a bursting-point with facts, she goes to her
  client and disgorges and crams him or her, and he or she finally disgorges
  into the Press.'</p>

  <p>'What a disgusting way to put it!' said his daughter. 'However, that is
  what it amounts to. I am a literary jackal, a collector of provender for the
  literary lions. Is that quite clear?'</p>

  <p>'Perfectly. But I don't think that, even now, I quite understand about the
  stuffed Shepherd Kings.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, it was not the Shepherd Kings who were to be stuffed. It was the
  author! That was mere obscurity of speech on the part of my father. The
  position is this: A venerable Archdeacon wrote an article on the patriarch
  Joseph&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And didn't know anything about him,' interrupted Mr. Bellingham, 'and got
  tripped up by a specialist who did, and then got shirty&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Nothing of the kind,' said Miss Bellingham. 'He knew as much as venerable
  archdeacons ought to know; but the expert knew more. So the archdeacon
  commissioned me to collect the literature on the state of Egypt at the end of
  the seventeenth dynasty, which I have done; and to-morrow I shall go and
  stuff him, as my father expresses it, and then&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'And then,' Mr. Bellingham interrupted, 'the archdeacon will rush forth
  and pelt that expert with Shepherd Kings and Sequenen-Ra and the whole
  tag-rag and bobtail of the seventeenth dynasty. Oh, there'll be wigs on the
  green, I can tell you.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I expect there will be quite a skirmish,' said Miss Bellingham. And
  thus dismissing the subject she made an energetic attack on the toast while
  her father refreshed himself with a colossal yawn.</p>

  <p>I watched her with furtive admiration and deep and growing interest. In
  spite of her pallor, her weary eyes, and her drawn and almost haggard face,
  she was an exceedingly handsome girl; and there was in her aspect a
  suggestion of purpose, of strength and character that marked her off from the
  rank and file of womanhood. I noted this as I stole an occasional glance at
  her or turned to answer some remark addressed to me; and I noted, too, that
  her speech, despite a general undertone of depression, was yet not without a
  certain caustic, ironical humour. She was certainly a rather enigmatical
  young person, but very decidedly interesting.</p>

  <p>When she had finished her repast she put aside the tray and, opening the
  shabby handbag, asked:</p>

  <p>'Do you take any interest in Egyptian history? We are as mad as hatters on
  the subject. It seems to be a family complaint.'</p>

  <p>'I don't know much about it,' I answered. 'Medical studies are rather
  engrossing and don't leave much time for general reading.'</p>

  <p>'Naturally,' she said. 'You can't specialise in everything. But if you
  would care to see how the business of a literary jackal is conducted, I will
  show you my notes.'</p>

  <p>I accepted the offer eagerly (not, I fear, from pure enthusiasm for the
  subject), and she brought forth from the bag four blue-covered, quarto
  notebooks, each dealing with one of the four dynasties from the fourteenth to
  the seventeenth. As I glanced through the neat and orderly extracts with
  which they were filled we discussed the intricacies of the peculiarly
  difficult and confused period that they covered, gradually lowering our
  voices as Mr. Bellingham's eyes closed and his head fell against the back of
  his chair. We had just reached the critical reign of Apepa II when a
  resounding snore broke in upon the studious quiet of the room and sent us
  both into a fit of silent laughter.</p>

  <p>'Your conversation has done its work,' she whispered as I stealthily
  picked up my hat, and together we stole on tiptoe to the door, which she
  opened without a sound. Once outside, she suddenly dropped her bantering
  manner and said quite earnestly:</p>

  <p>'How kind it was of you to come and see him to-night! You have done him a
  world of good, and I am most grateful. Good-night!'</p>

  <p>She shook hands with me really cordially, and I took my way down the
  creaking stairs in a whirl of happiness that I was quite at a loss to account
  for.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER V. THE WATERCRESS-BED</h3>

  <p>BARNARD'S PRACTICE, like most others, was subject to those fluctuations
  that fill the struggling practitioner alternately with hope and despair. The
  work came in paroxysms with intervals of almost complete stagnation. One of
  these intermissions occurred on the day after my visit to Nevill's Court,
  with the result that by half-past eleven I found myself wondering what I
  should do with the remainder of the day. The better to consider this weighty
  problem, I strolled down to the Embankment, and, leaning on the parapet,
  contemplated the view across the river; the grey stone bridge with its
  perspective of arches, the picturesque pile of the shot-towers, and beyond,
  the shadowy shapes of the Abbey and St Stephen's.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant scene, restful and quiet, with a touch of life and a
  hint of sober romance, when a barge swept down through the&mdash;middle arch
  of the bridge with a lugsail hoisted to a jury mast and a white-aproned woman
  at the tiller. Dreamily I watched the craft creep by upon the moving tide,
  noted the low freeboard, almost awash, the careful helmswoman, and the dog on
  the forecastle yapping at the distant shore&mdash;and thought of Ruth
  Bellingham.</p>

  <p>What was there about this strange girl that had made so deep an impression
  on me? That was the question that I propounded to myself, and not for the
  first time. Of the fact itself there was no doubt. But what was the
  explanation? Was it her unusual surroundings? Her occupation and rather
  recondite learning? Her striking personality and exceptional good looks? Or
  her connection with the dramatic mystery of her lost uncle?</p>

  <p>I concluded that it was all of these. Everything connected with her was
  unusual and arresting; but over and above these circumstances there was a
  certain sympathy and personal affinity of which I was strongly conscious and
  of which I dimly hoped that she, perhaps, was a little conscious too. At any
  rate, I was deeply interested in her; of that there was no doubt whatever.
  Short as our acquaintance had been, she held a place in my thoughts that had
  never been held by any other woman.</p>

  <p>From Ruth Bellingham my reflections passed by a natural transition to the
  curious story that her father had told me. It was a queer affair, that
  ill-drawn will, with the baffled lawyer protesting in the background. It
  almost seemed as if there must be something behind it all, especially when I
  remembered Mr. Hurst's very singular proposal. But it was out of my depth; it
  was a case for a lawyer, and to a lawyer it should go. This very night, I
  resolved, I would go to Thorndyke and give him the whole story as it had been
  told to me.</p>

  <p>And then there happened one of those coincidences at which we all wonder
  when they occur, but which are so frequent as to have become enshrined in a
  proverb. For even as I formed the resolution, I observed two men approaching
  from the direction of Blackfriars, and recognised in them my quondam teacher
  and his junior.</p>

  <p>'I was just thinking about you,' I said as they came up.</p>

  <p>'Very flattering,' replied Jervis; 'but I thought you had to talk of the
  devil.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' suggested Thorndyke, 'he was talking to himself. But why were
  you thinking of us, and what was the nature of your thoughts?'</p>

  <p>'My thoughts had reference to the Bellingham case. I spent the whole of
  last evening at Nevill's Court.'</p>

  <p>'Ha! And are there any fresh developments?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, by Jove! there are. Bellingham gave me a full detailed description
  of the will; and a pretty document it seems to be.'</p>

  <p>'Did he give you permission to repeat the details to me?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I asked specifically if I might, and he had no objection
  whatever.'</p>

  <p>'Good. We are lunching at Soho to-day as Polton has his hands full. Come
  with us and share our table and tell us your story as we go. Will that suit
  you?'</p>

  <p>It suited me admirably in the present state of the practice, and I
  accepted the invitation with undissembled glee.</p>

  <p>'Very well,' said Thorndyke; 'then let us walk slowly and finish with
  matters confidential before we plunge into the madding crowd.'</p>

  <p>We set forth at a leisurely pace along the broad pavement and I commenced
  my narration. As well as I could remember, I related the circumstances that
  had led up to the present disposition of the property and then proceeded to
  the actual provisions of the will; to all of which my two friends listened
  with rapt interest, Thorndyke occasionally stopping me to jot down a
  memorandum in his pocket-book.</p>

  <p>'Why, the fellow must have been a stark lunatic!' Jervis exclaimed, when I
  had finished. 'He seems to have laid himself out with the most devilish
  ingenuity to defeat his own ends.'</p>

  <p>'That is not an uncommon peculiarity with testators,' Thorndyke remarked.
  'A direct and perfectly intelligible will is rather the exception. But we can
  hardly judge until we have seen the actual document. I suppose Bellingham
  hasn't a copy?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' said I; 'but I will ask him.'</p>

  <p>'If he has one, I should like to look through it,' said Thorndyke. 'The
  provisions are very peculiar, and, as Jervis says, admirably calculated to
  defeat the testator's wishes if they have been correctly reported. And, apart
  from that, they have a remarkable bearing on the circumstances of the
  disappearance. I daresay you noticed that.'</p>

  <p>'I noticed that it is very much to Hurst's advantage that the body has not
  been found.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course. But there are some other points that are very
  significant. However, it would be premature to discuss the terms of the will
  until we have seen the actual document or a certified copy.'</p>

  <p>'If there is a copy extant,' I said, 'I will try to get hold of it. But
  Bellingham is terribly afraid of being suspected of a desire to get
  professional advice gratis.'</p>

  <p>'That,' said Thorndyke, 'is natural enough, and not discreditable. But you
  must overcome his scruples somehow. I expect you will be able to. You are a
  plausible young gentleman, as I remember of old, and you seem to have
  established yourself as quite the friend of the family.'</p>

  <p>'They are rather interesting people,' I explained; 'very cultivated and
  with a strong leaning towards archaeology. It seems to be in the blood.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Thorndyke; 'a family tendency, probably due to contact and
  common surroundings rather than heredity. So you like Godfrey
  Bellingham?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He is a trifle peppery and impulsive, but quite an agreeable, genial
  old butler.'</p>

  <p>'And the daughter,' said Jervis, 'what is she like?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, she is a learned lady; works up bibliographies and references at the
  Museum.'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' Jervis exclaimed with disfavour, 'I know the breed. Inky fingers; no
  chest to speak of; all side and spectacles.'</p>

  <p>'You're quite wrong,' I exclaimed indignantly, contrasting Jervis's
  hideous presentment with the comely original. 'She is an exceedingly
  good-looking girl, and her manners all that a lady's should be. A little
  stiff, perhaps, but then I am only an acquaintance&mdash;almost a
  stranger.'</p>

  <p>'But,' Jervis persisted, 'what is she like, in appearance I mean. Short?
  fat? sandy? Give us intelligible details.'</p>

  <p>I made a rapid mental inventory, assisted by my recent cogitations.</p>

  <p>'She is about five feet seven, slim but rather plump, very erect in
  carriage and graceful in movements; black hair, loosely parted in the middle
  and falling very prettily away from the forehead; pale, clear complexion,
  dark grey eyes, straight eyebrows, straight, well-shaped nose, short mouth,
  rather full; round chin&mdash;what the deuce are you grinning at, Jervis?'
  For my friend had suddenly unmasked his batteries and now threatened, like
  the Cheshire cat, to dissolve into a mere abstraction of amusement.</p>

  <p>'If there is a copy of that will, Thorndyke,' he said, 'we shall get it. I
  think you agree with me, reverend senior?'</p>

  <p>'I have already said,' was the reply, 'that I put my trust in Berkeley.
  And now let us dismiss professional topics. This is our hostelry.'</p>

  <p>He pushed open an unpretentious glazed door, and we followed him into the
  restaurant, whereof the atmosphere was pervaded by an appetising mealiness
  mingled with less agreeable suggestions of the destructive distillation of
  fat.</p>

  <p>It was some two hours later when I wished my friends adieu under the
  golden-leaved plane trees of King's Bench Walk.</p>

  <p>'I won't ask you to come in now,' said Thorndyke, 'as we have some
  consultations this afternoon. But come in and see us soon; don't wait for
  that copy of the will.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Jervis. 'Drop in in the evening when your work is done; unless,
  of course, there is more attractive society elsewhere. Oh, you needn't turn
  that colour, my dear child; we have all been young once; there is even a
  tradition that Thorndyke was young some time back in the pre-dynastic
  period.'</p>

  <p>'Don't take any notice of him, Berkeley,' said Thorndyke. 'The egg-shell
  is sticking to his head still. He'll know better when he is my age.'</p>

  <p>'Methuselah!' exclaimed Jervis; 'I hope I shan't have to wait as long as
  that!'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled benevolently at his irrepressible junior, and, shaking my
  hand cordially, turned into the entry.</p>

  <p>From the Temple I wended northward, to the adjacent College of Surgeons,
  where I spent a couple of profitable hours examining the 'pickles' and
  refreshing my memory on the subjects of pathology and anatomy; marvelling
  afresh (as every practical anatomist must marvel) at the incredibly perfect
  technique of the dissections, and inwardly paying tribute to the founder of
  the collection. At length the warning of the clock, combined with an
  increasing craving for tea, drove me forth and bore me towards the scene of
  my not very strenuous labours. My mind was still occupied with the contents
  of the cases and the great glass jars, so that I found myself at the corner
  of Fetter Lane without a very clear idea of how I had got there. But at that
  point I was aroused from my reflections rather abruptly by a raucous voice in
  my ear.</p>

  <p>'Orrible discovery at Sidcup!'</p>

  <p>I turned wrathfully&mdash;for a London street-boy's yell, let off at
  point-blank range, is, in effect, like the smack of an open hand&mdash;but
  the inscription on the staring yellow poster that was held up for my
  inspection changed my anger to curiosity.</p>

  <p>'Horrible discovery in a watercress-bed!'</p>

  <p>Now, let prigs deny it if they will, but there is something very
  attractive in a 'horrible discovery'. It hints at tragedy, at mystery, at
  romance. It promises to bring into our grey and commonplace life that element
  of the dramatic which is the salt that our existence is savoured withal. 'In
  a watercress-bed,' too! The rusticity of the background seemed to emphasise
  the horror of the discovery, whatever it might be.</p>

  <p>I bought a copy of the paper, and, tucking it under my arm, hurried on to
  the surgery, promising myself a mental feast of watercress; but as I opened
  the door I found myself confronted by a corpulent woman of piebald and pimply
  aspect who saluted me with a deep groan. It was the lady from the coal shop
  in Fleur-de-Lys Court.</p>

  <p>'Good-evening, Mrs. Jablett,' I said briskly; 'not come about yourself, I
  hope.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I have,' she answered, rising and following me gloomily into the
  consulting-room; and then, when I had seated her in the patient's chair and
  myself at the writing table, she continued: 'It's my inside, you know,
  doctor.'</p>

  <p>The statement lacked anatomical precision and merely excluded the domain
  of the skin specialist. I accordingly waited for enlightenment and speculated
  on the watercress-beds, while Mrs. Jablett regarded me expectantly with a dim
  and watery eye.</p>

  <p>'Ah!' I said at length; 'it's your&mdash;your inside, is it, Mrs.
  Jablett?'</p>

  <p>'Yus. And my 'ead,' she added, with a voluminous sigh that filled the
  apartment with odorous reminiscences of 'unsweetened'.</p>

  <p>'Your head aches, does it?'</p>

  <p>'Something chronic!' said Mrs. Jablett. 'Feels as if it was a-opening and
  a-shutting, a-opening and a-shutting, and when I sit down I feel as if I
  should bust.'</p>

  <p>This picturesque description of her sensations&mdash;not wholly
  inconsistent with her figure&mdash;gave the clue to Mrs. Jablett's
  sufferings. Resisting a frivolous impulse to reassure her as to the
  elasticity of the human integument, I considered her case in exhaustive
  detail, coasting delicately round the subject of 'unsweetened' and finally
  sent her away, revived in spirits and grasping a bottle of Mist. Sodae cum
  Bismutho from Barnard's big stock-jar. Then I went back to investigate the
  Horrible Discovery; but before I could open the paper, another patient
  arrived (Impetigo contagiosa, this time, affecting the 'wide and arched-front
  sublime' of a juvenile Fetter Laner), and then yet another, and so on through
  the evening, until at last I forgot the watercress-beds altogether. It was
  only when I had purified myself from the evening consultations with hot water
  and a nail-brush and was about to sit down to a frugal supper, that I
  remembered the newspaper and fetched it from the drawer of the
  consulting-room table, where it had been hastily thrust out of sight. I
  folded it into a convenient form, and, standing it upright against the
  water-jug, read the report at my ease as I supped.</p>

  <p>There was plenty of it. Evidently the reporter had regarded it as a
  'scoop', and the editor had backed him up with ample space and hair-raising
  head-lines.</p>

  <p class="newspaper">'HORRIBLE DISCOVERY<br>
  IN A WATERCRESS-BED<br>
  AT SIDCUP!'</p>

  <p>'A startling discovery was made yesterday afternoon in the course of
  clearing out a watercress-bed near the erstwhile rural village of Sidcup in
  Kent; a discovery that will occasion many a disagreeable qualm to those
  persons who have been in the habit of regaling themselves with this
  refreshing esculent. But before proceeding to a description of the
  circumstances of the actual discovery or of the objects found&mdash;which,
  however, it may be stated at once, are nothing more or less than the
  fragments of a dismembered human body&mdash;it will be interesting to trace
  the remarkable chain of coincidences by virtue of which the discovery was
  made.</p>

  <p>'The beds in question have been laid out in a small artificial lake fed by
  a tiny streamlet which forms one of the numerous tributaries of the River
  Cray. Its depth is greater than usual in the watercress-beds, otherwise the
  gruesome relics could never have been concealed beneath its surface, and the
  flow of water through it, though continuous, is slow. The tributary streamlet
  meanders through a succession of pasture meadows, in one of which the beds
  themselves are situated, and here throughout most of the year the fleecy
  victims of the human carnivore carry on the industry of converting grass into
  mutton. Now it happened some years ago that the sheep frequenting these
  pastures became affected with the disease known as "liver-rot"; and here we
  must make a short digression into the domain of pathology.</p>

  <p>'"Liver-rot" is a disease of quite romantic antecedents. Its cause is a
  small flat worm&mdash;the liver-fluke&mdash;which infests the liver and
  bile-ducts of the affected sheep.</p>

  <p>'Now how does the worm get into the sheep's liver? That is where the
  romance comes in. Let us see.</p>

  <p>'The cycle of transformations begins with the deposit of the eggs of the
  fluke in some shallow stream or ditch running through pasture lands. Now each
  egg has a sort of lid, which presently opens and lets out a minute, hairy
  creature who swims away in search of a particular kind of
  water-snail&mdash;the kind called by naturalists Limnosa truncatula. If he
  finds a snail, he bores his way into its flesh and soon begins to grow and
  wax fat. Then he brings forth a family&mdash;of tiny worms quite unlike
  himself, little creatures called rediae, which soon give birth to families of
  young redice. So they go on for several generations, but at last there comes
  a generation of redia which, instead of giving birth to fresh redia, produce
  families of totally different offspring; big-headed, long-tailed creatures
  like miniature tadpoles, called by the learned cercarice. The cercarice soon
  wriggle their way out of the body of the snail, and then complications arise:
  for it is the habit of this particular snail to leave the water occasionally
  and take a stroll in the fields. Thus the cercarice, escaping from the snail,
  find themselves on the grass, whereupon they promptly drop their tails and
  stick themselves to the grass-blades. Then comes the unsuspecting sheep to
  take his frugal meal, and, cropping the grass, swallows it, cercarice and
  all. But the latter, when they find themselves in the sheep's stomach, make
  their way straight to the bile-ducts, up which they travel to the liver.
  Here, in a few weeks, they grow up into full-blown flukes and begin the
  important business of producing eggs.</p>

  <p>'Such is the pathological romance of the "liver-rot"; and now what is its
  connection with this mysterious discovery? It is this. After the outbreak of
  "liver-rot" above referred to, the ground landlord, a Mr. John Bellingham,
  instructed his solicitor to insert a clause in the lease of the beds
  directing that the latter should be periodically cleared and examined by an
  expert to make sure that they were free from the noxious water-snails. The
  last lease expired about two years ago, and since then the beds have been out
  of cultivation; but, for the safety of the adjacent pastures, it was
  considered necessary to make the customary periodical inspection, and it was
  in the course of cleaning the beds for this purpose that r the present
  discovery was made.</p>

  <p>'The operation began two days ago. A gang of three men proceeded
  systematically to grub up the plants and collect the multitudes of
  water-snails that they might be examined by the expert to see if any
  obnoxious species were present. They had cleared nearly half of the beds
  when, yesterday afternoon, one of the men working in the deepest part came
  upon some bones, the appearance of which excited his suspicion. Thereupon he
  called his mates, and they carefully picked away the plants piece-meal, a
  process that soon laid bare an unmistakable human hand lying on the mud
  amongst the roots. Fortunately they had the wisdom not to disturb the
  remains, but at once sent off a message to the police. Very soon, an
  inspector and a sergeant, accompanied by the divisional surgeon, arrived on
  the scene, and were able to view the remains lying as they had been found.
  And now another very strange fact came to light; for it was seen that the
  hand&mdash;a left one&mdash;lying on the mud was minus its third finger. This
  is regarded by the police as a very important fact as bearing on the question
  of identification, seeing that the number of persons having the third finger
  of the left hand missing must be quite small. After a thorough examination on
  the spot, the bones were carefully collected and conveyed to the mortuary,
  where they now lie awaiting further inquiries.</p>

  <p>'The divisional surgeon, Dr. Brandon, in an interview with our
  representative, made the following statements:</p>

  <p>'"The bones are those of the left arm of a middle-aged or elderly man
  about five feet eight inches in height. All the bones of the arm are present,
  including the scapula, or shoulder-blade, and the clavicle, or collar-bone,
  but the three bones of the third finger are missing."</p>

  <p>'"Is this a deformity or has the finger been cut off?" our correspondent
  asked.</p>

  <p>'"The finger has been amputated," was the reply. "If it had been absent
  from birth, the corresponding hand bone, or metacarpal, would have been
  wanting or deformed, whereas it is present and quite normal."</p>

  <p>'"How long have the bones been in the water?" was the next question.</p>

  <p>'"More than a year, I should say. They are quite clean; there is not a
  vestige of the soft structures left."</p>

  <p>'"Have you any theory as to how the arm came to be deposited where it was
  found?"</p>

  <p>'"I should rather not answer that question," was the guarded response.</p>

  <p>'"One more question," our correspondent urged. "The ground landlord, Mr.
  John Bellingham; is he not the gentleman who disappeared so mysteriously some
  time ago?"</p>

  <p>'"So I understand," Dr. Brandon replied.</p>

  <p>'"Can you tell me if Mr. Bellingham had lost the third finger of his left
  hand?"</p>

  <p>'"I cannot say," said Dr. Brandon; and he added with a smile, "you had
  better ask the police."</p>

  <p>'That is how the matter stands at present. But we understand that the
  police are making active inquiries for any missing man who has lost the third
  finger of his left hand, and if any of our readers know of such a person,
  they are earnestly requested to communicate at once, either with us or with
  the authorities.</p>

  <p>'Also we believe that a systematic search is to be made for further
  remains.'</p>

  <p>I laid the newspaper down and fell into a train of reflection. It was
  certainly a most mysterious affair. The thought that had evidently come to
  the reporter's mind stole naturally into mine. Could these remains be those
  of John Bellingham? It was obviously possible, though I could not but see
  that the fact of the bones having been found on his land, while it
  undoubtedly furnished the suggestion, did not in any way add to its
  probability. The connection was accidental and in nowise relevant.</p>

  <p>Then, too, there was the missing finger. No reference to any such
  deformity had been made in the original report of the disappearance, though
  it could hardly have been overlooked. I should be seeing Thorndyke in the
  course of the next few days, and, undoubtedly, if the discovery had any
  bearing upon the disappearance of John Bellingham, I should hear of it. With
  such a reflection I rose from the table, and, adopting the advice contained
  in the spurious Johnsonian quotation, proceeded to 'take a walk in Fleet
  Street' before settling down for the evening.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VI. SIDELIGHTS</h3>

  <p>THE association of coal with potatoes is one upon which I have frequently
  speculated, without arriving at any more satisfactory explanation than that
  both products are of the earth, earthy. Of the connection itself Barnard's
  practice furnished several instances besides Mrs. Jablett's establishment in
  Fleur-de-Lys Court, one of which was a dark and mysterious cavern a foot
  below the level of the street, that burrowed under an ancient house on the
  west side of Fetter Lane&mdash;a crinkly, timber house of the three-decker
  type that leaned back drunkenly from the road as if about to sit down in its
  own back yard.</p>

  <p>Passing this repository of the associated products about ten o'clock in
  the morning, I perceived in the shadows of the cavern no less a person than
  Miss Oman. She saw me at the same moment, and beckoned peremptorily with a
  hand that held a large Spanish onion. I approached with a deferential
  smile.</p>

  <p>'What a magnificent onion, Miss Oman! and how generous of you to offer it
  to me&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I wasn't offering it to you. But there! Isn't it just like a
  man&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Isn't what just like a man?' I interrupted. 'If you mean the
  onion&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I don't!' she snapped; 'and I wish you wouldn't talk such a parcel of
  nonsense. A grown man and a member of a serious profession, too! You ought to
  know better.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose I ought,' I said reflectively. And she continued:</p>

  <p>'I called in at the surgery just now.'&mdash;</p>

  <p>'To see me?'&mdash;</p>

  <p>'What else should I come for? Do you suppose that I called to consult the
  bottle-boy?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly not, Miss Oman. So you find the lady doctor no use, after
  all?'</p>

  <p>Miss Oman gnashed her teeth at me (and very fine teeth they were too).</p>

  <p>'I called,' she said majestically, 'on behalf of Miss Bellingham.'</p>

  <p>My facetiousness evaporated instantly. 'I hope Miss Bellingham is not
  ill,' I said with a sudden anxiety that elicited a sardonic smile from Miss
  Oman.</p>

  <p>'No,' was the reply, 'she is not ill, but she has cut her hand rather
  badly. It's her right hand too, and she can't afford to lose the use of it,
  not being a great, hulky, lazy, lolloping man. So you had better go and put
  some stuff on it.'</p>

  <p>With this advice, Miss Oman whisked to the right-about and vanished into
  the depths of the cavern like the witch of Wokey, while I hurried on to the
  surgery to provide myself with the necessary instruments and materials, and
  thence proceeded to Nevill's Court.</p>

  <p>Miss Oman's juvenile maidservant, who opened the door to me, stated the
  existing conditions with epigrammatic conciseness.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Bellingham is hout, sir; but Miss Bellingham is hin.'</p>

  <p>Having thus delivered herself she retreated towards the kitchen and I
  ascended the stairs, at the head of which I found Miss Bellingham awaiting me
  with her right hand encased in what looked like a white boxing-glove.</p>

  <p>'I'm glad you have come,' she said. 'Phyllis&mdash;Miss Oman, you
  know&mdash;has kindly bound up my hand, but I should like you to see that it
  is all right.'</p>

  <p>We went into the sitting-room, where I laid out my paraphernalia on the
  table while I inquired into the particulars of the accident.</p>

  <p>'It is most unfortunate that it should have happened just now,' she said,
  as I wrestled with one of those remarkable feminine knots that, while they
  seem to defy the utmost efforts of human ingenuity to untie, yet have a
  singular habit of untying themselves at inopportune moments.</p>

  <p>'Why just now in particular?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Because I have some specially important work to do. A very learned lady
  who is writing an historical book has commissioned me to collect all the
  literature relating to the Tell el Amarna letters&mdash;the cuneiform
  tablets, you know, of Amenhotep the Fourth.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' I said soothingly, 'I expect your hand will soon be well.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, but that won't do. The work has to be done immediately. I have to
  send in completed notes not later than this day week, and it will be quite
  impossible. I am dreadfully disappointed.'</p>

  <p>By this time I had unwound the voluminous wrappings and exposed the
  injury&mdash;a deep gash in the palm that must have narrowly missed a
  good-sized artery. Obviously the hand would be useless for fully a week.</p>

  <p>'I suppose,' she said, 'you couldn't patch it up so that I could write
  with it?'</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>'No, Miss Bellingham. I shall have to put it on a splint. We can't run any
  risks with a deep wound like this.'</p>

  <p>'Then I shall have to give up the commission, and I don't know how my
  client will get the work done in the time. You see, I am pretty well up in
  the literature of Ancient Egypt; in fact, I was to receive special payment on
  that account. And it would have been such an interesting task, too. However,
  it can't be helped.'</p>

  <p>I proceeded methodically with the application of the dressings, and
  meanwhile reflected. It was evident that she was deeply disappointed. Loss of
  work meant loss of money, and it needed but a glance at her rusty black dress
  to see that there was little margin for that. Possibly, too, there was some
  special need to be met. Her manner seemed almost to imply that there was. And
  at this point I had a brilliant idea.</p>

  <p>'I'm not sure that it can't be helped,' said I.</p>

  <p>She looked at me inquiringly, and I continued: 'I am going to make a
  proposition, and I shall ask you to consider it with an open mind.'</p>

  <p>'That sounds rather portentous,' said she; 'but I promise. What is
  it?'</p>

  <p>'It is this: When I was a student I acquired the useful art of writing
  shorthand. I am not a lightning reporter, you understand, but I can take
  matter down from dictation at quite respectable speed.'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I have several hours free every day&mdash;usually the whole
  afternoon up to six or half-past&mdash;and it occurs to me that if you were
  to go to the Museum in the mornings you could get out your book, look up
  passages (you could do that without using your right hand), and put in
  bookmarks. Then I could come along in the afternoon and you could read out
  the selected passages to me, and I could take them down in shorthand. We
  should get through as much in a couple of hours as you could in a day using
  long-hand.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, but how kind of you, Dr. Berkeley!' she exclaimed. 'How very kind! Of
  course, I couldn't think of taking up all your leisure in that way; but I do
  appreciate your kindness very much.'</p>

  <p>I was rather chapfallen at this very definite refusal, but persisted
  feebly:</p>

  <p>'I wish you would. It may seem rather a cheek for a comparative stranger
  like me to make such a proposal to a lady: but if you'd been a man&mdash;in
  those special circumstances&mdash;I should have made it all the same, and you
  would have accepted as a matter of course.'</p>

  <p>'I doubt that. At any rate, I am not a man. I sometimes wish I were.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I am sure you are much better as you are!' I exclaimed, with such
  earnestness that we both laughed. And at this moment Mr. Bellingham entered
  the room carrying several large brand-new books in a strap.</p>

  <p>'Well, I'm sure!' he exclaimed genially; 'here are pretty goings on.
  Doctor and patient giggling like a pair of schoolgirls! What's the joke?'</p>

  <p>He thumped his parcel of books down on the table and listened smilingly
  while my unconscious witticism was expounded.</p>

  <p>'The doctor's quite right,' he said. 'You'll do as you are, chick; but the
  Lord knows what sort of man you would make. You take his advice and let well
  alone.'</p>

  <p>Finding him in this genial frame of mind, I ventured to explain my
  proposition to him and to enlist his support. He considered it with attentive
  approval, and when I had finished turned to his daughter.</p>

  <p>'What is your objection, chick?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'It would give Doctor Berkeley such a fearful lot of work,' she
  answered.</p>

  <p>'It would give him a fearful lot of pleasure,' I said. 'It would
  really.'</p>

  <p>'Then why not?' said Mr. Bellingham. 'We don't mind being under an
  obligation to the Doctor, do we?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, it isn't that!' she exclaimed hastily.</p>

  <p>'Then take him at his word. He means it. It is a kind action and he'll
  like doing it, I'm sure. That's all right, Doctor; she accepts, don't you,
  chick?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, if you say so, I do; and most thankfully.'</p>

  <p>She accompanied the acceptance with a gracious smile that was in itself a
  large repayment on account, and when we had made the necessary arrangements,
  I hurried away in a state of the most perfect satisfaction to finish my
  morning's work and order an early lunch.</p>

  <p>When I called for her a couple of hours later I found her waiting in the
  garden with the shabby handbag, of which I relieved her, and we set forth
  together, watched jealously by Miss Oman, who had accompanied her to the
  gate.</p>

  <p>As I walked up the court with this wonderful maid by my side I could
  hardly believe in my good fortune. By her presence and my own resulting
  happiness the mean surroundings became glorified and the commonest objects
  transfigured into things of beauty. What a delightful thoroughfare, for
  instance, was Fetter Lane, with its quaint charm and mediaeval grace! I
  snuffed the cabbage-laden atmosphere and seemed to breathe the scent of the
  asphodel. Holborn was even as the Elysian Fields; the omnibus that bore us
  westward was a chariot of glory; and the people who swarmed verminously on
  the pavements bore the semblance of the children of light.</p>

  <p>Love is a foolish thing judged by workaday standards, and the thoughts and
  actions of lovers foolish beyond measure. But the workaday standard is the
  wrong one, after all; for the utilitarian mind does but busy itself with the
  trivial and transitory interests of life, behind which looms the great and
  everlasting reality of the love of man and woman. There is more significance
  in a nightingale's song in the hush of a summer night than in all the wisdom
  of Solomon (who, by the way, was not without his little experiences of the
  tender passion).</p>

  <p>The janitor in the little glass box by the entrance to the library
  inspected us and passed us on, with a silent benediction, to the lobby,
  whence (when I had handed my stick to a bald-headed demigod and received a
  talismanic disc in exchange) we entered the enormous rotunda of the
  reading-room.</p>

  <p>I have often thought that, if some lethal vapour of highly preservative
  properties&mdash;such as formaldehyde, for instance&mdash;could be shed into
  the atmosphere of this apartment, the entire and complete collection of books
  and book-worms would be well worth preserving, for the enlightenment of
  posterity, as a sort of anthropological appendix to the main collection of
  the Museum. For, surely, nowhere else in the world are so many strange and
  abnormal human beings gathered together in one place. And a curious question
  that must have occurred to many observers is: Whence do these singular
  creatures come, and whither do they go when the very distinct-faced clock
  (adjusted to literary eyesight) proclaims closing time? The tragic-faced
  gentleman, for instance, with the corkscrew ringlets that bob up and down
  like spiral springs as he walks? Or the short, elderly gentleman in the black
  cassock and bowler hat, who shatters your nerves by turning suddenly and
  revealing himself as a middle-aged woman? Whither do they go? One never sees
  them elsewhere. Do they steal away at closing time into the depths of the
  Museum and hide themselves until morning in sarcophagi or mummy cases? Or do
  they creep through spaces in the book-shelves and spend the night behind the
  volumes in a congenial atmosphere of leather and antique paper? Who can say?
  What I do know is that when Ruth Bellingham entered the reading-room she
  appeared in comparison with these like a creature of another order; even as
  the head of Antinous, which formerly stood (it has since been moved) amidst
  the portrait-busts of the Roman Emperors, seemed like the head of a god set
  in a portrait gallery of illustrious baboons.</p>

  <p>'What have we got to do?' I asked when we had found a vacant seat. 'Do you
  want to look up the catalogue?'</p>

  <p>'No, I have the tickets in my bag. The books are waiting in the "kept
  books" department.'</p>

  <p>I placed my hat on the leather-covered shelf, dropped her gloves into
  it&mdash;how delightfully intimate and companionable it seemed!&mdash;altered
  the numbers on the tickets, and then we proceeded together to the 'kept
  books' desk to collect the volumes that contained the material for our day's
  work.</p>

  <p>It was a blissful afternoon. Two and a half hours of happiness unalloyed
  did I spend at that shiny, leather-clad desk, guiding my nimble pen across
  the pages of the notebook. It introduced me to a newt world&mdash;a world in
  which love and learning, sweet intimacy and crusted archaeology, were mingled
  into the oddest, most whimsical and most delicious confection that the mind
  of man can conceive. Hitherto, these recondite histories had been far beyond
  my ken. Of the wonderful heretic, Amenhotep the Fourth, I had already
  heard&mdash;at the most he had been a mere name; the Hittites a mythical race
  of undetermined habitat; while cuneiform tablets had presented themselves to
  my mind merely as an uncouth kind of fossil biscuit suited to the digestion
  of a prehistoric ostrich.</p>

  <p>Now all this was changed. As we sat with our chairs creaking together and
  she whispered the story of those stirring times into my receptive
  ear&mdash;talking is strictly forbidden in the reading-room&mdash;the
  disjointed fragments arranged themselves into a romance of supreme
  fascination. Egyptian, Babylonian, Aramaean, Hittite, Memphis, Babylon,
  Hamath, Megiddo&mdash;I swallowed them all thankfully, wrote them down, and
  asked for more. Only once did I disgrace myself. An elderly clergyman of
  ascetic and acidulous aspect had passed us with a glance of evident
  disapproval, clearly setting us down as intruding philanderers; and when I
  contrasted the parson's probable conception of the whispered communications
  that were being poured into my ear so tenderly and confidentially with the
  dry reality, I chuckled aloud. But my fair taskmistress only paused, with her
  finger on the page, smilingly to rebuke me, and then went on with the
  dictation. She was certainly a Tartar for work.</p>

  <p>It was a proud moment for me when, in response to my interrogative 'Yes?'
  my companion said 'That is all' and closed the book. We had extracted the
  pith and marrow of six considerable volumes in two and a half hours.</p>

  <p>'You have been better than your word,' she said. 'It would have taken me
  two full days of really hard work to make the notes that you have written
  down since we commenced. I don't know how to thank you.'</p>

  <p>'There's no need to. I've enjoyed myself and polished up my shorthand.
  What is the next thing? We shall want some books for to-morrow, shan't
  we?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I have made out a list, so if you will come with me to the catalogue
  desk I will look out the numbers and ask you to write the tickets.'</p>

  <p>The selection of a fresh batch of authorities occupied us for another
  quarter of an hour, and then, having handed in the volumes that we had
  squeezed dry, we took our way out of the reading-room.</p>

  <p>'Which way shall we go?' she asked as we passed out of the gate, where
  stood a massive policeman, like the guardian angel at the gate of Paradise
  (only, thank Heaven! he bore no flaming sword forbidding re-entry).</p>

  <p>'We are going,' I replied, 'to Museum Street, where is a milkshop in which
  one can get an excellent cup of tea.'</p>

  <p>She looked as if she would have demurred, but eventually followed
  obediently, and we were soon settled side by side at the little marble-topped
  table, retracing the ground we had covered in the afternoon's work and
  discussing various points of interest over a joint teapot.</p>

  <p>'Have you been doing this sort of work long?' I asked, as she handed me my
  second cup of tea.</p>

  <p>'Professionally,' she answered, 'only about two years; since we broke up
  our home, in fact. But long before that I used to come to the Museum with my
  Uncle John&mdash;the one who disappeared, you know, in that dreadfully
  mysterious way&mdash;and help him to look up references. We were good
  friends, he and I.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose he was a very learned man?' I suggested.</p>

  <p>'Yes, in a certain way; in the way of the better-class collector he was
  very learned indeed. He knew the contents of every museum in the world, in so
  far as they were connected with Egyptian antiquities, and had studied them
  specimen by specimen. Consequently, as Egyptology is largely a museum
  science, he was a learned Egyptologist. But his real interest was in things
  rather than events. Of course, he knew a great deal&mdash;a very great
  deal&mdash;about Egyptian history, but still he was, before all, a
  collector.'</p>

  <p>'And what will happen to his collection if he is really dead?'</p>

  <p>'The greater part of it goes to the British Museum by his will, and the
  remainder he has left to his solicitor, Mr. Jellicoe.'</p>

  <p>'To Mr. Jellicoe! Why, what will Mr. Jellicoe do with Egyptian
  antiquities?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, he is an Egyptologist too, and quite an enthusiast. He has really a
  fine collection of scarabs and other small objects such as it is possible to
  keep in a private house. I have always thought that it was his enthusiasm for
  everything Egyptian that brought him and my uncle together on terms of such
  intimacy; though I believe he is an excellent lawyer, and he is certainly a
  very discreet, cautious man.'</p>

  <p>'Is he? I shouldn't have thought so, judging by your uncle's will.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, but that was not Mr. Jellicoe's fault. He assures us that he
  entreated my uncle to let him draw up a fresh document with more reasonable
  provisions. But he says Uncle John was immovable; and he really was a rather
  obstinate man. Mr. Jellicoe repudiates any responsibility in the matter. He
  washes his hands of the whole affair, and says that it is the will of a
  lunatic. And so it is. I was glancing through it only a night or two ago, and
  really I cannot conceive how a sane man could have written such
  nonsense.'</p>

  <p>'You have a copy then?' I asked eagerly, remembering Thorndyke's parting
  instructions.</p>

  <p>'Yes. Would you like to see it? I know my father has told you about it,
  and it is worth reading as a curiosity of perverseness.'</p>

  <p>'I should very much like to show it to my friend, Doctor Thorndyke,' I
  replied. 'He said he would be interested to read it and learn the exact
  provisions; and it might be well to let him, and hear what he has to say
  about it.'</p>

  <p>'I see no objection,' she rejoined; 'but you know what my father is: his
  horror, I mean, of what he calls "cadging for advice gratis".'</p>

  <p>'Oh, but he need have no scruples on that score. Doctor Thorndyke wants to
  see the will because the case interests him. He is an enthusiast, you know,
  and he put the request as a personal favour to himself.'</p>

  <p>'That is very nice and delicate of him, and I will explain the position to
  my father. If he is willing for Doctor Thorndyke to see the copy, I will send
  or bring it over this evening. Have we finished?'</p>

  <p>I regretfully admitted that we had, and, when I had paid the modest
  reckoning, we sallied forth, turning back with one accord into Great Russell
  Street to avoid the noise and bustle of the larger thoroughfares.</p>

  <p>'What sort of man was your uncle?' I asked presently, as we walked along
  the quiet, dignified street. And then I added hastily: 'I hope you don't
  think me inquisitive, but, to my mind, he presents himself as a kind of
  mysterious abstraction; the unknown quantity of a legal problem.'</p>

  <p>'My Uncle John,' she answered reflectively, 'was a very peculiar man,
  rather obstinate, very self-willed, what people call "masterful", and
  decidedly wrong-headed and unreasonable.'</p>

  <p>'That is certainly the impression that the terms of his will convey,' I
  said.</p>

  <p>'Yes, and not the will only. There was the absurd allowance that he made
  to my father. That was a ridiculous arrangement, and very unfair too. He
  ought to have divided the property up as my grandfather intended. And yet he
  was by no means ungenerous, only he would have his own way, and his own way
  was very commonly the wrong way.'</p>

  <p>'I remember,' she continued, after a short pause, 'a very odd instance of
  his wrong-headedness and obstinacy. It was a small matter, but very typical
  of him. He had in his collection a beautiful little ring of the eighteenth
  dynasty. It was said to have belonged to Queen Ti, the mother of our friend
  Amenhotep the Fourth; but I don't think that could have been so, because the
  device on it was the Eye of Osiris, and Ti, as you know, was an
  Aten-worshipper. However, it was a very charming ring, and Uncle John, who
  had a queer sort of devotion to the mystical eye of Osiris, commissioned a
  very clever goldsmith to make two exact copies of it, one for himself and one
  for me. The goldsmith naturally wanted to take the measurements of our
  fingers, but this Uncle John would not hear of; the rings were to be exact
  copies, and an exact copy must be the same size as the original. You can
  imagine the result; my ring was so loose that I couldn't keep it on my
  finger, and Uncle John's was so tight that though he did manage to get it on,
  he was never able to get it off. And it was only the circumstance that his
  left hand was decidedly smaller than his right that made it possible for him
  to wear it at all.'</p>

  <p>'So you never wore your copy?'</p>

  <p>'No. I wanted to have it altered to make it fit, but he objected strongly;
  so I put it away, and have it in a box still.'</p>

  <p>'He must have been an extraordinarily pig-headed old fellow,' I
  remarked.</p>

  <p>'Yes; he was very tenacious. He annoyed my father a good deal, too, by
  making unnecessary alterations in the house in Queen Square when he fitted up
  his museum. We have a certain sentiment with regard to that house. Our people
  have lived in it ever since it was built, when the square was first laid out
  in the reign of Queen Anne, after whom it was named. It is a dear old house.
  Would you like to see it? We are quite near it now.'</p>

  <p>I assented eagerly. If it had been a coal-shed or a fried-fish shop I
  would still have visited it with pleasure, for the sake of prolonging our
  walk; but I was also really interested in this old house as a part of the
  background of the mystery of the vanished John Bellingham.</p>

  <p>We crossed into Cosmo Place, with its quaint row of the now rare,
  cannon-shaped iron posts, and passing through stood for a few moments looking
  into the peaceful, stately old square. A party of boys disported themselves
  noisily on the range of stone posts that form a bodyguard round the ancient
  lamp-surmounted pump, but otherwise the place was wrapped in dignified repose
  suited to its age and station. And very pleasant it looked on this summer
  afternoon with the sunlight gilding the foliage of its widespreading plane
  trees and lighting up the warm-toned brick of the house-fronts. We walked
  slowly down the shady west side, near the middle of which my companion
  halted.</p>

  <p>'This is the house,' she said. 'It looks gloomy and forsaken now; but it
  must have been a delightful house in the days when my ancestors could look
  out of the windows through the open end of the square across the fields of
  meadows to the heights of Hampstead and Highgate.'</p>

  <p>She stood at the edge of the pavement looking up with a curious
  wistfulness at the old house; a very pathetic figure, I thought, with her
  handsome face and proud carriage, her threadbare dress and shabby gloves,
  standing at the threshold of the home that had been her family's for
  generations, that should now have been hers, and that was shortly to pass
  away into the hands of strangers.</p>

  <p>I, too, looked up at it with a strange interest, impressed by something
  gloomy and forbidding in its aspect. The windows were shuttered from basement
  to attic, and no sign of life was visible. Silent, neglected, desolate, it
  breathed an air of tragedy. It seemed to mourn in sackcloth and ashes for its
  lost master. The massive door within the splendid carven portico was crusted
  with grime, and seemed to have passed out of use as completely as the ancient
  lamp-irons or the rusted extinguishers wherein the footmen were wont to
  quench their torches when some Bellingham dame was borne up the steps in her
  gilded chair, in the days of good Queen Anne.</p>

  <p>It was in a somewhat sobered frame of mind that we presently turned away
  and started homeward by way of Great Ormond Street. My companion was deeply
  thoughtful, relapsing for a while into that sombreness of manner that had so
  impressed me when I first met her. Nor was I without a certain sympathetic
  pensiveness; as if, from the great, silent house, the spirit of the vanished
  man had issued forth to bear us company.</p>

  <p>But still it was a delightful walk, and I was sorry when at last we
  arrived at the entrance to Nevill's Court, and Miss Bellingham halted and
  held out her hand.</p>

  <p>'Good-bye,' she said; 'and many, many thanks for your invaluable help.
  Shall I take the bag?'</p>

  <p>'If you want it. But I must take out the note-books.'</p>

  <p>'Why must you take them?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Why, haven't I got to copy the notes out into long-hand?'</p>

  <p>An expression of utter consternation spread over her face; in fact, she
  was so completely taken aback that she forgot to release my hand.</p>

  <p>'Heavens!' she exclaimed. 'How idiotic of me! But it is impossible, Doctor
  Berkeley! It will take you hours!'</p>

  <p>'It is perfectly possible, and it is going to be done; otherwise the notes
  would be useless. Do you want the bag?'</p>

  <p>'No, of course not. But I am positively appalled. Hadn't you better give
  up the idea?'</p>

  <p>'And this is the end of our collaboration?' I exclaimed tragically, giving
  her hand a final squeeze (whereby she became suddenly aware of its position,
  and withdrew it rather hastily). 'Would you throw away a whole afternoon's
  work? I won't certainly; so, goodbye until to-morrow. I shall turn up in the
  reading-room as early as I can. You had better take the tickets. Oh, and you
  won't forget a bin t the copy of the will for Doctor Thorndyke, will
  you?'</p>

  <p>'No; if my father agrees, you shall have it this evening.'</p>

  <p>She took the tickets from me, and, thanking me yet again, retired into the
  court.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VII. JOHN BELLINGHAM'S WILL</h3>

  <p>THE task upon which I had embarked so light-heartedly, when considered in
  cold blood, did certainly appear, as Miss Bellingham had said, rather
  appalling. The result of two and a half hours' pretty steady work at an
  average speed of nearly a hundred words a minute, would take some time to
  transcribe into long-hand; and if the notes were to be delivered punctually
  on the morrow, the sooner I got to work the better.</p>

  <p>Recognising this truth, I lost no time, but, within five minutes of my
  arrival at the surgery, was seated at the writing-table with my copy before
  me busily converting the sprawling, inexpressive characters into good,
  legible round-hand.</p>

  <p>The occupation was by no means unpleasant, apart from the fact that it was
  a labour of love; for the sentences, as I picked them up, were fragrant with
  the reminiscences of the gracious whisper in which they had first come to me.
  And then the matter itself was full of interest. I was gaining a fresh
  outlook on life, was crossing the threshold of a new world (which was her
  world); and so the occasional interruptions from the patients, while they
  gave me intervals of enforced rest, were far from welcome.</p>

  <p>The evening wore on without any sign from Nevill's Court, and I began to
  fear that Mr. Bellingham's scruples had proved insurmountable. Not, I am
  afraid, that I was so much concerned for the copy of the will as for the
  possibility of a visit, no matter howsoever brief, from my fair employer; and
  when, on the stroke of half-past seven, the surgery door flew open with
  startling abruptness, my fears were allayed and my hopes shattered
  simultaneously. For it was Miss Oman who stalked in, holding out a blue
  foolscap envelope with a warlike air as if it were an ultimatum.</p>

  <p>'I've brought you this from Mr. Bellingham,' she said. 'There's a note
  inside.'</p>

  <p>'May I read the note, Miss Oman?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Bless the man!' she exclaimed. 'What else would you do with it? Isn't
  that what it's brought for?'</p>

  <p>I supposed it was; and, thanking her for her gracious permission, I
  glanced through the note&mdash;a few lines authorising me to show the copy of
  the will to Dr. Thorndyke. When I looked up from the paper I found her eyes
  fixed on me with an expression critical and rather disapproving.</p>

  <p>'You seem to be making yourself mighty agreeable in a certain quarter,'
  she remarked.</p>

  <p>'I make myself universally agreeable. It is my nature to.'</p>

  <p>'Ha!' she snorted.</p>

  <p>'Don't you find me rather agreeable?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Oily,' said Miss Oman. And then with a sour smile at the open notebooks,
  she remarked:</p>

  <p>'You've got some work to do now; quite a change for you.'</p>

  <p>'A delightful change, Miss Oman. "For Satan findeth"&mdash;but no doubt
  you are acquainted with the philosophical works of Dr. Watts?'</p>

  <p>'If you are referring to "idle hands",' she replied, 'I'll give you a bit
  of advice. Don't you keep that hand idle any longer than is really necessary.
  I have my suspicions about that splint&mdash;oh, you know what I mean,' and
  before I had time to reply, she had taken advantage of the entrance of a
  couple of patients to whisk out of the surgery with the abruptness that had
  distinguished her arrival.</p>

  <p>The evening consultations were considered to be over by half-past eight;
  at which time Adolphus was wont with exemplary punctuality to close the outer
  door of the surgery. To-night he was not less prompt than usual; and having
  performed this, his last daily office, and turned down the surgery gas, he
  reported the fact and took his departure.</p>

  <p>As his retreating footsteps died away and the slamming of the outer door
  announced his final disappearance, I sat up and stretched myself. The
  envelope containing the copy of the will lay on the table, and I considered
  it thoughtfully. It ought to be conveyed to Thorndyke with as little delay as
  possible, and, as it certainly could not be trusted out of my hands, it ought
  to be conveyed by me.</p>

  <p>I looked at the notebooks. Nearly two hours' work had made a considerable
  impression on the matter that I had to transcribe, but still, a great deal of
  the task yet remained to be done. However, I reflected, I could put in a
  couple of hours or more before going to bed and there would be an hour or two
  to spare in the morning. Finally I locked the notebooks, open as they were,
  in the writing-table drawer, and slipping the envelope into my pocket, set
  out for the Temple.</p>

  <p>The soft chime of the Treasury clock was telling out, in confidential
  tones, the third quarter as I rapped with my stick on the forbidding 'oak' of
  my friends' chambers. There was no response, nor had I perceived any gleam of
  light from the windows as I approached, and I was considering the
  advisability of trying the laboratory on the next floor, when footsteps on
  the stone stairs and familiar voices gladdened my ear.</p>

  <p>'Hallo, Berkeley!' said Thorndyke, 'do we find you waiting like a Peri at
  the gates of Paradise? Polton is upstairs, you know, tinkering at one of his
  inventions. If you ever find the nest empty, you had better go up and bang at
  the laboratory door. He's always there in the evenings.'</p>

  <p>'I haven't been waiting long,' said I, 'and I was just thinking of rousing
  him up when you came.'</p>

  <p>'That was right,' said Thorndyke, turning up the gas. 'And what news do
  you bring? Do I see a blue envelope sticking out of your pocket?'</p>

  <p>'You do.'</p>

  <p>'Is it a copy of the will?' he asked.</p>

  <p>I answered 'yes', and added that I had full permission to show it to
  him.</p>

  <p>'What did I tell you?' exclaimed Jervis. 'Didn't I say that he would get
  the copy for us if it existed?'</p>

  <p>'We admit the excellence of your prognosis,' said Thorndyke, 'but there is
  no need to be boastful. Have you read through the document, Berkeley?'</p>

  <p>'No, I haven't taken it out of the envelope.'</p>

  <p>'Then it will be equally new to us all, and we shall see if it tallies
  with your description.'</p>

  <p>He placed three easy chairs at a convenient distance from the light, and
  Jervis, watching him with a smile, remarked:</p>

  <p>'Now Thorndyke is going to enjoy himself. To him, a perfectly
  unintelligible will is a thing of beauty and a joy for ever; especially if
  associated with some kind of recondite knavery.'</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' said I, 'that this will is particularly unintelligible.
  The mischief seems to be that it is rather too intelligible. However, here it
  is,' and I handed it over to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'I suppose that we can depend on this copy,' said the latter, as he drew
  out the document and glanced at it. 'Oh, yes,' he added, 'I see it is copied
  by Godfrey Bellingham, compared with the original and certified correct. In
  that case I will get you to read it out slowly, Jervis, and I will make a
  rough copy for reference. Let us make ourselves comfortable and light our
  pipes before we begin.'</p>

  <p>He provided himself with a writing-pad, and, when we had seated ourselves
  and got our pipes well alight, Jervis opened the document, and with a
  premonitory 'hem!' commenced the reading.</p>

  <p>'In the name of God, Amen. This is the last will and testament of me John
  Bellingham of number 141 Queen Square in the parish of St George Bloomsbury
  London in the county of Middlesex Gentleman made this twenty-first day of
  September in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and
  ninety-two.</p>

  <p>'1. I give and bequeath unto Arthur Jellicoe of number 184 New Square
  Lincoln's Inn London in the county of Middlesex Attorney-at-law the whole of
  my collection of seals and scarabs and those in my cabinets marked A, B, and
  D together with the contents thereof and the sum of two thousand pounds
  sterling free of legacy duty.</p>

  <p>'Unto the trustees of the British Museum the residue of my collection of
  antiquities.</p>

  <p>'Unto my cousin George Hurst of The Poplars Eltham in the county of Kent
  the sum of five thousand pounds free of legacy duty and unto my brother
  Godfrey Bellingham or if he should die before the occurrence of my death unto
  his daughter Ruth Bellingham the residue of my estate and effects real and
  personal subject to the conditions set forth hereinafter namely:</p>

  <p>'2. That my body shall be deposited with those of my ancestors in the
  churchyard appertaining to the church and parish of St George the Martyr or
  if that shall not be possible in some other churchyard cemetery burial ground
  church or chapel or other authorised place for the reception of bodies of the
  dead situate within or appertaining to the parishes of St Andrew above the
  Bars and St George the Martyr or St George Bloomsbury and St Giles in the
  Fields. But if the condition in this clause be not carried out then:</p>

  <p>'3. I give and devise the said residue of my estate and effects unto my
  cousin George Hurst aforesaid and I hereby revoke all wills and codicils made
  by me at any time heretofore and I appoint Arthur Jellicoe aforesaid to be
  the executor of this my will jointly with the principal beneficiary and
  residuary legatee that is to say with the aforesaid Godfrey Bellingham if the
  conditions set forth hereinbefore in clause 2 shall be duly carried out but
  with the aforesaid George Hurst if the said conditions in the said clause 2
  be not carried out.</p>

  <p>'john bellingham</p>

  <p>'Signed by the said testator John Bellingham in the presence of us present
  at the same time who at his request and in his presence and in the presence
  of each other have subscribed our names as witnesses.</p>

  <p>'Frederick Wilton, 16 Medford Road, London, N, clerk.</p>

  <p>'James Barber, 32 Wadbury Crescent, London, SW, clerk.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Jervis, laying down the document as Thorndyke detached the
  last sheet from his writing-pad, 'I have met with a good many idiotic wills,
  but this one can give them all points. I don't see how it is ever going to be
  administered. One of the two executors is a mere abstraction&mdash;a sort of
  algebraical problem with no answer.'</p>

  <p>'I think that difficulty could be overcome,' said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'I don't see how,' retorted Jervis. 'If the body is deposited in a certain
  place, A is the executor; if it is somewhere else, B is the executor. But as
  you cannot produce the body, and no one has the least idea where it is, it is
  impossible to prove either that it is or that it is not in any specified
  place.'</p>

  <p>'You are magnifying the difficulty, Jervis,' said Thorndyke. 'The body
  may, of course, be anywhere in the entire world, but the place where it is
  lying is either inside or out the general boundary of those two parishes. If
  it has been deposited within the boundary of those two parishes, the fact
  must be ascertainable by examining the burial certificates issued since the
  date when the missing man was last seen alive and by consulting the registers
  of those specified places of burial. I think that if no record can be found
  of any such interment within the boundary of those two parishes, that fact
  will be taken by the Court as proof that no such interment has taken place,
  and that therefore the body must have been deposited somewhere else. Such a
  decision would constitute George Hurst the co-executor and residuary
  legatee.'</p>

  <p>'That is cheerful for your friends, Berkeley,' Jervis remarked, 'for we
  may take it as pretty certain that the body has not been deposited in any of
  the places named.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I agreed gloomily, 'I'm afraid there is very little doubt of that.
  But what an ass the fellow must have been to make such a to-do about his
  beastly carcass! What the deuce could it have mattered to him where it was
  dumped, when he had done with it?'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled softly. 'Thus the irreverent youth of to-day,' said he.
  'But yours is hardly a fair comment, Berkeley. Our training makes us
  materialists, and puts us a little out of sympathy with those in whom
  primitive beliefs and emotions survive. A worthy priest who came to look at
  our dissecting-room expressed surprise to me that the students, thus
  constantly in the presence of relics of mortality, should be able to think of
  anything but the resurrection and the life hereafter. He was a bad
  psychologist. There is nothing so dead as a dissecting-room "subject"; and
  the contemplation of the human body in the process of being quietly taken to
  pieces&mdash;being resolved into its structural units like a worn-out clock
  or an old engine in the scrapper's yard&mdash;is certainly not conducive to a
  vivid realisation of the doctrine of the resurrection.'</p>

  <p>'No; but this absurd anxiety to be buried in some particular place has
  nothing to do with religious belief; it is merely silly sentiment.'</p>

  <p>'It is sentiment, I admit,' said Thorndyke, 'but I wouldn't call it silly.
  The feeling is so widespread in time and space that we must look on it with
  respect as something inherent in human nature. Think&mdash;as doubtless John
  Bellingham did&mdash;of the ancient Egyptians, whose chief aspiration was
  that of everlasting repose for the dead. See the trouble they took to achieve
  it. Think of the great Pyramid, or that of Amenemhat the Fourth with its
  labyrinth of false passages and its sealed and hidden sepulchral chambers.
  Think of Jacob, borne after death all those hundreds of weary miles in order
  that he might sleep with his fathers, and then remember Shakespeare and his
  solemn adjuration to posterity to let him rest undisturbed in his grave. No,
  Berkeley, it is not a silly sentiment. I am as indifferent as you as to what
  becomes of my body "when I have done with it," to use your irreverent phrase;
  but I recognise the solicitude that some other men display on the subject as
  a natural feeling that has to be taken seriously.'</p>

  <p>'But even so,' I said, 'if this man had a hankering for a freehold
  residence in some particular bone-yard, he might have gone about the business
  in a. more reasonable way.'</p>

  <p>'There I am entirely with you,' Thorndyke replied. 'It is the absurd way
  in which this provision is worded that not only creates all the trouble but
  also makes the whole document so curiously significant in view of the
  testator's disappearance.'</p>

  <p>'How significant?' Jervis demanded eagerly.</p>

  <p>'Let us consider the provisions of the will point by point,' said
  Thorndyke; 'and first note that the testator commanded the services of a very
  capable lawyer.'</p>

  <p>'But Mr. Jellicoe disapproved of the will,' said I; 'in fact, he protested
  strongly against the form of it.'</p>

  <p>'We will bear that in mind too,' Thorndyke replied. 'And now with
  reference to what we may call the contentious clauses: the first thing that
  strikes us is their preposterous injustice. Godfrey's inheritance is made
  conditional on a particular disposal of the testator's body. But this is a
  matter not necessarily under Godfrey's control. The testator might have been
  lost at sea, or killed in a fire or explosion, or have died abroad and been
  buried where his grave could not have been identified. There are numerous
  probable contingencies besides the improbable one that has happened that
  might prevent the body from being recovered.</p>

  <p>'But even if the body had been recovered, there is another difficulty. The
  places of burial in the parishes have all been closed for many years. It
  would be impossible to reopen any of them without a special faculty, and I
  doubt whether such a faculty would be granted. Possibly cremation might meet
  the difficulty, but even that is doubtful; and, in any case, the matter would
  not be in the control of Godfrey Bellingham. Yet, if the required interment
  should prove impossible, he is to be deprived of his legacy.'</p>

  <p>'It is a monstrous and absurd injustice,' I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>'It is,' Thorndyke agreed; 'but this is nothing to the absurdity that
  comes to light when we consider clauses two and three in detail. Observe that
  the testator presumably wished to be buried in a certain place; also he
  wished his brother should benefit under the will. Let us take the first point
  and see how he has set about securing the accomplishment of what he desired.
  Now if we read clauses two and three carefully, we shall see that he has
  rendered it virtually impossible that his wishes can be carried out. He
  desires to be buried in a certain place and makes Godfrey responsible for his
  being so buried. But he gives Godfrey no power or authority to carry out the
  provision, and places insuperable obstacles in his way. For until Godfrey is
  an executor, he has no power or authority to carry out the provisions; and
  until the provisions are carried out, he does not become an executor.'</p>

  <p>'It is a preposterous muddle,' exclaimed Jervis.</p>

  <p>'Yes, but that is not the worst of it,' Thorndyke continued. 'The moment
  John Bellingham dies, his dead body has come into existence; and it is
  "deposited", for the time being, wherever he happens to have died. But unless
  he should happen to have died in one of the places of burial
  mentioned&mdash;which is in the highest degree unlikely&mdash;his body will
  be, for the time being, "deposited" in some place other than those specified.
  In that case clause two is&mdash;for the time being&mdash;not complied with,
  and consequently George Hurst becomes, automatically, the co-executor.</p>

  <p>'But will George Hurst carry out the provisions of clause two? Probably
  not. Why should he? The will contains no instructions to that effect. It
  throws the whole duty on Godfrey. On the other hand, if he should carry out
  clause two, what happens? He ceases to be an executor and he loses some
  seventy thousand pounds. We may be pretty certain that he will do nothing of
  the kind. So that, on considering the two clauses, we see that the wishes of
  the testator could only be carried out in the unlikely event of his dying in
  one of the burial-places mentioned, or his body being conveyed immediately
  after death to p. public mortuary in one of the said parishes. In any other
  event, it is virtually certain that he will be buried in some place other
  than that which he desired, and that his brother will be left absolutely
  without provision or recognition.'</p>

  <p>'John Bellingham could never have intended that,' I said.</p>

  <p>'Clearly not,' agreed Thorndyke; 'the provisions of the will furnish
  internal evidence that he did not. You note that he bequeathed five thousand
  pounds to George Hurst, in the event of clause two being carried out; but he
  has made no bequest to his brother in the event of its not being carried out.
  Obviously, he had not entertained the possibility of this contingency at all.
  He assumed, as a matter of course, that the conditions of clause two would be
  fulfilled, and regarded the conditions themselves as a mere formality.'</p>

  <p>'But,' Jervis objected, 'Jellicoe must have seen the danger of a
  miscarriage and pointed it out to his client.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' said Thorndyke. 'There is the mystery. We understand that he
  objected strenuously, and that John Bellingham was obdurate. Now it is
  perfectly understandable that a man should adhere obstinately to the most
  stupid and perverse disposition of his property; but that a man should
  persist in retaining a particular form of words after it has been proved to
  him that the use of such form will almost certainly result in the defeat of
  his own wishes; that, I say, is a mystery that calls for very careful
  consideration.'</p>

  <p>'If Jellicoe had been an interested party,' said Jervis, 'one would have
  suspected him of lying low. But the form of clause two doesn't affect him at
  all.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Thorndyke; 'the person who stands to profit by the muddle is
  George Hurst. But we understand that he was unacquainted with the terms of
  the will, and there is certainly nothing to suggest that he is in any way
  responsible for it.'</p>

  <p>'The practical question is,' said I, 'what is going to happen? and what
  can be done for the Bellinghams?'</p>

  <p>'The probability is,' Thorndyke replied, 'that the next move will be made
  by Hurst. He is the party immediately interested. He will probably apply to
  the Court for permission to presume death and administer the will.'</p>

  <p>'And what will the Court do?'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled dryly. 'Now you are asking a very pretty conundrum. The
  decisions of Courts depend on idiosyncrasies of temperament that no one can
  foresee. But one may say that a Court does not lightly grant permission to
  presume death. There will be a rigorous inquiry&mdash;and a decidedly
  unpleasant one, I suspect&mdash;and the evidence will be reviewed by the
  judge with a strong predisposition to regard the testator as being still
  alive. On the other hand, the known facts point very distinctly to the
  probability that he is dead; and, if the will were less complicated and all
  the parties interested were unanimous in supporting the application, I don't
  see why it might not be granted. But it will clearly be to the interest of
  Godfrey to oppose the application, unless he can show that the conditions of
  clause two have been complied with&mdash;which it is virtually certain he
  cannot; and he may be able to bring forward reasons for believing John to be
  still alive. But even if he is unable to do this, inasmuch as it is pretty
  clear that he was intended to be the chief beneficiary, his opposition is
  likely to have considerable weight with the Court.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, is it?' I exclaimed eagerly. 'Then that accounts for a very peculiar
  proceeding on the part of Hurst. I have stupidly forgotten to tell you about
  it. He has been trying to come to a private agreement with Godfrey
  Bellingham.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed!' said Thorndyke. 'What sort of agreement?'</p>

  <p>'His proposal was this: that Godfrey should support him and Jellicoe in an
  application to the Court for permission to presume death and to administer
  the will, that if it was successful, Hurst should pay him four hundred pounds
  a year for life: the arrangement to hold good in all eventualities.'</p>

  <p>'By which he means?'</p>

  <p>'That if the body should be discovered at any future time, so that the
  conditions of clause two could be carried out, Hurst should still retain the
  property and continue to pay Godfrey the four hundred a year for life.'</p>

  <p>'Hey, ho!' exclaimed Thorndyke; 'that is a queer proposal; a very queer
  proposal indeed.'</p>

  <p>'Not to say fishy,' added Jervis. 'I don't fancy the Court would look with
  approval on that little arrangement.'</p>

  <p>'The law does not look with much favour on any little arrangements that
  aim at getting behind the provisions of a will,' Thorndyke replied; 'though
  there would be nothing to complain of in this proposal if it were not for the
  reference to "all eventualities". If a will is hopelessly impracticable, it
  is not unreasonable or improper for the various beneficiaries to make such
  private arrangements among themselves as may seem necessary to avoid useless
  litigation and delay in administering the will. If, for instance, Hurst had
  proposed to pay four hundred a year to Godfrey so long as the body remained
  undiscovered on condition that, in the event of its discovery, Godfrey should
  pay him a like sum for life, there would have been nothing to comment upon.
  It would have been an ordinary sporting chance. But the reference to "all
  eventualities" is an entirely different matter. Of course, it may be mere
  greediness, but all the same it suggests some very curious reflections.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, it does,' said Jervis. 'I wonder if he has any reason to expect that
  the body will be found? Of course it doesn't follow that he has. He may be
  merely taking the opportunity offered by the other man's poverty to make sure
  of the bulk of the property whatever happens. But it is uncommonly sharp
  practice, to say the least.'</p>

  <p>'Do I understand that Godfrey declined the proposal?' Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes, he did, very emphatically; and I fancy the two gentlemen proceeded
  to exchange opinions on the circumstances of the disappearance with more
  frankness than delicacy.'</p>

  <p>'Ah,' said Thorndyke, 'that is a pity. If the case comes into Court, there
  is bound to be a good deal of unpleasant discussion and still more unpleasant
  comment in the newspapers. But if the parties themselves begin to express
  suspicions of one another there is no telling where the matter will end.'</p>

  <p>'No, by Jove!' said Jervis. 'If they begin flinging accusations of murder
  about, the fat will be in the fire with a vengeance. That way lies the Old
  Bailey.'</p>

  <p>'We must try to prevent them from making an unnecessary scandal,' said
  Thorndyke. 'It may be that an exposure will be unavoidable, and that must be
  ascertained in advance. But to return to your question, Berkeley, as to what
  is to be done. Hurst will probably make some move pretty soon. Do you know if
  Jellicoe will act with him?'</p>

  <p>'No, he won't. He declines to take any steps without Godfrey's
  assent&mdash;at least, that is what he says at present. His attitude is one
  of correct neutrality.'</p>

  <p>'That is satisfactory so far,' said Thorndyke, 'though he may alter his
  tone when the case comes into Court. From what you said just now I gathered
  that Jellicoe would prefer to have the will administered and be quit of the
  whole business; which is natural enough, especially as he benefits under the
  will to the extent of two thousand pounds and a valuable collection.
  Consequently, we may fairly assume that, even if he maintains an apparent
  neutrality, his influence will be exerted in favour of Hurst rather than of
  Bellingham; from which it follows that Bellingham ought certainly to be
  properly advised, and, when the case goes into Court, properly
  represented.'</p>

  <p>'He can't afford either the one or the other,' said I. 'He's as poor as an
  insolvent church mouse and as proud as the devil. He wouldn't accept
  professional aid that he couldn't pay for.'</p>

  <p>'H'm,' grunted Thorndyke, 'that's awkward. But we can't allow the case to
  go "by default", so to speak&mdash;to fail for the mere lack of technical
  assistance. Besides, it is one of the most interesting cases that I have ever
  met with, and I am not going to see it bungled. He couldn't object to a
  little general advice in a friendly, informal way&mdash;amicus curia, as old
  Brodribb is so fond of saying; and there is nothing to prevent us from
  pushing forward the preliminary inquiries.'</p>

  <p>'Of what nature would they be?'</p>

  <p>'Well, to begin with, we have to satisfy ourselves that the conditions of
  clause two have not been complied with: that John Bellingham has not been
  buried within the parish boundaries mentioned. Of course he has not, but we
  must not take anything for granted. Then we have to satisfy ourselves that he
  is not still alive and accessible. It is perfectly possible that he is, after
  all, and it is our business to trace him, if he is still in the land of the
  living. Jervis and I can carry out these investigations without saying
  anything to Bellingham; my learned brother will look through the register of
  burials&mdash;not forgetting the cremations&mdash;in the metropolitan area,
  and I will take the other matter in hand.'</p>

  <p>'You really think that John Bellingham may still be alive?' said I.</p>

  <p>'Since his body has not been found, it is obviously a possibility. I think
  it in the highest degree improbable, but the improbable has to be
  investigated before it can be excluded.'</p>

  <p>'It sounds rather a hopeless quest,' I remarked. 'How do you propose to
  begin?'</p>

  <p>'I think of beginning at the British Museum. The people there may be able
  to throw some light on his movements. I know that there are some important
  evacuations in progress at Heliopolis&mdash;in fact, the Director of the
  Egyptian Department is out there at the present moment; and Doctor Norbury,
  who is taking his place temporarily, is an old friend of Bellingham's. I
  shall call on him and try to discover if there is anything that might have
  induced Bellingham suddenly to go abroad&mdash;to Heliopolis, for instance.
  Also he may be able to tell me what it was that took the missing man to Paris
  on that last, rather mysterious journey. That might turn out to be an
  important clue. And meanwhile, Berkeley, you must endeavour tactfully to
  reconcile your friend to the idea of letting us give an eye to the case. Make
  it clear to him that I am doing this entirely for the enlargement of my own
  knowledge.'</p>

  <p>'But won't you have to be instructed by a solicitor?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes, nominally; but only as a matter of etiquette. We shall do all the
  actual work. Why do you ask?'</p>

  <p>'I was thinking of the solicitor's costs, and I was going to mention that
  I have a little money of my own&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Then you keep it, my dear fellow. You'll want it when you go into
  practice. There will be no difficulty about the solicitor; I shall ask one of
  my friends to act nominally as a personal favour to me&mdash;Marchmont would
  take the case for us, Jervis, I am sure.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Jervis. 'Or old Brodribb, if we put it to him amicus
  curia.'</p>

  <p>'It is excessively kind of both of you to take this benevolent interest in
  the case of my friends,' I said; 'and it is to be hoped that they won't be
  foolishly proud and stiff-necked about it. It's rather the way with poor
  gentlefolk.'</p>

  <p>'I'll tell you what!' exclaimed Jervis. 'I have a most brilliant idea. You
  shall give us a little supper at your rooms and invite the Bellinghams to
  meet us. Then you and I will attack the old gentleman, and Thorndyke shall
  exercise his persuasive powers on the lady. These chronic incurable old
  bachelors, you know, are quite irresistible.'</p>

  <p>'You observe that my respected junior condemns me to lifelong celibacy,'
  Thorndyke remarked. 'But,' he added, 'his suggestion is quite a good one. Of
  course, we mustn't put any sort of pressure on Bellingham to employ
  us&mdash;for that is what it amounts to, even if we accept no
  payment&mdash;but a friendly talk over the supper-table would enable us to
  put the matter delicately and yet convincingly.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said I, 'I see that, and I like the idea immensely. But it won't be
  possible for several days, because I've got a job that takes up all my spare
  time&mdash;and that I ought to be at work on now,' I added, with a sudden
  qualm at the way in which I had forgotten the passage of time in the interest
  of Thorndyke's analysis.</p>

  <p>My two friends looked at me inquiringly and I felt it necessary to explain
  about the injured hand and the Tell el Amarna tablets; which I accordingly
  did rather shyly and with a nervous eye upon Jervis. The slow grin, however,
  for which I was watching, never came; on the contrary, he not only heard me
  through quite gravely, but when I had finished said with some warmth, and
  using my old hospital pet name:</p>

  <p>'I'll say one thing for you, Polly; you're a good chum, and you always
  were. I hope your Nevill's Court friends appreciate the fact.'</p>

  <p>They are far more appreciative than the occasion warrants,' I answered.
  'But to return to this question: how will this day week suit you?'</p>

  <p>'It will suit me,' Thorndyke answered, with a glance at his junior.</p>

  <p>'And me too,' said the latter; 'so, if it will do for the Bellinghams, we
  will consider it settled; but if they can't come, you must fix another
  night.'</p>

  <p>'Very well,' I said, rising and knocking out my pipe, 'I will issue the
  invitation to-morrow. And now I must be off to have another slog at those
  notes.'</p>

  <p>As I walked homewards I speculated cheerfully on the prospect of
  entertaining my friends under my own (or rather Barnard's) roof, if they
  could be lured out of their eremitical retirement. The idea had, in fact,
  occurred to me already, but I had been deterred by the peculiarities of
  Barnard's housekeeper. For Mrs. Gummer was one of those housewives who make
  up for an archaic simplicity of production by preparations on the most
  portentous and alarming scale. But this time I would not be deterred. If only
  the guests could be enticed into my humble lair it would be easy to furnish
  the raw materials of the feast from outside; and the consideration of ways
  and means occupied me pleasantly until I found myself once more at my
  writing-table, confronted by my voluminous notes on the incidents of the
  North Syrian War.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VIII. A MUSEUM IDYLL</h3>

  <p>WHETHER it was that practice revived a forgotten skill on my part, or that
  Miss Bellingham had over-estimated the amount of work to be done, I am unable
  to say. But whichever may have been the explanation, the fact is that the
  fourth afternoon saw our task so nearly completed that I was fain to plead
  that a small remainder might be left over to form an excuse for yet one more
  visit to the reading-room.</p>

  <p>Short, however, as had been the period of our collaboration, it had been
  long enough to produce a great change in our relations to one another. For
  there is no friendship so intimate and satisfying as that engendered by
  community of work, and none&mdash;between man and woman, at any rate&mdash;so
  frank and wholesome.</p>

  <p>Every day had arrived to find a pile of books with the places duly marked
  and the blue-covered quarto notebooks in readiness. Every day we had worked
  steadily at the allotted task, had then handed in the books and gone forth
  together to enjoy a most companionable tea in the milk-shop; thereafter to
  walk home by way of Queen Square, talking over the day's work and discussing
  the state of the world in the far-off days when Ahkhenaten was king and the
  Tell el Amarna tablets were a-writing.</p>

  <p>It had been a pleasant time, so pleasant, that as I handed in the books
  for the last time, I sighed to think that it was over; that not only was the
  task finished, but that the recovery of my fair patient's hand, from which I
  had that morning removed the splint, had put an end to the need of my
  help.</p>

  <p>'What shall we do?' I asked, as we came out into the central hall. 'It is
  too early for tea. Shall we go and look at some of the galleries?'</p>

  <p>'Why not?' she answered. 'We might look over some of the things connected
  with what we have been doing. For instance, there is a relief of Ahkhenaten
  upstairs in the Third Egyptian Room; we might go and look at it.'</p>

  <p>I fell in eagerly with the suggestion, placing myself under her
  experienced guidance, and we started by way of the Roman Gallery, past the
  long row of extremely commonplace and modern-looking Roman Emperors.</p>

  <p>'I don't know,' she said, pausing for a moment opposite a bust labelled
  'Trajan' (but obviously a portrait of Phil May), 'how I am ever even to thank
  you for all that you have done, to say nothing of repayment.'</p>

  <p>'There is no need to do either,' I replied. 'I have enjoyed working with
  you so I have had my reward. But still,' I added, 'if you want to do me a
  great kindness, you have it in your power.'</p>

  <p>'How?'</p>

  <p>'In connection with my friend, Doctor Thorndyke. I told you he was an
  enthusiast. Now he is, for some reason, most keenly interested in everything
  relating to your uncle, and I happen to know that, if any legal proceedings
  should take place, he would very much like to keep a friendly eye on the
  case.'</p>

  <p>'And what do you want me to do?'</p>

  <p>'I want you, if an opportunity should occur for him to give your father
  advice or help of any kind, to use your influence with your father in favour
  of, rather than in opposition to, his accepting it&mdash;always assuming that
  you have no real feeling against his doing so.'</p>

  <p>Miss Bellingham looked at me thoughtfully for a few moments, and then
  laughed softly.</p>

  <p>'So the great kindness that I am to do you is to let you do me a further
  kindness through your friend!'</p>

  <p>'No,' I protested; 'that is where you are mistaken. It isn't benevolence
  on Doctor Thorndyke's part; it's professional enthusiasm.'</p>

  <p>She smiled sceptically.</p>

  <p>'You don't believe in it,' I said; 'but consider other cases. Why does a
  surgeon get out of bed on a winter's night to do an emergency operation at a
  hospital? He doesn't get paid for it. Do you think it is altruism?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course. Isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly not. He does it because it is his job, because it is his
  business to fight with disease&mdash;and win.'</p>

  <p>'I don't see much difference,' she said. 'It's work done for love instead
  of for payment. However, I will do as you ask if the opportunity arises; but
  I shan't suppose that I am repaying your kindness to me.'</p>

  <p>'I don't mind so long as you do it,' I said, and we walked on for some
  time in silence.</p>

  <p>'Isn't it odd,' she said presently, 'how our talk always seems to come
  back to my uncle? Oh, and that reminds me that the things he gave to the
  Museum are in the same room as the Ahkhenaten relief. Would you like to see
  them?'</p>

  <p>'Of course I should.'</p>

  <p>'Then we will go and look at them first.' She paused, and then, rather
  shyly and with a rising colour, she continued: 'And I think I should like to
  introduce you to a very dear friend of mine&mdash;with your permission, of
  course.'</p>

  <p>This last addition she made hastily, seeing, I suppose, that I looked
  rather glum at the suggestion. Inwardly I consigned her friend to the devil,
  especially if of the masculine gender; outwardly I expressed my felicity at
  making the acquaintance of any person whom she should honour with her
  friendship. Whereat, to my discomfiture, she laughed enigmatically; a very
  soft laugh, low-pitched and musical, like the cooing of a glorified
  pigeon.</p>

  <p>I strolled on by her side, speculating a little anxiously on the coming
  introduction. Was I being conducted to the lair of one of the servants
  attached to the establishment? and would he add a superfluous third to our
  little party of two, so complete and companionable, solus cum sola, in this
  populated wilderness? Above all, would he turn out to be a young man, and
  bring my aerial castles tumbling about my ears. The shy look and the blush
  with which she had suggested the introduction were ominous indications, upon
  which I mused gloomily as we ascended the stairs and passed through the wide
  doorway. I glanced apprehensively at my companion, and met a quiet,
  inscrutable smile; and at that moment she halted opposite a wall-case and
  faced me.</p>

  <p>'This is my friend,' she said. 'Let me present you to Artemidorus, late of
  the Fayyum. Oh, don't smile!' she pleaded. 'I am quite serious. Have you
  never heard of pious Catholics who cherish a devotion to some long-departed
  saint? That is my feeling towards Artemidorus, and if you only knew what
  comfort he has shed into the heart of a lonely woman; what a quiet,
  unobtrusive friend he has been to me in my solitary, friendless days, always
  ready with a kindly greeting on his gentle, thoughtful face, you would like
  him for that alone. And I want you to like him and to share our silent
  friendship. Am I very silly, very sentimental?'</p>

  <p>A wave of relief swept over me, and the mercury of my emotional
  thermometer, which had shrunk almost into the bulb, leaped up to summer heat.
  How charming it was of her and how sweetly intimate, to wish to share this
  mystical friendship with me! And what a pretty conceit it was, too, and how
  like this strange, inscrutable maiden, to come here and hold silent converse
  with this long-departed Greek. And the pathos of it all touched me deeply
  amidst the joy of this new-born intimacy.</p>

  <p>'Are you scornful?' she asked, with a shade of disappointment, as I made
  no reply.</p>

  <p>'No, indeed I am not,' I answered earnestly. 'I want to make you aware of
  my sympathy and my appreciation without offending you by seeming to
  exaggerate, and I don't know how to express it.' Oh, never mind about the
  expression, so long as you feel it. I thought you would understand,' and she
  gave me a smile that made me tingle to my finger-tips.</p>

  <p>We stood awhile gazing in silence at the mummy&mdash;for such, indeed, was
  her friend Artemidorus. But not an ordinary mummy. Egyptian in form, it was
  entirely Greek in feeling; and brightly coloured as it was, in accordance
  with the racial love of colour, the tasteful refinement with which the
  decoration of the case was treated made those around look garish and
  barbaric. But the most striking feature was a charming panel picture which
  occupied the place of the usual mask. This painting was a revelation to me.
  Except that it was executed in tempera instead of oil, it differed in no
  respect from modern work. There was nothing archaic or ancient about it. With
  its freedom of handling and its correct rendering of light and shade, it
  might have been painted yesterday; indeed, enclosed in an ordinary gilt
  frame, it might have passed without remark in an exhibition of modern
  portraits.</p>

  <p>Miss Bellingham observed my admiration and smiled approvingly.</p>

  <p>'It is a charming little portrait, isn't it?' she said; 'and such a sweet
  face too; so thoughtful and human, with a shade of melancholy. But the whole
  thing is full of charm. I fell in love with it the first time I saw it. And
  it is so Greek!'</p>

  <p>'Yes, it is, in spite of the Egyptian gods and symbols.'</p>

  <p>'Rather because of them, I think,' said she. 'There we have the typical
  Greek attitude, the genial, cultivated electicism that appreciated the
  fitness of even the most alien forms of art. There is Anubis standing beside
  the bier; there are Isis and Nephthys, and there below Horus and Tahuti. But
  we can't suppose Artemidorus worshipped or believed in those gods. They are
  there because they are splendid decoration and perfectly appropriate in
  character. The real feeling of those who loved the dead man breaks out in the
  inscription.' She pointed to a band below the pectoral, where, in gilt
  capital letters, was written the two words, (Greek).'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I said, 'it is very dignified and very human.'</p>

  <p>'And so sincere and full of real emotion,' she added. 'I find it
  unspeakably touching. "O Artemidorus, farewell!" There is the real note of
  human grief, the sorrow of eternal parting. How much finer it is than the
  vulgar boastfulness of the Semitic epitaphs, or our own miserable, insincere
  make-believe of the "Not lost but gone before" type. He has gone from them
  for ever; they would look on his face and hear his voice no more; they
  realised that this was their last farewell. Oh, there is a world of love and
  sorrow in those two simple words!'</p>

  <p>For some time neither of us spoke. The glamour of this touching memorial
  of a long-buried grief had stolen over me, and I was content to stand silent
  by my beloved companion and revive, with a certain pensive pleasure, the
  ghosts of human emotions over which the many centuries had rolled. Presently
  she turned to me with a frank smile. 'You have been weighed in the balance of
  friendship,' she said, 'and not found wanting. You have the gift of sympathy,
  even with a woman's sentimental fancies.'</p>

  <p>I suspected that a good many men would have developed this precious
  quality under the circumstances, but I refrained from saying so. There is no
  use in crying down one's own wares. I was glad enough to have earned her good
  opinion so easily, and when she at length turned away from the case and
  passed through into the adjoining room, it was a very complacent young man
  who bore her company.</p>

  <p>'Here is Ahkhenaten&mdash;or Khu-en-aten, as the authorities here render
  the hieroglyphics. She indicated a fragment of a coloured relief labelled:
  'Portion of a painted stone tablet with a portrait figure of Amenhotep IV,
  and we stopped to look at the frail, effeminate figure of the great king,
  with his large cranium, his queer, pointed chin, and the Aten rays stretching
  out their weird hands as if caressing him.</p>

  <p>'We mustn't stay here if you want to see my uncle's gift, because this
  room closes at four to-day.' With this admonition she moved on to the other
  end of the room, where she halted before a large floor-case containing a
  mummy and a large number of other objects. A black label with white lettering
  set forth the various contents with a brief explanation as follows:</p><br>

  <p class="quote">'Mummy of Sebekhotep, a scribe of the twenty-second dynasty,
  together with the objects found in the tomb. These include the four Canopic
  jars, in which the internal organs were deposited, the Ushabti figures, tomb
  provisions and various articles that had belonged to the deceased; his
  favourite chair, his head-rest, his ink-palette, inscribed with his name and
  the name of the king, Osorkon I, in whose reign he lived, and other smaller
  articles. Presented by John Bellingham, Esq.'</p><br>

  <p>'They have put all the objects together in one case,' Miss Bellingham
  explained, 'to show the contents of an ordinary tomb of the better class. You
  see that the dead man was provided with all his ordinary comforts:
  provisions, furniture, the ink-palette that he had been accustomed to use in
  writing on papyri, and a staff of servants to wait on him.'</p>

  <p>'Where are the servants?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'The little Ushabti figures,' she answered; 'they were the attendants of
  the dead, you know, his servants in the under-world. It was a quaint idea,
  wasn't it? But it was all very complete and consistent, and quite reasonable,
  too, if one once accepts the belief in the persistence of the individual
  apart from the body.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I agreed, 'and that is the only fair way to judge a religious
  system, by taking the main beliefs for granted. But what a business it must
  have been, bringing all these things from Egypt to London.'</p>

  <p>'It was worth the trouble, though, for it is a fine and instructive
  collection. And the work is all very good of its kind. You notice that the
  Ushabti figures and the heads that form the stoppers of the Canopic jars are
  quite finely modelled. The mummy itself, too, is rather handsome, though that
  coat of bitumen on the back doesn't improve it. But Sebekhotep must have been
  a fine-looking man.'</p>

  <p>'The mask on the face is a portrait, I suppose?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; in fact, it's rather more. To some extent it is the actual face of
  the man himself. This mummy is enclosed in what is called a cartonnage, that
  is a case moulded on the figure. The cartonnage was formed of a number of
  layers of linen or papyrus united by glue or cement, and when the case had
  been fitted to a mummy it was moulded to the body, so that the general form
  of the features and limbs was often apparent. After the cement was dry the
  case was covered with a thin layer of stucco and the face modelled more
  completely, and then decorations and inscriptions were painted on. So that,
  you see, in a cartonnage, the body was sealed up like a nut in its shell,
  unlike the more ancient forms in which the mummy was merely rolled up and
  enclosed in a wooden coffin.'</p>

  <p>At this moment there smote upon our ears a politely protesting voice
  announcing in sing-song tones that it was closing time; and simultaneously a
  desire for tea suggested the hospitable milk-shop. With leisurely dignity
  that ignored the official who shepherded us along the galleries, we made our
  way to the entrance, still immersed in conversation on matters
  sepulchral.</p>

  <p>It was rather earlier than our usual hour for leaving the Museum and,
  moreover, it was our last day&mdash;for the present. Wherefore we lingered
  over our tea to an extent that caused the milk-shop lady to view us with some
  disfavour, and when at length we started homeward, we took so many short cuts
  that six o'clock found us no nearer our destination than Lincoln's Inn
  Fields; whither we had journeyed by a slightly indirect route that traversed
  (among other places) Russell Square, Red Lion Square, with the quaint passage
  of the same name, Bedford Row, Jockey's Fields, Hand Court, and Great
  Turnstile.</p>

  <p>It was in the latter thoroughfare that our attention was attracted by a
  flaming poster outside a newsvendor's bearing the startling inscription:</p>

  <p>MORE MEMENTOES</p>

  <p>OF MURDERED MAN</p>

  <p>Miss Bellingham glanced at the poster and shuddered.</p>

  <p>'Horrible, isn't it?' she said. 'Have you read about them?'</p>

  <p>'I haven't been noticing the papers the last few days,' I replied.</p>

  <p>'No, of course you haven't. You've been slaving at those wretched notes.
  We don't very often see the papers, at least we don't take them in, but Miss
  Oman has kept us supplied during the last day or two. She is a perfect little
  ghoul; she delights in horrors of every kind, and the more horrible the
  better.'</p>

  <p>'But,' I asked, 'what is it they have found?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, they are the remains of some poor creature who seems to have been
  murdered and cut into pieces. It is dreadful. It made me shudder to read of
  it, for I couldn't help thinking of poor Uncle John, and, as for my father,
  he was really quite upset.'</p>

  <p>'Are these the bones that were found in a watercress-bed at Sidcup?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, but they have found several more. The police have been most
  energetic. They seem to have been making a systematic search, and the result
  has been that they have discovered several portions of the body, scattered
  about in very widely separated places&mdash;Sidcup, Lee, St Mary Cray; and
  yesterday it was reported that an arm had been found in one of the ponds
  called "the Cuckoo Pits," close to our old home.'</p>

  <p>'What! in Essex?' I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>'Yes, in Epping Forest, quite near Woodford. Isn't it dreadful to think of
  it? They were probably hidden when we were living there. I think it was that
  that horrified my father so much. When he read it he was so upset that he
  gathered up the whole bundle of newspapers and tossed them out of the window;
  and they blew over the wall, and poor Miss Oman had to rush and pursue them
  up the court.'</p>

  <p>'Do you think he suspects that these remains may be those of your
  uncle?'</p>

  <p>'I think so, though he has said nothing to that effect, and, of course, I
  have not made any suggestion to him. We always preserve the fiction between
  ourselves of believing that Uncle John is still alive.'</p>

  <p>'But you don't think he is, do you?'</p>

  <p>'No, I'm afraid I don't; and I feel pretty sure that my father doesn't
  think so either, but he doesn't like to admit it to me.'</p>

  <p>'Do you happen to remember what bones have been found?'</p>

  <p>'No, I don't. I know that an arm was found in the Cuckoo Pits, and I think
  a thigh-bone was dredged up out of a pond near St Mary Cray. But Miss Oman
  will be able to tell you all about it, if you are interested. She will be
  delighted to meet a kindred spirit,' Miss Bellingham added, with a smile.</p>

  <p>'I don't know that I claim spiritual kinship with a ghoul,' said I;
  'especially such a very sharp-tempered ghoul.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, don't disparage her, Doctor Berkeley!' Miss Bellingham pleaded. 'She
  isn't really bad-tempered; only a little prickly on the surface. I oughtn't
  to have called her a ghoul; she is just the sweetest, most affectionate, most
  unselfish little angelic human hedgehog that you could find if you travelled
  the wide world through. Do you know that she has been working her fingers to
  the bone making an old dress of mine presentable because she is so anxious
  that I shall look nice at your little supper party.'</p>

  <p>'You are sure to do that, in any case,' I said; 'but I withdraw my remark
  as to her temper unreservedly. And I really didn't mean it, you know; I have
  always liked the little lady.'</p>

  <p>'That's right; and now won't you come in and have a few minutes' chat with
  my father? We are quite early in spite of the short cuts.'</p>

  <p>I accepted readily, and the more so inasmuch as I wanted a few words with
  Miss Oman on the subject of catering and did not want to discuss it before my
  friends. Accordingly I went and gossiped with Mr. Bellingham, chiefly about
  the work we had done at the Museum, until it was time for me to return to the
  surgery.</p>

  <p>Having taken my leave, I walked down the stairs with reflective slowness
  and as much creaking of my boots as I could manage; with the result,
  hopefully anticipated, that as I approached the door of Miss Oman's room it
  opened and the lady's head protruded.</p>

  <p>'I'd change my cobbler if I were you,' she said.</p>

  <p>I thought of the 'angelic human hedgehog', and nearly sniggered in her
  face.</p>

  <p>'I am sure you would, Miss Oman, instantly; though, mind you, the poor
  fellow can't help his looks.'</p>

  <p>'You are a very flippant young man,' she said severely. Whereat I grinned,
  and she regarded me silently with a baleful glare. Suddenly I remembered my
  mission and became serious and sober.</p>

  <p>'Miss Oman,' I said, 'I very much want to take your advice on a matter of
  some importance&mdash;to me, at least.' (That ought to fetch her, I thought.
  The 'advice fly'&mdash;strangely neglected by Izaak Walton&mdash;is
  guaranteed to kill in any weather.) And it did fetch her. She rose in a flash
  and gorged it, cock's feathers, worsted body and all.</p>

  <p>'What is it about?' she asked eagerly. 'But don't stand out here where
  everybody can hear but me. Come in and sit down.'</p>

  <p>Now I didn't want to discuss the matter here, and, besides, there was not
  time. I therefore assumed an air of mystery.</p>

  <p>'I can't, Miss Oman. I'm due at the surgery now. But if you should be
  passing and should have a few minutes to spare, I should be greatly obliged
  if you would look in. I really don't quite know how to act.'</p>

  <p>'No, I expect not. Men very seldom do. But you're better than most, for
  you know when you are in difficulties and have the sense to consult a woman.
  But what is it about? Perhaps I might be thinking it over.'</p>

  <p>'Well, you know,' I began evasively, 'it's a simple matter, but I can't
  very well&mdash;no, by Jove!' I added, looking at my watch, 'I must run, or I
  shall keep the multitude waiting.' And with this I bustled away, leaving her
  literally dancing with curiosity.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IX. THE SPHINX OF LINCOLN'S INN</h3>

  <p>AT the age of twenty-six one cannot claim to have attained to the position
  of a person of experience. Nevertheless, the knowledge of human nature
  accumulated in that brief period sufficed to make me feel confident that, at
  some time during the evening, I should receive a visit from Miss Oman. And
  circumstances justified my confidence; for the clock yet stood at two minutes
  to seven when a premonitory tap at the surgery door heralded her arrival.</p>

  <p>'I happened to be passing,' she explained, and I forbore to smile at the
  coincidence, 'so I thought I might as well drop in and hear what you wanted
  to ask me about.'</p>

  <p>She seated herself in the patients' chair and laying a bundle of
  newspapers on the table, glared at me expectantly.</p>

  <p>'Thank you, Miss Oman,' said I. 'It is very good of you to look in on me.
  I am ashamed to give you all this trouble about such a trifling matter.'</p>

  <p>She rapped her knuckles impatiently on the table.</p>

  <p>'Never mind about the trouble,' she exclaimed tartly.
  'What&mdash;is&mdash;it&mdash;that&mdash;you&mdash;want&mdash;to&mdash;ask&mdash;me
  about?'</p>

  <p>I stated my difficulties in respect of the supper-party, and, as I
  proceeded, an expression of disgust and disappointment spread over her
  countenance.</p>

  <p>'I don't see why you need have been so mysterious about it,' she said
  glumly.</p>

  <p>'I didn't mean to be mysterious; I was only anxious not to make a mess of
  the affair. It's all very fine to assume a lofty scorn of the pleasures of
  the table, but there is great virtue in a really good feed, especially when
  low-living and high-thinking have been the order of the day.'</p>

  <p>'Coarsely put,' said Miss Oman, 'but perfectly true.'</p>

  <p>'Very well. Now, if I leave the management to Mrs. Gummer, she will
  probably provide a tepid Irish stew with flakes of congealed fat on it, and a
  plastic suet-pudding or something of that kind, and turn the house upside
  down in getting it ready. So I thought of having a cold spread and getting
  the things from outside. But I don't want it to look as if I had been making
  enormous preparations.'</p>

  <p>'They won't think the things came down from heaven,' said Miss Oman.</p>

  <p>'No, I suppose they won't. But you know what I mean. Now, where do you
  advise me to go for the raw materials of conviviality?'</p>

  <p>Miss Oman reflected. 'You had better let me do your shopping and manage
  the whole business,' was her final verdict.</p>

  <p>This was precisely what I wanted, and I accepted thankfully, regardless of
  the feelings of Mrs. Gummer. I handed her two pounds, and, after some
  protests at my extravagance, she bestowed them in her purse; a process that
  occupied time, since that receptacle, besides being a sort of miniature
  Record Office of frayed and time-stained bills, already bulged with a lading
  of draper's samples, ends of tape, a card of linen buttons, another of hooks
  and eyes, a lump of beeswax, a rat-eaten stump of lead-pencil, and other
  trifles that I have forgotten. As she closed the purse at the imminent risk
  of wrenching off its fastenings she looked at me severely and pursed her
  lips.</p>

  <p>'You're a very plausible young man,' she remarked.</p>

  <p>'What makes you say that?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Philandering about museums,' she continued, 'with handsome young ladies
  on the pretence of work. Work, indeed! Oh, I heard her telling her father
  about it. She thinks you were perfectly enthralled by the mummies and dried
  cats and chunks of stone and all the other trash. She doesn't know what
  humbugs men are.'</p>

  <p>'Really, Miss Oman&mdash;' I began.</p>

  <p>'Oh, don't talk to me!' she snapped. 'I can see it all. You can't impose
  upon me. I can see you staring into those glass cases, egging her on to talk
  and listening open-mouthed and bulging-eyed and sitting at her
  feet&mdash;now, didn't you?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know about sitting at her feet,' I said, 'though it might easily
  have come to that with those infernal slippery floors; but I had a very jolly
  time, and I mean to go again if I can. Miss Bellingham is the cleverest and
  most accomplished woman I have ever spoken to.'</p>

  <p>This was a poser for Miss Oman, whose admiration and loyalty, I knew, were
  only equalled by my own. She would have liked to contradict me, but the thing
  was impossible. To cover her defeat she snatched up the bundle of newspapers
  and began to open them out.</p>

  <p>'What sort of stuff is "hibernation"?' she demanded suddenly.</p>

  <p>'Hibernation!' I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>'Yes. They found a patch of it on a bone that was discovered in a pond at
  St Mary Cray, and a similar patch on one that was found at some other place
  in Essex. Now, I want to know what "hibernation" is.'</p>

  <p>'You must mean "eburnation,"' I said, after a moment's reflection.</p>

  <p>'The newspapers say "hibernation," and I suppose they know what they are
  talking about. If you don't know what it is, don't be ashamed to say so.'</p>

  <p>'Well, then, I don't.'</p>

  <p>'In that case you had better read the papers and find out,' she said, a
  little illogically. And then: 'Are you fond of murders? I am, awfully.'</p>

  <p>'What a shocking little ghoul you must be!' I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She stuck out her chin at me. I'll trouble you,' she said, 'to be a little
  more respectful in your language. Do you realise that I am old enough to be
  your mother?'</p>

  <p>'Impossible!' I ejaculated.</p>

  <p>'Fact,' said Miss Oman.</p>

  <p>'Well, anyhow,' said I, 'age is not the only qualification. And besides,
  you are too late for the billet. The vacancy's filled.'</p>

  <p>Miss Oman slapped the papers down on the table and rose abruptly.</p>

  <p>'You had better read the papers and see if you can learn a little sense,'
  she said severely as she turned to go. 'Oh, and don't forget the finger!' she
  added eagerly. 'That is really thrilling.'</p>

  <p>'The finger?' I repeated.</p>

  <p>'Yes. They found a hand with one missing. The police think it is an
  important clue. I don't know what they mean; but you read the account and
  tell me what you think.'</p>

  <p>With this parting injunction she bustled out through the surgery, and I
  followed to bid her a ceremonious adieu on the doorstep. I watched her little
  figure tripping with quick, bird-like steps down Fetter Lane, and was about
  to turn back into the surgery when my attention was attracted by the
  evolutions of an elderly gentleman on the opposite side of the street. He was
  a somewhat peculiar-looking man, tall, gaunt, and bony, and the way in which
  he carried his head suggested to the medical mind a pronounced degree of near
  sight and a pair of deep spectacle glasses. Suddenly he espied me and crossed
  the road with his chin thrust forward and a pair of keen blue eyes directed
  at me through the centres of his spectacles.</p>

  <p>'I wonder if you can and will help me,' said he, with a courteous salute.
  'I wish to call on an acquaintance, and I have forgotten his address. It is
  in some court, but the name of that court has escaped me for the moment. My
  friend's name is Bellingham. I suppose you don't chance to know it? Doctors
  know a great many people, as a rule.'</p>

  <p>'Do you mean Mr. Godfrey Bellingham?'</p>

  <p>'Ah! Then you do know him. I have not consulted the oracle in vain. He is
  a patient of yours, no doubt?'</p>

  <p>'A patient and personal friend. His address is Forty-nine Nevill's
  Court.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, thank you. Oh, and as you are a friend, perhaps you can inform
  me as to the customs of the household. I am not expected, and I do not wish
  to make an untimely visit. What are Mr. Bellingham's habits as to his evening
  meal? Would this be a convenient time to call?'</p>

  <p>'I generally make my evening visits a little later than this&mdash;say
  about half-past eight; they have finished their meal by then.'</p>

  <p>'Ah! Half-past eight, then? Then I suppose I had better take a walk until
  that time. I don't want to disturb them.'</p>

  <p>'Would you care to come in and smoke a cigar until it is time to make your
  call? If you would, I could walk over with you and show you the house.'</p>

  <p>'That is very kind of you,' said my new acquaintance, with an inquisitive
  glance at me through his spectacles. 'I think I should like to sit down. It's
  a dull affair, mooning about the streets, and there isn't time to go back to
  my chambers&mdash;in Lincoln's Inn.'</p>

  <p>'I wonder,' said I, as I ushered him into the room lately vacated by Miss
  Oman, 'if you happen to be Mr. Jellicoe?'</p>

  <p>He turned his spectacles full on me with a keen, suspicious glance. 'What
  makes you think I am Mr. Jellicoe?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Oh, only that you live in Lincoln's Inn.'</p>

  <p>'Ha! I see. I live in Lincoln's Inn; Mr. Jellicoe lives in Lincoln's Inn;
  therefore I am Mr. Jellicoe. Ha! ha! Bad logic, but a correct conclusion.
  Yes, I am Mr. Jellicoe. What do you know about me?'</p>

  <p>'Mighty little, excepting that you were the late John Bellingham's man of
  business.'</p>

  <p>'The "late John Bellingham," hey! How do you know he is the late John
  Bellingham?'</p>

  <p>'As a matter of fact, I don't; only I rather understood that that was your
  own belief.'</p>

  <p>'You understood! Now from whom did you "understand" that? From Godfrey
  Bellingham? H'm! And how did he know what I believe? I never told him. It is
  a very unsafe thing, my dear sir, to expound another man's beliefs.'</p>

  <p>'Then you think that John Bellingham is alive?'</p>

  <p>'Do I? Who said so? I did not, you know.'</p>

  <p>'But he must be either dead or alive.'</p>

  <p>'There,' said Mr. Jellicoe, 'I am entirely with you. You have stated an
  undeniable truth.'</p>

  <p>'It is not a very illuminating one, however,' I replied, laughing.</p>

  <p>'Undeniable truths often are not,' he retorted. 'They are apt to be
  extremely general. In fact, I would affirm that the certainty of the truth of
  a given proposition is directly proportional to its generality.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose that is so,' said I.</p>

  <p>'Undoubtedly. Take an instance from your own profession. Given a million
  normal human beings under twenty, and you can say with certainty that a
  majority of them will die before reaching a certain age, that they will die
  in certain circumstances and of certain diseases. Then take a single unit
  from that million, and what can you predict concerning him? Nothing. He may
  die to-morrow; he may live to be a couple of hundred. He may die of a cold in
  the head or a cut finger, or from falling off the cross of St Paul's. In a
  particular case you can predict nothing.'</p>

  <p>'That is perfectly true,' said I. And then realising that I had been led
  away from the topic of John Bellingham, I ventured to return to it.</p>

  <p>'That was a very mysterious affair&mdash;the disappearance of John
  Bellingham, I mean.'</p>

  <p>'Why mysterious?' asked Mr. Jellicoe. 'Men disappear from time to time,
  and when they reappear, the explanations that they give (when they give any)
  seem more or less adequate.'</p>

  <p>'But the circumstances were surely rather mysterious.'</p>

  <p>'What circumstances?' asked Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'I mean the way in which he vanished from Mr. Hurst's house.'</p>

  <p>'In what way did he vanish from it?'</p>

  <p>'Well, of course, I don't know.'</p>

  <p>'Precisely. Neither do I. Therefore I can't say whether that way was a
  mysterious one or not.'</p>

  <p>'It is not even certain that he did leave it,' I remarked, rather
  recklessly.</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' said Mr. Jellicoe. 'And if he did not, he is there still. And
  if he is there still, he has not disappeared&mdash;in the sense understood.
  And if he has not disappeared, there is no mystery.'</p>

  <p>I laughed heartily, but Mr. Jellicoe preserved a wooden solemnity and
  continued to examine me through his spectacles (which I, in my turn,
  inspected and estimated at about minus five dioptres). There was something
  highly diverting about this grim lawyer, with his dry contentiousness and
  almost farcical caution. His ostentatious reserve encouraged me to ply him
  with fresh questions, the more indiscreet the better.</p>

  <p>'I suppose,' said I, 'that, under these circumstances, you would hardly
  favour Mr. Hurst's proposal to apply for permission to presume death?'</p>

  <p>'Under what circumstances?' he inquired.</p>

  <p>'I was referring to the doubt you have expressed as to whether John
  Bellingham is, after all, really dead.'</p>

  <p>'My dear sir,' said he, 'I fail to see your point. If it were certain that
  the man was alive, it would be impossible to presume that he was dead; and if
  it were certain that he was dead, presumption of death would still be
  impossible. You do not presume a certainty. The uncertainty is of the essence
  of the transaction.'</p>

  <p>'But,' I persisted, 'if you really believe that he may be alive, I should
  hardly have thought that you would take the responsibility of presuming his
  death and dispersing his property.'</p>

  <p>'I don't,' said Mr. Jellicoe. 'I take no responsibility. I act in
  accordance with the decision of the Court and have no choice in the
  matter.'</p>

  <p>'But the Court may decide that he is dead and he may nevertheless be
  alive.'</p>

  <p>'Not at all. If the Court decides that he is presumably dead, then he is
  presumably dead. As a mere irrelevant, physical circumstance he may, it is
  true, be alive. But legally speaking, and for testamentary purposes, he is
  dead. You fail to perceive the distinction, no doubt?'</p>

  <p>'I am afraid I do,' I admitted.</p>

  <p>'Yes; the members of your profession usually do. That is what makes them
  such bad witnesses in a court of law. The scientific outlook is radically
  different from the legal. The man of science relies on his own knowledge and
  observation and judgment, and disregards testimony. A man comes to you and
  tells you he is blind in one eye. Do you accept his statement? Not in the
  least. You proceed to test his eyesight with some infernal apparatus of
  coloured glasses, and you find that he can see perfectly well with both eyes.
  Then you decide that he is not blind in one eye; that is to say, you reject
  his testimony in favour of facts of your own ascertaining.'</p>

  <p>'But surely that is the rational method of coming to a conclusion?'</p>

  <p>'In science, no doubt. Not in law. A court of law must decide according to
  the evidence which is before it; and that evidence is of the nature of sworn
  testimony. If a witness is prepared to swear that black is white and no
  evidence to the contrary is offered, the evidence before the Court is that
  black is white, and the Court must decide accordingly. The judge and the jury
  may think otherwise&mdash;they may even have private knowledge to the
  contrary&mdash;but they have to decide according to the evidence.'</p>

  <p>'Do you mean to say that a judge would be justified in giving a decision
  which he knew to be contrary to the facts? Or that he might sentence a man
  whom he knew to be innocent?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly. It has been done. There is a case of a judge who sentenced a
  man to death and allowed the execution to take place, notwithstanding that
  he&mdash;the judge&mdash;had actually seen the murder committed by another
  man. But that was carrying correctness of procedure to the verge of
  pedantry.'</p>

  <p>'It was, with a vengeance,' I agreed. 'But to return to the case of John
  Bellingham. Supposing that after the Court has decided that he is dead he
  should return alive? What then?'</p>

  <p>'Ah! It would then be his turn to make an application, and the Court,
  having fresh evidence laid before it, would probably decide that he was
  alive.'</p>

  <p>'And meantime his property would have been dispersed?'</p>

  <p>'Probably. But you will observe that the presumption of death would have
  arisen out of his own proceedings. If a man acts in such a way as to create a
  belief that he is dead, he must put up with the consequences.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, that is reasonable enough,' said I. And then, after a pause, I
  asked: 'Is there any immediate likelihood of proceedings of the kind being
  commenced?'</p>

  <p>'I understood from what you said just now that Mr. Hurst was contemplating
  some action of the kind. No doubt you had your information from a reliable
  quarter.' This answer Mr. Jellicoe delivered without moving a muscle,
  regarding me with the fixity of a spectacled figurehead.</p>

  <p>I smiled feebly. The operation of pumping Mr. Jellicoe was rather like the
  sport of boxing with a porcupine, being chiefly remarkable as a demonstration
  of the power of passive resistance. I determined, however, to make one more
  effort, rather, I think, for the pleasure of witnessing his defensive
  manoeuvres than with the expectation of getting anything out of him. I
  accordingly 'opened out' on the subject of the 'remains.'</p>

  <p>'Have you been following these remarkable discoveries of human bones that
  have been appearing in the papers?' I asked.</p>

  <p>He looked at me stonily for some moments, and then replied:</p>

  <p>'Human bones are rather more within your province than mine, but, now that
  you mention it, I think I recall having read of some such discoveries. They
  were disconnected bones, I believe.'</p>

  <p>'Yes; evidently parts of a dismembered body.'</p>

  <p>'So I should suppose. No, I have not followed the accounts. As we get on
  in life our interests tend to settle into grooves, and my groove is chiefly
  connected with conveyancing. These discoveries would be of more interest to a
  criminal lawyer.'</p>

  <p>'I thought you might, perhaps, have connected them with the disappearance
  of your client?'</p>

  <p>'Why should I? What could be the nature of the connection?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' I said, 'these are the bones of a man&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yes; and my client was a man with bones. That is a connection, certainly,
  though not a very specific or distinctive one. But perhaps you had something
  more particular in your mind?'</p>

  <p>'I had,' I replied. 'The fact that some of the bones were actually found
  on land belonging to your client seemed to me rather significant.'</p>

  <p>'Did it, indeed?' said Mr. Jellicoe. He reflected for a few moments,
  gazing steadily at me the while, and then continued: 'In that I am unable to
  follow you. It would have seemed to me that the finding of human remains upon
  a certain piece of land might conceivably throw a prima fade suspicion upon
  the owner or occupant of the land as being the person who deposited them. But
  the case that you suggest is the one case in which this would be impossible.
  A man cannot deposit his own dismembered remains.'</p>

  <p>'No, of course not. I was not suggesting that he deposited them himself,
  but merely that the fact of their being deposited on his land, in a way,
  connected these remains with him.'</p>

  <p>'Again,' said Mr. Jellicoe, 'I fail to follow you, unless you are
  suggesting that it is customary for murderers who mutilate bodies to be
  punctilious in depositing the dismembered remains upon land belonging to
  their victims. In which case I am sceptical as to your facts. I am not aware
  of the existence of any such custom. Moreover, it appears that only a portion
  of the body was deposited on Mr. Bellingham's land, the remaining portions
  having been scattered broadcast over a wide area. How does that agree with
  your suggestion?'</p>

  <p>'It doesn't, of course,' I admitted. 'But there is another fact that I
  think you will admit to be more significant. The first remains that were
  discovered were found at Sidcup. Now, Sidcup is close to Eltham; and Eltham
  is the place where Mr. Bellingham was last seen alive.'</p>

  <p>'And what is the significance of this? Why do you connect the remains with
  one locality rather than the various other localities in which other portions
  of the body were found?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' I replied, rather gravelled by this very pertinent question, 'the
  appearances seem to suggest that the person who deposited these remains
  started from the neighbourhood of Eltham, where the missing man was last
  seen.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Jellicoe shook his head. 'You appear,' said he, 'to be confusing the
  order of deposition with the order of discovery. What evidence is there that
  the remains found at Sidcup were deposited before those found elsewhere?'</p>

  <p>'I don't know that there is any,' I admitted.</p>

  <p>'Then,' said he, 'I don't see how you support your suggestion that the
  person started from the neighbourhood of Eltham.'</p>

  <p>On consideration, I had to admit that I had nothing to offer in support of
  my theory; and having thus shot my last arrow in this very unequal contest, I
  thought it time to change the subject.</p>

  <p>'I called in at the British Museum the other day,' said I, 'and had a look
  at Mr. Bellingham's last gift to the nation. The things are very well shown
  in that central case.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I was very pleased with the position they have given to the exhibit,
  and so would my poor old friend have been. I wished, as I looked at the case,
  that he could have seen it. But perhaps he may, after all.'</p>

  <p>'I am sure I hope he will,' said I, with more sincerity, perhaps, than the
  lawyer gave me credit for. For the return of John Bellingham would most
  effectually have cut the Gordian knot of my friend Godfrey's difficulties.
  'You are a good deal interested in Egyptology yourself, aren't you?' I
  added.</p>

  <p>'Greatly interested,' replied Mr. Jellicoe, with more animation than I had
  thought possible in his wooden face. 'It is a fascinating subject, the study
  of this venerable civilisation, extending back to the childhood of the human
  race, preserved for ever for our instruction in its own unchanging monuments
  like a fly in a block of amber. Everything connected with Egypt is full of an
  impressive solemnity. A feeling of permanence, of stability, defying time and
  change, pervades it. The place, the people, and the monuments alike breathe
  of eternity.'</p>

  <p>I was mightily surprised at this rhetorical outburst on the part of this
  dry, taciturn lawyer. But I liked him the better for the touch of enthusiasm
  that made him human, and determined to keep him astride of his hobby.</p>

  <p>'Yet,' said I, 'the people must have changed in the course of
  centuries.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, that is so. The people who fought against Cambyses were not the race
  who marched into Egypt five thousand years before&mdash;the dynastic people
  whose portraits we see on the early monuments. In those fifty centuries the
  blood of Hyksos and Syrians and Ethiopians and Hittites, and who can say how
  many more races, must have mingled with that of the old Egyptians. But still
  the national life went on without a break; the old culture leavened the new
  peoples, and the immigrant strangers ended by becoming Egyptians. It is a
  wonderful phenomenon. Looking back on it from our own time, it seems more
  like a geological period than the life history of a single nation. Are you at
  all interested in the subject?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, decidedly, though I am completely ignorant of it. The fact is that
  my interest is of quite recent growth. It is only of late that I have been
  sensible of the glamour of things Egyptian.'</p>

  <p>'Since you made Miss Bellingham's acquaintance, perhaps?' suggested Mr.
  Jellicoe, himself as unchanging in aspect as an Egyptian effigy.</p>

  <p>I suppose I must have reddened&mdash;I certainly resented the
  remark&mdash;for he continued in the same even tone: 'I made the suggestion
  because I know that she takes an intelligent interest in the subject and is,
  in fact, quite well informed on it.'</p>

  <p>'Yes; she seems to know a great deal about the antiquities of Egypt, and I
  may as well admit that your surmise was correct. It was she who showed me her
  uncle's collection.'</p>

  <p>'So I had supposed,' said Mr. Jellicoe. 'And a very instructive collection
  it is, in a popular sense; very suitable for exhibition in a public museum,
  though there is nothing in it of unusual interest to the expert. The tomb
  furniture is excellent of its kind and the cartonnage case of the mummy is
  well made and rather finely decorated.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I thought it quite handsome. But can you explain to me why, after
  taking all that trouble to decorate it, they should have disfigured it with
  those great smears of bitumen?'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' said Mr. Jellicoe, 'that is quite an interesting question. It is not
  unusual to find mummy cases smeared with bitumen; there is a mummy of a
  priestess in the next gallery which is completely coated with bitumen except
  the gilded face. Now, this bitumen was put on for a purpose&mdash;for the
  purpose of obliterating the inscriptions and thus concealing the identity of
  the deceased from the robbers and desecrators of tombs. And there is the
  oddity of this mummy of Sebekhotep. Evidently there was an intention of
  obliterating the inscriptions. The whole of the back is covered thickly with
  bitumen, and so are the feet. Then the workers seem to have changed their
  minds and left the inscriptions and decoration untouched. Why they intended
  to cover it, and why, having commenced, they left it partially covered only,
  is a mystery. The mummy was found in its original tomb and quite undisturbed,
  so far as tomb-robbers are concerned. Poor Bellingham was greatly puzzled as
  to what the explanation could be.'</p>

  <p>'Speaking of bitumen,' said I, 'reminds me of a question that has occurred
  to me. You know that this substance has been used a good deal by modern
  painters and that it has a very dangerous peculiarity; I mean its tendency to
  liquefy, without any obvious reason, long after it has dried.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I know. Isn't there some story about a picture of Reynolds' in which
  bitumen had been used? A portrait of a lady, I think. The bitumen softened,
  and one of the lady's eyes slipped down on to her cheek; and they had to hang
  the portrait upside down and keep it warm until the eye slipped back again
  into its place. But what was your question?'</p>

  <p>'I was wondering whether the bitumen used by the Egyptian artists has ever
  been known to soften after this great lapse of time.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I think it has. I have heard of instances in which the bitumen
  coatings have softened under certain circumstances and become quite "tacky".
  But, bless my soul! here am I gossiping with you and wasting your time, and
  it is nearly a quarter to nine!'</p>

  <p>My guest rose hastily, and I, with many apologies for having detained him,
  proceeded to fulfil my promise to guide him to his destination. As we sallied
  forth together the glamour of Egypt faded by degrees, and when he shook my
  hand stiffly at the gate of the Bellinghams' house, all his vivacity and
  enthusiasm had vanished, leaving the taciturn lawyer, dry, uncommunicative,
  and not a little suspicious.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER X. THE NEW ALLIANCE</h3>

  <p>THE 'Great Lexicographer'&mdash;tutelary deity of my adopted
  habitat&mdash;has handed down to shuddering posterity a definition of the act
  of eating which might have been framed by a dyspeptic ghoul, 'Eat: to devour
  with the mouth.' It is a shocking view to take of so genial a function:
  cynical, indelicate, and finally unforgivable by reason of its very accuracy.
  For, after all, that is what eating amounts to, if one must needs express it
  with such crude brutality. But if 'the ingestion of alimentary
  substances'&mdash;to ring a modern change upon the older formula&mdash;is in
  itself a process material even unto carnality, it is undeniable that it forms
  a highly agreeable accompaniment to more psychic manifestations.</p>

  <p>And so, as the lamplight, reinforced by accessory candles, falls on the
  little first-floor room looking on Fetter Lane&mdash;only now the curtains
  are drawn&mdash;the conversation is not the less friendly and bright for a
  running accompaniment executed with knives and forks, for clink of goblet,
  and jovial gurgle of wine-flask. On the contrary, to one of us, at
  least&mdash;to wit, Godfrey Bellingham&mdash;the occasion is one of uncommon
  festivity, and his boyish enjoyment of the simple feast makes pathetic
  suggestions of hard times, faced uncomplainingly, but keenly felt
  nevertheless.</p>

  <p>The talk flitted from topic to topic, mainly concerning itself with
  matters artistic, and never for one moment approaching the critical subject
  of John Bellingham's will. From the stepped pyramid of Sakkara with its
  encaustic tiles to mediaeval church floors; from Elizabethan woodwork to
  Mycenaean pottery, and thence to the industrial arts of the Stone age and the
  civilisation of the Aztecs, began to suspect that my two legal friends were
  so carried away by the interest of the conversation that they had forgotten
  the secret purpose of the meeting, for the dessert had been placed on the
  table (by Mrs. Gummer with the manner of a bereaved dependant dispensing
  funeral bakemeats), and still no reference had been made to the 'case'. But
  it seemed that Thorndyke was but playing a waiting game; was only allowing
  the intimacy to ripen while he watched for the opportunity. And that
  opportunity came, even as Mrs. Gummer vanished spectrally with a tray of
  plates and glasses.</p>

  <p>'So you had a visitor last night, Doctor,' said Mr. Bellingham. 'I mean my
  friend Jellicoe. He told us he had seen you, and mighty curious he was about
  you. I have never known Jellicoe to be so inquisitive before. What did you
  think of him?'</p>

  <p>'A quaint old cock. I found him highly amusing. We entertained one another
  for quite a long time with questions and crooked answers; I affecting eager
  curiosity, he replying with a defensive attitude of universal ignorance. It
  was a most diverting encounter.'</p>

  <p>'He needn't have been so close,' Miss Bellingham remarked, 'seeing that
  all the world will be regaled with our affairs before long.'</p>

  <p>'They are proposing to take the case into Court, then?' said
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Mr. Bellingham. 'Jellicoe came to tell me that my cousin,
  Hurst, has instructed his solicitors to make the application and to invite me
  to join him. Actually he came to deliver an ultimatum from Hurst&mdash;but I
  mustn't disturb the harmony of this festive gathering with litigious
  discords.'</p>

  <p>'Now, why mustn't you?' asked Thorndyke. 'Why is a subject in which we are
  all keenly interested to be taboo? You don't mind telling us about it, do
  you?'</p>

  <p>'No, of course not. But what do you think of a man who buttonholes a
  doctor at a dinner-party to retail a list of ailments?'</p>

  <p>'It depends on what his ailments are,' replied Thorndyke. 'If he is a
  chronic dyspeptic and wishes to expound the virtues of Doctor Snaffler's
  Purple Pills for Pimply People, he is merely a bore. But if he chances to
  suffer from some rare and choice disease, such as Trypanosomiasis or
  Acromegaly, the doctor will be delighted to listen.'</p>

  <p>'Then are we to understand,' Miss Bellingham asked, 'that we are rare and
  choice products, in a legal sense?'</p>

  <p>'Undoubtedly,' replied Thorndyke. 'The case of John Bellingham is, in many
  respects, unique. It will be followed with the deepest interest by the
  profession at large, and especially by medical jurists.'</p>

  <p>'How gratifying that should be to us!' said Miss Bellingham. 'We may even
  attain undying fame in textbooks and treatises; and yet we are not so very
  much puffed up with our importance.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said her father; 'we could do without the fame quite well, and so, I
  think, could Hurst. Did Berkeley tell you of the proposal that he made?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Thorndyke; 'and I gather from what you say that he has
  repeated it.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He sent Jellicoe to give me another chance, and I was tempted to
  take it; but my daughter was strongly against any compromise, and probably
  she is right. At any rate, she is more concerned than I am.'</p>

  <p>'What view did Mr. Jellicoe take?' Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>'Oh, he was very cautious and reserved, but he didn't disguise his feeling
  that I should be wise to take a certainty in lieu of a very problematical
  fortune. He would certainly like me to agree, for he naturally wishes to get
  the affair settled and pocket his legacy.'</p>

  <p>'And have you definitely refused?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; quite definitely. So Hurst will apply for permission to presume
  death and prove the will, and Jellicoe will support him; he says he has no
  choice.'</p>

  <p>'And you?'</p>

  <p>'I suppose I shall oppose the application, though I don't quite know on
  what grounds.'</p>

  <p>'Before you take definite steps,' said Thorndyke, 'you ought to give the
  matter very careful consideration. I take it that you have very little doubt
  that your brother is dead. And if he is dead, any benefit that you may
  receive under the will must be conditional on the previous presumption or
  proof of death. But perhaps you have taken advice?'</p>

  <p>'No, I have not. As our friend the Doctor has probably told you, my
  means&mdash;or rather, the lack of them&mdash;do not admit of my getting
  professional advice. Hence my delicacy about discussing the case with
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Then do you propose to conduct your case in person?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; if it is necessary for me to appear in Court, as I suppose it will
  be, if I oppose the application.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected for a few moments and then said gravely:</p>

  <p>'You had much better not appear in person to conduct your case, Mr.
  Bellingham, for several reasons. To begin with, Mr. Hurst is sure to be
  represented by a capable counsel, and you will find yourself quite unable to
  meet the sudden exigencies of a contest in Court. You will be out-maneuvered.
  Then there is the judge to be considered.'</p>

  <p>'But surely one can rely on the judge dealing fairly with a man who is
  unable to afford a solicitor and counsel?'</p>

  <p>'Undoubtedly, as a rule, a judge will give an unrepresented litigant every
  assistance and consideration. English judges in general are high-minded men
  with a deep sense of their great responsibilities. But you cannot afford to
  take any chances. You must consider the exceptions. A judge has been a
  counsel, and he may carry to the bench some of the professional prejudices of
  the bar. Indeed, if you consider the absurd licence permitted to counsel in
  their treatment of witnesses, and the hostile attitude adopted by some judges
  towards medical and other scientific men who have to give their evidence, you
  will see that the judicial mind is not always quite as judicial as one would
  wish, especially when the privileges and immunities of the profession are
  concerned. Now, your appearance in person to conduct your case must
  unavoidably, cause some inconvenience to the Court. Your ignorance of
  procedure and legal details must occasion some delay; and if the judge should
  happen to be an irritable man he might resent the inconvenience and delay. I
  don't say that would affect his decision&mdash;I don't think it
  would&mdash;but I am sure it would be wise to avoid giving offence to the
  judge. And, above all, it is most desirable to be able to detect and reply to
  any manoeuvres on the part of the opposing counsel, which you certainly would
  not be able to do.'</p>

  <p>'This is excellent advice, Doctor Thorndyke,' said Bellingham, with a grim
  smile; 'but I'm afraid I shall have to take my chance.'</p>

  <p>'Not necessarily,' said Thorndyke. 'I am going to make a little proposal,
  which I will ask you to consider without prejudice as a mutual accommodation.
  You see, your case is one of exceptional interest&mdash;it will become a
  textbook case, as Miss Bellingham prophesied; and, since it lies within my
  speciality, it will be necessary for me to follow it in the closest detail.
  Now, it would be much more satisfactory for me to study it from within than
  from without, to say nothing of the credit which would accrue to me if I
  should be able to conduct it to a successful issue. I am therefore going to
  ask you to put your case in my hands and let me see what can be done with it.
  I know this is an unusual course for a professional man to take, but I think
  it is not improper under the circumstances.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Bellingham pondered in silence for a few moments, and then, after a
  glance at his daughter, began rather hesitatingly: 'It's very generous of
  you, Doctor Thorndyke&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Pardon me,' interrupted Thorndyke, 'it is not. My motives, as I have
  explained, are purely egoistic.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Bellingham laughed uneasily and again glanced at his daughter, who,
  however, pursued her occupation of peeling a pear with calm deliberation and
  without lifting her eyes. Getting no help from her he asked: 'Do you think
  that there is any possibility whatever of a successful issue?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, a remote possibility&mdash;very remote, I fear, as things look at
  present; but if I thought the case absolutely hopeless I should advise you to
  stand aside and let events take their course.'</p>

  <p>'Supposing the case should come to a favourable termination, would you
  allow me to settle your fees in the ordinary way?'</p>

  <p>'If the choice lay with me,' replied Thorndyke, 'I should say "yes" with
  pleasure. But it does not. The attitude of the profession is very definitely
  unfavourable to "speculative" practice. You may remember the well-known firm
  of Dodson and Fogg, who gained thereby much profit, but little credit. But
  why discuss contingencies of this kind? If I bring your case to a successful
  issue I shall have done very well for myself. We shall have benefited one
  another mutually. Come now, Miss Bellingham, I appeal to you. We have eaten
  salt together, to say nothing of pigeon pie and other cakes. Won't you back
  me up, and at the same time do a kindness to Doctor Berkeley?'</p>

  <p>'Why, is Doctor Berkeley interested in our decision?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly he is, as you will appreciate when I tell you that he actually
  tried to bribe me secretly out of his own pocket.'</p>

  <p>'Did you?' she asked, looking at me with an expression that rather alarmed
  me.</p>

  <p>'Well, not exactly,' I replied, mighty hot and uncomfortable, and wishing
  Thorndyke at the devil with his confidences. 'I merely mentioned that
  the&mdash;the&mdash;solicitor's costs, you know, and that sort of
  thing&mdash;but you needn't jump on me, Miss Bellingham; Doctor Thorndyke did
  all that was necessary in that way.'</p>

  <p>She continued to look at me thoughtfully as I stammered out my excuses,
  and then said: 'I wasn't going to. I was only thinking that poverty has its
  compensations. You are all so very good to us; and, for my part, I should
  accept Doctor Thorndyke's generous offer most gratefully, and thank him for
  making it so easy for us.'</p>

  <p>'Very well, my dear,' said Mr. Bellingham; 'we will enjoy thesweets of
  poverty, as you say&mdash;we have sampled the other kind of I thing pretty
  freely&mdash;and do ourselves the pleasure of accepting a | great kindness,
  most delicately offered.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' said Thorndyke. 'You have justified my faith in you, Miss
  Bellingham, and in the power of Dr. Berkeley's salt. I understand that you
  place your affairs in my hands?'</p>

  <p>'Entirely and thankfully,' replied Mr. Bellingham. 'Whatever you think
  best to be done we agree to beforehand.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' said I, 'let us drink success to the cause. Port, if you please,
  Miss Bellingham; the vintage is not recorded, but it is quite wholesome, and
  a suitable medium for the sodium chloride of friendship.' I filled her glass,
  and when the bottle had made its circuit, we stood up and solemnly pledged
  the new alliance.</p>

  <p>There is just one thing I would say before we dismiss the subject for the
  present,' said Thorndyke. 'It is a good thing to keep one's own counsel. When
  you get formal notice from Mr. Hurst's solicitors that proceedings are being
  commenced, you may refer them to Mr. Marchmont of Gray's Inn, who will
  nominally act for you. He will actually have nothing to do, but we must
  preserve the fiction that I am instructed by a solicitor. Meanwhile, and
  until the case goes into Court, I think it very necessary that neither Mr.
  Jellicoe nor anyone else should know that I am connected with it. We must
  keep the other side in the dark, if we can.'</p>

  <p>'We will be as secret as the grave,' said Mr. Bellingham; 'and, as a
  matter of fact, it will be quite easy, since it happens, by a curious
  coincidence, that I am already acquainted with Mr. Marchmont. He acted for
  Stephen Blackmore, you remember, in that case that you unravelled so
  wonderfully well. I knew the Blackmores.'</p>

  <p>'Did you?' said Thorndyke. 'What a small world it is. And what a
  remarkable affair that was! The intricacies and cross-issues made it quite
  absorbingly interesting; and it is noteworthy for me in another respect, for
  it was one of the first cases in which I was associated with Doctor
  Jervis.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, and a mighty useful associate I was,' remarked Jervis, 'though I did
  pick up one or two facts by accident. And, by the way, the Blackmore case had
  certain points in common with your case, Mr. Bellingham. There was a
  disappearance and a disputed will, and the man who vanished was a scholar and
  an antiquarian.'</p>

  <p>'Cases in our speciality are apt to have certain general resemblances,'
  Thorndyke said; and as he spoke he directed a keen glance at his junior, the
  significance of which I partly understood when he abruptly changed the
  subject.</p>

  <p>'The newspaper reports of your brother's disappearance, Mr. Bellingham,
  were remarkably full of detail. There were even plans of your house and that
  of Mr. Hurst. Do you know who supplied the information?'</p>

  <p>'No, I don't,' replied Mr. Bellingham. 'I know that I didn't. Some
  newspaper men came to me for information, but I sent them packing. So, I
  understand, did Hurst; and as for Jellicoe, you might as well cross-examine
  an oyster.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Thorndyke, 'the pressmen have queer methods of getting
  "copy"; but still, some one must have given them that description of your
  brother and those plans. It would be interesting to know who it was. However,
  we don't know; and now let us dismiss these legal topics, with suitable
  apologies for having introduced them.'</p>

  <p>'And perhaps,' said I, 'we may as well adjourn to what we call the
  drawing-room&mdash;it is really Barnard's den&mdash;and leave the housekeeper
  to wrestle with the debris.'</p>

  <p>We migrated to the cheerfully shabby little apartment, and, when Mrs.
  Gummer had served coffee, with gloomy resignation (as who should say: 'If you
  will drink this sort of stuff I suppose you must, but don't blame me for the
  consequences'), I settled Mr. Bellingham in Barnard's favourite lop-sided
  easy chair&mdash;the depressed seat of which suggested its customary use by
  an elephant of sedentary habits&mdash;and opened the diminutive piano.</p>

  <p>'I wonder if Miss Bellingham would give us a little music?' I said.</p>

  <p>'I wonder if she could?' was the smiling response. 'Do you know,' she
  continued, 'I have not touched a piano for nearly two years? It will be quite
  an interesting experiment&mdash;to me; but if it fails, you will be the
  sufferers. So you must choose.'</p>

  <p>'My verdict,' said Mr. Bellingham, 'is fiat experimentum, though I won't
  complete the quotation, as that would seem to disparage Doctor Barnard's
  piano. But before you begin, Ruth, there is one rather disagreeable matter
  that I want to dispose of, so that I may not disturb the harmony with it
  later.'</p>

  <p>He paused and we all looked at him expectantly.</p>

  <p>'I suppose, Doctor Thorndyke,' he said, 'you read the newspapers?'</p>

  <p>'I don't,' replied Dr. Thorndyke. 'But I ascertain, for purely business
  purposes, what they contain.'</p>

  <p>'Then,' said Mr. Bellingham, 'you have probably met with some accounts of
  the finding of certain human remains, apparently portions of a mutilated
  body.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I have seen those reports and filed them for future reference.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly. Well, now, it can hardly be necessary for me to tell you that
  those remains&mdash;the mutilated remains of some poor murdered creature, as
  there can be no doubt they are&mdash;have seemed to have a very dreadful
  significance for me. You will understand what I mean; and I want to ask you
  if&mdash;if they have made a similar suggestion to you?'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke paused before replying, with his eyes bent thoughtfully on the
  floor, and we all looked at him anxiously.</p>

  <p>'It's very natural,' he said at length, 'that you should associate these
  remains with the mystery of your brother's disappearance. I should like to
  say that you are wrong in doing so, but if I did I should be uncandid. There
  are certain facts that do, undoubtedly, seem to suggest a connection, and, up
  to the present, there are no definite facts of a contrary significance.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Bellingham sighed deeply and shifted uncomfortably in his chair.</p>

  <p>'It is a horrible affair!' he said huskily; 'horrible! Would you mind,
  Doctor Thorndyke, telling us just how the matter stands in your
  opinion&mdash;what the probabilities are, for and against?'</p>

  <p>Again Thorndyke reflected awhile, and it seemed to me that he was not very
  willing to discuss the subject. However, the question had been asked
  pointedly, and eventually he answered:</p>

  <p>'At the present stage of the investigation it is not very easy to state
  the balance of probabilities. The matter is still quite speculative. The
  bones which have been found hitherto (for we are dealing with a skeleton, not
  with a body) have been exclusively those which are useless for personal
  identification; which is, in itself, a rather curious and striking fact. The
  general character and dimension of the bones seem to suggest a middle-aged
  man of about your brother's height, and the date of deposition appears to be
  in agreement with the date of his disappearance.'</p>

  <p>'Is it known, then, when they were deposited?' asked Mr. Bellingham.</p>

  <p>'In the case of those found at Sidcup it seems possible to deduct an
  approximate date. The watercress-bed was cleaned out about two years ago, so
  they could not have been lying there longer than that; and their condition
  suggests that they could not have been there much less than two years, as
  there is apparently no vestige of the soft structures left. Of course, I am
  speaking from the newspaper reports only; I have no direct knowledge of the
  matter.'</p>

  <p>'Have they found any considerable part of the body yet? I haven't been
  reading the papers myself. My little friend, Miss Oman, brought a great
  bundle of 'em for me to read, but I couldn't stand it; I pitched the whole
  boiling of 'em out of the window.'</p>

  <p>I thought I detected a slight twinkle in Thorndyke's eye, but he answered
  quite gravely:</p>

  <p>'I think I can give you the particulars from memory, though I won't
  guarantee the dates. The original discovery was made, apparently quite
  accidentally, at Sidcup on the fifteenth of July. It consisted of a complete
  left arm, minus the third finger and including the bones of the
  shoulder&mdash;the shoulder-blade and collar bone. This discovery seems to
  have set the local population, especially the juvenile part of it, searching
  all the ponds and streams of the neighbourhood&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Cannibals!' interjected Mr. Bellingham.</p>

  <p>'With the result that there was dredged up out of a pond near St Mary
  Cray, in Kent, a right thigh-bone. There is a slight clue to identity in
  respect of this bone, since the head of it has a small patch of
  "eburnation"&mdash;that is a sort of porcelain-like polish that occurs on the
  parts of bones that form a joint when the natural covering of cartilage is
  destroyed by disease. It is produced by the unprotected surface of the bone
  grinding against the similarly unprotected surface of another.'</p>

  <p>'And how,' Mr. Bellingham asked, 'would that help the identification?'</p>

  <p>'It would indicate,' Thorndyke replied, 'that the deceased had probably
  suffered from rheumatoid arthritis&mdash;what is commonly I known as
  rheumatic gout&mdash;and he would probably have limped! slightly and
  complained of some pain in the right hip.'</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid that doesn't help us very much,' said Mr. Bellingham; 'for,
  you see, John had a pretty pronounced limp from another cause, an old injury
  to his left ankle; and as to complaining of pain&mdash;well, he was a hardy
  old fellow and not much given to making complaints of any kind. But don't let
  me interrupt you.'</p>

  <p>'The next discovery,' continued Thorndyke, 'was made near Lee, by the
  police this time. They seem to have developed sudden activity in the matter,
  and in searching the neighbourhood of West Kent they dragged out of a pond
  near Lee the bones of a right foot. Now, if it had been the left instead of
  the right we might have a clue, as I understand your brother had fractured
  his left ankle, and there might have been some traces of the injury on the
  foot itself.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Mr. Bellingham. 'I suppose there might. The injury was
  described as a Pott's fracture.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly. Well, now, after this discovery at Lee it seems that the police
  set on foot a systematic search of all the ponds and small pieces of water
  around London, and, on the twenty-third, they found in the Cuckoo Pits in
  Epping Forest, not far from Woodford, the bones of a right arm (including
  those of the shoulder, as before), which seem to be part of the same
  body.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Mr. Bellingham, 'I heard of that. Quite close to my old house.
  Horrible! horrible! It gave me the shudders to think of it&mdash;to think
  that poor old John may have been waylaid and murdered when he was actually
  coming to see me. He may even have got into the grounds by the back gate, if
  it was left unfastened, and been followed in there and murdered. You remember
  that a scarab from his watch-chain was found there? But is it clear that this
  arm was the fellow of the arm that was found at Sidcup?'</p>

  <p>'It seems to agree in character and dimensions,' said Thorndyke, 'and the
  agreement is strongly supported by a discovery made two days later.'</p>

  <p>'What is that?' Mr. Bellingham demanded.</p>

  <p>'It is the lower half of a trunk which the police dragged out of a rather
  deep pond on the skirts of the forest at Loughton&mdash;Staple's Pond, it is
  called. The bones found were the pelvis&mdash;that is, the two
  hip-bones&mdash;and six vertebrae, or joints of the backbone. Having
  discovered these, the police dammed the stream and pumped the pond dry, but
  no other bones were found; which is rather odd, as there should have been a
  pair of ribs belonging to the upper vertebra&mdash;the twelfth dorsal
  vertebra. It suggests some curious questions as to the method of
  dismemberment; but I mustn't go into unpleasant details. The point is that
  the cavity of the right hip-joint showed a patch of eburnation corresponding
  to that on the head of the right thigh-bone that was found at St Mary Cray.
  So there can be very little doubt that these bones are all part of the same
  body.'</p>

  <p>'I see,' grunted Mr. Bellingham; and he added, after a moment's thought:
  'Now, the question is, Are these bones the remains of my brother John? What
  do you say, Doctor Thorndyke?'</p>

  <p>'I say that the question cannot be answered on the facts at present known
  to us. It can only be said that they may be, and that some of the
  circumstances suggest that they are. But we can only wait for further
  discoveries. At any moment the police may light upon some portion of the
  skeleton which will settle the question definitely one way or the other.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose,' said Mr. Bellingham, 'I can't be of any service to you in the
  matter of identification?'</p>

  <p>'Indeed you can,' said Thorndyke, 'and I was going to ask you to assist
  me. What I want you to do is this: Write down a full description of your
  brother, including every detail known to you, together with an account of
  every illness or injury from which you know him to have suffered; also the
  names and, if possible, the addresses of any doctors, surgeons, or dentists
  who may have attended him at any time. The dentists are particularly
  important, as their information would be invaluable if the skull belonging to
  these bones should be discovered.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Bellingham shuddered.</p>

  <p>'It's a shocking idea,' he said, 'but, of course you are right. You must
  have the facts if you are to form an opinion. I will write out what you want
  and send it to you without delay. And now, for God's sake, let us throw off
  this nightmare, for a little while, at least! What is there, Ruth, among
  Doctor Barnard's music that you can manage?'</p>

  <p>Barnard's collection in general inclined to the severely classical, but we
  disinterred from the heap a few lighter works of an old-fashioned kind,
  including a volume of Mendelssohn's Lieder ohne Worte, and with one of these
  Miss Bellingham made trial of her skill, playing it with excellent taste and
  quite adequate execution. That, at least, was her father's verdict; for, as
  to me, I found it the perfection of happiness merely to sit and look at
  her&mdash;a state of mind that would have been in no wise disturbed even by
  'Silvery Waves' or 'The Maiden's Prayer'.</p>

  <p>Thus with simple, homely music, and conversation always cheerful and
  sometimes brilliant, slipped away one of the pleasantest evenings of my life,
  and slipped away all too soon. St Dunstan's clock was the fly in the
  ointment, for it boomed out intrusively the hour of eleven just as my guests
  were beginning to thoroughly appreciate one another, and thereby carried the
  sun (with a minor paternal satellite) out of the firmament of my heaven. For
  I had, in my professional capacity, given strict injunctions that Mr.
  Bellingham should on no account sit up late; and now, in my social capacity,
  I had smilingly to hear 'the doctor's orders' quoted. It was a scurvy return
  for all my care.</p>

  <p>When Mr. and Miss Bellingham departed, Thorndyke and Jervis would have
  gone too; but noting my bereaved condition, and being withal compassionate
  and tender of heart, they were persuaded to stay awhile and bear me company
  in a consolatory pipe.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XI. THE EVIDENCE REVIEWED</h3>

  <p>'SO THE game has opened,' observed Thorndyke, as he struck a match. 'The
  play has begun with a cautious lead off by the other side. Very cautious and
  not very confident.'</p>

  <p>'Why do you say "not very confident"?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Well, it is evident that Hurst&mdash;and, I fancy, Jellicoe too&mdash;is
  anxious to buy off Bellingham's opposition, and at a pretty long price, under
  the circumstances. And when we consider how very little Bellingham has to
  offer against the presumption of his brother's death, it looks as if Hurst
  hadn't much to say on his side.'</p>

  <p>'No,' said Jervis, 'he can't hold many trumps or he wouldn't be willing to
  pay four hundred a year for his opponent's chances; and that is just as well,
  for it seems to me that our own hand is a pretty poor one.'</p>

  <p>'We must look through our hand and see what we do hold,' said Thorndyke.
  'Our trump card at present&mdash;a rather small one, I'm afraid&mdash;is the
  obvious intention of the testator that the bulk of the property should go to
  his brother.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose you will begin your inquiries now?' I said.</p>

  <p>'We began them some time ago&mdash;the day after you brought us the will,
  in fact. Jervis had been through the registers and has ascertained that no
  interment under the name of John Bellingham has taken place since the
  disappearance; which was just what we expected. He has also discovered that
  some other person has been making similar inquiries; which, again, is what we
  expected.'</p>

  <p>'And your own investigations?'</p>

  <p>'Have given negative results for the most part. I found Doctor Norbury, at
  the British Museum, very friendly and helpful; so friendly, in fact, that I
  am thinking whether I may not be able to enlist his help in certain private
  researches of my own, with reference to the change effected by time in the
  physical properties of certain substances.'</p>

  <p>'Oh; you haven't told me about that,' said Jervis.</p>

  <p>'No; I haven't really commenced to plan my experiments yet, and they will
  probably lead to nothing when I do. It occurred to me that, possibly, in the
  course of time, certain molecular changes might take place in substances such
  as wood, bone, pottery, stucco, and other common materials, and that these
  changes might alter their power of conducting or transmitting molecular
  vibrations. Now, if this should turn out to be the case, it would be a fact
  of considerable importance, medico-legally and otherwise; for it would be
  possible to determine approximately the age of any object of known
  composition by testing its reactions to electricity, heat, light and other
  molecular vibrations. I thought of seeking Doctor Norbury's assistance
  because he can furnish me with materials for experiment of such great age
  that the reactions, if any, should be extremely easy to demonstrate. But to
  return to our case. I learned from him that John Bellingham had certain
  friends in Paris&mdash;collectors and museum officials&mdash;whom he was in
  the habit of visiting for the purpose of study and exchange of specimens. I
  have made inquiries of all these, and none of them had seen him during his
  last visit. In fact, I have not yet discovered anyone who had seen Bellingham
  in Paris on this occasion. So his visit there remains a mystery for the
  present.'</p>

  <p>'It doesn't seem to be of much importance, since he undoubtedly came
  back,' I remarked; but to this Thorndyke demurred.</p>

  <p>'It is impossible to estimate the importance of the unknown,' said he.</p>

  <p>'Well, how does the matter stand,' asked Jervis, 'on the evidence that we
  have? John Bellingham disappeared on a certain date. Is there anything to
  show what was the manner of his disappearance?'</p>

  <p>'The facts in our possession,' said Thorndyke, 'which are mainly those set
  forth in the newspaper report, suggest several alternative possibilities; and
  in view of the coming inquiry&mdash;for they will, no doubt, have to be gone
  into in Court, to some extent&mdash;it may be worth while to consider them.
  There are five conceivable hypotheses'&mdash;here Thorndyke checked them on
  his fingers as he proceeded&mdash;'First, he may still be alive. Second, he
  may have died and been buried without identification. Third, he may have been
  murdered by some unknown person. Fourth, he may have been murdered by Hurst
  and his body concealed. Fifth, he may have been murdered by his brother. Let
  us examine these possibilities seriatim.</p>

  <p>'First, he may still be alive. If he is, he must either have disappeared
  voluntarily, have lost his memory suddenly and not been identified, or have
  been imprisoned&mdash;on a false charge or otherwise. Let us take the first
  case&mdash;that of voluntary disappearance. Obviously, its improbability is
  extreme.'</p>

  <p>'Jellicoe doesn't think so,' said I. 'He thinks it quite on the cards that
  John Bellingham is alive. He says that it is not a very unusual thing for a
  man to disappear for a time.'</p>

  <p>'Then why is he applying for a presumption of death?'</p>

  <p>'Just what I asked him. He says that it is the correct thing to do; that
  the entire responsibility rests on the Court.'</p>

  <p>'That is all nonsense,' said Thorndyke. 'Jellicoe is the trustee for his
  absent client, and, if he thinks that client is alive, it is his duty to keep
  the estate intact; and he knows that perfectly well. We may take it that
  Jellicoe is of the same opinion as I am: that John Bellingham is dead.'</p>

  <p>'Still,' I urged, 'men do disappear from time to time, and turn up again
  after years of absence.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, but for a definite reason. Either they are irresponsible vagabonds
  who take this way of shuffling of their responsibilities, or they are men who
  have been caught in a net of distasteful circumstances. For instance, a civil
  servant or a solicitor or a tradesman finds himself bound for life to a
  locality and an occupation of intolerable monotony. Perhaps he has an
  ill-tempered wife, who after the amiable fashion of a certain type of woman,
  thinking that her husband is pinned down without a chance of escape, gives a
  free rein to her temper. The man puts up with it for years, but at last it
  becomes unbearable. Then he suddenly disappears; and small blame to him. But
  this was not Bellingham's case. He was a wealthy bachelor with an engrossing
  interest in life, free to go whither he would and to do whatsoever he wished.
  Why should he disappear? The thing is incredible.</p>

  <p>'As to his having lost his memory and remained unidentified, that, also,
  is incredible in the case of a man who had visiting-cards and letters in his
  pocket, whose linen was marked, and who was being inquired for everywhere by
  the police. As to his being in prison, we may dismiss that possibility,
  inasmuch as a prisoner, both before and after conviction, would have full
  opportunity of communicating with his friends.</p>

  <p>'The second possibility, that he may have died suddenly and been buried
  without identification, is highly improbable; but, as it is conceivable that
  the body might have been robbed and the means of identification thus lost, it
  remains as a possibility that has to be considered, remote as it is.</p>

  <p>'The third hypothesis, that he may have been murdered by some unknown
  person, is, under the circumstances, not wildly improbable; but, as the
  police were on the lookout and a detailed description of the missing man's
  person was published in the papers, it would involve the complete concealment
  of the body. But this would exclude the most probable form of crime&mdash;the
  casual robbery with violence. It is therefore possible, but highly
  improbable.</p>

  <p>'The fourth hypothesis is that Bellingham was murdered by Hurst. Now the
  one fact which militates against this view is that Hurst apparently had no
  motive for committing the murder. We are assured by Jellicoe that no one but
  himself knew the contents of the will, and if this is so&mdash;but mind, we
  have no evidence that it is so&mdash;Hurst would have no reason to suppose
  that he had anything material to gain by his cousin's death. Otherwise the
  hypothesis presents no inherent improbabilities. The man was last seen alive
  at Hurst's house. He was seen to enter it and he was never seen to leave
  it&mdash;we are still taking the facts as stated in the newspapers,
  remember&mdash;and it now appears that he stands to benefit enormously by
  that man's death.'</p>

  <p>'But,' I objected, 'you are forgetting that, directly the man was missed
  Hurst and the servants together searched the entire house.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. What did they search for?'</p>

  <p>'Why, for Mr. Bellingham, of course.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly; for Mr. Bellingham. That is, for a living man. Now how do you
  search a house for a living man? You look in all the rooms. When you look in
  a room if he is there, you see him; if you do not see him, you assume that he
  is not there. You don't look under the sofa or behind the piano, you don't
  pull out large drawers or open cupboards. You just look into the rooms. That
  is what these people seem to have done. And they did not see Mr. Bellingham.
  Mr. Bellingham's corpse might have been stowed away out of sight in any one
  of the rooms that they looked into.'</p>

  <p>'That is a grim thought,' said Jervis; 'but it is perfectly true. There is
  no evidence that the man was not lying dead in the house at the very time of
  the search.'</p>

  <p>'But even so,' said I, 'there was the body to be disposed of somehow. Now
  how could he possibly have got rid of the body without being observed?'</p>

  <p>'Ah!' said Thorndyke, 'now we are touching on a point of crucial
  importance. If anyone should ever write a treatise on the art of
  murder&mdash;not an exhibition of literary fireworks like De Quincey's, but a
  genuine working treatise&mdash;he might leave all other technical details to
  take care of themselves if he could describe to me some really practicable
  plan for disposing of the body. That is, and always has been, the great
  stumbling-block to the murderer: to get rid of the body. The human body,' he
  continued, thoughtfully regarding his pipe, just as, in the days of my
  pupilage, he was wont to regard the black-board chalk, 'is a very remarkable
  object. It presents a combination of properties that makes it singularly
  difficult to conceal permanently. It is bulky and of an awkward shape, it is
  heavy, it is completely incombustible, it is chemically unstable, and its
  decomposition yields great volumes of highly odorous gases, and it
  nevertheless contains identifiable structures of the highest degree of
  permanence. It is extremely difficult to preserve unchanged, and it is still
  more difficult completely to destroy. The essential permanence of the human
  body is well known in the classical case of Eugene Aram; but a still more
  striking instance is that of Sekenen-Ra the Third, one of the last kings of
  the seventeenth Egyptian dynasty. Here, after a lapse of four thousand years,
  it has been possible to determine not only the cause of death and the manner
  of its occurrence, but the way in which the king fell, the nature of the
  weapon with which the fatal wound was inflicted, and even the position of the
  assailant. And the permanence of the body under other conditions is admirably
  shown in the case of Doctor Parkman, of Boston, USA, in which identification
  was actually effected by means of remains collected from the ashes of a
  furnace.'</p>

  <p>'Then we may take it,' said Jervis, 'that the world has not yet seen the
  last of John Bellingham.'</p>

  <p>'I think we may regard that as almost a certainty,' replied Thorndyke.
  'The only question&mdash;and a very important one&mdash;is to when the
  reappearance may take place. It may be to-morrow or it may be centuries
  hence, when all the issues involved have been! forgotten.'</p>

  <p>'Assuming,' said I, 'for the sake of argument, that Hurst did murder him
  and that the body was concealed in the study at the time the search was made.
  How could it have been disposed of? If you had been in Hurst's place, how
  would you have gone to work?'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled at the bluntness of my question.</p>

  <p>'You are asking me for an incriminating statement,' said he, 'delivered in
  the presence of a witness too. But, as a matter of fact, there is no use in
  speculating a priori', we should have to reconstruct a purely imaginary
  situation, the circumstances of which are unknown to us, and we should almost
  certainly reconstruct it wrong. What we may fairly assume is that no
  reasonable person, no matter how immoral, would find himself in the position
  that you suggest. Murder is usually a crime of impulse, and the murderer a
  person of feeble self-control. Such persons are most unlikely to make
  elaborate and ingenious arrangements for the disposal of the bodies of their
  victims. Even the cold-blooded perpetrators of the most carefully planned
  murders appear as I have said, to break down at this point. The almost
  insuperable difficulty of getting rid of the human body is not appreciated
  until the murderer suddenly finds himself face to face with it.</p>

  <p>'In the case you are suggesting, the choice would seem to lie between
  burial on the premises or dismemberment and dispersal of the fragments; and
  either method would be pretty certain to lead to discovery.'</p>

  <p>'As illustrated by the remains of which you were speaking to Mr.
  Bellingham,' Jervis remarked.</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' Thorndyke answered, 'though we could hardly imagine a
  reasonably intelligent criminal adopting a watercress-bed as a hiding
  place.'</p>

  <p>'No. That was certainly an error of judgment. By the way, I thought it
  best to say nothing while you were talking to Bellingham, but I noticed that,
  in discussing the possibility of those being the bones of his brother, you
  made no comment on the absence of the third ringer of the left hand. I am
  sure you didn't overlook it, but isn't it a point of some importance?'</p>

  <p>'As to identification? Under the present circumstances, I think not! If
  there were a man missing who had lost that finger it would, of course, be an
  important fact. But I have not heard of any such man. Or, again, if there
  were any evidence that the finger had been removed before death, it would be
  highly important. But there is no such evidence. It may have been cut off
  after death, and that is where the real significance of its absence
  lies.'</p>

  <p>'I don't see quite what you mean,' said Jervis.</p>

  <p>'I mean that, if there is no report of any missing man who had lost that
  particular finger, the probability is that the finger was removed after
  death. And then arises the interesting question of motive. Why should it have
  been removed? It could hardly have become detached accidentally. What do you
  suggest?'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Jervis, 'it might have been a peculiar finger; a finger, for
  instance, with some characteristic deformity such as an ankylosed joint,
  which would be easy to identify.'</p>

  <p>'Yes; but that explanation introduces the same difficulty. No person with
  a deformed or ankylosed finger has been reported as missing.'</p>

  <p>Jervis puckered up his brows, and looked at me.</p>

  <p>'I'm hanged if I see any other explanation,' he said. 'Do you,
  Berkeley?'</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>'Don't forget which finger it is that is missing,' said Thorndyke. 'The
  third finger of the left hand.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I see!' said Jervis. 'The ring-finger. You mean that it may have been
  removed for the sake of a ring that wouldn't come off.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. It would not be the first instance of the kind. Fingers have been
  severed from dead hands&mdash;and even from living ones&mdash;for the sake of
  rings that were too tight to be drawn off. And the fact that it is the left
  hand supports the suggestion; for a ring that was inconveniently tight would
  be worn by preference on the left hand, as that is usually slightly smaller
  than the right. What is the matter, Berkeley?'</p>

  <p>A sudden light had burst upon me, and I suppose my countenance betrayed
  the fact.</p>

  <p>'I am a confounded fool!' I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>'Oh, don't say that,' said Jervis. 'Give your friends a chance.'</p>

  <p>'I ought to have seen this long ago and told you about it. John Bellingham
  did wear a ring, and it was so tight that, when once he had got it on, he
  could never get it off again.'</p>

  <p>'Do you happen to know on which hand he wore it?' Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes. It was on the left hand; because Miss Bellingham, who told me about
  it, said that he would never have been able to get the ring on at all but for
  the fact this his left hand was slightly smaller than his right.'</p>

  <p>'There it is, then,' said Thorndyke. 'With this new fact in our
  possession, the absence of the finger furnishes the starting-point of some
  very curious speculations.'</p>

  <p>'As, for instance,' said Jervis.</p>

  <p>'Ah, under the circumstances, I must leave you to pursue those
  speculations independently. I am now acting for Mr. Bellingham.'</p>

  <p>Jervis grinned and was silent for a while, refilling his pipe
  thoughtfully; but when he had got it alight he resumed.</p>

  <p>'To return to the question of the disappearance; you don't consider it
  highly improbable that Bellingham might have been murdered by Hurst?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, don't imagine I am making an accusation. I am considering the various
  probabilities merely in the abstract. The same reasoning applies to the
  Bellinghams. As to whether any of them did commit the murder, that is a
  question of personal character. I certainly do not suspect the Bellinghams
  after having seen them, and with regard to Hurst, I know nothing, or at least
  very little, to his disadvantage.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' Thorndyke said, with some hesitation, 'it seems a thought unkind
  to rake up the little details of a man's past, and yet it has to be done. I
  have, of course, made the usual routine inquiries concerning the parties to
  this affair, and this is what they have brought to light:</p>

  <p>'Hurst, as you know, is a stockbroker&mdash;a man of good position and
  reputation; but, about ten years ago, he seems to have committed an
  indiscretion, to put it mildly, which nearly got him into rather serious
  difficulties. He appears to have speculated rather heavily and considerably
  beyond his means, for when a sudden spasm of the markets upset his
  calculations, it turned out that he had been employing his clients' capital
  and securities. For a time it looked as if there was going to be serious
  trouble; then, quite unexpectedly, he managed to raise the necessary amount
  in some way and settle all claims. Whence he got the money has never been
  discovered to this day, which is a curious circumstance, seeing that the
  deficiency was rather over five thousand pounds; but the important fact is
  that he did get it and that he paid up all that he owed. So that he was only
  a potential defaulter, so to speak; and discreditable as the affair
  undoubtedly was, it does not seem to have any direct bearing on this present
  case.'</p>

  <p>'No,' Jervis agreed, 'though it makes one consider his position with more
  attention than one would otherwise.'</p>

  <p>'Undoubtedly,' said Thorndyke. 'A reckless gambler is a man whose conduct
  cannot be relied on. He is subject to vicissitudes of fortune which may force
  him into other kinds of wrong doing. Many an embezzlement has been preceded
  by an unlucky plunge on the turf.'</p>

  <p>'Assuming the responsibility for this disappearance to lie between Hurst
  and&mdash;and the Bellinghams,' said I, with an uncomfortable gulp as I
  mentioned the names of my friends, 'to which side does the balance of
  probability incline?'</p>

  <p>'To the side of Hurst, I should say, without doubt,' replied Thorndyke.
  'The case stands thus&mdash;on the facts presented to us: Hurst appears to
  have had no motive for killing the deceased (as we will call him); but the
  man was seen to enter the house, was never seen to leave it, and was never
  again seen alive. Bellingham, on the other hand, had a motive, as he had
  believed himself to be the principal beneficiary under the will. But the
  deceased was not seen at his house, and there is no evidence that he went to
  the house or to the neighbourhood, excepting the scarab that was found there.
  But the evidence of the scarab is vitiated by the fact that Hurst was present
  when it was picked up, and that it was found on a spot over which Hurst had
  passed only a few minutes previously. Until Hurst is cleared, it seems to me
  that the presence of the scarab proves nothing against the Bellinghams.'</p>

  <p>'Then your opinions on the case,' said I, 'are based entirely on the facts
  that have been made public.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, mainly. I do not necessarily accept those facts just as they are
  presented, and I may have certain views of my own on the case. But if I have,
  I do not feel in a position to discuss them. For the present, discussion has
  to be limited to the facts and inferences offered by the parties
  concerned.'</p>

  <p>'There!' exclaimed Jervis, rising to knock his pipe out, 'that is where
  Thorndyke has you. He lets you think you're in the thick of the "know" until
  one fine morning you wake up and discover that you have only been a gaping
  outsider; and then you are mightily astonished&mdash;and so are the other
  side, too, for that matter. But we must really be off now, mustn't we,
  reverend senior?'</p>

  <p>'I suppose we must,' replied Thorndyke; and, as he drew on his gloves, he
  asked: 'Have you heard from Barnard lately?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes,' I answered. 'I wrote to him at Smyrna to say that the practice
  was flourishing and that I was quite happy and contented, and that he might
  stay away as long as he liked. He writes by return that he will prolong his
  holiday if an opportunity offers, but will let me know later.'</p>

  <p>'Gad,' said Jervis, 'it was a stroke of luck for Barnard that Bellingham
  happened to have such a magnificent daughter&mdash;there! don't mind me, old
  man. You go in and win&mdash;she's worth it, isn't she, Thorndyke?'</p>

  <p>'Miss Bellingham's a very charming young lady,' replied Thorndyke. 'I am
  most favourably impressed by both the father and the daughter, and I only
  trust that we may be able to be of some service to them.' With this sedate
  little speech Thorndyke shook my hand, and I watched my two friends go on
  their way until their fading shapes were swallowed up in the darkness of
  Fetter Lane.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XII. A VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY</h3>

  <p>IT was two or three mornings after my little supper party that, as I stood
  in the consulting-room brushing my hat preparatory to starting on my morning
  round, Adolphus appeared at the door to announce two gentlemen waiting in the
  surgery. I told him to bring them in, and a moment later Thorndyke entered,
  accompanied by Jervis. I noted that they looked uncommonly large in that
  little apartment, especially Thorndyke, but I had no time to consider this
  phenomenon, for the latter, when he had shaken my hand, proceeded at once to
  explain the object of their visit.</p>

  <p>'We have come to ask a favour, Berkeley,' he said; 'to ask you to do us a
  very great service in the interests of your friends the Bellinghams.'</p>

  <p>'You know I shall be delighted,' I said warmly. 'What is it?'</p>

  <p>'I will explain. You know&mdash;or perhaps you don't&mdash;that the police
  have collected all the bones that have been discovered and deposited them in
  the mortuary at Woodford, where they are to be viewed by the coroner's jury.
  Now, it has become imperative that I should have more definite and reliable
  information than I can get from the newspapers. The natural thing for me
  would be to go down and examine them myself, but there are circumstances that
  make it very desirable that my connection with the case should not leak out.
  Consequently, I can't go myself, and, for the same reason, I can't send
  Jervis. On the other hand, as it is now stated pretty openly that the police
  consider the bones to be almost certainly those of John Bellingham, it would
  seem perfectly natural that you, as Godfrey Bellingham's doctor, should go
  down to view them on his behalf.'</p>

  <p>'I should like to,' I said. 'I would give anything to go; but how is it to
  be managed? It would mean a whole day off and leaving the practice to look
  after itself.'</p>

  <p>'I think it could be managed,' said Thorndyke; 'and the matter is really
  important for two reasons. One is that the inquest opens tomorrow, and
  someone certainly ought to be there to watch the proceedings on Godfrey's
  behalf; and the other is that our client has received notice from Hurst's
  solicitors that the application will be heard in the Probate Court in a few
  days.'</p>

  <p>'Isn't that rather sudden?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'It certainly suggests that there has been a good deal more activity than
  we were given to understand. But you see the importance of the affair. The
  inquest will be a sort of dress rehearsal for the Probate Court, and it is
  quite essential that we should have a chance of estimating the
  management.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I see that. But how are we to manage about the practice?'</p>

  <p>'We shall find you a substitute.'</p>

  <p>'Through a medical agent?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Jervis. 'Percival will find us a man; in fact, he has done it.
  I saw him this morning; he has a man who is waiting up in town to negotiate
  for the purchase of a practice and who would do the job for a couple of
  guineas. Quite a reliable man. Only say the word, and I will run off to Adam
  Street and engage him definitely.'</p>

  <p>'Very well. You engage the locum tenens, and I will be prepared to start
  for Woodford as soon as he turns up.'</p>

  <p>'Excellent!' said Thorndyke. 'That is a great weight off my mind. And if
  you could manage to drop in this evening and smoke a pipe with us we could
  talk over the plan of campaign and let you know what items of information we
  are particularly in want of.'</p>

  <p>I promised to turn up at King's Bench Walk as soon after half-past eight
  as possible, and my two friends then took their departure, leaving me to set
  out in high spirits on my scanty round of visits.</p>

  <p>It is surprising what different aspects things present from different
  points of view; how relative are our estimates of the conditions and
  circumstances of life. To the urban workman&mdash;the journeyman baker or
  tailor, for instance, labouring year in year out in a single building&mdash;a
  holiday ramble on Hampstead Heath is a veritable voyage of discovery; whereas
  to the sailor the shifting panorama of the whole wide world is but the
  commonplace of the day's work.</p>

  <p>So I reflected as I took my place in the train at Liverpool Street on the
  following day. There had been a time when a trip by rail to the borders of
  Epping Forest would have been far from a thrilling experience; now, after
  vegetating in the little world of Fetter Lane, it was quite an adventure.</p>

  <p>The enforced inactivity of a railway journey is favourable to thought, and
  I had much to think about. The last few weeks had witnessed momentous changes
  in my outlook. New interests had arisen, new friendships had grown up, and
  above all, there had stolen into my life that supreme influence that, for
  good or for evil, according to my fortune, was to colour and pervade it even
  to its close. Those few days of companionable labour in the reading-room,
  with the homely hospitalities of the milk-shop and the pleasant walks
  homeward through the friendly London streets, had called into existence a new
  world&mdash;a world in which the gracious personality of Ruth Bellingham was
  the one dominating reality. And thus, as I leaned back in the corner of the
  railway carriage with an unlighted pipe in my hand, the events of the
  immediate past, together with those more problematical ones of the impending
  future, occupied me rather to the exclusion of the business of the moment,
  which was to review the remains collected in the Woodford mortuary, until, as
  the train approached Stratford, the odours of the soap and bone-manure
  factories poured in at the open window and (by a natural association of
  ideas) brought me back to the object of my quest.</p>

  <p>As to the exact purpose of this expedition, I was not very clear; but I
  knew that I was acting as Thorndyke's proxy and thrilled with pride at the
  thought. But what particular light my investigations were to throw upon the
  intricate Bellingham case I had no very definite idea. With a view to fixing
  the procedure in my mind, I took Thorndyke's written instructions from my
  pocket and read them over carefully. They were very full and explicit, making
  ample allowance for my lack of experience in medico-legal matters:</p>

  <p>'1. Do not appear to make minute investigations or in any way excite
  remark.</p>

  <p>'2. Ascertain if all the bones belonging to each region are present, and
  if not, which are missing.</p>

  <p>'3. Measure the extreme length of the principal bones and compare those of
  opposite sides.</p>

  <p>'4. Examine the bones with reference to age, sex, and muscular development
  of the deceased.</p>

  <p>'5. Note the presence or absence of signs of constitutional disease, local
  disease of bone or adjacent structures, old or recent injuries, and any other
  departures from the normal or usual.</p>

  <p>'6. Observe the presence or absence of adipocere and its position, if
  present.</p>

  <p>'7. Note any remains of tendons, ligaments, or other soft structures.</p>

  <p>'8. Examine the Sidcup hand with reference to the question as to whether
  the finger was separated before or after death.</p>

  <p>'9. Estimate the probable period of submersion and note any changes (as
  e.g., mineral or organic staining) due to the character of the water or
  mud.</p>

  <p>'10. Ascertain the circumstances (immediate and remote) that led to the
  discovery of the bones and the names of the persons concerned in those
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>'11. Commit all information to writing as soon as possible, and make plans
  and diagrams on the spot, if circumstances permit.</p>

  <p>'12. Preserve an impassive exterior: listen attentively but without
  eagerness; ask as few questions as possible; pursue any inquiry that your
  observations on the spot may suggest.'</p>

  <p>These were my instructions, and, considering that I was going merely to
  inspect a few dry bones, they appeared rather formidable; in fact, the more I
  read them over the greater became my misgivings as to my qualifications for
  the task.</p>

  <p>As I approached the mortuary it became evident that some, at least, of
  Thorndyke's admonitions were by no means unnecessary. The place was in charge
  of a police sergeant, who watched my approach suspiciously; and some
  half-dozen men, obviously newspaper reporters, hovered about the entrance
  like a pack of jackals. I presented the coroner's order which Mr. Marchmont
  had obtained, and which the sergeant read with his back against the wall, to
  prevent the newspaper men from looking over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>My credentials being found satisfactory, the door was unlocked and I
  entered, accompanied by three enterprising reporters, whom, however, the
  sergeant summarily ejected and locked out, returning to usher me into the
  presence and to observe my proceedings with intelligent but highly
  embarrassing interest.</p>

  <p>The bones were laid out on a large table and covered with a sheet, which
  the sergeant slowly turned back, watching my face intently as he did so to
  note the impression that the spectacle made upon me. I imagine that he must
  have been somewhat disappointed by my impassive demeanour, for the remains
  suggested to me nothing more than a rather shabby set of 'student's
  osteology.' The whole collection had been set out by the police surgeon (as
  the sergeant informed me) in their proper anatomical order; notwithstanding
  which I counted them over carefully to make sure that none were missing,
  checking them by the list with which Thorndyke had furnished me.</p>

  <p>'I see you have found the left thigh-bone,' I remarked, observing that
  this did not appear in the list.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said the sergeant; 'that turned up yesterday evening in a big pond
  called Baldwin's Pond in the Sandpit plain, near Little Monk Wood.'</p>

  <p>'Is that near here?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'In the forest up Loughton way,' was the reply.</p>

  <p>I made a note of the fact (on which the sergeant looked as if he was sorry
  he had mentioned it), and then turned my attention to a general consideration
  of the bones before examining them in detail. Their appearance would have
  been improved and examination facilitated by a thorough scrubbing, for they
  were just as they had been taken from their respective resting-places, and it
  was difficult to decide whether their reddish-yellow colour was an actual
  stain or due to a deposit on the surface. In any case, as it affected them
  all alike, I thought it an interesting feature and made a note of it. They
  bore numerous traces of their sojourn in the various ponds from which they
  had been recovered, but these gave me little help in determining the length
  of time during which they had been submerged. They were, of course, encrusted
  with mud, and little wisps of pond-weed stuck to them in places; but these
  facts furnished only the vaguest measure of time.</p>

  <p>Some of the traces were, indeed, more informing. To several of the bones,
  for instance, there adhered the dried egg-clusters of the common pond-snail,
  and in one of the hollows of the right shoulder-blade (the 'infra-spinous
  fossa') was a group of the mud-built tubes of the red river-worm. These
  remains gave proof of a considerable period of submersion, and since they
  could not have been deposited on the bones until all the flesh had
  disappeared they furnished evidence that some time&mdash;a month or two, at
  any rate&mdash;had elapsed since this had happened. Incidentally, too, their
  distribution showed the position in which the bones had lain, and though this
  appeared to be of no importance in the existing circumstances, I made careful
  notes of the situation of each adherent body, illustrating their position by
  rough sketches.</p>

  <p>The sergeant watched my proceedings with an indulgent smile.</p>

  <p>'You're making a regular inventory, sir,' he remarked, 'as if you were
  going to put 'em up for auction. I shouldn't think those snails' eggs would
  be much help in identification. And all that has been done already,' he added
  as I produced my measuring-tape.</p>

  <p>'No doubt,' I replied; 'but my business is to make independent
  observations, to check the others, if necessary.' And I proceeded to measure
  each of the principal bones separately and to compare those of the opposite
  sides. The agreement in dimensions and general characteristics of the pairs
  of bones left little doubt that all were parts of one skeleton, a conclusion
  that was confirmed by the eburnated patch on the head of the right thigh-bone
  and the corresponding patch in the socket of the right hip-bone. When I had
  finished my measurements I went over the entire series of bones in detail,
  examining each with the closest attention for any of those signs which
  Thorndyke had indicated, and eliciting nothing but a monotonously reiterated
  negative. They were distressingly and disappointingly normal.</p>

  <p>'Well, sir, what do you make of 'em?' the sergeant asked cheerfully as I
  shut up my notebook and straightened my back. 'Whose bones are they? Are they
  Mr. Bellingham's, think ye?'</p>

  <p>'I should be very sorry to say whose bones they are,' I replied. 'One bone
  is very much like another, you know.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose it is,' he agreed; 'but I thought that, with all that measuring
  and all those notes, you might have arrived at something definite.' Evidently
  he was disappointed in me; and I was somewhat disappointed in myself when I
  contrasted Thorndyke's elaborate instructions with the meagre result of my
  investigations. For what did my discoveries amount to? And how much was the
  inquiry advanced by the few entries in my notebook?</p>

  <p>The bones were apparently those of a man of fair though not remarkable
  muscular development; over thirty years of age, but how much older I was
  unable to say. His height I judged roughly to be five feet eight inches, but
  my measurements would furnish data for a more exact estimate by Thorndyke.
  Beyond this the bones were quite uncharacteristic. There were no signs of
  diseases either local or general, no indications of injuries either old or
  recent, no departures of any kind from the normal or usual; and the
  dismemberment had been effected with such care that there was not a single
  scratch on any of the separated surfaces. Of adipocere (the peculiar waxy or
  soapy substance that is commonly found in bodies that have slowly decayed in
  damp situations) there was not a trace; and the only remnant of the soft
  structures was a faint indication, like a spot of dried glue, of the tendon
  on the tip of the right elbow.</p>

  <p>The sergeant was in the act of replacing the sheet, with the air of a
  showman who has just given an exhibition, when there came a sharp rapping on
  the mortuary door. The officer finished spreading the sheet with official
  precision, and having ushered me out into the lobby, turned the key and
  admitted three persons, holding the door open after they had entered for me
  to go out. But the appearance of the new-comers inclined me to linger. One of
  them was a local constable, evidently in official charge; a second was a
  labouring man, very wet and muddy, who carried a small sack; while in the
  third I thought I scented a professional brother.</p>

  <p>The sergeant continued to hold the door open.</p>

  <p>'Nothing more I can do for you, sir?' he asked genially.</p>

  <p>'Is that the divisional surgeon?' I inquired.</p>

  <p>'Yes. I am the divisional surgeon,' the new-comer answered. 'Did you want
  anything of me?'</p>

  <p>'This,' said the sergeant, 'is a medical gentleman who has got permission
  from the coroner to inspect the remains. He is acting for the family of the
  deceased&mdash;I mean, for the family of Mr. Bellingham,' he added in answer
  to an inquiring glance from the surgeon.</p>

  <p>'I see,' said the latter. 'Well, they have found the rest of the trunk,
  including, I understand, the ribs that were missing from the other part.
  Isn't that so, Davis?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, sir,' replied the constable. 'Inspector Badger says all the ribs is
  here, and all the bones of the neck as well.'</p>

  <p>'The inspector seems to be an anatomist,' I remarked.</p>

  <p>The sergeant grinned. 'He is a very knowing gentleman, is Mr. Badger. He
  came down here this morning quite early and spent a long time looking over
  the bones and checking them by some notes in his pocket-book. I fancy he's
  got something on, but he was precious close about it.'</p>

  <p>Here the sergeant shut up rather suddenly&mdash;perhaps contrasting his
  own conduct with that of his superior.</p>

  <p>'Let us have these new bones out on the table,' said the police surgeon.
  'Take the sheet off, and don't shoot them out as if they were coals. Hand
  them out carefully.'</p>

  <p>The labourer fished out the wet and muddy bones one by one from the sack,
  and as he laid them on the table the surgeon arranged them in their proper
  relative positions.</p>

  <p>'This has been a neatly executed job,' he remarked; 'none of your clumsy
  hacking with a chopper or a saw. The bones have been cleanly separated at the
  joints. The fellow who did this must have had some anatomical knowledge,
  unless he was a butcher, which, by the way, is not impossible. He has used
  his knife uncommonly skilfully, and you notice that each arm was taken off
  with the scapula attached, just as a butcher takes off a shoulder of mutton.
  Are there any more bones in that bag?'</p>

  <p>'No, sir,' replied the labourer, wiping his hands with an air of finality
  on the posterior aspect of his trousers; 'that's the lot.'</p>

  <p>The surgeon looked thoughtfully at the bones as he gave a final touch to
  their arrangement, and remarked:</p>

  <p>'The inspector is right. All the bones of the neck are there. Very odd.
  Don't you think so?'</p>

  <p>'You mean&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'I mean that this very eccentric murderer seems to have given himself such
  an extraordinary amount of trouble for no reason that one can see. There are
  these neck vertebrae, for instance. He must have carefully separated the
  skull from the atlas instead of just cutting through the neck. Then there is
  the way he divided the trunk; the twelfth ribs have just come in with this
  lot, but the twelfth dorsal vertebra to which they belong was attached to the
  lower half. Imagine the trouble he must have taken to do that, and without
  cutting or hacking the bones about, either. It is extraordinary. This is
  rather interesting, by the way. Handle it carefully.'</p>

  <p>He picked up the breast-bone daintily&mdash;for it was covered with wet
  mud&mdash;and handed it to me with the remark:</p>

  <p>'That is the most definite piece of evidence we have.'</p>

  <p>'You mean,' I said, 'that the union of the two parts into a single mass
  fixes this as the skeleton of an elderly man?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, that is the obvious suggestion, which is confirmed by the deposit of
  bone in the rib-cartilages. You can tell the inspector, Davis, that I have
  checked this lot of bones and that they are all here.'</p>

  <p>'Would you mind writing it down, sir?' said the constable. 'Inspector
  Badger said I was to have everything in writing.'</p>

  <p>The surgeon took out his pocket-book, and, while he was selecting a
  suitable piece of paper, he asked: 'Did you form any opinion as to the height
  of the deceased?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I thought he would be about five feet eight' (here I caught the
  sergeant's eyes, fixed on me with a knowing leer).</p>

  <p>'I made it five eight and a half,' said the police surgeon; 'but we shall
  know better when we have seen the lower leg-bones. Where was this lot found,
  Davis?'</p>

  <p>'In the pond just off the road in Lord's Bushes, sir, and the inspector
  has gone off now to&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Never mind where he's gone,' interrupted the sergeant. 'You just answer
  questions and attend to your business.'</p>

  <p>The sergeant's reproof conveyed a hint to me on which I was not slow to
  act. Friendly as my professional colleague was, it was clear that the police
  were disposed to treat me as an interloper who was to be kept out of the
  'know' as far as possible. Accordingly I thanked my colleague and the
  sergeant for their courtesy, and bidding them adieu until we should meet at
  the inquest, took my departure and walked away quickly until I found an
  inconspicuous position from which I could keep the door of the mortuary in
  view. A few moments later I saw Constable Davis emerge and stride away up the
  road.</p>

  <p>I watched his rapidly diminishing figure until he had gone as far as I
  considered desirable, and then I set forth in his wake. The road led straight
  away from the village, and in less than half a mile entered the outskirts of
  the forest. Here I quickened my pace to close up somewhat, and it was well
  that I did so, for suddenly he diverged from the road into a green lane,
  where for a while I lost sight of him. Still hurrying forward, I again caught
  sight of him just as he turned off into a narrow path that entered a beech
  wood with a thickish undergrowth of holly, along which I followed him for
  several minutes, gradually decreasing the distance between us, until suddenly
  there fell on my ear a rhythmical sound like the clank of a pump. Soon after
  I caught the sound of men's voices, and then the constable struck off the
  path into the wood.</p>

  <p>I now advanced more cautiously, endeavouring to locate the search party by
  the sound of the pump, and when I had done this I made a little detour so
  that I might approach from the opposite direction to that from which the
  constable had appeared.</p>

  <p>Still guided by the noise of the pump, I at length came out into a small
  opening among the trees and halted to survey the scene. The centre of the
  opening was occupied by a small pond, not more than a dozen yards across, by
  the side of which stood a builder's handcart. The little two-wheeled vehicle
  had evidently been used to convey the appliances which were deposited on the
  ground near it, and which consisted of a large tub&mdash;now filled with
  water&mdash;a shovel, a rake, a sieve, and a portable pump, the latter being
  fitted with a long delivery hose. There were three men besides the constable,
  one of whom was working the handle of the pump, while another was glancing at
  a paper that the constable had just delivered to him. He looked up sharply as
  I appeared, and viewed me with unconcealed disfavour.</p>

  <p>'Hallo, sir!' said he. 'You can't come here.'</p>

  <p>Now, seeing that I was actually here, this was clearly a mistake, and I
  ventured to point out the fallacy.</p>

  <p>'Well, I can't allow you to stay here. Our business is of a private
  nature.'</p>

  <p>'I know exactly what your business is, Inspector Badger.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, do you?' said he, surveying me with a foxy smile. 'And I expect I
  know what yours is, too. But we can't have any of you newspaper gentry spying
  on us just at present, so you just be off.'</p>

  <p>I thought it best to undeceive him at once, and accordingly, having
  explained who I was, I showed him the coroner's permit, which he read with
  manifest annoyance.</p>

  <p>'This is all very well, sir,' said he as he handed me back the paper, 'but
  it doesn't authorise you to come spying on the proceedings of the police. Any
  remains that we discover will be deposited in the mortuary, where you can
  inspect them to your heart's content; but you can't stay here and watch
  us.'</p>

  <p>I had no defined object in keeping a watch on the inspector's proceedings;
  but the sergeant's indiscreet hint had aroused my curiosity, which was
  further excited by Mr. Badger's evident desire to get rid of me. Moreover,
  while we had been talking, the pump had stopped (the muddy floor of the pond
  being now pretty fully exposed), and the inspector's assistant was handling
  the shovel impatiently.</p>

  <p>'Now I put it to you, Inspector,' said I, persuasively, 'is it politic of
  you to allow it to be said that you refused an authorised representative of
  the family facilities for verifying any statements that you may make
  hereafter?'</p>

  <p>'What do you mean?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'I mean that if you should happen to find some bone which could be
  identified as part of the body of Mr. Bellingham, that fact would be of more
  importance to his family than to anyone else. You know that there is a very
  valuable estate and a rather difficult will.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't know it, and I don't see the bearing of it now' (neither did I
  for that matter); 'but if you make such a point of being present at the
  search, I can't very well refuse. Only you mustn't get in our way, that's
  all.'</p>

  <p>On hearing this conclusion, his assistant, who looked like a plain-clothes
  officer, took up his shovel and stepped into the mud that formed the bottom
  of the pond, stooping as he went and peering among the masses of weed that
  had been left stranded by the withdrawal of the water. The inspector watched
  him anxiously, cautioning him from time to time to 'look out where he was
  treading'; the labourer left the pump and craned forward from the margin of
  the mud, and the constable and I looked on from our respective points of
  vantage. For some time the search was fruitless. Once the searcher stooped
  and picked up what turned out to be a fragment of decayed wood; then the
  remains of a long-deceased jay were discovered, examined, and rejected.
  Suddenly the man bent down by the side of a small pool that had been left in
  one of the deeper hollows, stared intently into the mud, and stood up.</p>

  <p>'There's something here that looks like a bone, sir,' he sang out.</p>

  <p>'Don't grub about then,' said the inspector. 'Drive your shovel right into
  the mud where you saw it and bring it to the sieve.'</p>

  <p>The man followed out these instructions, and as he came shore-wards with a
  great pile of the slimy mud on his shovel we all converged on the sieve,
  which the inspector took up and held over the tub, directing the constable
  and labourer to 'lend a hand,' meaning thereby that they were to crowd round
  the tub and exclude me as completely as possible. This, in fact, they did
  very effectively with his assistance, for, when the shovelful of mud had been
  deposited on the sieve, the four men leaned over it and so nearly hid it from
  view that it was only by craning over, first on one side and then on the
  other, that I was able to catch an occasional glimpse of it and to observe it
  gradually melting away as the sieve, immersed in the water, was shaken to and
  fro.</p>

  <p>Presently the inspector raised the sieve from the water and stooped over
  it more closely to examine its contents. Apparently the examination yielded
  no very conclusive results, for it was accompanied by a series of rather
  dubious grunts.</p>

  <p>At length the officer stood up, and turning to me with a genial but foxy
  smile, held out the sieve for my inspection.</p>

  <p>'Like to see what we have found, Doctor?' said he.</p>

  <p>I thanked him and stood over the sieve. It contained the sort of litter of
  twigs, skeleton leaves, weed, pond-snails, dead shells, and fresh-water
  mussels that one would expect to strain out from the mud of an ancient pond;
  but in addition to these there were three small bones which at first glance
  gave me quite a start until I saw what they were.</p>

  <p>The inspector looked at me inquiringly. 'H'm?' said he.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I replied. 'Very interesting.'</p>

  <p>'Those will be human bones, I fancy; h'm?'</p>

  <p>'I should say so, undoubtedly,' I answered.</p>

  <p>'Now,' said the inspector, 'could you say, off-hand, which finger those
  bones belong to?'</p>

  <p>I smothered a grin (for I had been expecting this question), and
  answered:</p>

  <p>'I can say off-hand that they don't belong to any finger. They are the
  bones of the left great toe.'</p>

  <p>The inspector's jaw dropped.</p>

  <p>'The deuce they are!' he muttered. 'H'm. I thought they looked a bit
  stout.'</p>

  <p>'I expect,' said I, 'that if you go through the mud close to where this
  came from you'll find the rest of the foot.'</p>

  <p>The plain-clothes man proceeded at once to act on my suggestion, taking
  the sieve with him to save time. And sure enough, after filling it twice with
  the mud from the bottom of the pool, the entire skeleton of the foot was
  brought to light.</p>

  <p>'Now you're happy, I suppose,' said the inspector when I had checked the
  bones and found them all present.</p>

  <p>'I should be more happy,' I replied, 'if I knew what you were searching
  for in this pond. You weren't looking for the foot, were you?'</p>

  <p>'I was looking for anything that I might find,' he answered. 'I shall go
  on searching until we have the whole body. I shall go through all the streams
  and ponds around here, excepting Con-naught Water. That I shall leave to the
  last, as it will be a case of dredging from a boat and isn't so likely as the
  smaller ponds. Perhaps the head will be there; it's deeper than any of the
  others.'</p>

  <p>It now occurred to me that as I had learned all that I was likely to
  learn, which was little enough, I might as well leave the inspector to pursue
  his searches unembarrassed by my presence. Accordingly I thanked him for his
  assistance and departed by the way I had come.</p>

  <p>But as I retraced my steps along the shady path I speculated profoundly on
  the officer's proceedings. My examinations of the mutilated hand had yielded
  the conclusion that the finger had been removed after death or shortly
  before, but more probably after. Some one else had evidently arrived at the
  same conclusion, and had communicated his opinion to Inspector Badger; for it
  was clear that that gentleman was in full cry after the missing finger. But
  why was he searching for it here when the hand had been found at Sidcup? And
  what did he expect to learn from it when he found it? There is nothing
  particularly characteristic about a finger, or, at least, the bones of one;
  and the object of the present researches was to determine the identity of the
  person of whom these bones were the remains. There was something mysterious
  about the affair, something suggesting that Inspector Badger was in
  possession of private information of some kind. But what information could he
  have? And whence could he have obtained it? These were questions to which I
  could find no answer, and I was still fruitlessly revolving them when I
  arrived at the modest inn where the inquest was to be held, and I proposed to
  fortify myself with a correspondingly modest lunch as a preparation for my
  attendance at the inquiry.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XIII. THE CORONER'S QUEST</h3>

  <p>THE proceedings of that fine old institution, the coroner's court, are apt
  to have their dignity impaired by the somewhat unjudicial surroundings amidst
  which they are conducted. The present inquiry was to be held in a long room
  attached to the inn, ordinarily devoted, as its various appurtenances
  testified, to gatherings of a more convivial character.</p>

  <p>Hither I betook myself after a protracted lunch and a meditative pipe, and
  being the first to arrive&mdash;the jury having already been sworn and
  conducted to the mortuary to view the remains&mdash;whiled away the time by
  considering the habits of the customary occupants of the room by the light of
  the objects contained in it. A wooden target with one or two darts sticking
  in it hung on the end wall and invited the Robin Hoods of the village to try
  their skill; a system of incised marks on the oaken table made sinister
  suggestions of shove-halfpenny; and a large open box filled with white wigs,
  gaudily coloured robes and wooden spears, swords and regalia, crudely coated
  with gilded paper, obviously appertained to the puerile ceremonials of the
  Order of Druids.</p>

  <p>I had exhausted the interest of these relics and had transferred my
  attentions to the picture gallery when the other spectators and the witnesses
  began to arrive. Hastily I seated myself in the only comfortable chair
  besides the one placed at the head of the table, presumably for the coroner;
  and I had hardly done so when the latter entered accompanied by the jury.
  Immediately after them came the sergeant, Inspector Badger, one or two
  plain-clothes men, and finally the divisional surgeon.</p>

  <p>The coroner took his seat at the head of the table and opened his book,
  and the jury seated themselves on a couple of benches on one side of the long
  table.</p>

  <p>I looked with some interest at the twelve 'good men and true.' They were a
  representative group of British tradesmen, quiet, attentive, and rather
  solemn; but my attention was particularly attracted by a small man with a
  very large head and a shock of upstanding hair whom I had diagnosed, after a
  glance at his intelligent but truculent countenance and the shiny knees of
  his trousers, as the village cobbler. He sat between the broad-shouldered
  foreman, who looked like a blacksmith, and a dogged, red-faced man whose
  general aspect of prosperous greasiness suggested the calling of a
  butcher.</p>

  <p>'The inquiry, gentlemen,' the coroner commenced, 'upon which we are now
  entering concerns itself with two questions. The first is that of identity:
  who was this person whose body we have just viewed? The second is: How, when,
  and by what means did he come by his death? We will take the identity first
  and begin with the circumstances under which the body was discovered.'</p>

  <p>Here the cobbler stood up and raised an excessively dirty hand.</p>

  <p>'I rise, Mr. Chairman,' said he, 'to a point of order.' The other jurymen
  looked at him curiously and some of them, I regret to say, grinned. 'You have
  referred, sir,' he continued, 'to the body which we have just viewed. I wish
  to point out that we have not viewed a body; we have viewed a collection of
  bones.'</p>

  <p>'We will refer to them as the remains, if you prefer it,' said the
  coroner.</p>

  <p>'I do prefer it,' was the reply, and the objector sat down.</p>

  <p>'Very well,' rejoined the coroner, and he proceeded to call the witnesses,
  of whom the first was a labourer who had discovered the bones in the
  watercress-bed.</p>

  <p>'Do you happen to know how long it was since the watercress-beds had been
  cleaned out previously?' the coroner asked, when the witness had told the
  story of the discovery.</p>

  <p>'They was cleaned out by Mr. Tapper's orders just before he gave them up.
  That will be a little better than two years ago. In May it were. I helped to
  clean 'em. I worked on this very same place and there wasn't no bones there
  then.'</p>

  <p>The coroner glanced at the jury. 'Any questions, gentlemen,' he asked.</p>

  <p>The cobbler directed an intimidating scowl at the witness and
  demanded:</p>

  <p>'Were you searching for bones when you came on these remains?'</p>

  <p>'Me!' exclaimed the witness. 'What should I be searching for bones
  for?'</p>

  <p>'Don't prevaricate,' said the cobbler sternly; 'answer the question: Yes
  or no.'</p>

  <p>'No, of course I wasn't.'</p>

  <p>The juryman shook his enormous head dubiously as though implying that he
  would let it pass this time but it mustn't happen again; and the examination
  of the witnesses continued, without eliciting anything that was new to me or
  giving rise to any incident, until the sergeant had described the finding of
  the right arm in the Cuckoo Pits.</p>

  <p>'Was this an accidental discovery?' the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>'No. We had instructions from Scotland Yard to search any likely ponds in
  this neighbourhood.'</p>

  <p>The coroner discreetly forbore to press this matter any further, but my
  friend the cobbler was evidently on the qui-vive, and I anticipated a brisk
  cross-examination for Mr. Badger when his turn came. The inspector was
  apparently of the same opinion, for I saw him cast a glance of the deepest
  malevolence at the too inquiring disciple of St Crispin. In fact, his turn
  came next, and the cobbler's hair stood up with unholy joy.</p>

  <p>The finding of the lower half of the trunk in Staple's Pond at Loughton
  was the inspector's own achievement, but he was not boastful about it. The
  discovery, he remarked, followed naturally on the previous one in the Cuckoo
  Pits.</p>

  <p>'Had you any private information that led you to search this particular
  neighbourhood?' the cobbler asked.</p>

  <p>'We had no private information whatever,' replied Badger.</p>

  <p>'Now I put it to you,' pursued the juryman, shaking a forensic, and very
  dirty, forefinger at the inspector; 'here are certain remains found at
  Sidcup; here are certain other remains found at St Mary Cray, and certain
  others at Lee. All those places are in Kent. Now isn't it very remarkable
  that you should come straight down to Epping Forest, which is in Essex, and
  search for those bones and find 'em?'</p>

  <p>'We were making a systematic search of all likely places,' replied
  Badger.</p>

  <p>'Exactly,' said the cobbler, with a ferocious grin, 'that's just my point.
  I say, isn't it very funny that, after finding the remains in Kent some
  twenty miles from here, with the River Thames between, you should come here
  to look for the bones and go straight to Staple's Pond, where they happen to
  be&mdash;and find 'em?'</p>

  <p>'It would have been more funny,' Badger replied sourly, 'if we'd gone
  straight to a place where they happened not to be&mdash;and found them.'</p>

  <p>A gratified snigger arose from the other eleven good men and true, and the
  cobbler grinned savagely; but before he could think of a suitable rejoinder
  the coroner interposed.</p>

  <p>'The question is not very material,' he said, 'and we mustn't embarrass
  the police by unnecessary inquiries.'</p>

  <p>'It's my belief,' said the cobbler, 'that he knew they were there all the
  time.'</p>

  <p>'The witness has stated that he had no private information,' said the
  coroner; and he proceeded to take the rest of the inspector's evidence,
  watched closely by the critical juror.</p>

  <p>The account of the finding of the remains having been given in full, the
  police surgeon was called and sworn; the jurymen straightened their backs
  with an air of expectancy, and I turned over a page of my notebook.</p>

  <p>'You have examined the bones at present lying in the mortuary and forming
  the subject of this inquiry?' the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>'I have.'</p>

  <p>'Will you kindly tell us what you have observed?'</p>

  <p>'I find that the bones are human bones, and are, in my opinion, all parts
  of the same person. They form a skeleton which is complete with the exception
  of the skull, the third finger of the left hand, the knee-caps, and the
  leg-bones&mdash;I mean the bones between the knees and the ankles.'</p>

  <p>'Is there anything to account for the absence of the missing finger?'</p>

  <p>'No. There is no deformity and no sign of its having been amputated during
  life. In my opinion it was removed after death.'</p>

  <p>'Can you give us any description of the deceased?'</p>

  <p>'I should say that these are the bones of an elderly man, probably over
  sixty years of age, about five feet eight and a half inches in height, of
  rather stout build, fairly muscular, and well preserved. There are no signs
  of disease excepting some old-standing rheumatic gout of the right
  hip-joint.'</p>

  <p>'Can you form any opinion as to the cause of death?'</p>

  <p>'No. There are no marks of violence or signs of injury. But it will be
  impossible to form any opinion as to the cause of death until we have seen
  the skull.'</p>

  <p>'Did you note anything else of importance?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I was struck by the appearance of anatomical knowledge and skill on
  the part of the person who dismembered the body. The knowledge of anatomy is
  proved by the fact that the corpse has been divided into definite anatomical
  regions. For instance, the bones of the neck are complete and include the top
  joint of the backbone known as the atlas; whereas a person without anatomical
  knowledge would probably take off the head by cutting through the neck. Then
  the arms have been separated with the scapula (or shoulder-blade) and
  clavicle (or collar-bone) attached, just as an arm would be removed for
  dissection.</p>

  <p>'The skill is shown by the neat way in which the dismemberment has been
  carried out. The parts have not been rudely hacked asunder, but have been
  separated at the joints so skilfully that I have not discovered a single
  scratch or mark of the knife on any of the bones.'</p>

  <p>'Can you suggest any class of person who would be likely to possess the
  knowledge and skill to which you refer?'</p>

  <p>'It would, of course, be possessed by a surgeon or medical student, and
  possibly by a butcher.'</p>

  <p>'You think that the person who dismembered this body may have been a
  surgeon or a medical student?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; or a butcher. Some one accustomed to the dismemberment of bodies and
  skilful with the knife.'</p>

  <p>Here the cobbler suddenly rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>'I rise, Mr. Chairman,' said he, 'to protest against the statement that
  has just been made.'</p>

  <p>'What statement?' demanded the coroner.</p>

  <p>'Against the aspersion,' continued the cobbler, with an oratorical
  flourish, 'that has been cast upon a honourable calling.'</p>

  <p>'I don't understand you,' said the coroner.</p>

  <p>'Doctor Summers has insinuated that this murder was committed by a
  butcher. Now a member of that honourable calling is sitting on this
  jury&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'You let me alone,' growled the butcher.</p>

  <p>'I will not let you alone,' persisted the cobbler. 'I desire&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Oh, shut up, Pope!' This was from the foreman, who, at the same moment,
  reached out an enormous hairy hand with which he grabbed the cobbler's
  coat-tails and brought him into a sitting posture with a thump that shook the
  room.</p>

  <p>But Mr. Pope, though seated, was not silenced. 'I desire,' he said, 'to
  have my protest put on record.'</p>

  <p>'I can't do that,' said the coroner, 'and I can't allow you to interrupt
  the witnesses.'</p>

  <p>'I am acting,' said Mr. Pope, 'in the interests of my friend here and the
  members of a honourable&mdash;'</p>

  <p>But here the butcher turned on him savagely, and, in a hoarse
  stage-whisper, exclaimed:</p>

  <p>'Look here, Pope; you've got too much of what the cat licks&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Gentlemen! gentlemen!' the coroner protested sternly; 'I cannot permit
  this unseemly conduct. You are forgetting the solemnity of the occasion and
  your own responsible positions. I must insist on more decent and decorous
  behaviour.'</p>

  <p>There was profound silence, in the midst of which the butcher concluded in
  the same hoarse whisper:</p>

  <p>'&mdash;licks 'er paws with.'</p>

  <p>The coroner cast a withering glance at him, and, turning to the witness,
  resumed the examination.</p>

  <p>'Can you tell us, Doctor, how long a time has elapsed since the death of
  the deceased?'</p>

  <p>'I should say not less than eighteen months, but probably more. How much
  more it is impossible from inspection alone to say. The bones are perfectly
  clean&mdash;that is, clean of all soft structures&mdash;and will remain
  substantially in their present condition for many years.'</p>

  <p>'The evidence of the man who found the remains in the watercress-bed
  suggests that they could not have been there for more than two years. Do the
  appearances in your opinion agree with that view?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; perfectly.'</p>

  <p>'There is one more point, Doctor; a very important one. Do you find
  anything in any of the bones, or all of them together, which would enable you
  to identify them as the bones of any particular individual?'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Dr. Summers; 'I found no peculiarity that could furnish the
  means of personal identification.'</p>

  <p>'The description of a missing individual has been given to us,' said the
  coroner; 'a man, fifty-nine years of age, five feet eight inches in height,
  healthy, well preserved, rather broad in build, and having an old Pott's
  fracture of the left ankle. Do the remains that you have examined agree with
  that description?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, so far as agreement is possible. There is no disagreement.'</p>

  <p>'The remains might be those of that individual?'</p>

  <p>'They might; but there is no positive evidence that they are. The
  description would apply to a large proportion of elderly men, except as to
  the fracture.'</p>

  <p>'You found no signs of such a fracture?'</p>

  <p>'No. Pott's fracture affects the bone called the fibula. That is one of
  the bones that has not yet been found, so there is no evidence on that point.
  The left foot was quite normal, but then it would be in any case, unless the
  fracture had resulted in great deformity.'</p>

  <p>'You estimated the height of the deceased as half an inch greater than
  that of the missing person. Does that constitute a disagreement?'</p>

  <p>'No; my estimate is only approximate. As the arms are complete and the
  legs are not, I have based my calculations on the width across the two arms.
  But measurement of the thigh-bones gives the same result. The length of the
  thigh-bones is one foot seven inches and five-eighths.'</p>

  <p>'So the deceased might not have been taller than five feet eight?'</p>

  <p>'That is so; from five feet eight to five feet nine.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you. I think that is all we want to ask you, Doctor; unless the
  jury wish to put any questions.'</p>

  <p>He glanced uneasily at that august body, and instantly the irrepressible
  Pope rose to the occasion.</p>

  <p>'About that finger that is missing,' said the cobbler. 'You say that it
  was cut off after death?'</p>

  <p>'That is my opinion.'</p>

  <p>'Now can you tell us why it was cut off?'</p>

  <p>'No, I cannot.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, come now, Doctor Summers, you must have formed some opinion on the
  subject.'</p>

  <p>Here the coroner interposed. 'The Doctor is only concerned with the
  evidence arising out of the actual examination of the remains. Any personal
  opinions or conjectures that he may have formed are not evidence, and he must
  not be asked about them.'</p>

  <p>'But, sir,' objected Pope, 'we want to know why that finger was cut off.
  It couldn't have been took off for no reason. May I ask, sir, if the person
  who is missing had anything peculiar about that finger?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing is stated to that effect in the written description,' replied the
  coroner.</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' suggested Pope, 'Inspector Badger can tell us.'</p>

  <p>'I think,' said the coroner, 'we had better not ask the police too many
  questions. They will tell us anything that they wish to be made public.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, very well,' snapped the cobbler. 'If it's a matter of hushing it up
  I've got no more to say; only I don't see how we are to arrive at a verdict
  if we don't have the facts put before us.'</p>

  <p>All the witnesses having now been examined, the coroner proceeded to sum
  up and address the jury.</p>

  <p>'You have heard the evidence, gentlemen, of the various witnesses, and you
  will have perceived that it does not enable us to answer either of the
  questions that form the subject of this inquiry. We now know that the
  deceased was an elderly man, about sixty years of age, and about five feet
  eight to nine in height; and that his death took place from eighteen months
  to two years ago. That is all we know. From the treatment to which the body
  has been subjected we may form conjectures as to the circumstances of his
  death. But we have no actual knowledge. We do not know who the deceased was
  or how he came by his death. Consequently, it will be necessary to adjourn
  this inquiry until fresh facts are available, and as soon as that is the
  case, you will receive due notice that your attendance is required.'</p>

  <p>The silence of the Court gave place to the confused noise of moving chairs
  and a general outbreak of eager talk, amidst which I rose and made my way out
  into the street. At the door I encountered Dr. Summers, whose dog-cart was
  waiting close by.</p>

  <p>'Are you going back to town now?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I answered; 'as soon as I can catch a train.'</p>

  <p>'If you jump into my cart I'll run you down in time for the five-one.
  You'll miss it if you walk.'</p>

  <p>I accepted his offer thankfully, and a minute later was spinning briskly
  down the road to the station.</p>

  <p>'Queer little devil, that man Pope,' Dr. Summers remarked. 'Quite a
  character; a socialist, labourite, agitator, general crank; anything for a
  row.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I answered; 'that was what his appearance suggested. It must be
  trying for the coroner to get a truculent rascal like that on a jury.'</p>

  <p>Summers laughed. 'I don't know. He supplies the comic relief. And then,
  you know, those fellows have their uses. Some of his questions were pretty
  pertinent.'</p>

  <p>'So Badger seemed to think.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, by Jove,' chuckled Summers. 'Badger didn't like him a bit; and I
  suspect the worthy inspector was sailing pretty close to the wind in his
  answers.'</p>

  <p>'You think he really has some private information?'</p>

  <p>'Depends upon what you mean by "information." The police are not a
  speculative body. They wouldn't be taking all this trouble unless they had a
  pretty straight tip from somebody. How are Mr. and Miss Bellingham? I used to
  know them when they lived here.'</p>

  <p>I was considering a discreet answer to this question when we swept into
  the station yard. At the same moment the train drew up at the platform, and,
  with a hurried hand-shake and hastily spoken thanks, I sprang from the
  dog-cart and darted into the station.</p>

  <p>During the rather slow journey homewards I read over my notes and
  endeavoured to extract from the facts they set forth some significance other
  than that which lay on the surface, but without much success. Then I fell to
  speculating on what Thorndyke would think of the evidence at the inquest and
  whether he would be satisfied with the information that I had collected.
  These speculations lasted me, with occasional digressions, until I arrived at
  the Temple and ran up the stairs rather eagerly to my friends' chambers.</p>

  <p>But here a disappointment awaited me. The nest was empty with the
  exception of Polton, who appeared at the laboratory door in his white apron,
  with a pair of flat-nosed pliers in his hand.</p>

  <p>'The Doctor had to go down to Bristol to consult over an urgent case,' he
  explained, 'and Doctor Jervis has gone with him. They'll be away a day or
  two, I expect, but the Doctor left this note for you.'</p>

  <p>He took a letter from the shelf, where it had been stood conspicuously on
  edge, and handed it to me. It was a short note from Thorndyke apologising for
  his sudden departure and asking me to give Polton my notes with any comments
  that I had to make.</p>

  <p>'You will be interested to learn,' he added, 'that the application will be
  heard in the Probate Court the day after to-morrow. I shall not be present,
  of course, nor will Jervis, so I should like you to attend and keep your eyes
  open for anything that may happen during the hearing and that may not appear
  in the notes that Marchmont's clerk will be instructed to take. I have
  retained Dr. Payne to stand by and help you with the practice, so that you
  can attend the Court with a clear conscience.'</p>

  <p>This was highly flattering and quite atoned for the small disappointment;
  with deep gratification at the trust that Thorndyke had reposed in me, I
  pocketed the letter, handed my notes to Polton, wished him 'Good-evening,'
  and betook myself to Fetter Lane.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XIV. WHICH CARRIES THE READER INTO THE PROBATE COURT</h3>

  <p>THE Probate Court wore an air of studious repose when I entered with Miss
  Bellingham and her father. Apparently the great and inquisitive public had
  not become aware of the proceedings that were about to take place, or had not
  realised their connection with the sensational 'Mutilation Case'; but
  barristers and Pressmen, better informed, had gathered in some strength, and
  the hum of their conversation filled the air like the droning of the
  voluntary that ushers in a cathedral service.</p>

  <p>As we entered, a pleasant-faced, elderly gentleman rose and came forward
  to meet us, shaking Mr. Bellingham's hand cordially and saluting Miss
  Bellingham with a courtly bow.</p>

  <p>'This is Mr. Marchmont, Doctor,' said the former, introducing me; and the
  solicitor, having thanked me for the trouble I had taken in attending at the
  inquest, led us to a bench, at the farther end of which was seated a
  gentleman whom I recognised as Mr. Hurst.</p>

  <p>Mr. Bellingham recognised him at the same moment and glared at him
  wrathfully.</p>

  <p>'I see that scoundrel is here!' he exclaimed in a distinctly audible
  voice, 'pretending that he doesn't see me, because he is ashamed to look me
  in the face, but&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Hush! hush! my dear sir,' exclaimed the horrified solicitor; 'we mustn't
  talk like that, especially in this place. Let me beg you&mdash;let me entreat
  you to control your feelings, to make no indiscreet remarks; in fact, to make
  no remarks at all,' he added, with the evident conviction that any remarks
  that Mr. Bellingham might make would be certain to be indiscreet.</p>

  <p>'Forgive me, Marchmont,' Mr. Bellingham replied contritely. 'I will
  control myself: I will really be quite discreet. I won't even look at him
  again&mdash;because, if I do, I shall probably go over and pull his
  nose.'</p>

  <p>This form of discretion did not appear to be quite to Mr. Marchmont's
  liking, for he took the precaution of insisting that Miss Bellingham and I
  should sit on the farther side of his client, and thus effectually separate
  him from his enemy.</p>

  <p>'Who's the long-nosed fellow talking to Jellicoe?' Mr. Bellingham
  asked.</p>

  <p>'That is Mr. Loram, KG, Mr. Hurst's counsel; and the convivial-looking
  gentleman next to him is our counsel, Mr. Heath, a most able man
  and'&mdash;here Mr. Marchmont whispered behind his hand&mdash;'fully
  instructed by Doctor Thorndyke.'</p>

  <p>At this juncture the judge entered and took his seat; the usher proceeded
  with great rapidity to swear in the jury, and the Court gradually settled
  down into that state of academic quiet which it maintained throughout the
  proceedings, excepting when the noisy swing-doors were set oscillating by
  some bustling clerk or reporter.</p>

  <p>The judge was a somewhat singular-looking old gentleman, very short as to
  his face and very long as to his mouth; which peculiarities, together with a
  pair of large and bulging eyes (which he usually kept closed), suggested a
  certain resemblance to a frog. And he had a curious frog-like trick of
  flattening his eyelids&mdash;as if in the act of swallowing a large
  beetle&mdash;which was the only outward and visible sign of emotion that he
  ever displayed.</p>

  <p>As soon as the swearing in of the jury was completed Mr. Loram rose to
  introduce the case; whereupon his lordship leaned back in his chair and
  closed his eyes, as if bracing himself for a painful operation.</p>

  <p>'The present proceedings,' Mr. Loram explained, 'are occasioned by the
  unaccountable disappearance of Mr. John Bellingham, of 141, Queen Square,
  Bloomsbury, which occurred about two years ago, or, to be more precise, on
  the twenty-third of November, nineteen hundred and two. Since that date
  nothing has been heard of Mr. Bellingham, and, as there are certain
  substantial reasons for believing him to be dead, the principal beneficiary
  under his will, Mr. George Hurst, is now applying to the Court for permission
  to presume the death of the testator and prove the will. As the time which
  has elapsed since the testator was last seen alive is only two years, the
  application is based upon the circumstances of the disappearance, which were,
  in many respects, very singular, the most remarkable feature of that
  disappearance being, perhaps, its suddenness and completeness.'</p>

  <p>Here the judge remarked in a still, small voice that 'It would, perhaps,
  have been even more remarkable if the testator had disappeared gradually and
  incompletely.'</p>

  <p>'No doubt, my lord,' agreed Mr. Loram; 'but the point is that the
  testator, whose habits had always been regular and orderly, disappeared on
  the date mentioned without having made any of the usual provisions for the
  conduct of his affairs, and has not since then been seen or heard of.'</p>

  <p>With this preamble Mr. Loram proceeded to give a narrative of the events
  connected with the disappearance of John Bellingham, which was substantially
  identical with that which I had read in the newspapers; and having laid the
  actual facts before the jury, he went on to discuss their probable
  import.</p>

  <p>'Now, what conclusion,' he asked, 'will this strange, this most mysterious
  train of events suggest to an intelligent person who shall consider it
  impartially? Here is a man who steps forth from the house of his cousin or
  his brother, as the case may be, and forthwith, in the twinkling of an eye,
  vanishes from human ken. What is the explanation? Did he steal forth and,
  without notice or hint of his intention, take train to some seaport, thence
  to embark for some distant land, leaving his affairs to take care of
  themselves and his friends to speculate vainly as to his whereabouts? Is he
  now hiding abroad, or even at home, indifferent alike to the safety of his
  own considerable property and the peace of mind of his friends? Or is it that
  death has come upon him unawares by sickness, by accident, or, more probably,
  by the hand of some unknown criminal? Let us consider the probabilities.</p>

  <p>'Can he have disappeared by his own deliberate act? Why not? it may be
  asked. Men undoubtedly do disappear from time to time, to be discovered by
  chance or to reappear voluntarily after intervals of years and find their
  names almost forgotten and their places filled by new-comers. Yes; but there
  is always some reason for a disappearance of this kind, even though it be a
  bad one. Family discords that make life a weariness; pecuniary difficulties
  that make life a succession of anxieties; distaste for particular
  circumstances and surroundings from which there seems no escape; inherent
  restlessness and vagabond tendencies, and so on.</p>

  <p>'Do any of these explanations apply to the present case? No, they do not.
  Family discords&mdash;at least those capable of producing chronic
  misery&mdash;appertain exclusively to a married state. But the testator was a
  bachelor with no encumbrances whatever. Pecuniary anxieties can be equally
  excluded. The testator was in easy, in fact, in affluent circumstances. His
  mode of life was apparently agreeable and full of interest and activity, and
  he had full liberty of change if he wished. He had been accustomed to travel,
  and could do so again without absconding. He had reached an age when radical
  changes do not seem desirable. He was a man of fixed and regular habits, and
  his regularity was of his own choice and not due to compulsion or necessity.
  When last seen by his friends, as I shall prove, he was proceeding to a
  definite destination with the expressed intention of returning for purposes
  of his own appointing. He did return and then vanished, leaving those
  purposes unachieved.</p>

  <p>'If we conclude that he has voluntarily disappeared and is at present in
  hiding, we adopt an opinion that is entirely at variance with all these
  weighty facts. If, on the other hand, we conclude that he has died suddenly,
  or has been killed by an accident or otherwise, we are adopting a view that
  involves no inherent improbabilities and that is entirely congruous with the
  known facts; facts that will be proved by the testimony of the witnesses whom
  I shall call. The supposition that the testator is dead is not only more
  probable than that he is alive; I submit it is the only reasonable
  explanation of the circumstances of his disappearance.</p>

  <p>'But this is not all. The presumption of death which arises so inevitably
  out of the mysterious and abrupt manner in which the testator disappeared has
  recently received most conclusive and dreadful confirmation. On the fifteenth
  of July last there were discovered at Sidcup the remains of a human
  arm&mdash;a left arm, gentlemen, from the hand of which the third, or ring,
  finger was missing. The doctor who has examined that arm will tell you that
  the finger was cut off either after death or immediately before; and his
  evidence will prove conclusively that that arm must have been deposited in
  the place where it was found just about the time when the testator
  disappeared. Since that first discovery, other portions of the same mutilated
  body have come to light; and it is a strange and significant fact that they
  have all been found in the immediate neighbourhood of Eltham or Woodford. You
  will remember, gentlemen, that it was either at Eltham or Woodford that the
  testator was last seen alive.</p>

  <p>'And now observe the completeness of the coincidence. These human remains,
  as you will be told presently by the experienced and learned medical
  gentleman who has examined them most exhaustively, are those of a man of
  about sixty years of age, about five feet eight inches in height, fairly
  muscular and well preserved, apparently healthy, and rather stoutly built.
  Another witness will tell you that the missing man was about sixty years of
  age, about five feet eight inches in height, fairly muscular and well
  preserved, apparently healthy, and rather stoutly built. And&mdash;another
  most significant and striking fact&mdash;the testator was accustomed to wear
  upon the third finger of his left hand&mdash;the very finger that is missing
  from the remains that were found&mdash;a most peculiar ring, which fitted so
  tightly that he was unable to get it off after once putting it on; a ring,
  gentlemen, of so peculiar a pattern that had it been found on the body must
  have instantly established the identity of the remains. In a word, gentlemen,
  the remains which have been found are those of a man exactly like the
  testator; they differ from him in no respect whatever; they display a
  mutilation which suggests an attempt to conceal an identifying peculiarity
  which he undoubtedly presented; and they were deposited in their various
  hiding-places about the time of the testator's disappearance. Accordingly,
  when you have heard these facts proved by the sworn testimony of competent
  witnesses, together with the facts relating to the disappearance, I shall ask
  you for a verdict in accordance with that evidence.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Loram sat down, and adjusting a pair of pince-nez, rapidly glanced
  over his brief while the usher was administering the oath to the first
  witness.</p>

  <p>This was Mr. Jellicoe, who stepped into the box and directed a stony gaze
  at the (apparently) unconscious judge. The usual preliminaries having been
  gone through, Mr. Loram proceeded to examine him.</p>

  <p>'You were the testator's solicitor and confidential agent, I believe?'</p>

  <p>'I was&mdash;and am.'</p>

  <p>'How long have you known him?'</p>

  <p>'Twenty-seven years.'</p>

  <p>'Judging from your experience of him, should you say that he was a person
  likely to disappear voluntarily and suddenly to cease to communicate with his
  friends?</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'Kindly give your reasons for that opinion.'</p>

  <p>'Such conduct on the part of the testator would be entirely opposed to his
  habits and character as they are known to me. He was exceedingly regular and
  businesslike in his dealings with me.</p>

  <p>When travelling abroad he always kept me informed as to his whereabouts,
  or, if he was likely to be beyond reach of communications, he always advised
  me beforehand. One of my duties was to collect a pension which he drew from
  the Foreign Office, and on no occasion, previous to his disappearance, has he
  ever failed to furnish me punctually with the necessary documents.'</p>

  <p>'Had he, so far as you know, any reasons for wishing to disappear?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'When and where did you last see him alive?'</p>

  <p>'At six o'clock in the evening, on the fourteenth of October, nineteen
  hundred and two, at 141, Queen Square, Bloomsbury.'</p>

  <p>'Kindly tell us what happened on that occasion.'</p>

  <p>'The testator had called for me at my office at a quarter past three, and
  asked me to come with him to his house to meet Doctor Norbury. I accompanied
  him to 141, Queen Square, and shortly after we arrived Doctor Norbury came to
  look at some antiquities that the testator proposed to give to the British
  Museum. The gift consisted of a mummy with four Canopic jars and other
  tomb-furniture which the testator stipulated should be exhibited together in
  a single case and in the state in which they were then presented. Of these
  objects, the mummy only was ready for inspection. The tomb-furniture had not
  yet arrived in England, but was expected within a week. Doctor Norbury
  accepted the gift on behalf of the Museum, but could not take possession of
  the objects until he had communicated with the Director and obtained his
  formal authority. The testator accordingly gave me certain instructions
  concerning the delivery of the gift, as he was leaving England that
  evening.'</p>

  <p>'Are those instructions relevant to the subject of this inquiry?'</p>

  <p>'I think they are. The testator was going to Paris, and perhaps thence to
  Vienna. He instructed me to receive and unpack the tomb-furniture on its
  arrival, and to store it, with the mummy, in a particular room, where it was
  to remain for three weeks. If he returned within that time he was to hand it
  over in person to the Museum authorities; if he had not returned within that
  time, he desired me to notify the Museum authorities that they were at
  liberty to take possession of and remove the collection at their convenience.
  From these instructions I gathered that the testator was uncertain as to the
  length of his absence from England and the extent of his journey.'</p>

  <p>'Did he state precisely where he was going?'</p>

  <p>'No. He said he was going to Paris and perhaps to Vienna, but he gave no
  particulars and I asked for none.' 'Do you, in fact, know where he went?'</p>

  <p>'No. He left the house at six o'clock wearing a long, heavy overcoat and
  carrying a suit-case and an umbrella. I wished him "Good-bye" at the door and
  watched him walk away as if going towards Southampton Row. I have no idea
  where he went, and I never saw him again.'</p>

  <p>'Had he no other luggage than the suit-case?' 'I do not know, but I
  believe not. He was accustomed to travel with the bare necessaries, and to
  buy anything further he wanted en route.'</p>

  <p>'Did he say nothing to the servants as to the probable date of his
  return?'</p>

  <p>'There were no servants excepting the caretaker. The house was not used
  for residential purposes. The testator slept and took his meals at his club,
  though he kept his clothes at the house.' 'Did you receive any communication
  from him after he left?' 'No. I never heard from him again in any way. I
  waited for three weeks as he had instructed me, and then notified the Museum
  authorities that the collection was ready for removal. Five days later Doctor
  Norbury came and took formal possession of it, and it was transferred to the
  Museum forthwith.' 'When did you next hear of the testator?'</p>

  <p>'On the twenty-third of November following at a quarter-past seven in the
  evening. Mr. George Hurst came to my rooms, which are over my office, and
  informed me that the testator had called at his house during his absence and
  had been shown into the study to wait for him. That on his&mdash;Mr.
  Hurst's&mdash;arrival it was found that the testator had disappeared without
  acquainting the servants of his intended departure, and without being seen by
  anyone to leave the house. Mr. Hurst thought this so remarkable that he had
  hastened up to town to inform me. I also thought it a remarkable
  circumstance, especially as I had received no communication from the
  testator, and we both decided that it was advisable to inform the testator's
  brother, Godfrey, of what had happened.</p>

  <p>'Accordingly-Mr. Hurst and I proceeded as quickly as possible to Liverpool
  Street and took the first train available to Woodford, where Mr. Godfrey
  Bellingham then resided. We arrived at his house at five minutes to nine, and
  were informed by the servant that he was not at home, but that his daughter
  was in the library, which was a detached building situated in the grounds.
  The servant lighted a lantern and conducted us through the grounds to the
  library, where we found Mr. Godfrey Bellingham and Miss Bellingham. Mr.
  Godfrey had only just come in and had entered by the back gate, which had a
  bell that rang in the library. Mr. Hurst informed Mr. Godfrey of what had
  occurred, and then we left the library to walk up to the house. A few paces
  from the library I noticed by the light of the lantern, which Mr. Godfrey was
  carrying, a small object lying on the lawn. I pointed it to him and he picked
  it up, and then we all recognised it as a scarab that the testator was
  accustomed to wear on his watch-chain. It was fitted with a gold wire passed
  through the suspension hole and a gold ring. Both the wire and the ring were
  in position, but the ring was broken. We went to the house and questioned the
  servants as to visitors; but none of them had seen the testator, and they all
  agreed that no visitor whatsoever had come to the house during the afternoon
  or evening. Mr. Godfrey and Miss Bellingham both declared that they had
  neither seen nor heard anything of the testator, and were both unaware that
  he had returned to England. As the circumstances were somewhat disquieting, I
  communicated, on the following morning, with the police and requested them to
  make inquiries; which they did, with the result that a suit-case bearing the
  initials "J. B.", was found to be lying unclaimed in the cloak-room at
  Charing Cross Station. I was able to identify the suit-case as that which I
  had seen the testator carry away from Queen Square. I was also able to
  identify some of the contents. I interviewed the cloak-room attendant, who
  informed me that the suit-case had been deposited on the twenty-third about
  4.15 p.m. He had no recollection of the person who deposited it. It remained
  unclaimed in the possession of the railway company for three months, and was
  then surrendered to me.'</p>

  <p>'Were there any marks or labels on it showing the route by which it had
  travelled?'</p>

  <p>'There were no labels on it and no marks other than the initials
  "J.B."</p>

  <p>'Do you happen to know the testator's age?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He was fifty-nine on the eleventh of October, nineteen hundred and
  two.'</p>

  <p>'Can you tell us what his height was?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. He was exactly five feet eight inches.'</p>

  <p>'What sort of health had he?'</p>

  <p>'So far as I know his health was good. I am not aware that he suffered
  from any disease. I am only judging by his appearance, which was that of a
  healthy man.'</p>

  <p>'Should you describe him as well preserved or otherwise?'</p>

  <p>'I should describe him as a well preserved man for his age.'</p>

  <p>'How should you describe his figure?'</p>

  <p>'I should describe him as rather broad and stout in build, and fairly
  muscular, though not exceptionally so.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Loram made a rapid note of these answers and then said:</p>

  <p>'You have told us, Mr. Jellicoe, that you have known the testator
  intimately for twenty-seven years. Now, did you ever notice whether he was
  accustomed to wear any rings upon his fingers?'</p>

  <p>'He wore upon the third finger of his left hand a copy of an antique ring
  which bore the device of the Eye of Osiris. That was the only ring he ever
  wore as far as I know.'</p>

  <p>'Did he wear it constantly?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, necessarily; because it was too small for him, and having once
  squeezed it on he was never able to get it off again.'</p>

  <p>This was the sum of Mr. Jellicoe's evidence, and at its conclusion the
  witness glanced inquiringly at Mr. Bellingham's counsel. But Mr. Heath
  remained seated, attentively considering the notes that he had just made, and
  finding that there was to be no cross-examination, Mr. Jellicoe stepped down
  from the box. I leaned back on my bench, and, turning my head, observed Miss
  Bellingham deep in thought.</p>

  <p>'What do you think of it?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'It seems very complete and conclusive,' she replied. And then, with a
  sigh, she murmured: 'Poor old Uncle John! How horrid it sounds to talk of him
  in this cold-blooded, business-like way, as "the testator," as if he were
  nothing but a sort of algebraical sign.'</p>

  <p>'There isn't much room for sentiment, I suppose, in the proceedings of the
  Probate Court,' I replied. To which she assented, and then asked: 'Who is
  this lady?'</p>

  <p>'This lady' was a fashionably dressed young woman who had just bounced
  into the witness-box and was now being sworn. The preliminaries being
  finished, she answered Miss Bellingham's question and Mr. Loram's by stating
  that her name was Augustina Gwendoline Dobbs, and that she was housemaid to
  Mr. George Hurst, of' The Poplars,' Eltham.</p>

  <p>'Mr. Hurst lives alone, I believe?' said Mr. Loram.</p>

  <p>'I don't know what you mean by that,' Miss Dobbs began; but the barrister
  explained.</p>

  <p>'I mean that I believe he is unmarried?'</p>

  <p>'Well, and what about it?' the witness demanded tartly.</p>

  <p>'I am asking you a question.'</p>

  <p>'I know that,' said the witness viciously; 'and I say that you've no
  business to make any such insinuations to a respectable young lady when
  there's a cook-housekeeper and a kitchenmaid living in the house, and him old
  enough to be my father&mdash;'</p>

  <p>Here his lordship flattened his eyelids with startling effect, and Mr.
  Loram interrupted: 'I make no insinuations. I merely ask, Is your employer,
  Mr. Hurst, an unmarried man, or is he not?'</p>

  <p>'I never asked him,' said the witness sulkily.</p>

  <p>'Please answer my question&mdash;yes or no.'</p>

  <p>'How can I answer your question? He may be married or he may not. How do I
  know? I'm no private detective.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Loram directed a stupefied gaze at the witness, and in the ensuing
  silence a plaintive voice came from the bench:</p>

  <p>'Is that point material?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly, my lord,' replied Mr. Loram.</p>

  <p>'Then, as I see that you are calling Mr. Hurst, perhaps you had better put
  the question to him. He will probably know.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Loram bowed, and as the judge subsided into his normal state of coma
  he turned to the triumphant witness.</p>

  <p>'Do you remember anything remarkable occurring on the twenty-third of
  November the year before last?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. Mr. John Bellingham called at our house.'</p>

  <p>'How did you know he was Mr. John Bellingham?'</p>

  <p>'I didn't; but he said he was, and I supposed he knew.'</p>

  <p>'At what time did he arrive?'</p>

  <p>'At twenty minutes past five in the evening.'</p>

  <p>'What happened then?'</p>

  <p>'I told him that Mr. Hurst had not come home yet, and he said he would
  wait for him in the study and write some letters; so I showed him into the
  study and shut the door.'</p>

  <p>'What happened next?'</p>

  <p>'Nothing. Then Mr. Hurst came home at his usual time&mdash;a quarter to
  six&mdash;and let himself in with his key. He went straight into the study
  where I supposed Mr. Bellingham still was, so I took no notice, but laid the
  table for two. At six o'clock Mr. Hurst came into the dining-room&mdash;he
  has tea in the City and dines at six&mdash;and when he saw the table laid for
  two he asked the reason. I said I thought Mr. Bellingham was staying to
  dinner.</p>

  <p>'"Mr. Bellingham!" says he. "I didn't know he was here. Why didn't you
  tell me?" he says. "I thought he was with you, sir," I said. "I showed him
  into the study," I said. "Well, he wasn't there when I came in," he said,
  "and he isn't there now," he said. "Perhaps he has gone to wait in the
  drawing-room," he said. So we went and looked in the drawing-room, but he
  wasn't there. Then Mr. Hurst said he thought Mr. Bellingham must have got
  tired of waiting and gone away; but I told him I was quite sure he hadn't,
  because I had been watching all the time. Then he asked me if Mr. Bellingham
  was alone or whether his daughter was with him, and I said that it wasn't
  that Mr. Bellingham at all, but Mr. John Bellingham, and then he was more
  surprised than ever. I said we had better search the house to make sure
  whether he was there or not, and Mr. Hurst said he would come with me; so we
  all went over the house and looked in all the rooms, but there was not a sign
  of Mr. Bellingham in any of them. Then Mr. Hurst got very nervous and upset,
  and when he had just snatched a little dinner he ran off to catch the six
  thirty-one train up to town.'</p>

  <p>'You say that Mr. Bellingham could not have left the house because you
  were watching all the time. Where were you while you were watching?'</p>

  <p>'I was in the kitchen. I could see the front gate from the kitchen
  window.'</p>

  <p>'You say that you laid the table for two. Where did you lay it?'</p>

  <p>'In the dining-room, of course.'</p>

  <p>'Could you see the front gate from the dining-room?'</p>

  <p>'No, but I could see the study door. The study is opposite the
  dining-room.'</p>

  <p>'Do you have to come upstairs to get from the kitchen to the
  dining-room?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course you do!'</p>

  <p>'Then, might not Mr. Bellingham have left the house while you were coming
  up the stairs?'</p>

  <p>'No, he couldn't have done.'</p>

  <p>'Why not?'</p>

  <p>'Because it would have been impossible.'</p>

  <p>'But why would it have been impossible?'</p>

  <p>'Because he couldn't have done it.'</p>

  <p>'I suggest that Mr. Bellingham left the house quietly while you were on
  the stairs?'</p>

  <p>'No, he didn't.'</p>

  <p>'How do you know he did not?'</p>

  <p>'I am quite sure he didn't.'</p>

  <p>'But how can you be certain?'</p>

  <p>'Because I should have seen him if he had.'</p>

  <p>'But I mean when you were on the stairs.'</p>

  <p>'He was in the study when I was on the stairs.'</p>

  <p>'How do you know he was in the study?'</p>

  <p>'Because I showed him in there and he hadn't come out.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Loram paused and took a deep breath, and his lordship flattened his
  eyelids.</p>

  <p>'Is there a gate to the premises?' the barrister resumed wearily.</p>

  <p>'Yes. It opens into a narrow lane at the side of the house.'</p>

  <p>'And there is a French window in the study, is there not?'</p>

  <p>'Yes It opens on to the small grass plot opposite the side gate.'</p>

  <p>'Were the window and the gate locked or would it have been possible for
  Mr. Bellingham to let himself out into the lane?'</p>

  <p>'The window and the gate both have catches on the inside. He could have
  got out that way, but, of course, he didn't.'</p>

  <p>'Why not?'</p>

  <p>'Well, no gentleman would go creeping out the back way like a thief.'</p>

  <p>'Did you look to see if the French window was shut and fastened after you
  missed Mr. Bellingham?'</p>

  <p>'I looked at it when we shut the house up for the night. It was then shut
  and fastened on the inside.'</p>

  <p>'And the side gate?'</p>

  <p>'That gate was shut and latched. You have to slam the gate to make the
  latch fasten, so no one could have gone out of the gate without being
  heard.'</p>

  <p>Here the examination-in-chief ended, and Mr. Loram sat down with an
  audible sigh of relief. Miss Dobbs was about to step down from the
  witness-box when Mr. Heath rose to cross-examine.</p>

  <p>'Did you see Mr. Bellingham in a good light?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'Pretty good. It was dark outside, but the hall-lamp was alight.'</p>

  <p>'Kindly look at this'&mdash;here a small object was passed across to the
  witness. 'It is a trinket that Mr. Bellingham is stated to have carried
  suspended from his watch-guard. Can you remember if he was wearing it in that
  manner when he came to the house?'</p>

  <p>'No, he was not.'</p>

  <p>'You are sure of that.'</p>

  <p>'Quite sure.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you. And now I want to ask you about the search that you have
  mentioned. You say that you went all over the house. Did you go into the
  study?'</p>

  <p>'No&mdash;at least, not until Mr. Hurst had gone to London.'</p>

  <p>'When you did go in, was the window fastened?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Could it have been fastened from the outside?'</p>

  <p>'No; there is no handle outside.'</p>

  <p>'What furniture is there in the study?'</p>

  <p>'There is a writing-table, a revolving-chair, two easy chairs, two large
  book-cases, and a wardrobe that Mr. Hurst keeps his overcoats and hats
  in.'</p>

  <p>'Does the wardrobe lock?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Was it locked when you went in?'</p>

  <p>'I'm sure I don't know. I don't go about trying the cupboards and
  drawers.'</p>

  <p>'What furniture is there in the drawing-room?'</p>

  <p>'A cabinet, six or seven chairs, a Chesterfield sofa, a piano, a
  silver-table, and one or two occasional tables.'</p>

  <p>'Is the piano a grand or upright?'</p>

  <p>'It is an upright grand.'</p>

  <p>'In what position is it placed?'</p>

  <p>'It stands across a corner near the window.'</p>

  <p>'Is there sufficient room behind it for a man to conceal himself?'</p>

  <p>Miss Dobbs was amused and did not dissemble. 'Oh, yes,' she sniggered,
  'there's plenty of room for a man to hide behind it.'</p>

  <p>'When you searched the drawing-room, did you look behind the piano?'</p>

  <p>'No, I didn't,' Miss Dobbs replied scornfully.</p>

  <p>'Did you look under the sofa?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly not!'</p>

  <p>'What did you do then?'</p>

  <p>'We opened the door and looked into the room. We were not looking for a
  cat or a monkey; we were looking for a middle-aged gentleman.'</p>

  <p>'And am I to take it that your search over the rest of the house was
  conducted in a similar manner?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly. We looked into the rooms, but we did not search under the beds
  or in the cupboards.'</p>

  <p>'Are all the rooms in the house in use as living or sleeping rooms?'</p>

  <p>'No; there is one room on the second floor that is used as a store and
  lumber-room, and one on the first floor that Mr. Hurst uses to store trunks
  and things that he is not using.'</p>

  <p>'Did you look in those rooms when you searched the house?'</p>

  <p>'No.'</p>

  <p>'Have you looked in them since?'</p>

  <p>'I have been in the lumber-room since, but not in the other. It is always
  kept locked.'</p>

  <p>At this point an ominous flattening became apparent in his lordship's
  eyelids, but these symptoms passed when Mr. Heath sat down and indicated that
  he had no further questions to ask.</p>

  <p>Miss Dobbs once more prepared to step down from the witness-box when Mr.
  Loram shot up like a jack-in-the-box.</p>

  <p>'You have made certain statements,' said he, 'concerning the scarab which
  Mr. Bellingham was accustomed to wear suspended from his watch-guard. You say
  that he was not wearing it when he came to Mr. Hurst's house on the
  twenty-third of November, nineteen hundred and two. Are you quite sure of
  that?'</p>

  <p>'Quite sure.'</p>

  <p>'I must ask you to be very careful in your statement on this point. The
  question is a highly important one. Do you swear that the scarab was not
  hanging from his watch-guard?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I do.'</p>

  <p>'Did you notice the watch-guard particularly?'</p>

  <p>'No; not particularly.'</p>

  <p>'Then what makes you sure that the scarab was not attached to it?'</p>

  <p>'It couldn't have been.'</p>

  <p>'Why could it not?'</p>

  <p>'Because if it had been there I should have seen it.'</p>

  <p>'What kind of watch-guard was Mr. Bellingham wearing?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, an ordinary sort of watch-guard.'</p>

  <p>'I mean was it a chain or a ribbon or a strap?'</p>

  <p>'A chain, I think&mdash;or perhaps a ribbon&mdash;or it might have been a
  strap.'</p>

  <p>His lordship flattened his eyelids, but made no further sign and Mr. Loram
  continued:</p>

  <p>'Did you or did you not notice what kind of watch-guard Mr. Bellingham was
  wearing?'</p>

  <p>'I did not. Why should I? It was no business of mine.'</p>

  <p>'But yet you are quite sure about the scarab?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, quite sure.'</p>

  <p>'You noticed that then?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Loram paused and looked helplessly at the witness; a suppressed titter
  arose from the body of the Court, and a faint voice from the bench
  inquired:</p>

  <p>'Are you quite incapable of giving a straightforward answer?'</p>

  <p>Miss Dobbs's only reply was to burst into tears; whereupon Mr. Loram
  abruptly sat down and abandoned his re-examination.</p>

  <p>The witness-box vacated by Miss Dobbs was occupied successively by Dr.
  Norbury, Mr. Hurst and the cloakroom attendant, none of whom contributed any
  new facts, but merely corroborated the statements made by Mr. Jellicoe and
  the housemaid. Then came the labourer who discovered the bones at Sidcup, and
  who repeated the evidence that he had given at the inquest, showing that the
  remains could not have been lying in the watercress-bed more than two years.
  Finally Dr. Summers was called, and, after he had given a brief description
  of the bones that he had examined, was asked by Mr. Loram:</p>

  <p>'You have heard the description that Mr. Jellicoe has given of the
  testator?'</p>

  <p>'I have.'</p>

  <p>'Does that description apply to the person whose remains you
  examined?'</p>

  <p>'In a general way it does.'</p>

  <p>'I must ask you for a direct answer&mdash;yes or no. Does it apply?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. But I ought to say that my estimate of the height of the deceased is
  only approximate.'</p>

  <p>'Quite so. Judging from your examination of those remains and from Mr.
  Jellicoe's description, might those remains be the remains of the testator,
  John Bellingham?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, they might.'</p>

  <p>On receiving this admission Mr. Loram sat down, and Mr. Heath immediately
  rose to cross-examine.</p>

  <p>'When you examined these remains, Doctor Summers, did you discover any
  personal peculiarities which would enable you to identify them as the remains
  of any one individual rather than any other individual of similar size, age,
  and proportions?'</p>

  <p>'No. I found nothing that would identify the remains as those of any
  particular individual.'</p>

  <p>As Mr. Heath asked no further questions, the witness received his
  dismissal, and Mr. Loram informed the Court that that was his case. The judge
  bowed somnolently, and then Mr. Heath rose to address the Court on behalf of
  the respondent. It was not a long speech, nor was it enriched by any displays
  of florid rhetoric; it concerned itself exclusively with a rebutment of the
  arguments of the counsel for the petitioner.</p>

  <p>Having briefly pointed out that the period of absence was too short to
  give rise of itself to the presumption of death, Mr. Heath continued:</p>

  <p>'The claim therefore rests upon evidence of a positive character. My
  learned friend asserts that the testator is presumably dead, and it is for
  him to prove what he has affirmed. Now, has he done this? I submit that he
  has not. He has argued with great force and ingenuity that the testator,
  being a bachelor, a solitary man without wife or child, dependant or master,
  public or private office of duty, or any bond, responsibility, or any other
  condition limiting his freedom of action, had no reason or inducement for
  absconding. This is my learned friend's argument, and he has conducted it
  with so much skill and ingenuity that he has not only succeeded in proving
  his case; he has proved a great deal too much. For if it is true, as my
  learned friend so justly argues, that a man thus unfettered by obligations of
  any kind has no reason for disappearing, is it not even more true that he has
  no reason for not disappearing? My friend has urged that the testator was at
  liberty to go where he pleased, when he pleased, and how he pleased; and that
  therefore there was no need for him to abscond. I reply, if he was at liberty
  to go away, whither, when, and how he pleased, why do we express surprise
  that he has made use of his liberty? My learned friend points out that the
  testator notified to nobody his intention of going away and has acquainted no
  one with his whereabouts; but, I ask, whom should he have notified? He was
  responsible to nobody; there was no one dependent upon him; his presence or
  absence was the concern of nobody but himself. If circumstances suddenly
  arising made it desirable that he should go abroad, why should he not go? I
  say there was no reason whatever.</p>

  <p>'My learned friend has said that the testator went away leaving his
  affairs to take care of themselves. Now, gentlemen, I ask you if this can
  fairly be said of a man whose affairs are, as they have been for many years,
  in the hands of a highly capable, completely trustworthy agent who is better
  acquainted with them than the testator himself? Clearly it cannot.</p>

  <p>'To conclude this part of the argument: I submit that the circumstances of
  the so-called disappearance of the testator present nothing out of the
  ordinary. The testator is a man of ample means, without any responsibilities
  to fetter his movements, and has been in the constant habit of travelling,
  often into remote and distant regions. The mere fact that he has been absent
  somewhat longer; than usual affords no ground whatever for the drastic
  proceeding of presumption of death and taking possession of his property.</p>

  <p>'With reference to the human remains which have been mentioned in
  connection with the case I need say but little. The attempt; to connect them
  with the testator has failed completely. You, yourselves have heard Doctor
  Summers state on oath that they cannot be identified as the remains of any
  particular person. That would seem to dispose of them effectually. I must
  remark upon a very singular point that has been raised by the learned counsel
  for the petitioner, which is this:</p>

  <p>'My learned friend points out that these remains were discovered near
  Eltham and near Woodford and that the testator was last seen alive at one of
  these two places. This he considers for some reason to be a highly
  significant fact. But I cannot agree with him. If the testator had been last
  seen alive at Woodford and the remains had been found at Woodford, or if he
  had disappeared from Eltham, and the remains had been found at Eltham, that
  would have had some significance. But he can only have been last seen at one
  of the places, whereas the remains have been found at both places. Here again
  my learned friend seems to have proved too much.</p>

  <p>'But I need not occupy your time further. I repeat that, in order to
  justify us in presuming the death of the testator, clear and positive
  evidence would be necessary. That no such evidence has been brought forward.
  Accordingly, seeing that the testator may return at any time and is entitled
  to find his property intact, I shall ask you for a verdict that will secure
  to him this measure of ordinary justice.'</p>

  <p>At the conclusion of Mr. Heath's speech the judge, as if awakening from a
  refreshing nap, opened his eyes; and uncommonly shrewd, intelligent eyes they
  were when the expressive eyelids were duly tucked up out of the way. He
  commenced by reading over a part of the will and certain notes&mdash;which he
  appeared to have made in some miraculous fashion with his eyes shut&mdash;and
  then proceeded to review the evidence and the counsels' arguments for the
  instruction of the jury.</p>

  <p>'Before considering the evidence which you have heard, gentlemen' he said,
  'it will be well for me to say a few words to you on the general aspects of
  the case which is occupying our attention.'</p>

  <p>'If a person goes abroad or disappears from his home and his ordinary
  places of resort and is absent for a long period of time, the presumption of
  death arises at the expiration of seven years from the date on which he was
  last heard of. That is to say, that the total disappearance of an individual
  for seven years constitutes presumptive evidence that the said individual is
  dead; and the presumption can be set aside only by the production of evidence
  that he was alive at some time within that period of seven years. But if, on
  the other hand, it is sought to presume the death of a person who has been
  absent for a shorter period than seven years, it is necessary to produce such
  evidence as shall make it highly probable that the said person is dead. Of
  course, presumption implies supposition as opposed to actual demonstration;
  but, nevertheless, the evidence in such a case must be of a kind that tends
  to create a very strong belief that death has occurred; and I need hardly say
  that the shorter the period of absence, the more convincing must be the
  evidence.</p>

  <p>'In the present case, the testator, John Bellingham, has been absent
  somewhat under two years. This is a relatively short period, and in itself
  gives rise to no presumption of death. Nevertheless, death has been presumed
  in a case where the period of absence was even shorter and the insurance
  recovered; but here the evidence supporting the belief in the occurrence of
  death was exceedingly weighty.</p>

  <p>'The testator in this case was a shipmaster, and his disappearance was
  accompanied by the disappearance of the ship and the entire ship's company in
  the course of a voyage from London to Marseilles. The loss of the ship and
  her crew was the only reasonable explanation of the disappearance, and, short
  of actual demonstration, the facts offered convincing evidence of the death
  of all persons on board. I mention this case as an illustration. You are not
  dealing with speculative probabilities. You are contemplating a very
  momentous proceeding, and you must be very sure of your ground. Consider what
  it is that you are asked to do.</p>

  <p>'The petitioner asks permission to presume the death of the testator in
  order that the testator's property may be distributed among the beneficiaries
  under the will. The granting of such permission involves us in the gravest
  responsibility. An ill-considered decision might be productive of a serious
  injustice to the testator, an injustice that could never be remedied. Hence
  it is incumbent upon you to weigh the evidence with the greatest care, to
  come to no decision without the profoundest consideration of all the
  facts.</p>

  <p>'The evidence that you have heard divides itself into two parts&mdash;that
  relating to the circumstances of the testator's disappearance, and that
  relating to certain human remains. In connection with the latter I can only
  suggest my surprise and regret that the application was not postponed until
  the completion of the coroner's inquest, and leave you to consider the
  evidence. You will bear in mind that Doctor Summers has stated explicitly
  that the remains cannot be identified as those of any particular individual,
  but that the testator and the unknown deceased had so many points of
  resemblance that they might possibly be one and the same person.</p>

  <p>'With reference to the circumstances of the disappearance, you have heard
  the evidence of Mr. Jellicoe to the effect that the testator has on no
  previous occasion gone abroad without informing him as to his proposed
  destination. But in considering what weight you are to give to this statement
  you will bear in mind that when the testator set out for Paris after his
  interview with Doctor Norbury he left Mr. Jellicoe without any information as
  to his specific destination, his address in Paris, or the precise date when
  he should return, and that Mr. Jellicoe was unable to tell us where the
  testator went or what was his business. Mr. Jellicoe was, in fact, for a time
  without any means of tracing the testator or ascertaining his
  whereabouts.</p>

  <p>'The evidence of the housemaid, Dobbs, and of Mr. Hurst is rather
  confusing. It appears that the testator came to the house, and when looked
  for later was not to be found. A search of the premises showed that he was
  not in the house, whence it seems to follow that he must have left it; but
  since no one was informed of his intention to leave, and he had expressed the
  intention of staying to see Mr. Hurst, his conduct in thus going away
  surreptitiously must appear somewhat eccentric. The point that you have to
  consider, therefore, is whether a person who is capable of thus departing in
  a surreptitious and eccentric manner from a house, without giving notice to
  the servants, is capable also of departing in a surreptitious and eccentric
  manner from his usual places of resort without giving notice to his friends
  or thereafter informing them of his whereabouts.</p>

  <p>'The questions, then, gentlemen, that you have to ask yourselves before
  deciding on your verdict are two: first, Are the circumstances of the
  testator's disappearance and his continued absence incongruous with his
  habits and personal peculiarities as they are known to you? and second, Are
  there any facts which indicate in a positive manner that the testator is
  dead? Ask yourselves these questions, gentlemen, and the answers to them,
  furnished by the evidence that you have heard, will guide you to your
  decision.'</p>

  <p>Having delivered himself of the above instructions, the judge applied
  himself to the perusal of the will with professional gusto, in which
  occupation he was presently disturbed by the announcement of the foreman of
  the jury that a verdict had been agreed upon.</p>

  <p>The judge sat up and glanced at the jury-box, and when the foreman
  proceeded to state that 'We find no sufficient reason for presuming the
  testator, John Bellingham, to be dead,' he nodded approvingly. Evidently that
  was his opinion, too, as he was careful to explain when he conveyed to Mr.
  Loram the refusal of the Court to grant the permission applied for.</p>

  <p>The decision was a great relief to me, and also, I think, to Miss
  Bellingham; but most of all to her father, who, with instinctive good
  manners, since he could not suppress a smile of triumph, rose and hastily
  stumped out of the Court, so that the discomfited Hurst should not see him.
  His daughter and I followed, and as we left the Court she remarked, with a
  smile:</p>

  <p>'So our pauperism is not, after all, made absolute. There is still a
  chance for us in the Chapter of Accidents&mdash;and perhaps even for poor old
  Uncle John.'</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XV. CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</h3>

  <p>THE morning after the hearing saw me setting forth on my round in more
  than usually good spirits. The round itself was but a short one, for my list
  contained only a couple of 'chronics,' and this, perhaps, contributed to my
  cheerful outlook on life. But there were other reasons. The decision of the
  Court had come as an unexpected reprieve and the ruin of my friends'
  prospects was at least postponed. Then, I had learned that Thorndyke was back
  from Bristol and wished me to look in on him; and, finally, Miss Bellingham
  had agreed to spend this very afternoon with me, browsing round the galleries
  at the British Museum.</p>

  <p>I had disposed of my two patients by a quarter to eleven, and three
  minutes later was striding down Mitre Court, all agog to hear what Thorndyke
  had to say with reference to my notes on the inquest. The 'oak' was open when
  I arrived at his chambers, and a modest flourish on the little brass knocker
  of the inner door was answered by my quondam teacher himself.</p>

  <p>'How good of you, Berkeley,' he said, shaking hands genially, 'to look me
  up so early. I am alone, just looking through the report of the evidence in
  yesterday's proceedings.'</p>

  <p>He placed an easy chair for me, and, gathering up a bundle of typewritten
  papers, laid them aside on the table.</p>

  <p>'Were you surprised at the decision?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'No,' he answered. 'Two years is a short period of absence; but still, it
  might easily have gone the other way. I am greatly relieved. The respite
  gives us time to carry out our investigations without undue hurry.'</p>

  <p>'Did you find my notes of any use?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Heath did. Polton handed them to him, and they were invaluable to him for
  his cross-examination. I haven't seen them yet; in fact, I have only just got
  them back from him. Let us go through them together now.'</p>

  <p>He opened a drawer and taking from it my notebook, seated himself, and
  began to read through my notes with grave attention, while I stood and looked
  shyly over his shoulder. On the page that contained my sketches of the Sidcup
  arm, showing the distribution of the snails' eggs on the bones, he lingered
  with a faint smile that made me turn hot and red.</p>

  <p>'Those sketches look rather footy,' I said; 'but I had to put something in
  my notebook.'</p>

  <p>'You did not attach any importance, then, to the facts that they
  illustrated?'</p>

  <p>'No. The egg-patches were there, so I noted the fact. That's all.'</p>

  <p>'I congratulate you, Berkeley. There is not one man in twenty who would
  have had the sense to make a careful note of what he considers an unimportant
  or irrelevant fact; and the investigator who notes only those things that
  appear significant is perfectly useless. He gives himself no material for
  reconsideration. But you don't mean that these egg-patches and worm tubes
  appeared to you to have no significance at all?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, of course, they show the position in which the bones were lying.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly. The arm was lying, fully extended, with the dorsal side
  uppermost. But we also learn from these egg-patches that the hand had been
  separated from the arm before it was thrown into the pond; and there is
  something very remarkable in that.'</p>

  <p>I leaned over his shoulder and gazed at my sketches, amazed at the
  rapidity with which he had reconstructed the limb from my rough drawings of
  the individual bones.</p>

  <p>'I don't quite see how you arrived at it, though,' I said.</p>

  <p>'Well, look at your drawings. The egg-patches are on the dorsal surface of
  the scapula, the humerus, and the bones of the fore-arm. But here you have
  shown six of the bones of the hand: two metacarpals, the os magnum, and three
  phalanges; and they all have egg-patches on the palmar surface. Therefore the
  hand was lying palm upwards.'</p>

  <p>'But the hand may have been pronated.'</p>

  <p>'If you mean pronated in relation to the arm, that is impossible, for the
  position of the egg-patches shows clearly that the bones of the arm were
  lying in the position of supination. Thus the dorsal surface of the arm and
  the palmar surface of the hand respectively were uppermost, which is an
  anatomical impossibility so long as the hand is attached to the arm.'</p>

  <p>'But might not the hand have become detached after lying in the pond some
  time?'</p>

  <p>'No. It could not have been detached until the ligaments had decayed, and
  if it had been separated after the decay of the soft parts, the bones would
  have been thrown into disorder. But the egg-patches are all on the palmar
  surface, showing that the bones were still in their normal relative
  positions. No, Berkeley, that hand was thrown into the pond separately from
  the arm.'</p>

  <p>'But why should it have been?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Ah, there is a very pretty little problem for you to consider. And,
  meantime, let me tell you that your expedition has been a brilliant success.
  You are an excellent observer. Your only fault is that when you have noted
  certain facts you don't seem fully to appreciate their
  significance&mdash;which is merely a matter of inexperience. As to the facts
  that you have collected, several of them are of prime importance.'</p>

  <p>'I am glad you are satisfied,' said I, 'though I don't see that I have
  discovered much excepting those snails' eggs; and they don't seem to have
  advanced matters very much.'</p>

  <p>'A definite fact, Berkeley, is a definite asset. Perhaps we may presently
  find a little space in our Chinese puzzle which this fact of the detached
  hand will just drop into. But, tell me, did you find nothing unexpected or
  suggestive about those bones&mdash;as to their number and condition, for
  instance?'</p>

  <p>'Well, I thought it a little queer that the scapula and clavicle should be
  there. I should have expected him to cut the arm off at the
  shoulder-joint.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Thorndyke; 'so should I; and so it has been done in every case
  of dismemberment that I am acquainted with. To an ordinary person, the arm
  seems to join on to the trunk at the shoulder-joint, and that is where he
  would naturally sever it. What explanation do you suggest of this unusual
  mode of severing the arm?'</p>

  <p>'Do you think the fellow could have been a butcher?' I asked, remembering
  Dr. Summers' remark. 'This is the way a shoulder of mutton is taken off.'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Thorndyke. 'A butcher includes the scapula in a shoulder of
  mutton for a specific purpose, namely, to take off a given quantity of meat.
  And also, as a sheep has no clavicle, it is the easiest way to detach the
  limb. But I imagine a butcher would find himself in difficulties if he
  attempted to take off a man's arm in that way. The clavicle would be a new
  and perplexing feature. Then, too a butcher does not deal very delicately
  with his subject; if he has to divide a joint, he just cuts through it and
  does not trouble himself to avoid marking the bones. But you note here that
  there is not a single scratch or score on any one of the bones, not even
  where the finger was removed. Now, if you have ever prepared bones for a
  museum, as I have, you will remember the extreme care that is necessary in
  disarticulating joints to avoid disfiguring the articular ends of the bones
  with cuts and scratches.'</p>

  <p>'Then you think that the person who dismembered this body must have had
  some anatomical knowledge and skill?'</p>

  <p>'That is what has been suggested. The suggestion is not mine.'</p>

  <p>'Then I infer that you don't agree?'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled. 'I am sorry to be so cryptic, Berkeley, but you
  understand that I can't make statements. Still, I am trying to lead you to
  make certain inferences from the facts that are in your possession.'</p>

  <p>'If I make the right inference, will you tell me?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'It won't be necessary,' he answered, with the same quiet smile. 'When you
  have fitted the puzzle together you don't need to be told you have done
  it.'</p>

  <p>It was most infernally tantalising. I pondered on the problem with a scowl
  of such intense cogitation that Thorndyke laughed outright.</p>

  <p>'It seems to me,' I said, at length, 'that the identity of the remains is
  the primary question and that it is a question of fact. It doesn't seem any
  use to speculate about it.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly. Either these bones are the remains of John Bellingham or they
  are not. There will be no doubt on the subject when all the bones are
  assembled&mdash;if ever they are. And the settlement of that question will
  probably throw light on the further question: Who deposited them in the
  places in which they were found? But to return to your observations: did you
  gather nothing from the other bones? From the complete state of the neck
  vertebrae, for instance?'</p>

  <p>'Well, it did strike me as rather odd that the fellow should have gone to
  the trouble of separating the atlas from the skull. He must have been pretty
  handy with the scalpel to have done it as cleanly as he seems to have done;
  but I don't see why he should have gone about the business in the most
  inconvenient way.'</p>

  <p>'You notice the uniformity of method. He has separated the head from the
  spine, instead of cutting through the spine lower down, as most persons would
  have done: he removed the arms with the entire shoulder-girdle, instead of
  simply cutting them off at the shoulder-joints. Even in the thighs the same
  peculiarity appears; for in neither case was the knee-cap found with the
  thigh-bone, although it seems to have been searched for. Now the obvious way
  to divide the leg is to cut through the patellar ligament, leaving the
  knee-cap attached to the thigh. But in this case, the knee-cap appears to
  have been left attached to the shank. Can you explain why this person should
  have adopted this unusual and rather inconvenient method? Can you suggest a
  motive for this procedure, or can you think of any circumstances which might
  lead a person to adopt this method by preference?'</p>

  <p>'It seems as if he wished, for some reason, to divide the body into
  definite anatomical regions.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled. 'You are not offering that suggestion as an
  explanation, are you? Because it would require more explaining than the
  original problem. And it is not even true. Anatomically speaking, the
  knee-cap appertains to the thigh rather than to the shank. It is a sesamoid
  bone belonging to the thigh muscles; yet in this case it has been left
  attached, apparently, to the shank. No, Berkeley, that cat won't jump. Our
  unknown operator was not preparing a skeleton as a museum specimen; he was
  dividing a body up into convenient sized portions for the purpose of
  conveying them to various ponds. Now what circumstances might have led him to
  divide it in this peculiar manner?'</p>

  <p>'I am afraid I have no suggestion to offer. Have you?'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke suddenly lapsed into ambiguity. 'I think,' he said, 'it is
  possible to conceive such circumstances, and so, probably, will you if you
  think it over.'</p>

  <p>'Did you gather anything of importance from the evidence at the inquest?'
  I asked.</p>

  <p>'It is difficult to say,' he replied. 'The whole of my conclusions in this
  case are based on what is virtually circumstantial evidence. I have not one
  single fact of which I can say that it admits only of a single
  interpretation. Still, it must be remembered that even the most inconclusive
  facts, if sufficiently multiplied, yield a highly conclusive total. And my
  little pile of evidence is growing, particle by particle; but we mustn't sit
  here gossiping at this hour of the day; I have to consult with Marchmont and
  you say that you have an early afternoon engagement. We can walk together as
  far as Fleet Street.'</p>

  <p>A minute or two later we went our respective ways, Thorndyke towards
  Lombard Street and I to Fetter Lane, not unmindful of those coming events
  that were casting so agreeable a shadow before them.</p>

  <p>There was only one message awaiting me, and when Adolphus had delivered it
  (amidst mephitic fumes that rose from the basement, premonitory of fried
  plaice), I pocketed my stethoscope and betook myself to Gunpowder Alley, the
  aristocratic abode of my patient, joyfully threading the now familiar
  passages of Gough Square and Wine Office Court, and meditating pleasantly on
  the curious literary flavour that pervades these little-known regions. For
  the shade of the author of 'Rasselas' still seems to haunt the scenes of his
  Titanic labours and his ponderous but homely and temperate rejoicings. Every
  court and alley whispers of books and of the making of books: formes of type,
  trundled noisily on trolleys by ink-smeared boys, salute the wayfarer at odd
  corners; piles of strawboard, rolls or bales of paper, drums of printing-ink
  or roller composition stand on the pavement outside dark entries; basement
  windows give glimpses into Hadean caverns tenanted by legions of printer's
  devils; and the very air is charged with the hum of press and with odours of
  glue and paste and oil. The entire neighbourhood is given up to the printer
  and binder; and even my patient turned out to be a guillotine-knife
  grinder&mdash;a ferocious and revolutionary calling strangely at variance
  with his harmless appearance and meek bearing.</p>

  <p>I was in good time at my tryst, despite the hindrances of fried plaice and
  invalid guillotinists; but, early as I was, Miss Bellingham was already
  waiting in the garden&mdash;she had been filling a bowl with
  flowers&mdash;ready to sally forth.</p>

  <p>'It is quite like old times,' she said, as we turned into Fetter Lane, 'to
  be going to the Museum together. It brings back the Tell el Amarna tablets
  and all your kindness and unselfish labour, suppose we shall walk there
  to-day?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly,' I replied; 'I am not going to share your society with the
  common mortals who ride in omnibuses. That would be sheer, simple waste.
  Besides, it is more companionable to walk.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, it is; and the bustle of the streets makes one more appreciative of
  the quiet of the Museum. What are we going to look at when we get there?'</p>

  <p>'You must decide that,' I replied. 'You know the collection much better
  than I do.'</p>

  <p>'Well, now,' she mused, 'I wonder what you would like to see; or, in other
  words, what I should like you to see. The old English pottery is rather
  fascinating, especially the Fulham ware. I rather think I shall take you to
  see that.'</p>

  <p>She reflected a while, and then, just as we reached the gate of Staple
  Inn, she stopped and looked thoughtfully down the Gray's Inn Road.</p>

  <p>'You have taken a great interest in our "case" as Doctor Thorndyke calls
  it. Would you like to see the churchyard where Uncle John wished to be
  buried? It is a little out of our way, but we are not in a hurry, are
  we?'</p>

  <p>I, certainly, was not. Any deviation that might prolong our walk was
  welcome, and, as to the place&mdash;why, all places were alike to me if only
  she were by my side. Besides, the churchyard was really of some interest,
  since it was undoubtedly the 'exciting cause' of the obnoxious paragraph two
  of the will. I accordingly expressed a desire to make its acquaintance, and
  we crossed to the entrance to Gray's Inn Road.</p>

  <p>'Do you ever try,' she asked, as we turned down the dingy thoroughfare,
  'to picture familiar places as they looked a couple of hundred years
  ago?'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I answered, 'and very difficult I find it. One has to manufacture
  the materials for reconstruction, and then the present aspect of the place
  will keep obtruding itself. But some places are easier to reconstitute than
  others.'</p>

  <p>'That is what I find,' said she. 'Now Holborn, for example, is quite easy
  to reconstruct, though I daresay the imaginary form isn't a bit like the
  original. But there are fragments left, like Staple Inn and the front of
  Gray's Inn; and then one has seen prints of the old Middle Row and some of
  the taverns, so that one has some material with which to help out one's
  imagination. But this road we are walking in always baffles me. It looks so
  old and yet is, for the most part, so new that I find it impossible to make a
  satisfactory picture of its appearance, say, when Sir Roger de Coverley might
  have strolled in Gray's Inn Walks, or farther back, when Francis Bacon had
  chambers in the Inn.'</p>

  <p>'I imagine,' said I, 'that part of the difficulty is in the mixed
  character of the neighbourhood. Here, on the one side, is old Gray's Inn, not
  much changed since Bacon's time&mdash;his chambers are still to be seen, I
  think, over the gateway; and there, on the Clerkenwell side, is a dense and
  rather squalid neighbourhood which has grown up over a region partly rural
  and wholly fugitive in character. Places like Bagnigge Wells and Hockley in
  the Hole would not have had many buildings that were likely to survive; and
  in the absence of surviving specimens the imagination hasn't much to work
  from.'</p>

  <p>'I daresay you are right,' said she. 'Certainly, the purlieus of old
  Clerkenwell present a very confused picture to me; whereas, in the case of an
  old street like, say, Great Ormond Street, one has only to sweep away the
  modern buildings and replace them with glorious old houses like the few that
  remain, dig up the roadway and pavements and lay down cobble-stones, plant a
  few wooden posts, hang up one or two oil-lamps, and the transformation is
  complete. And a very delightful transformation it is.'</p>

  <p>'Very delightful; which, by the way, is a melancholy thought. For we ought
  to be doing better work than our forefathers; whereas what we actually do is
  to pull down the old buildings, clap the doorways, porticoes, panelling, and
  mantels in our museums, and then run up something inexpensive and useful and
  deadly uninteresting in their place.'</p>

  <p>My companion looked at me and laughed softly. 'For a naturally cheerful,
  and even gay young man,' said she, 'you are most amazingly pessimistic. The
  mantle of Jeremiah&mdash;if he ever wore one&mdash;seems to have fallen on
  you, but without in the least impairing-your good spirits excepting in regard
  to matters architectural.'</p>

  <p>'I have much to be thankful for,' said I. 'Am I not taken to the Museum by
  a fair lady? And does she not stay me with mummy cases and comfort me with
  crockery?'</p>

  <p>'Pottery,' she corrected; and then as we met a party of grave-looking
  women emerging from a side-street, she said: 'I suppose these are lady
  medical students.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, on their way to the Royal Free Hospital. Note the gravity of their
  demeanour and contrast it with the levity of the male student.'</p>

  <p>'I was doing so,' she answered, 'and wondering why professional women are
  usually so much more serious than men.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' I suggested, 'it is a matter of selection. A peculiar type of
  woman is attracted to the professions, whereas every man has to earn his
  living as a matter of course.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I daresay that is the explanation. This is our turning.'</p>

  <p>We passed into Heathcote Street, at the end of which was an open gate
  giving entrance to one of those disused and metamorphosed burial-grounds that
  are to be met with in the older districts of London; in which the
  dispossessed dead are jostled into corners to make room for the living. Many
  of the headstones were still standing, and others, displaced to make room for
  asphalted walks and seats, were ranged around by the walls exhibiting
  inscriptions made meaningless by their removal. It was a pleasant enough
  place on this summer afternoon, contrasted with the dingy streets whence we
  had come, though its grass was faded and yellow and the twitter of the birds
  in the trees mingled with the hideous Board-school drawl of the children who
  played around the seats and the few remaining tombs.</p>

  <p>'So this is the last resting-place of the illustrious house of
  Bellingham,' said I.</p>

  <p>'Yes; and we are not the only distinguished people who repose in this
  place. The daughter of no less a person than Richard Cromwell is buried here;
  the tomb is still standing&mdash;but perhaps you have been here before, and
  know it.'</p>

  <p>'I don't think I have ever been here before; and yet there is something
  about the place that seems familiar.' I looked around, cudgelling my brains
  for the key to the dimly reminiscent sensations that the place evoked; until,
  suddenly, I caught sight of a group of buildings away to the west, enclosed
  within a wall heightened by a wooden trellis.</p>

  <p>'Yes, of course!' I exclaimed. 'I remember the place now. I have never
  been in this part before, but in that enclosure beyond, which opens at the
  end of Henrietta Street, there used to be and may be still, for all I know, a
  school of anatomy, at which I attended in my first year; in fact, I did my
  first dissection there.'</p>

  <p>'There was a certain gruesome appropriateness in the position of the
  school,' remarked Miss Bellingham. 'It would have been really convenient in
  the days of the resurrection men. Your material would have been delivered at
  your very door. Was it a large school?'</p>

  <p>'The attendance varied according to the time of the year. Sometimes I
  worked there quite alone. I used to let myself in with a key and hoist my
  subject out of a sort of sepulchral tank by means of a chain tackle. It was a
  ghoulish business. You have no idea how awful the body used to look to my
  unaccustomed eyes, as it rose slowly out of the tank. It was like the
  resurrection scenes that you see on some old tombstones, where the deceased
  is shown rising out of his coffin while the skeleton, Death, falls vanquished
  with his dart shattered and his crown toppling off.</p>

  <p>'I remember, too, that the demonstrator used to wear a blue apron, which
  created a sort of impression of a cannibal butcher's shop. But I am afraid I
  am shocking you.'</p>

  <p>'No you are not. Every profession has its unpresentable aspects, which
  ought not to be seen by outsiders. Think of the sculptor's studio and of the
  sculptor himself when he is modelling a large figure or group in the clay. He
  might be a bricklayer or a road-sweeper if you judge by his appearance. This
  is the tomb I was telling you about.'</p>

  <p>We halted before the plain coffer of stone, weathered and wasted by age,
  but yet kept in decent repair by some pious hands, and read the inscription,
  setting forth with modest pride, that here reposed Anna, sixth daughter of
  Richard Cromwell, 'The Protector.' It was a simple monument and commonplace
  enough, with the crude severity of the ascetic age to which it belonged. But
  still, it carried the mind back to those stirring times when the leafy shades
  of Gray's Inn Lane must have resounded with the clank of weapons and the
  tramp of armed men; when this bald recreation-ground was a rustic churchyard,
  standing amidst green fields and hedgerows, and countrymen leading their
  pack-horses into London through the Lane would stop to look in over the
  wooden gate.</p>

  <p>Miss Bellingham looked at me critically as I stood thus reflecting, and
  presently remarked: 'I think you and I have a good many mental habits in
  common.'</p>

  <p>'I looked up inquiringly, and she continued: 'I notice that an old
  tombstone seems to set you meditating. So it does me. When I look at an
  ancient monument, and especially an old headstone, I find myself almost
  unconsciously retracing the years to the date that is written on the stone.
  Why do you think that is? Why should a monument be so stimulating to the
  imagination? And why should a common headstone be more so than any
  other?'</p>

  <p>'I suppose it is,' I answered reflectively, 'that a churchyard monument is
  a peculiarly personal thing and appertains in a peculiar way to a particular
  time. And the circumstance that it has stood untouched by the passing years
  while everything around has changed, helps the imagination to span the
  interval. And the common headstone, the memorial of some dead and gone farmer
  or labourer who lived and died in the village hard by, is still more intimate
  and suggestive. The rustic, childish sculpture of the village mason and the
  artless doggerel of the village schoolmaster, bring back the time and place
  and the conditions of life more vividly than the more scholarly inscriptions
  and the more artistic enrichments of monuments of greater pretensions. But
  where are your own family tombstones?'</p>

  <p>'They are over in that farther corner. There is an intelligent, but
  inopportune, person apparently copying the epitaphs. I wish he would go away.
  I want to show them to you.'</p>

  <p>I now noticed, for the first time, an individual engaged, notebook in
  hand, in making a careful survey of a group of old headstones. Evidently he
  was making a copy of the inscriptions, for not only was he poring attentively
  over the writing on the face of the stone, but now and again he helped out
  his vision by running his fingers over the worn lettering.</p>

  <p>'That is my grandfather's tombstone that he is copying now,' said Miss
  Bellingham; and even as she spoke, the man turned and directed a searching
  glance at us with a pair of keen, spectacled eyes.</p>

  <p>Simultaneously we uttered an exclamation of surprise; for the investigator
  was Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XVI. O ARTEMIDORUS, FAREWELL!</h3>

  <p>WHETHER or not Mr. Jellicoe was surprised to see us, it is impossible to
  say. His countenance (which served the ordinary purposes of a face, inasmuch
  as it contained the principal organs of special sense, with inlets to the
  alimentary and respiratory tracts) was, as an apparatus for the expression of
  the emotions, a total failure. To a thought-reader it would have been about
  as helpful as the face carved upon the handle of an umbrella; a comparison
  suggested, perhaps, by a certain resemblance to such an object. He advanced,
  holding open his notebook and pencil, and having saluted us with a stiff bow
  and an old-fashioned flourish of his hat, shook hands rheumatically and
  waited for us to speak.</p>

  <p>'This is an unexpected pleasure, Mr. Jellicoe,' said Miss Bellingham.</p>

  <p>'It is very good of you to say so,' he replied.</p>

  <p>'And quite a coincidence&mdash;that we should all happen to come here on
  the same day.'</p>

  <p>'A coincidence, certainly,' he admitted, 'and if we all happened not to
  come&mdash;which must have occurred frequently&mdash;that also would have
  been a coincidence.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose it would,' said she, 'but I hope we are not interrupting
  you.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, no. I had just finished when I had the pleasure of perceiving
  you.'</p>

  <p>You were making some notes in reference to the case, I imagine,' said I.
  It was an impertinent question, put with malice aforethought for the mere
  pleasure of hearing him evade it.</p>

  <p>'The case?' he repeated. 'You are referring, perhaps, to Stevens versus
  the Parish Council?'</p>

  <p>'I think Doctor Berkeley was referring to the case of my uncle's will,'
  Miss Bellingham said quite gravely, though with a suspicious dimpling about
  the corners of her mouth.</p>

  <p>'Indeed,' said Mr. Jellicoe. 'There is a case, is there; a suit?'</p>

  <p>'I mean the proceedings instituted by Mr. Hurst.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, but that was merely an application to the Court, and is, moreover,
  finished and done with. At least, so I understand. I speak, of course,
  subject to correction; I am not acting for Mr. Hurst, you will be pleased to
  remember. As a matter of fact,' he continued, after a brief pause, 'I was
  just refreshing my memory as to the wording of the inscriptions on these
  stones, especially that of your grandfather, Francis Bellingham. It has
  occurred to me that if it should appear by the finding of the coroner's jury
  that your uncle is deceased, it would be proper and decorous that some
  memorial should be placed here. But, as the burial ground is closed, there
  might be some difficulty about erecting a new monument, whereas there would
  probably be none in adding an inscription to one already existing. Hence
  these investigations. For if the inscriptions on your grandfather's stone had
  set forth that "here rests the body of Francis Bellingham," it would have
  been manifestly improper to add "also that of John Bellingham, son of the
  above". Fortunately the inscription was more discreetly drafted, merely
  recording the fact that this monument is "sacred to the memory of the said
  Francis", and not committing itself as to the whereabouts of the remains. But
  perhaps I am interrupting you.'</p>

  <p>'No, not at all,' replied Miss Bellingham (which was grossly untrue; he
  was interrupting me most intolerably); 'we were going to the British Museum
  and just looked in here on our way.'</p>

  <p>'Ha,' said Mr. Jellicoe, 'now, I happen to be going to the Museum too, to
  see Doctor Norbury. I suppose that is another coincidence?'</p>

  <p>'Certainly it is,' Miss Bellingham replied; and then she asked: 'Shall we
  walk together?' and the old curmudgeon actually said 'yes'&mdash;confound
  him!</p>

  <p>We returned to the Gray's Inn Road, where, as there was now room for us to
  walk abreast, I proceeded to indemnify myself for the lawyer's unwelcome
  company by leading the conversation back to the subject of the missing
  man.</p>

  <p>'Was there anything, Mr. Jellicoe, in Mr. John Bellingham's state of
  health that would make it probable that he might die suddenly?'</p>

  <p>The lawyer looked at me suspiciously for a few moments and then
  remarked:</p>

  <p>'You seem to be greatly interested in John Bellingham and his
  affairs.'</p>

  <p>'I am. My friends are deeply concerned in them, and the case itself is of
  more than common interest from a professional point of view.'</p>

  <p>'And what is the bearing of this particular question?'</p>

  <p>'Surely it is obvious,' said I. 'If a missing man is known to have
  suffered from some affection, such as heart disease, aneurism, or arterial
  degeneration, likely to produce sudden death, that fact will surely be highly
  material to the question as to whether he is probably dead or alive.'</p>

  <p>'No doubt you are right,' said Mr. Jellicoe. 'I have little knowledge of
  medical affairs, but doubtless you are right. As to the question itself, I am
  Mr. Bellingham's lawyer, not his doctor. His health is a matter that lies
  outside my jurisdiction. But you heard my evidence in Court, to the effect
  that the testator appeared, to my untutored observation, to be a healthy man.
  I can say no more now.'</p>

  <p>'If the question is of any importance,' said Miss Bellingham, 'I wonder
  they did not call his doctor and settle it definitely. My own impression is
  that he was&mdash;or is&mdash;rather a strong and sound man. He certainly
  recovered very quickly and completely after his accident.'</p>

  <p>'What accident was that?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Oh, hasn't my father told you? It occurred while he was staying with us.
  He slipped from a kerb and broke one of the bones of the left
  ankle&mdash;somebody's fracture&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Pott's?'</p>

  <p>'Yes; that was the name&mdash;Pott's fracture; and he broke both his
  knee-caps as well. Sir Morgan Bennet had to perform an operation, or he would
  have been a cripple for life. As it was, he was about again in a few weeks,
  apparently none the worse excepting for a slight weakness of the left
  ankle.'</p>

  <p>'Could he walk upstairs?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Oh, yes; and play golf and ride a bicycle.'</p>

  <p>'You are sure he broke both knee-caps?'</p>

  <p>'Quite sure. I remember that it was mentioned as an uncommon injury, and
  that Sir Morgan seemed quite pleased with him for doing it.'</p>

  <p>'That sounds rather libellous; but I expect he was pleased with the result
  of the operation. He might well be.'</p>

  <p>Here there was a brief lull in the conversation, and, even as I was trying
  to think of a poser for Mr. Jellicoe, that gentleman took the opportunity to
  change the subject.</p>

  <p>'Are you going to the Egyptian rooms?' he asked.</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Miss Bellingham; 'we are going to look at the pottery.'</p>

  <p>'Ancient or modern?'</p>

  <p>'That old Fulham ware is what chiefly interests us at present; that of the
  seventeenth century. I don't know whether you call that ancient or
  modern.'</p>

  <p>'Neither do I,' said Mr. Jellicoe. 'Antiquity and modernity are terms that
  have no fixed connotation. They are purely relative and their application in
  a particular instance has to be determined by a sort of sliding-scale. To a
  furniture collector, a Tudor chair or a Jacobean chest is ancient; to an
  architect, their period is modern, whereas an eleventh-century church is
  ancient; but to an Egyptologist, accustomed to remains of a vast antiquity,
  both are products of modern periods separated by an insignificant interval.
  And, I suppose,' he added reflectively, 'that to a geologist, the traces of
  the very earliest dawn of human history appertain only to the recent period.
  Conceptions of time, like all other conceptions, are relative.'</p>

  <p>'You would appear to be a disciple of Herbert Spencer,' I remarked.</p>

  <p>'I am a disciple of Arthur Jellicoe, sir,' he retorted. And I believed
  him.</p>

  <p>By the time we had reached the Museum he had become almost genial; and, if
  less amusing in this frame, he was so much more instructive and entertaining
  that I refrained from baiting him, and permitted him to discuss his favourite
  topic unhindered, especially since my companion listened with lively
  interest. Nor, when we entered the great hall, did he relinquish possession
  of us, and we followed submissively, as he led the way past the winged bulls
  of Nineveh and the great seated statues, until we found ourselves, almost
  without the exercise of our volition, in the upper room amidst the glaring
  mummy cases that had witnessed the birth of my friendship with Ruth
  Bellingham.</p>

  <p>'Before I leave you,' said Mr. Jellicoe, 'I should like to show you that
  mummy that we were discussing the other evening; the one, you remember, that
  my friend, John Bellingham, presented to the Museum a little time before his
  disappearance. The point that I mentioned is only a trivial one, but it may
  become of interest hereafter if any plausible explanation should be
  forthcoming.' He led us along the room until we arrived at the case
  containing John Bellingham's gift, where he halted and gazed in at the mummy
  with the affectionate reflectiveness of the connoisseur.</p>

  <p>'The bitumen coating was what we were discussing, Miss Bellingham,' said
  he. 'You have seen it, of course.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she answered. 'It is a dreadful disfigurement, isn't it?'</p>

  <p>'Aesthetically it is to be deplored, but it adds a certain speculative
  interest to the specimen. You notice that the black coating leaves the
  principal decoration and the whole of the inscription untouched, which is
  precisely the part that one would expect to find covered up; whereas the feet
  and the back, which probably bore no writing, are quite thickly crusted. If
  you stoop down, you can see that the bitumen was daubed freely into the
  lacings of the back, where it served no purpose, so that even the strings are
  embedded.' He stooped as he spoke, and peered up inquisitively at the back of
  the mummy, where it was visible between the supports.</p>

  <p>'Has Doctor Norbury any explanation to offer?' asked Miss Bellingham.</p>

  <p>'None whatever,' replied Mr. Jellicoe. 'He finds it as great a mystery as
  I do. But he thinks that we may get some suggestion from the Director when he
  comes back. He is a very great authority, as you know, and a practical
  excavator of great experience too. I mustn't stay here talking of these
  things, and keeping you from your pottery. Perhaps I have stayed too long
  already. If I have I ask your pardon, and I will now wish you a very good
  afternoon.' With a sudden return to his customary wooden impassivity, he
  shook hands with us, bowed stiffly, and took himself off towards the
  curator's office.</p>

  <p>'What a strange man that is,' said Miss Bellingham, as Mr. Jellicoe
  disappeared through the doorway at the end of the room, 'or perhaps I should
  say, a strange being, for I can hardly think of him as a man. I have never
  met any other human creature at all like him.'</p>

  <p>'He is certainly a queer old fogey,' I agreed.</p>

  <p>'Yes, but there is something more than that. He is so emotionless, so
  remote and aloof from all mundane concerns. He moves among ordinary men and
  women, but as a mere presence, an unmoved spectator of their actions, quite
  dispassionate and impersonal.'</p>

  <p>'Yes; he is astonishingly self-contained; in fact, he seems, as you say,
  to go to and fro among men, enveloped in a sort of infernal atmosphere of his
  own, like Marley's ghost. But he is lively and human enough as soon as the
  subject of Egyptian antiquities is broached.'</p>

  <p>'Lively, but not human. He is always, to me, quite unhuman. Even when he
  is most interested, and even enthusiastic, he is a mere personification of
  knowledge. Nature ought to have furnished him with an ibis' head like Tahuti;
  then he would have looked his part.'</p>

  <p>'He would have made a rare sensation in Lincoln's Inn if he had,' said I;
  and we both laughed heartily at the imaginary picture of Tahuti Jellicoe,
  slender-beaked and top-hatted, going about his business in Lincoln's Inn and
  the Law Courts.</p>

  <p>Insensibly, as we talked, we had drawn near to the mummy of Artemidorus,
  and now my companion halted before the case with her thoughtful grey eyes
  bent dreamily on the face that looked out at us. I watched her with reverent
  admiration. How charming she looked as she stood with her sweet, grave face
  turned so earnestly to the object of her mystical affection! How dainty and
  full of womanly dignity and grace! And then, suddenly it was borne in upon me
  that a great change had come over her since the day of our first meeting. She
  had grown younger, more girlish, and more gentle. At first she had seemed
  much older than I; a sad-faced woman, weary, solemn, enigmatic, almost
  gloomy, with a bitter, ironic humour and a bearing distant and cold. Now she
  was only maidenly and sweet; tinged, it is true, with a certain seriousness,
  but frank and gracious and wholly lovable.</p>

  <p>Could the change be due to our friendship? As I asked myself the question,
  my heart leaped with a new hope. I yearned to tell her all that she was to
  me&mdash;all that I hoped we might be to one another in the years to
  come.</p>

  <p>At length I ventured to break in upon her reverie.</p>

  <p>'What are you thinking about so earnestly, fair lady?'</p>

  <p>She turned quickly with a bright smile and sparkling eyes that looked
  frankly into mine. 'I was wondering,' said she, 'if he was jealous of my new
  friend. But what a baby I am to talk such nonsense!'</p>

  <p>She laughed softly and happily with just an adorable hint of shyness.</p>

  <p>'Why should he be jealous?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Well, you see, before&mdash;we were friends, he had me all to himself. I
  have never had a man friend before&mdash;except my father&mdash;and no really
  intimate friend at all. And I was very lonely in those days, after our
  troubles had befallen. I am naturally solitary, but still, I am only a girl;
  I am not a philosopher. So when I felt very lonely, I used to come here and
  look at Artemidorus and make believe that he knew all the sadness of my life
  and sympathised with me. It was very silly, I know, but yet, somehow it was a
  real comfort to me.'</p>

  <p>'It was not silly of you at all. He must have been a good man, a gentle,
  sweet-faced man who had won the love of those who knew him, as this beautiful
  memorial tells; and it was wise and good of you to sweeten the bitterness of
  your life with the fragrance of this human love that blossoms in the dust
  after the lapse of centuries. No, you were not silly, and Artemidorus is not
  jealous of your new friend.'</p>

  <p>'Are you sure?' She still smiled as she asked the question, but was
  soft&mdash;almost tender&mdash;and there was a note of whimsical anxiety in
  her voice.</p>

  <p>'Quite sure. I give you my confident assurance.' She laughed gaily.</p>

  <p>'Then,' said she, 'I am satisfied, for I am sure you know. But here is a
  mighty telepathist who can read the thoughts even of a mummy. A most
  formidable companion. But tell me how you know.'</p>

  <p>'I know because it is he who gave you to me to be my friend. Don't you
  remember?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I remember,' she answered softly. 'It was when you were so
  sympathetic with my foolish whim that I felt we were really friends.'</p>

  <p>'And I, when you confided your pretty fancy to me, thanked you for the
  gift of your friendship, and treasured it, and do still treasure it, above
  everything on earth.'</p>

  <p>She looked at me quickly with a sort of nervousness in her manner, and
  cast down her eyes. Then, after a few moments' almost embarrassed silence, as
  if to bring back our talk to a less emotional plane, she said:</p>

  <p>'Do you notice the curious way in which this memorial divides itself up
  into two parts?'</p>

  <p>'How do you mean?' I asked, a little disconcerted by the sudden
  descent.</p>

  <p>'I mean that there is a part of it that is purely decorative and a part
  that is expressive or emotional. You notice that the general design and
  scheme of decoration, although really Greek in feeling, follows rigidly the
  Egyptian conventions. But the portrait is entirely in the Greek manner, and
  when they came to that pathetic farewell, it had to be spoken in their own
  tongue, written in their own familiar characters.'</p>

  <p>'Yes. I have noticed that and admired the taste with which they have kept
  the inscription so inconspicuous as not to clash with the decoration. An
  obtrusive inscription in Greek characters would have spoiled the consistency
  of the whole scheme.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, it would.' She assented absently as if she were thinking of
  something else, and once more gazed thoughtfully at the mummy. I watched her
  with deep content: noted the lovely contour of her cheek, the soft masses of
  hair that strayed away so gracefully from her brow, and thought her the most
  wonderful creature that had ever trod the earth. Suddenly she looked at me
  reflectively.</p>

  <p>'I wonder,' she said, 'what made me tell you about Artemidorus. It was a
  rather silly, childish sort of make-believe, and I wouldn't have told anyone
  else for the world; not even my father. How did I know that you would
  sympathise and understand?'</p>

  <p>She asked the question in all simplicity with her serious grey eyes
  looking inquiringly into mine. And the answer came to me in a flash, with the
  beating of my own heart.</p>

  <p>'I will tell you how you know, Ruth,' I whispered passionately. 'It was
  because I loved you more than anyone else in the world has ever loved you,
  and you felt my love in your heart and called it sympathy.'</p>

  <p>I stopped short, for she had blushed scarlet, and then turned deathly
  pale. And now she looked at me wildly, almost with terror.</p>

  <p>'Have I shocked you, Ruth dearest?' I exclaimed penitently, 'have I spoken
  too soon? If I have, forgive me. But I had to tell you. I have been eating my
  heart out for love of you for I don't know how long. I think I have loved you
  from the first day we met. Perhaps I shouldn't have spoken yet, but, Ruth
  dear, if you only knew what a sweet girl you are, you wouldn't blame me.'</p>

  <p>'I don't blame you,' she said, almost in a whisper; 'I blame myself. I
  have been a bad friend to you, who have been so loyal and loving to me. I
  ought not to have let this happen. For it can't be, Paul; I can't say what
  you want me to say. We can never be anything more to one another than
  friends.'</p>

  <p>A cold hand seemed to grasp my heart&mdash;a horrible fear that I had lost
  all that I cared for&mdash;all that made life desirable.</p>

  <p>'Why can't we?' I asked. 'Do you mean that&mdash;that the gods have been
  gracious to some other man?'</p>

  <p>'No, no,' she answered hastily&mdash;almost indignantly, 'of course I
  don't mean that.'</p>

  <p>'Then it is only that you don't love me yet. Of course you don't. Why
  should you? But you will, dear, some day. And I will wait patiently until
  that day comes and not trouble you with entreaties. I will wait for you as
  Jacob waited for Rachel; and as the long years seemed to him but as a few
  days because of the love he bore her, so it shall be with me, if only you
  will not send me away quite without hope.'</p>

  <p>She was looking down, white-faced, with a hardening of the lips as if she
  were in bodily pain. 'You don't understand,' she whispered. It can't
  be&mdash;it can never be. There is something that makes it impossible, now
  and always. I can't tell you more than that.'</p>

  <p>But, Ruth dearest,' I pleaded despairingly, 'may it not become possible
  some day? Can it not be made possible? I can wait, but I can't give you up.
  Is there no chance whatever that this obstacle may be removed?'</p>

  <p>'Very little, I fear. Hardly any. No, Paul; it is hopeless, and I can't
  bear to talk about it. Let me go now. Let us say good-bye here and see one
  another no more for a while. Perhaps we may be friends again some
  day&mdash;when you have forgiven me.'</p>

  <p>'Forgiven you, dearest!' I exclaimed. 'There is nothing to forgive. And we
  are friends, Ruth. Whatever happens, you are the dearest friend I have on
  earth, or can ever have.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you, Paul,' she said faintly. 'You are very good to me. But let me
  go, please. I must be alone.'</p>

  <p>4 She held out a trembling hand, and, as I took it, I was shocked to see
  how terribly agitated and ill she looked.</p>

  <p>'May I not come with you, dear?' I pleaded.</p>

  <p>'No, no!' she exclaimed breathlessly; 'I must go away by myself. I want to
  be alone. Good-bye.'</p>

  <p>'Before I let you go, Ruth&mdash;if you must go&mdash;I must have a most
  solemn promise from you.'</p>

  <p>Her sad grey eyes met mine and her lips quivered with an unspoken
  question.</p>

  <p>'You must promise me,' I went on, 'that if ever this barrier that parts us
  should be removed, you will let me know instantly. Remember that I love you
  always, and that I am waiting for you always on this side of the grave.'</p>

  <p>She caught her breath in a quick little sob, and pressed my hand.</p>

  <p>'Yes,' she whispered: 'I promise. Good-bye.'</p>

  <p>She pressed my hand again and was gone; and, as I gazed at the empty
  doorway through which she had passed, I caught a glimpse of her reflection in
  a glass on the landing, where she had paused for a moment to wipe her eyes. I
  felt it, in a manner, indelicate to have seen her, and turned away my head
  quickly; and yet I was conscious of a certain selfish satisfaction in the
  sweet sympathy that her grief bespoke.</p>

  <p>But now that she was gone a horrible sense of desolation descended on me.
  Only now, by the consciousness of irreparable loss, did I begin to realise
  the meaning of this passion of love that had stolen unawares into my life.
  How it had glorified the present and spread a glamour of delight over the
  dimly considered future: how all pleasures and desires, hopes and ambitions,
  had converged upon it as a focus; how it had stood out as the one great
  reality behind which the other circumstances of life were as a background,
  shimmering, half seen, immaterial and unreal. And now it was gone&mdash;lost,
  as it seemed, beyond hope; and that which was left to me was but the empty
  frame from which the picture had vanished.</p>

  <p>I have no idea how long I stood rooted to the spot where she had left me,
  wrapped in a dull consciousness of pain, immersed in a half-numb reverie.
  Recent events flitted, dream-like, through my mind; our happy labours in the
  reading-room; our first visit to the Museum; and this present day that had
  opened so brightly and with such joyous promise. One by one these phantoms of
  a vanished happiness came and went. Occasional visitors sauntered into the
  room&mdash;but the galleries were mostly empty that day&mdash;gazed
  inquisitively at my motionless figure, and went their way. And still the
  dull, intolerable ache in my breast went on, the only vivid consciousness
  that was left to me.</p>

  <p>Presently I raised my eyes and met those of the portrait. The sweet,
  pensive face of the old Greek settler looked out at me wistfully as though he
  would offer comfort; as though he would tell me that he, too, had known
  sorrow when he lived his life in the sunny Fayyum. And a subtle consolation,
  like the faint scent of old rose leaves, seemed to exhale from that friendly
  face that had looked on the birth of my happiness and had seen it wither and
  fade. I turned away, at last, with a silent farewell; and when I looked back,
  he seemed to speed me on my way with gentle valediction.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XVII. THE ACCUSING FINGER</h3>

  <p>OF my wanderings after I left the Museum on that black and dismal dies
  irie, I have but a dim recollection. But I must have travelled a quite
  considerable distance, since it wanted an hour or two to the time for
  returning to the surgery, and I spent the interval walking swiftly through
  streets and squares, unmindful of the happenings around, intent only on my
  present misfortune, and driven by a natural impulse to seek relief in bodily
  exertion. For mental distress sets up, as it were, a sort of induced current
  of physical unrest; a beneficent arrangement, by which a dangerous excess of
  emotional excitement may be transformed into motor energy, and so safely got
  rid of. The motor apparatus acts as a safety-valve to the psychical; and if
  the engine races for a while, with the onset of a bodily fatigue the
  emotional pressure-gauge returns to a normal reading.</p>

  <p>And so it was with me. At first I was conscious of nothing but a sense of
  utter bereavement, of the shipwreck of all my hopes. But, by degrees, as I
  threaded my way among the moving crowds, I came to a better and more worthy
  frame of mind. After all, I had lost nothing that I had ever had. Ruth was
  still all that she had ever been to me&mdash;perhaps even more; and if that
  had been a rich endowment yesterday, why not to-day also? And how unfair it
  would be to her if I should mope and grieve over a disappointment that was no
  fault of hers and for which there was no remedy! Thus I reasoned with myself,
  and to such purpose that, by the time I reached Fetter Lane, my dejection had
  come to quite manageable proportions and I had formed the resolution to get
  back to the status quo ante helium as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>About eight o'clock, as I was sitting alone in the consulting-room,
  gloomily persuading myself that I was now quite resigned to the inevitable,
  Adolphus brought me a registered packet, at the handwriting on which my heart
  gave such a bound that I had much ado to sign the receipt. As soon as
  Adolphus had retired (with undissembled contempt of the shaky signature) I
  tore open the packet, and as I drew out a letter a tiny box dropped on the
  table.</p>

  <p>The letter was all too short, and I devoured it over and over again with
  the eagerness of a condemned man reading a reprieve:</p>
<br>

  <p class="letter">'<SPAN CLASS="smcap">My Dear Paul</SPAN>.</p>

  <p class="letter">'Forgive me for leaving you so abruptly this afternoon, and leaving you so
  unhappy, too. I am more sane and reasonable now, and so send you greeting and
  beg you not to grieve for that which can never be. It is quite impossible,
  dear friend, and I entreat you, as you care for me, never speak of it again;
  never again to make me feel that I can give you so little when you have given
  so much. And do not try to see me for a little while. I shall miss your
  visits, and so will my father, who is very fond of you; but it is better that
  we should not meet, until we can take up our old relations&mdash;if that can
  ever be.</p>

  <p class="letter">'I am sending you a little keepsake in case we should drift apart on the
  eddies of life. It is the ring that I told you about&mdash;the one that my
  uncle save me. Perhaps you may be able to wear it as you have a small hand,
  but in any case keep it in remembrance of our friendship. The device on it is
  the Eye of Osiris, a mystic symbol for which I have a sentimentally
  superstitious affection, as also had my poor uncle, who actually bore it
  tattooed in scarlet on his breast. It signifies that the great judge of the
  dead looks down on men to see that justice is done and that truth prevails.
  So I commend you to the good Osiris; may his eye be upon you, ever watchful
  over your welfare in the absence of</p>

  <p class="letter">'Your affectionate friend.</p>

  <p class="letter">'<SPAN CLASS="smcap">Ruth</SPAN>.'</p>
<br>

  <p>It was a sweet letter, I thought, even if it carried little comfort; quiet
  and reticent like its writer, but with an undertone of affection. I laid it
  down at length, and, taking the ring from its box, examined it fondly. Though
  but a copy, it had all the quaintness and feeling of the antique original,
  and, above all, it was fragrant with the spirit of the giver. Dainty and
  delicate, wrought of silver and gold, with an inlay of copper, I would not
  have exchanged it for the Koh-i-noor; and when I had slipped it on my finger
  its tiny eye of blue enamel looked up at me so friendly and companionable
  that I felt the glamour of the old-world superstition stealing over me
  too.</p>

  <p>Not a single patient came in this evening, which was well for me (and also
  for the patient), as I was able forthwith to write in reply a long letter;
  but this I shall spare the long-suffering reader excepting its concluding
  paragraph:</p>
<br>

  <p class="letter">'And now, dearest, I have said my say; once for all I have said it, and I
  will not open my mouth on the subject again (I am not actually opening it
  now) "until the times do alter". And if the times do never alter&mdash;if it
  shall come to pass, in due course, that we two shall sit side by side,
  white-haired, and crinkly-nosed, and lean our poor old chins upon our sticks
  and mumble and gibber amicably over the things that might have been if the
  good Osiris had come up to the scratch&mdash;I will still be content, because
  your friendship, Ruth, is better than another woman's love. So you see, I
  have taken my gruel and come up to lime smiling&mdash;if you will pardon the
  pugilistic metaphor&mdash;and I promise you loyally to do your bidding and
  never again to distress you.'</p>

  <p class="letter">'Your faithful and loving friend.</p>

  <p class="letter"><SPAN CLASS="smcap">Paul</SPAN>.'</p>
<br>

  <p>This letter I addressed and stamped, and then, with a wry grimace which I
  palmed off on myself (but not on Adolphus) as a cheerful smile, I went out
  and dropped it into the post-box; after which I further deluded myself by
  murmuring Nunc dimittis and assuring myself that the incident was now
  absolutely closed.</p>

  <p>But despite this comfortable assurance I was, in the days that followed,
  an exceedingly miserable young man. It is all very well to write down
  troubles of this kind as trivial and sentimental. They are nothing of the
  kind. When a man of essentially serious nature has found the one woman of all
  the world who fulfils his highest ideals of womanhood, who is, in fact, a
  woman in ten thousand, to whom he has given all that he has to give of love
  and worship, the sudden wreck of all his hopes is no small calamity. And so I
  found it. Resign myself as I would to the bitter reality, the ghost of the
  might-have-been haunted me night and day, so that I spent my leisure
  wandering abstractedly about the streets, always trying to banish thought and
  never for an instant succeeding. A great unrest was upon me; and when I
  received a letter from Dick Barnard announcing his arrival at Madeira,
  homeward bound, I breathed a sigh of relief. I had no plans for the future,
  but I longed to be rid of thenow irksome, routine of the practice&mdash;to be
  free to come and go when and how I pleased.</p>

  <p>One evening, as I sat consuming with little appetite my solitary supper,
  there fell on me a sudden sense of loneliness. The desire that I had hitherto
  felt to be alone with my own miserable reflections gave place to a yearning
  for human companionship. That, indeed, which I craved for most was forbidden,
  and I must abide by my lady's wishes; but there were my friends in the
  Temple. It was more than a week since I had seen them; in fact, we had not
  met since the morning of that unhappiest day of my life. They would be
  wondering what had become of me. I rose from the table, and having filled my
  pouch from a tin of tobacco, set forth for King's Bench Walk.</p>

  <p>As I approached the entry of No. 5A in the gathering darkness I met
  Thorndyke himself emerging encumbered with two deck-chairs, a
  reading-lantern, and a book.</p>

  <p>'Why, Berkeley!' he exclaimed, 'is it indeed thou? We have been wondering
  what had become of you.'</p>

  <p>'It is a long time since I looked you up,' I admitted.</p>

  <p>He scrutinised me attentively by the light of the entry lamp, and then
  remarked: 'Fetter Lane doesn't seem to be agreeing with you very well, my
  son. You are looking quite thin and peaky.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I've nearly done with it. Barnard will be back in about ten days.
  His ship is putting in at Madeira to coal and take in some cargo, and then he
  is coming home. Where are you going with those chairs?'</p>

  <p>'I am going to sit down at the end of the Walk by the railings. It's
  cooler there than indoors. If you will wait a moment I will go and fetch
  another chair for Jervis, though he won't be back for a little while.' He ran
  up the stairs, and presently returned with a third chair, and we carried our
  impedimenta down to the quiet corner of the Walk.</p>

  <p>'So your term of servitude is coming to an end,' said he, when we had
  placed the chairs and hung the lantern on the railings. 'Any other news?'</p>

  <p>'No. Have you any?'</p>

  <p>'I am afraid I have not. All my inquiries have yielded negative results.
  There is, of course, a considerable body of evidence, and it all seems to
  point one way. But I am unwilling to make a decisive move without something
  more definite. I am really waiting for confirmation or otherwise of my ideas
  on the subject; for some new item of evidence.'</p>

  <p>'I didn't know there was any evidence.'</p>

  <p>'Didn't you?' said Thorndyke. 'But you know as much as I know. You have
  all the essential facts; but apparently you haven't collated them and
  extracted their meaning. If you had, you would have found them curiously
  significant.'</p>

  <p>'I suppose I mustn't ask what their significance is?' No, I think not.
  When I am conducting a case I mention my surmises to nobody&mdash;not even to
  Jervis. Then I can say confidently that there has been no leakage. Don't
  think I distrust you. Remember that my thoughts are my client's property, and
  that the essence of strategy is to keep the enemy in the dark.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I see that. Of course I ought not to have asked.'</p>

  <p>'You ought not to need to ask,' Thorndyke replied, with a smile; 'you
  should put the facts together and reason from them yourself.'</p>

  <p>While we had been talking I had noticed Thorndyke glance at me
  inquisitively from time to time. Now after an interval of silence, he asked
  suddenly:</p>

  <p>'Is anything amiss, Berkeley? Are you worrying about your friends'
  affairs?'</p>

  <p>'No, not particularly; though their prospects don't look very rosy.'
  Perhaps they are not quite so bad as they look,' said he. 'But I am afraid
  something is troubling you. All your gay spirits seem to have evaporated.' He
  paused for a few moments, and then added: 'I don't want to intrude on your
  private affairs, but if I can help you by advice or otherwise, remember that
  we are old friends and that you are my academic offspring.'</p>

  <p>Instinctively, with a man's natural reticence, I began to mumble a
  half-articulate disclaimer; and then I stopped. After all, why should I not
  confide in him? He was a good man and a wise man, full of human sympathy, as
  I knew, though so cryptic and secretive in his professional capacity. And I
  wanted a friend badly just now.</p>

  <p>'I'm afraid,' I began shyly, 'it is not a matter that admits of much help,
  and it's hardly the sort of thing that I ought to worry you by talking
  about&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'If it is enough to make you unhappy, my dear fellow, it is enough to
  merit serious consideration by your friend; so if you don't mind telling
  me&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Of course I don't, sir!' I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>'Then fire away; and don't call me "sir." We are brother practitioners
  just now.'</p>

  <p>Thus encouraged, I poured out the story of my little romance; bashfully at
  first and with halting phrases, but later, with more freedom and confidence.
  He listened with grave attention, and once or twice put a question when my
  narrative became a little disconnected. When I had finished he laid his hand
  softly on my arm.</p>

  <p>'You have had rough luck, Berkeley. I don't wonder that you are miserable.
  I am more sorry than I can tell you.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' I said. 'It's exceedingly good of you to listen so patiently,
  but it's a shame for me to pester you with my sentimental troubles.'</p>

  <p>'Now, Berkeley, you don't think that, and I hope you don't think that I
  do. We should be bad biologists and worse physicians if we should
  underestimate the importance of that which is nature's chiefest care. The one
  salient biological truth is the paramount importance of sex; and we are deaf
  and blind if we do not hear and see it in everything that lives when we look
  abroad upon the world; when we listen to the spring song of the birds, or
  when we consider the lilies of the field. And as is man to the lower
  organisms, so is human love to their merely reflex manifestations of sex. I
  will maintain, and you will agree with me, I know, that the love of a serious
  and honourable man for a woman who is worthy of him is the most momentous of
  all human affairs. It is the foundation of social life, and its failure is a
  serious calamity, not only to those whose lives may be thereby spoilt, but to
  society at large.'</p>

  <p>'It's a serious enough matter for the parties concerned,' I agreed; 'but
  that is no reason why they should bore their friends.'</p>

  <p>'But they don't. Friends should help one another and think it a
  privilege.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, I shouldn't mind coming to you for help, knowing you as I do. But no
  one can help a poor devil in a case like this&mdash;and certainly not a
  medical jurist.'</p>

  <p>'Oh, come, Berkeley!' he protested, 'don't rate us too low. The humblest
  of creatures has its uses&mdash;"even the little pismire," you know, as Isaak
  Walton tells us. Why, I have got substantial help from a stamp-collector. And
  then reflect upon the motor-scorcher and the earth-worm and the blow-fly. All
  these lowly creatures play their parts in the scheme of nature; and shall we
  cast out the medical jurist as nothing worth?'</p>

  <p>I laughed dejectedly at my teacher's genial irony.</p>

  <p>What I meant,' said I, 'was that there is nothing to be done but
  wait&mdash;perhaps for ever. I don't know why she isn't able to marry me, and
  I mustn't ask her. She can't be married already.'</p>

  <p>'Certainly not. She told you explicitly that there was no man in the
  case.'</p>

  <p>'Exactly. And I can think of no other valid reason, excepting that she
  doesn't care enough for me. That would be a perfectly sound reason, but then
  it would only be a temporary one, not the insuperable obstacle that she
  assumes to exist, especially as we really got on excellently together. I hope
  it isn't some confounded perverse feminine scruple. I don't see how it could
  be; but women are most frightfully tortuous and wrong-headed at times.'</p>

  <p>'I don't see,' said Thorndyke, 'why we should cast about for perversely
  abnormal motives when there is a perfectly reasonable explanation staring us
  in the face.'</p>

  <p>Us there?' I exclaimed. 'I see none.'</p>

  <p>'You are, not unnaturally, overlooking some of the circumstances that
  affect Miss Bellingham; but I don't suppose she has failed to grasp their
  meaning. Do you realise what her position really is? I mean with regard to
  her uncle's disappearance?'</p>

  <p>'I don't think I quite understand you.'</p>

  <p>'Well, there is no use in blinking the facts,' said Thorndyke. 'The
  position is this: if John Bellingham ever went to his brother's house at
  Woodford, it is nearly certain that he went there after his visit to Hurst.
  Mind, I say "if he went"; I don't say that I believe he did. But it is stated
  that he appears to have gone there; and if he did go, he was never seen alive
  afterwards. Now, he did not go in at the front door. No one saw him enter the
  house. But there was a back gate, which John Bellingham knew, and which had a
  bell which rang in the library. And you will remember that, when Hurst and
  Jellicoe called, Mr. Bellingham had only just come in. Previous to that time
  Miss Bellingham had been alone in the library; that is to say, she was alone
  in the library at the very time when John Bellingham is said to have made his
  visit. That is the position, Berkeley. Nothing pointed has been said up to
  the present. But, sooner or later, if John Bellingham is not found, dead or
  alive, the question will be opened. Then it is certain that Hurst, in
  self-defence, will make the most of any facts that may transfer suspicion
  from him to some one else. And that some one else will be Miss
  Bellingham.'</p>

  <p>I sat for some moments literally paralysed with horror. Then my dismay
  gave place to indignation. 'But, damn it!' I exclaimed, starting up&mdash;'I
  beg your pardon&mdash;but could anyone have the infernal audacity to
  insinuate that that gentle, refined lady murdered her uncle?'</p>

  <p>'That is what will be hinted, if not plainly asserted; and she knows it.
  And that being so, is it difficult to understand why she should refuse to
  allow you to be publicly associated with her? To run the risk of dragging
  your honourable name into the sordid transactions of the police-court or the
  Old Bailey? To invest it, perhaps, with a dreadful notoriety?'</p>

  <p>'Oh, don't! for God's sake! It is too horrible! Not that I would care for
  myself. I would be proud to share her martyrdom of ignominy, if it had to be;
  but it is the sacrilege, the blasphemy of even thinking of her in such terms,
  that enrages me.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' said Thorndyke; 'I understand and sympathise with you. Indeed, I
  share your righteous indignation at this dastardly affair. So you mustn't
  think me brutal for putting the case so plainly.'</p>

  <p>'I don't. You have only shown me the danger that I was fool enough not to
  see. But you seem to imply that this hideous position has been brought about
  deliberately.'</p>

  <p>'Certainly I do! This is no chance affair. Either the appearances indicate
  the real events&mdash;which I am sure they do not&mdash;or they have been
  created of a set purpose to lead to false conclusions. But the circumstances
  convince me that there has been a deliberate plot; and I am waiting&mdash;in
  no spirit of Christian patience, I can tell you&mdash;to lay my hand on the
  wretch who has done this.'</p>

  <p>'What are you waiting for?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'I am waiting for the inevitable,' he replied; 'for the false move that
  the most artful criminal invariably makes. At present he is lying low; but
  presently he will make a move, and then I shall have him.'</p>

  <p>'But he may go on lying low. What will you do then?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, that is the danger. We may have to deal with the perfect villain who
  knows when to leave well alone. I have never met him, but he may exist,
  nevertheless.'</p>

  <p>'And then we should have to stand by and see our friends go under.'</p>

  <p>'Perhaps,' said Thorndyke; and we both subsided into gloomy and silent
  reflection.</p>

  <p>The place was peaceful and quiet, as only a backwater of London can be.
  Occasional hoots from far-away tugs and steamers told of the busy life down
  below in the crowded Pool. A faint hum of traffic was borne in from the
  streets outside the precincts, and the shrill voices of newspaper boys came
  in unceasing chorus from the direction of Carmelite Street. They were too far
  away to be physically disturbing, but the excited yells, toned down as they
  were by distance, nevertheless stirred the very marrow in my bones, so
  dreadfully suggestive were they of those possibilities of the future at which
  Thorndyke had hinted. They seemed like the sinister shadows oncoming
  misfortunes.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they called up the same association of ideas in Thorndyke's mind,
  for he remarked presently: 'The newsvendor is abroad to-night like a bird of
  ill-omen. Something unusual has happened: some public or private calamity,
  most likely, and these yelling ghouls are out to feast on the remains. The
  newspaper men have a good deal in common with the carrion-birds that hover
  over a battle-field.'</p>

  <p>Again we subsided into silence and reflection. Then, after an interval, I
  asked:</p>

  <p>'Would it be possible for me to help in any way in this investigation of
  yours?'</p>

  <p>'That is exactly what I have been asking myself,' replied Thorndyke. 'It
  would be right and proper that you should, and I think you might.'</p>

  <p>'How?' I asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>'I can't say off-hand; but Jervis will be going away for his holiday
  almost at once&mdash;in fact, he will go off actual duty to-night. There is
  very little doing; the long vacation is close upon us, and I can do without
  him. But if you would care to come down here and take his place, you would be
  very useful to me; and if there should be anything to be done in the
  Bellinghams' case, I am sure you would make up in enthusiasm for any
  deficiency in experience.'</p>

  <p>'I couldn't really take Jervis's place,' said I, 'but if you would let me
  help you in any way it would be a great kindness. I would rather clean your
  boots than be out of it altogether.'</p>

  <p>'Very well. Let us leave it that you come here as soon as Barnard has done
  with you. You can have Jervis's room, which he doesn't often use nowadays,
  and you will be more happy here than elsewhere, I know. I may as well give
  you my latch-key now. I have a duplicate upstairs, and you understand that my
  chambers are yours too from this moment.'</p>

  <p>He handed me the latch-key and I thanked him warmly from my heart, for I
  felt sure that the suggestion was made, not for any use that I should be to
  him, but for my own peace of mind. I had hardly finished speaking when a
  quick step on the paved walk caught my ear.</p>

  <p>'Here is Jervis,' said Thorndyke. 'We will let him know that there is a
  locum tenens ready to step into his shoes when he wants to be off.' He
  flashed the lantern across the path, and a few moments later his junior
  stepped up briskly with a bundle of newspapers tucked under his arm.</p>

  <p>It struck me that Jervis looked at me a little queerly when he recognised
  me in the dim light; also he was a trifle constrained in his manner, as if my
  presence were an embarrassment. He listened to Thorndyke's announcement of
  our newly made arrangement without much enthusiasm and with none of his
  customary facetious comments. And again I noticed a quick glance at me, half
  curious, half uneasy, and wholly puzzling to me.</p>

  <p>'That's all right,' he said when Thorndyke had explained the situation. 'I
  daresay you'll find Berkeley as useful as me, and, in any case, he'll be
  better here than staying on with Barnard.' He spoke with unwonted gravity,
  and there was in his tone a solicitude for me that attracted my notice and
  that of Thorndyke as well, for the latter looked at him curiously, though he
  made no comment. After a short silence, however, he asked: 'And what news
  does my learned brother bring? There is a mighty shouting among the outer
  barbarians and I see a bundle of newspapers under my learned friend's arm.
  Has anything in particular happened?'</p>

  <p>Jervis looked more uncomfortable than ever. 'Well&mdash;yes,' he replied
  hesitatingly, 'something has happened&mdash;there! It's no use beating about
  the bush; Berkeley may as well learn it from me as from those yelling devils
  outside.' He took a couple of papers from his bundle and silently handed one
  to me and the other to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>Jervis's ominous manner, naturally enough, alarmed me not a little. I
  opened the paper with a nameless dread. But whatever my vague fears, they
  fell far short of the occasion; and when I saw those yells from without
  crystallised into scare head-lines and flaming capitals I turned for a moment
  sick and dizzy with fear.</p>

  <p>The paragraph was only a short one, and I read it through in less than a
  minute.</p>

  <p>'THE MISSING FINGER</p>

  <p>DRAMATIC DISCOVERY AT WOODFORD'</p>

  <p>'The mystery that has surrounded the remains of a mutilated human body,
  portions of which have been found in various places in Kent and Essex, has
  received a partial and very sinister solution. The police have, all along,
  suspected that those remains were those of a Mr. John Bellingham who
  disappeared under circumstances of some suspicion about two years ago. There
  is now no doubt upon the subject, for the finger which was missing from the
  hand that was found at Sidcup has been discovered at the bottom of a disused
  well together with a ring, which has been identified as one habitually worn
  by Mr. John Bellingham.</p>

  <p>'The house in the garden of which the well is situated was the property of
  the murdered man, and was occupied at the time of the disappearance by his
  brother, Mr. Godfrey Bellingham. But the latter left it very soon after, and
  it has been empty ever since. Just lately it has been put in repair, and it
  was in this way that the well came to be emptied and cleaned out. It seems
  that Detective-Inspector Badger, who was searching the neighbourhood for
  further remains, heard of the emptying of the well and went down in the
  bucket to examine the bottom, where he found the three bones and the
  ring.</p>

  <p>'Thus the identity of the body is established beyond all doubt, and the
  question that remains is, Who killed John Bellingham? It may be remembered
  that a trinket, apparently broken from his watch-chain, was found in the
  grounds of this house on the day that he disappeared, and that he was never
  again seen alive. What may be the import of these facts time will show.'</p>

  <p>That was all; but it was enough. I dropped the paper to the ground and
  glanced round furtively at Jervis, who sat gazing gloomily at the toes of his
  boots. It was horrible! It was incredible! The blow was so crushing that it
  left my faculties numb, and for a while I seemed unable even to think
  intelligibly.</p>

  <p>I was aroused by Thorndyke's voice&mdash;calm, businesslike, composed:</p>

  <p>'Time will show, indeed! But meanwhile we must go warily. And don't be
  unduly alarmed, Berkeley. Go home, take a good dose of bromide with a little
  stimulant, and turn in. I am afraid this has been rather a shock to you.'</p>

  <p>I rose from my chair like one in a dream and held out my hand to
  Thorndyke; and even in the dim light and in my dazed condition I noticed that
  his face bore a look that I had never seen before; the look of a granite mask
  of Fate&mdash;grim, stern, inexorable.</p>

  <p>My two friends walked with me as far as the gateway at the top of Inner
  Temple Lane, and as we reached the entry a stranger, coming quickly up the
  Lane, overtook and passed us. In the glare of the lamp outside the porter's
  lodge he looked at us quickly over his shoulder, and though he passed on
  without halt or greeting, I recognised him with a certain dull surprise which
  I did not understand then and do not understand now. It was Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>I shook hands once more with my friends and strode out into Fleet Street,
  but as soon as I was outside the gate I made direct for Nevill's Court. What
  was in my mind I do not know; only that some instinct of protection led me
  there, where my lady lay unconscious of the hideous menace that hung over
  her. At the entrance to the Court a tall, powerful man was lounging against
  the wall, and he seemed to look at me curiously as I passed; but I hardly
  noticed him and strode forward into the narrow passage. By the shabby gateway
  of the house I halted and looked up at such of the windows as I could see
  over the wall. They were all dark. All the inmates, then, were in bed.
  Vaguely comforted by this, I walked on to the New Street end of the Court and
  looked out. Here, too, a man&mdash;a tall, thick-set man&mdash;was loitering;
  and as he looked inquisitively into my face I turned and re-entered the
  Court, slowly retracing my steps. As I again reached the gate of the house I
  stopped to look once more at the windows, and turning I found the man whom I
  had last noticed close behind me. Then, in a flash of dreadful comprehension,
  I understood. These two were plain-clothes policemen.</p>

  <p>For a moment a blind fury possessed me. An insane impulse urged me to give
  battle to this intruder; to avenge upon this person the insult of his
  presence. Fortunately the impulse was but momentary, and I recovered myself
  without making any demonstration. But the appearance of those two policemen
  brought the peril into the immediate present, imparted to it a horrible
  actuality. A chilly sweat of terror stood on my forehead, and my ears were
  ringing when I walked with faltering steps out into Fetter Lane.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XVIII. JOHN BELLINGHAM</h3>

  <p>THE next few days were a very nightmare of horror and gloom. Of course, I
  repudiated my acceptance of the decree of banishment that Ruth had passed
  upon me. I was her friend, at least, and in time of peril my place was at her
  side. Tacitly&mdash;though thankfully enough, poor girl!&mdash;she had
  recognised the fact and made me once more free of the house.</p>

  <p>For there was no disguising the situation. Newspaper boys yelled the news
  up and down Fleet Street from morning to night; soul-shaking posters grinned
  on gaping crowds; and the newspapers fairly wallowed in the 'Shocking
  details.'</p>

  <p>It is true that no direct accusations were made; but the original reports
  of the disappearance were reprinted with such comments as made me gnash my
  teeth with fury.</p>

  <p>The wretchedness of those days will live in my memory until my dying day.
  Never can I forget the dread that weighed me down, the horrible suspense, the
  fear that clutched at my heart as I furtively scanned the posters in the
  streets. Even the wretched detectives who prowled about the entrances to
  Nevill's Court became grateful to my eyes, for, embodying as they did the
  hideous menace that hung over my dear lady, their presence at least told me
  that the blow had not yet fallen. Indeed, we came, after a time, to exchange
  glances of mutual recognition, and I thought that they seemed to be sorry for
  her and for me, and had no great liking for their task. Of course, I spent
  most of my leisure at the old house, though my heart ached more there than
  elsewhere; and I tried, with but poor success, I fear to maintain a cheerful,
  confident manner, cracking my little jokes as of old, and even essaying to
  skirmish with Miss Oman. But this last experiment was a dead failure; and
  when she had suddenly broken down in a stream of brilliant repartee to weep
  hysterically on my breast, I abandoned the attempt and did not repeat it.</p>

  <p>A dreadful gloom had settled down upon the old house. Poor Miss Oman crept
  silently but restlessly up and down the ancient stairs with dim eyes and a
  tremulous chin, or moped in her room with a parliamentary petition
  (demanding, if I remember rightly, the appointment of a female judge to deal
  with divorce and matrimonial causes) which lay on her table languidly
  awaiting signatures that never came. Mr. Bellingham, whose mental condition
  at first alternated between furious anger and absolute panic, was fast
  sinking into a state of nervous prostration that I viewed with no little
  alarm. In fact, the only really self-possessed person in the entire household
  was Ruth herself, and even she could not conceal the ravages of sorrow and
  suspense and overshadowing peril. Her manner was almost unchanged; or rather,
  I should say, she had gone back to that which I had first known&mdash;quiet,
  reserved, taciturn, with a certain bitter humour showing through her
  unvarying amiability. When she and I were alone, indeed, her reserve melted
  away and she was all sweetness and gentleness. But it wrung my heart to look
  at her, to see how, day by day, she grew ever more thin and haggard; to watch
  the growing pallor of her cheek; to look into her solemn grey eyes, so sad
  and tragic and yet so brave and defiant of fate.</p>

  <p>It was a terrible time; and through it all the dreadful questions haunted
  me continually: When will the blow fall? What is it that the police are
  waiting for? And when they do strike, what will Thorndyke have to say?</p>

  <p>So things went on for four dreadful days. But on the fourth day, just as
  the evening consultations were beginning and the surgery was filled with
  waiting patients, Polton appeared with a note, which he insisted, to the
  indignation of Adolphus, on delivering into my own hands. It was from
  Thorndyke, and was to the following effect:</p>
<br>

  <p class="letter">'I learn from Dr. Norbury that he has recently heard from Hen Lederbogen,
  of Berlin&mdash;a learned authority on Oriental antiquities&mdash;who makes
  some reference to an English Egyptologist whom he met in Vienna about a year
  ago. He cannot recall the Englishman's name, but there are certain
  expressions in the letter which make Dr. Norbury suspect that he is referring
  to John Bellingham.'</p>

  <p class="letter">'I want you to bring Mr. and Miss Bellingham to my chambers this evening
  at 8.30, to meet Dr. Norbury and talk over his letter; and in view of the
  importance of the matter, I look to you not to fail me.'</p>
<br>

  <p>A wave of hope and relief swept over me. It was still possible that this
  Gordian knot might be cut; that the deliverance might not come before it was
  too late. I wrote a hasty note to Thorndyke and another to Ruth, making the
  appointment; and having given them both to the trusty Polton, returned
  somewhat feverishly to my professional duties. To my profound relief, the
  influx of patients ceased, and the practice sank into its accustomed torpor;
  whereby I was able without base and mendacious subterfuge to escape in good
  time to my tryst.</p>

  <p>It was near upon eight o'clock when I passed through the archway into
  Nevill's Court. The warm afternoon light had died away, for the summer was
  running out apace. The last red glow of the setting sun had faded from the
  ancient roofs and chimney stacks, and down in the narrow court the shades of
  evening had begun to gather in nooks and corners. I was due at eight, and, as
  it still wanted some minutes to the hour, I sauntered slowly down the Court,
  looking reflectively on the familiar scene and the well-known friendly
  faces.</p>

  <p>The day's work was drawing to a close. The little shops were putting up
  their shutters; lights were beginning to twinkle in parlour windows; a solemn
  hymn arose in the old Moravian chapel, and its echoes stole out through the
  dark entry that opens into the court under the archway.</p>

  <p>Here was Mr. Finneymore (a man of versatile gifts, with a leaning towards
  paint and varnish) sitting, white-aproned and shirt-sleeved, on a chair in
  his garden, smoking his pipe with a complacent eye on his dahlias. There at
  an open window a young man, with a brush in his hand and another behind his
  ear, stood up and stretched himself while an older lady deftly rolled up a
  large map. The barber was turning out the gas in his little saloon; the
  greengrocer was emerging with a cigarette in his mouth and an aster in his
  button-hole, and a group of children were escorting the lamp-lighter on his
  rounds.</p>

  <p>All these good, homely folk were Nevill's Courtiers of the genuine breed'
  born in the court, as had been their fathers before them for generations. And
  of such to a great extent was the population of the place. Miss Oman herself
  claimed aboriginal descent and so did the sweet-faced Moravian lady next
  door&mdash;a connection of the famous La Trobes of the old Conventicle, whose
  history went back to the Gordon Riots; and as to the gentleman who lived in
  the ancient timber-and-plaster house at the bottom of the court, it was
  reported that his ancestors had dwelt in that very house since the days of
  James the First.</p>

  <p>On these facts I reflected as I sauntered down the court, on the strange
  phenomenon of an old-world hamlet with its ancient population lingering in
  the very heart of the noisy city; an island of peace set in an ocean of
  unrest, an oasis in a desert of change and ferment.</p>

  <p>My meditations brought me to the shabby gate in the high wall, and as I
  raised the latch and pushed it open, I saw Ruth standing at the door of the
  house talking to Miss Oman. She was evidently waiting for me, for she wore
  her sombre black coat and hat and a black veil, and when she saw me she came
  out, closing the door after her, and holding out her hand.</p>

  <p>'You are punctual,' said she. 'St Dunstan's clock is striking now.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' I answered. 'But where is your father?'</p>

  <p>'He has gone to bed, poor old dear. He didn't feel well enough to come,
  and I did not urge him. He is really very ill. This dreadful suspense will
  kill him if it goes on much longer.'</p>

  <p>'Let us hope it won't,' I said, but with little conviction, I fear, in my
  tone.</p>

  <p>It was harrowing to see her torn by anxiety for her father, and I yearned
  to comfort her. But what was there to say? Mr. Bellingham was breaking up
  visibly under the stress of the terrible menace that hung over his daughter,
  and no words of mine could make the fact less manifest.</p>

  <p>We walked silently up the court. The lady at the window greeted us with a
  smiling salutation, Mr. Finneymore removed his pipe and raised his cap,
  receiving a gracious bow from Ruth in return, and then we passed through the
  covered way into Fetter Lane, where my companion paused and looked about
  her.</p>

  <p>'What are you looking for?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'The detective,' she answered quietly. 'It would be a pity if the poor man
  should miss me after waiting so long. However, I don't see him.' And she
  turned away towards Fleet Street. It was an unpleasant surprise to me that
  her sharp eyes detected the secret spy upon her movements; and the dry,
  sardonic tone of her remark pained me too, recalling, as it did, the frigid
  self-possession that had so repelled me in the early days of our
  acquaintance. And yet I could not but admire the cool unconcern with which
  she faced her horrible peril.</p>

  <p>'Tell me a little more about this conference,' she said, as we walked down
  Fetter Lane. 'Your note was rather more concise than lucid; but I suppose you
  wrote it in a hurry.'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I did. And I can't give you any details now. All I know is that
  Doctor Norbury has had a letter from a friend of his in Berlin, an
  Egyptologist, as I understand, named Lederbogen, who refers to an English
  acquaintance of his and Norbury's whom he saw in Vienna about a year ago. He
  cannot remember the Englishman's name, but from some of the circumstances
  Norbury seems to think that he is referring to your Uncle John. Of course, if
  this should turn out to be really the case, it would set everything straight;
  so Thorndyke was anxious that you and your father should meet Norbury and
  talk it over.'</p>

  <p>'I see,' said Ruth. Her tone was thoughtful but by no means
  enthusiastic.</p>

  <p>'You don't seem to attach much importance to the matter,' I remarked.</p>

  <p>'No. It doesn't seem to fit the circumstances. What is the use of
  suggesting that poor Uncle John is alive&mdash;and behaving like an imbecile,
  which he certainly was not&mdash;when his dead body has actually been
  found?'</p>

  <p>'But,' I suggested lamely, 'there may be some mistake. It may not be his
  body after all.'</p>

  <p>'And the ring?' she asked, with a bitter smile.</p>

  <p>'That may be just a coincidence. It was a copy of a well-known form of
  antique ring. Other people may have had copies made as well as your uncle.
  Besides,' I added with more conviction, 'we haven't seen the ring. It may not
  be his at all.'</p>

  <p>She shook her head. 'My dear Paul,' she said quietly, 'it is useless to
  delude ourselves. Every known fact points to the certainty that it is his
  body. John Bellingham is dead: there can be no doubt of that. And to every
  one except his unknown murderer and one or two of my own loyal friends, it
  must seem that his death lies at my door. I realised from the beginning that
  the suspicion lay between George Hurst and me; and the finding of the ring
  fixes it definitely on me. I am only surprised that the police have made no
  move yet.'</p>

  <p>The quiet conviction of her tone left me for a while speechless with
  horror and despair. Then I recalled Thorndyke's calm, even confident,
  attitude, and I hastened to remind her of it.</p>

  <p>'There is one of your friends,' I said, 'who is still undismayed.
  Thorndyke seems to anticipate no difficulties.'</p>

  <p>'And yet,' she replied, 'he is ready to consider a forlorn hope like this.
  However, we shall see.'</p>

  <p>I could think of nothing more to say, and it was in gloomy silence that we
  pursued our way down Inner Temple Lane and through the dark entries and
  tunnel-like passages that brought us out, at length, by the Treasury.</p>

  <p>'I don't see any light in Thorndyke's chambers,' I said, as we crossed
  King's Bench Walk; and I pointed out the row of windows all dark and
  blank.</p>

  <p>'No; and yet the shutters are not closed. He must be out.'</p>

  <p>'He can't be after making an appointment with you and your father. It is
  most mysterious. Thorndyke is so very punctilious about his engagements.'</p>

  <p>The mystery was solved, when we reached the landing, by a slip of paper
  fixed by a tack on the iron-bound 'oak.'</p>

  <p>'A note for P. B. is on the table,' was the laconic message: on reading
  which I inserted my key, swung the heavy door outward, and opened the lighter
  inner door. The note was lying on the table and I brought it out to the
  landing to read by the light of the staircase lamp.</p>

  <p>'Apologise to our friends,' it ran, 'for the slight change of programme.
  Norbury is anxious that I should get my experiments over before the Director
  returns, so as to save discussion. He has asked me to begin to-night and says
  he will see Mr. and Miss Bellingham here, at the Museum. Please bring them
  along at once. I think some matters of importance may transpire at the
  interview.&mdash;J. E. T.'</p>

  <p>'I hope you don't mind,' I said apologetically, when I had read the note
  to Ruth.</p>

  <p>'Of course I don't,' she replied. 'I am rather pleased. We have so many
  associations with the dear old Museum, haven't we?' She looked at me for a
  moment with a strange and touching wistfulness and then turned to descend the
  stone stairs.&mdash;|</p>

  <p>At the Temple gate I hailed a hansom, and we were soon speeding westward
  and north to the soft twinkle of the horse's bell.</p>

  <p>'What are these experiments that Doctor Thorndyke refers to?' she asked
  presently.</p>

  <p>'I can only answer you vaguely,' I replied. 'Their object, I believe, is
  to ascertain whether the penetrability of organic substances by the X-rays
  becomes altered by age; whether, for instance, an ancient block of wood is
  more or less transparent to the rays than a new block of the same size.'</p>

  <p>'And of what use would the knowledge be, if it were obtained?'</p>

  <p>'I can't say. Experiments are made to obtain knowledge without regard to
  its utility. The use appears when the knowledge has been acquired. But in
  this case, if it should be possible to determine the age of any organic
  substance by its reaction to X-rays, the discovery might be found of some
  value in legal practice&mdash;as in demonstrating a new seal on an old
  document, for instance. But I don't know whether Thorndyke has anything
  definite in view; I only know that the preparations have been on a most
  portentous scale.'</p>

  <p>'How do you mean?'</p>

  <p>'In regard to size. When I went into the workshop yesterday morning, I
  found Polton erecting a kind of portable gallows about nine feet high, and he
  had just finished varnishing a pair of enormous wooden trays each over six
  feet long. It looked as if he and Thorndyke were contemplating a few private
  executions with subsequent post-mortems on the victims.'</p>

  <p>'What a horrible suggestion!'</p>

  <p>'So Polton said, with his quaint, crinkly smile. But he was mighty close
  about the use of the apparatus all the same. I wonder if we shall see
  anything of the experiments, when we get there. This is Museum Street, isn't
  it?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.' As she spoke, she lifted the flap of one of the little windows in
  the back of the cab and peered out. Then, closing it with a quiet, ironic
  smile, she said:</p>

  <p>'It is all right; he hasn't missed us. It will be quite a nice little
  change for him.'</p>

  <p>The cab swung round into Great Russell Street, and, glancing out as it
  turned, I saw another hansom following; but before I had time to inspect its
  solitary passenger, we drew up at the Museum gates.</p>

  <p>The gate porter, who seemed to expect us, ushered us up the drive to the
  great portico and into the Central Hall, where he handed us over to another
  official.</p>

  <p>'Doctor Norbury is in one of the rooms adjoining the Fourth Egyptian
  Room,' the latter stated in answer to our inquiries: and, providing himself
  with a wire-guarded lantern, he prepared to escort us thither.</p>

  <p>Up the great staircase, now wrapped in mysterious gloom, we passed in
  silence with bitter-sweet memories of that day of days when we had first
  trodden its steps together; through the Central Saloon, the Mediaeval Room
  and the Asiatic Saloon, and so into the long range of the Ethnographical
  Galleries.</p>

  <p>It was a weird journey. The swaying lantern shot its beams abroad into the
  darkness of the great, dim galleries, casting instantaneous flashes on the
  objects in the cases, so that they leaped into being and vanished in the
  twinkling of an eye. Hideous idols with round, staring eyes started forth
  from the darkness, glared at us for an instant and were gone. Grotesque
  masks, suddenly revealed by the shimmering light, took on the semblance of
  demon faces that seemed to mow and gibber at us as we passed. As for the
  life-sized models&mdash;realistic enough by daylight&mdash;their aspect was
  positively alarming; for the moving light and shadow endowed them with life
  and movement, so that they seemed to watch us furtively, to lie in wait and
  to hold themselves in readiness to steal out and follow us.</p>

  <p>The illusion evidently affected Ruth as well as me, for she drew nearer to
  me and whispered:</p>

  <p>'These figures are quite startling. Did you see that Polynesian? I really
  felt as if he were going to spring out on us.'</p>

  <p>'They are rather uncanny,' I admitted, 'but the danger is over now. We are
  passing out of their sphere of influence.'</p>

  <p>We came out on a landing as I spoke and then turned sharply to the left
  along the North Gallery, from the centre of which we entered the Fourth
  Egyptian Room.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately, a door in the opposite wall opened; a peculiar,
  high-pitched humming sound became audible, and Jervis came out on tiptoe with
  his hand raised.</p>

  <p>'Tread as lightly as you can,' he said. 'We are just making an
  exposure.'</p>

  <p>The attendant turned back with his lantern, and we followed Jervis into
  the room from whence he had come. It was a large room, and little lighter
  than the galleries, for the single glow-lamp that burned at the end where we
  entered left the rest of the apartment in almost complete obscurity. We
  seated ourselves at once on the chairs that had been placed for us, and, when
  the mutual salutations had been exchanged, I looked about me. There were
  three people in the room besides Jervis: Thorndyke, who sat with his watch in
  his hand, a grey-headed gentleman whom I took to be Dr. Norbury, and a
  smaller person at the dim farther end&mdash;undistinguishable, but probably
  Polton. At our end of the room were the two large trays that I had seen in
  the workshop, now mounted on trestles and each fitted with a rubber
  drain-tube leading down to a bucket. At the farther end of the room the
  sinister shape of the gallows reared itself aloft in the gloom; only now I
  could see that it was not a gallows at all. For affixed to the top cross-bar
  was a large, bottomless glass basin, inside which was a glass bulb that
  glowed with a strange green light; and in the heart of the bulb a bright spot
  of red.</p>

  <p>It was all clear enough so far. The peculiar sound that filled the air was
  the hum of the interrupter; the bulb was, of course, a Crookes' tube, and the
  red spot inside it, the glowing red-hot disc of the anti-cathode. Clearly an
  X-ray photograph was being made; but of what? I strained my eyes, peering
  into the gloom at the foot of the gallows, but though I could make out an
  elongated object lying on the floor directly under the bulb, I could not
  resolve the dimly seen shape into anything recognisable. Presently, however,
  Dr. Norbury supplied the clue.</p>

  <p>'I am rather surprised,' said he, 'that you chose so composite an object
  as a mummy to begin on. I should have thought that a simpler object, such as
  a coffin or a wooden figure, would have been more instructive.'</p>

  <p>'In some ways it would,' replied Thorndyke, 'but the variety of materials
  that the mummy gives us has its advantages. I hope your father is not ill,
  Miss Bellingham.'</p>

  <p>'He is not at all well,' said Ruth, 'and we agreed that it was better for
  me to come alone. I knew Herr Lederbogen quite well. He stayed with us for a
  time when he was in England.'</p>

  <p>'I trust,' said Dr. Norbury, 'that I have not troubled you for nothing.
  Herr Lederbogen speaks of "our erratic English friend with the long name that
  I can never remember," and it seemed to me that he might be referring to your
  uncle.'</p>

  <p>'I should have hardly have called my uncle erratic,' said Ruth.</p>

  <p>'No, no. Certainly not,' Dr. Norbury agreed hastily. 'However, you shall
  see the letter presently and judge for yourself. We mustn't introduce
  irrelevant topics while the experiment is in progress, must we, Doctor?'</p>

  <p>'You had better wait until we have finished,' said Thorndyke, 'because I
  am going to turn out the light. Switch off the current, Polton.'</p>

  <p>The green light vanished from the bulb, the hum of the interrupter swept
  down an octave or two and died away. Then Thorndyke and Dr. Norbury rose from
  their chairs and went towards the mummy, which they lifted tenderly while
  Polton drew from beneath it what presently turned out to be a huge black
  paper envelope. The single glow-lamp was switched off, leaving the room in
  total darkness until there burst suddenly a bright orange red light
  immediately above one of the trays.</p>

  <p>We all gathered round to watch, as Polton&mdash;the high priest of these
  mysteries&mdash;drew from the black envelope a colossal sheet of bromide
  paper, laid it carefully in the tray and proceeded to wet it with a large
  brush which he had dipped in a pail of water.</p>

  <p>'I thought you always used plates for this kind of work,' said Dr.
  Norbury.</p>

  <p>'We do, by preference; but a six-foot plate would be impossible, so I had
  a special paper made to the size.'</p>

  <p>There is something singularly fascinating in the appearance of a
  developing photograph; in the gradual, mysterious emergence of the picture
  from the blank, white surface of plate or paper. But a skiagraph, or X-ray
  photograph, has a fascination all its own. Unlike the ordinary photograph,
  which yields a picture of things already seen, it gives a presentment of
  objects hitherto invisible; and hence, when Polton poured the developer on
  the already wet paper, we all craned over the tray with the keenest
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>The developer was evidently a very slow one. For fully half a minute no
  change could be seen in the uniform surface. Then, gradually, almost
  insensibly, the marginal portion began to darken, leaving the outline of the
  mummy in pale relief. The change, once started, proceeded apace. Darker and
  darker grew the margin of the paper until from slate grey it had turned to
  black; and still the shape of the mummy, now in strong relief, remained an
  elongated patch of bald white. But not for long. Presently the white shape
  began to be tinged with grey, and, as the colour deepened, there grew out of
  it a paler form that seemed to steal out of the enshrouding grey like an
  apparition, spectral, awesome, mysterious. The skeleton was coming into
  view.</p>

  <p>'It is rather uncanny,' said Dr. Norbury. 'I feel as if I were assisting
  at some unholy rite. Just look at it now!'</p>

  <p>The grey shadow of the cartonnage, the wrappings and the flesh was fading
  away into the background and the white skeleton stood out in sharp contrast.
  And it certainly was rather a weird spectacle.</p>

  <p>'You'll lose the bones if you develop much farther,' said Dr. Norbury.</p>

  <p>'I must let the bones darken,' Thorndyke replied, 'in case there are any
  metallic objects. I have three more papers in the envelope.'</p>

  <p>The white shape of the skeleton now began to grey over and, as Dr. Norbury
  had said, its distinctness became less and yet less. Thorndyke leaned over
  the tray with his eyes fixed on a point in the middle of the breast and we
  all watched him in silence. Suddenly he rose. 'Now, Polton,' he said sharply,
  'get the hypo on as quickly as you can.'</p>

  <p>Polton, who had been waiting with his hand on the stop-cock of the
  drain-tube, rapidly ran off the developer into the bucket and flooded the
  paper with the fixing solution.</p>

  <p>'Now we can look at it at our leisure,' said Thorndyke. After waiting a
  few seconds, he switched on one of the glow-lamps, and as the flood of light
  fell on the photograph, he added: 'You see we haven't quite lost the
  skeleton.'</p>

  <p>'No.' Dr. Norbury put on a pair of spectacles and bent down over the tray;
  and at this moment I felt Ruth's hand touch my arm, lightly, at first, and
  then with a strong nervous grasp; and I could feel that her hand was
  trembling. I looked round at her anxiously and saw that she had turned
  deathly pale.</p>

  <p>'Would you rather go out into the gallery?' I asked; for the room with its
  tightly shut windows was close and hot.</p>

  <p>'No,' she replied quietly, 'I will stay here. I am quite well.' But still
  she kept hold of my arm.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke glanced at her keenly and then looked away as Dr. Norbury turned
  to ask him a question.</p>

  <p>'Why is it, think you, that some of the teeth show so much whiter than
  others?'</p>

  <p>'I think the whiteness of the shadows is due to the presence of metal,'
  Thorndyke replied.</p>

  <p>'Do you mean that the teeth have metal fillings?' asked Dr. Norbury.</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Really! This is very interesting. The use of gold stoppings&mdash;and
  artificial teeth, too&mdash;by the ancient Egyptians is well known, but we
  have no examples in this Museum. This mummy ought to be unrolled. Do you
  think all those teeth are filled with the same metal? They are not equally
  white.'</p>

  <p>'No,' replied Thorndyke. 'Those teeth that are perfectly white are
  undoubtedly filled with gold, but that greyish one is probably filled with
  tin.'</p>

  <p>'Very interesting,' said Dr. Norbury. 'Very interesting! And what do you
  make of that faint mark across the chest, near the top of the sternum?'</p>

  <p>It was Ruth who answered his question. 'It is the eye of Osiris!' she
  exclaimed in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>'Dear me!' exclaimed Dr. Norbury, 'so it is. You are quite right. It is
  the Utchat&mdash;the Eye of Horus&mdash;or Osiris, if you prefer to call it
  so. That, I presume, will be a gilded device on some of the wrappings.'</p>

  <p>'No; I should say it is a tattoo mark. It is too indefinite for a gilded
  device. And I should say further that the tattooing is done in vermilion, as
  carbon tattooing would cast no visible shadow.'</p>

  <p>'I think you must be mistaken about that,' said Dr. Norbury, 'but we shall
  see, if the Director allows us to unroll the mummy. By the way, those little
  objects in front of the knees are metallic, I suppose?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, they are metallic. But they are not in front of the knees&mdash;they
  are in the knees. They are pieces of silver wire which have been I used to
  repair fractured kneecaps.'</p>

  <p>'Are you sure of that?' exclaimed Dr. Norbury, peering at the little white
  marks with ecstasy; 'because if you are, and if these objects are what you
  say they are, the mummy of Sebekhotep is an absolutely unique specimen.'</p>

  <p>'I am quite certain of it,' said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'Then,' said Dr. Norbury, 'we have made a discovery, thanks to your
  inquiring spirit. Poor John Bellingham! He little knew what a treasure he was
  giving us! How I wish he could have known! How I wish he could have been here
  with us to-night!'</p>

  <p>He paused once more to gaze in rapture at the photograph. And then
  Thorndyke, in his quiet, impassive way, said:</p>

  <p>'John Bellingham is here, Doctor Norbury. This is John Bellingham.'</p>

  <p>Dr Norbury started back and stared at Thorndyke in speechless
  amazement.</p>

  <p>'You don't mean,' he exclaimed, after a long pause, 'that this mummy is
  the body of John Bellingham!'</p>

  <p>'I do indeed. There is no doubt of it.'</p>

  <p>'But it is impossible! The mummy was here in the gallery a full three
  weeks before he disappeared.'</p>

  <p>'Not so,' said Thorndyke. 'John Bellingham was last seen alive by you and
  Mr. Jellicoe on the fourteenth of October, more than three weeks before the
  mummy left Queen Square. After that date he was never seen alive or dead by
  any person who knew him and could identify him.'</p>

  <p>Dr Norbury reflected awhile in silence. Then, in a faint voice, he
  asked:</p>

  <p>'How do you suggest that John Bellingham's body came to be inside that
  cartonnage?'</p>

  <p>'I think Mr. Jellicoe is the most likely person to be able to answer that
  question,' Thorndyke replied dryly.</p>

  <p>There was another interval of silence, and then Dr. Norbury asked
  suddenly:</p>

  <p>'But what do you suppose has become of Sebekhotep? The real Sebekhotep, I
  mean?'</p>

  <p>'I take it,' said Thorndyke, 'that the remains of Sebekhotep, or at least
  a portion of them, are at present lying in the Woodford mortuary awaiting an
  adjourned inquest.'</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke made this statement a flash of belated intelligence, mingled
  with self-contempt, fell on me. Now that the explanation was given, how
  obvious it was! And yet I, a competent anatomist and physiologist and
  actually a pupil of Thorndyke's, had mistaken those ancient bones for the
  remains of a recent body!</p>

  <p>Dr Norbury considered the last statement for some time in evident
  perplexity. 'It is all consistent enough, I must admit,' said he, at length,
  'and yet&mdash;are you quite sure there is no mistake? It seems so
  incredible.'</p>

  <p>There is no mistake, I assure you,' Thorndyke answered. 'To convince you,
  I will give you the facts in detail. First, as to the teeth. I have seen John
  Bellingham's dentist and obtained particulars from his case-book. There were
  in all five teeth that had been filled. The right upper wisdom-tooth, the
  molar next to it, and the second lower molar on the left side, had all
  extensive gold fillings. You can see them all quite plainly in the skiagraph.
  The left lower lateral incisor had a very small gold filling, which you can
  see as a nearly circular white dot. In addition to these, a filling of tin
  amalgam had been inserted while the deceased was abroad, in the second left
  upper bicuspid, the rather grey spot that we have already noticed. These
  would, by themselves, furnish ample means of identification. But in addition,
  there is the tattooed device of the eye of Osiris&mdash;-'</p>

  <p>'Horus,' murmured Dr. Norbury.</p>

  <p>'Horus, then&mdash;in the exact locality in which it was borne by the
  deceased and tattooed, apparently, with the same pigment. There are, further,
  the suture wires in the knee-caps; Sir Morgan Bennet, having looked up the
  notes of the operation, informs me that he introduced three suture wires into
  the left patella and two into the right; which is what the skiagraph shows.
  Lastly, the deceased had an old Pott's fracture on the left side. It is not
  very apparent now, but I saw it quite distinctly just now when the shadows of
  the bones were whiter. I think that you may take it that the identification
  is beyond all doubt or question.'</p>

  <p>'Yes,' agreed Dr. Norbury, with gloomy resignation, 'it sounds, as you
  say, quite conclusive. Well, well, it is a most horrible affair. Poor old
  John Bellingham! It looks uncommonly as if he had met with foul play. Don't
  you think so?'</p>

  <p>'I do,' replied Thorndyke. 'There was a mark on the right side of the
  skull that looked rather like a fracture. It was not very clear, being at the
  side, but we must develop the negative to show it.'</p>

  <p>Dr Norbury drew his breath in sharply through his teeth. 'This is a
  gruesome business, Doctor,' said he. 'A terrible business. Awkward for our
  people, too. By the way, what is our position in the matter? What steps ought
  we to take?'</p>

  <p>'You should give notice to the coroner&mdash;I will manage the
  police&mdash;and you should communicate with one of the executors of the
  will.'</p>

  <p>'Mr. Jellicoe?'</p>

  <p>'No, not Mr. Jellicoe, under the peculiar circumstances. You had better
  write to Mr. Godfrey Bellingham.'</p>

  <p>'But I rather understood that Mr. Hurst was the co-executor,' said Dr.
  Norbury.</p>

  <p>'He is, surely, as matters stand,' said Jervis.</p>

  <p>'Not at all,' replied Thorndyke. 'He was as matters stood; but he is not
  now. You are forgetting the conditions of clause two. That clause sets forth
  the conditions under which Godfrey Bellingham shall inherit the bulk of the
  estate and become the co-executor; and those conditions are: "that the body
  of the testator shall be deposited in some authorised place for the reception
  of the bodies of the dead, situate within the boundaries of, or appertaining
  to some place of worship within, the parish of St George, Bloomsbury, and St
  Giles in the Fields, or St Andrews above the Bars and St George the Martyr."
  Now Egyptian mummies are bodies of the dead, and this Museum is an authorised
  place for their reception; and this building is situate within the boundaries
  of the parish of St George, Bloomsbury. Therefore the provisions of clause
  two have been duly carried out and therefore Godfrey Bellingham is the
  principal beneficiary under the will, and the co-executor, in accordance with
  the wishes of the testator. Is that quite clear?'</p>

  <p>'Perfectly,' said Dr. Norbury; 'and a most astonishing
  coincidence&mdash;but, my dear young lady, had you not better sit down? You
  are looking very ill.'</p>

  <p>He glanced anxiously at Ruth, who was pale to the lips and was now leaning
  heavily on my arm.</p>

  <p>'I think, Berkeley,' said Thorndyke, 'you had better take Miss Bellingham
  out into the gallery, where there is more air. This has been a tremendous
  climax to all the trials she has borne so bravely. Go out with Berkeley,' he
  added gently, laying his hand on her shoulder, 'and sit down while we develop
  the other negatives. You mustn't break down now, you know, when the storm has
  passed and the sun is beginning to shine.' He held the door open and as we
  passed out his face softened into a smile of infinite kindness. 'You won't
  mind my locking you out,' said he; 'this is a photographic dark-room at
  present.'</p>

  <p>The key grated in the lock and we turned away into the dim gallery. It was
  not quite dark, for a beam of moonlight filtered in here and there through
  the blinds that covered the sky-lights. We walked on slowly, her arm linked
  in mine, and for a while neither of us spoke. The great rooms were very
  silent and peaceful and solemn. The hush, the stillness, the mystery of the
  half-seen forms in the cases around, were all in harmony with the deeply-felt
  sense of a great deliverance that filled our hearts.</p>

  <p>We had passed through into the next room before either of us broke the
  silence. Insensibly our hands had crept together, and as they met and clasped
  with mutual pressure, Ruth exclaimed: 'How dreadful and tragic it is! Poor,
  poor Uncle John! It seems as if he had come back from the world of shadows to
  tell us of this awful thing. But, O God! what a relief it is!'</p>

  <p>She caught her breath in one or two quick sobs and pressed my hand
  passionately.</p>

  <p>'It is over, dearest,' I said. 'It is gone for ever. Nothing remains but
  the memory of your sorrow and your noble courage and patience.'</p>

  <p>'I can't realise it yet,' she murmured. 'It has been like a frightful,
  interminable dream.'</p>

  <p>'Let us put it away,' said I, 'and think only of the happy life that is
  opening.'</p>

  <p>She made no reply, and only a quick catch in her breath, now and again,
  told of the long agony that she had endured with such heroic calm.</p>

  <p>We walked on slowly, scarcely disturbing the silence with our soft
  footfalls, through the wide doorway into the second room. The vague shapes of
  mummy-cases standing erect in the wall-cases, loomed out dim and gigantic,
  silent watchers keeping their vigil with the memories of untold centuries
  locked in their shadowy breasts. They were an awesome company. Reverend
  survivors from a vanished world, they looked out from the gloom of their
  abiding-place, but with no shade of menace or of malice in their silent
  presence; rather with a solemn benison on the fleeting creatures of
  to-day.</p>

  <p>Half-way along the room a ghostly figure, somewhat aloof from its
  companions, showed a dim, pallid blotch where its face would have been. With
  one accord we halted before it.</p>

  <p>'Do you know who this is, Ruth?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Of course I do,' she answered. 'It is Artemidorus.'</p>

  <p>We stood, hand in hand, facing the mummy, letting our memories fill in the
  vague silhouette with its well-remembered details. Presently I drew her
  nearer to me and whispered:</p>

  <p>'Ruth! do you remember when we last stood here?'</p>

  <p>'As if I could ever forget!' she answered passionately. 'Oh, Paul! The
  sorrow of it! The misery! How it wrung my heart to tell you! Were you very
  unhappy when I left you?'</p>

  <p>'Unhappy! I never knew, until then, what real, heart-breaking sorrow was.
  It seemed as if the light had gone out of my life for ever. But there was
  just one little spot of brightness left.'</p>

  <p>'What was that?'</p>

  <p>'You made me a promise, dear&mdash;a solemn promise; and I felt&mdash;at
  least I hoped&mdash;that the day would come, if I only waited patiently, when
  you would be able to redeem it.'</p>

  <p>She crept closer to me and yet closer, until her head nestled on my
  shoulder and her soft cheek lay against mine.</p>

  <p>'Dear heart,' I whispered, 'is it now? Is the time fulfilled?'</p>

  <p>'Yes, dearest,' she murmured softly. 'It is now&mdash;and for ever.'</p>

  <p>Reverently I folded her in my arms; gathered her to the heart that
  worshipped her utterly. Henceforth no sorrows could hurt us, no misfortunes
  vex; for we should walk hand in hand on our earthly pilgrimage and find the
  way all too short.</p>

  <p>Time, whose sands run out with such unequal swiftness for the just and the
  unjust, the happy and the wretched, lagged, no doubt, with the toilers in the
  room that we had left. But for us its golden grains trickled out apace, and
  left the glass empty before we had begun to mark their passage. The turning
  of a key and the opening of a door aroused us from our dream of perfect
  happiness. Ruth raised her head to listen, and our lips met for one brief
  moment. Then, with a silent greeting to the friend who had looked on our
  grief and witnessed our final happiness, we turned and retraced our steps
  quickly, filling the great empty rooms with chattering echoes.</p>

  <p>'We won't go back into the dark-room&mdash;which isn't dark now,' said
  Ruth.</p>

  <p>'Why not?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'Because&mdash;when I came out I was very pale; and I'm&mdash;well, I
  don't think I am very pale now. Besides, poor Uncle John is in
  there&mdash;and&mdash;I should be ashamed to look at him with my selfish
  heart overflowing with happiness.'</p>

  <p>'You needn't be,' said I. 'It is the day of our lives and we have a right
  to be happy. But you shan't go in, if you don't wish to,' and I accordingly
  steered her adroitly past the beam of light that streamed from the open
  door.</p>

  <p>'We have developed four negatives,' said Thorndyke, as he emerged with the
  others, 'and I am leaving them in the custody of Doctor Norbury, who will
  sign each when they are dry, as they may have to be put in evidence. What are
  you going to do?'</p>

  <p>I looked at Ruth to see what she wished.</p>

  <p>'If you won't think me ungrateful,' said she, 'I should rather be alone
  with my father to-night. He is very weak, and&mdash;'</p>

  <p>'Yes, I understand,' I said hastily. And I did. Mr. Bellingham was a man
  of strong emotions and would probably be somewhat overcome by the sudden
  change of fortune and the news of his brother's tragic death.</p>

  <p>'In that case,' said Thorndyke, 'I will bespeak your services. Will you go
  on and wait for me at my chambers, when you have seen Miss Bellingham
  home?'</p>

  <p>I agreed to this, and we set forth under the guidance of Dr. Norbury (who
  carried an electric lamp) to return by the way we had come; two of us, at
  least, in a vastly different frame of mind. The party broke up at the
  entrance gates, and as Thorndyke wished my companion 'Good-night,' she held
  his hand and looked up in his face with swimming eyes.</p>

  <p>'I haven't thanked you, Doctor Thorndyke,' she said, 'and I don't feel
  that I ever can. What you have done for me and my father is beyond all
  thanks. You have saved his life and you have rescued me from the most
  horrible ignominy. Good-bye! and God bless you!'</p>

  <p>The hansom that bowled along eastward&mdash;at most unnecessary
  speed&mdash;bore two of the happiest human beings within the wide boundaries
  of the town. I looked at my companion as the lights of the street shone into
  the cab, and was astonished at the transformation. The pallor of her cheek
  had given place to a rosy pink; the hardness, the tension, the haggard
  self-repression that had aged her face, were all gone, and the girlish
  sweetness that had so bewitched me in the early days of our love had stolen
  back. Even the dimple was there when the sweeping lashes lifted and her eyes
  met mine in a smile of infinite tenderness.</p>

  <p>Little was said on that brief journey. It was happiness enough to sit,
  hand clasped in hand, and know that our time of trial was past; that no cross
  of Fate could ever part us now.</p>

  <p>The astonished cabman set us down, according to instructions, at the
  entrance to Nevill's Court, and watched us with open mouth as we vanished
  into the narrow passage. The court had settled down for the night, and no one
  marked our return; no curious eye looked down on us from the dark house-front
  as we said 'Good-bye' just inside the gate.</p>

  <p>'You will come and see us to-morrow, dear, won't you?' she asked.</p>

  <p>'Do you think it possible that I could stay away, then?'</p>

  <p>'I hope not, but come as early as you can. My father will be positively
  frantic to see you; because I shall have told him, you know. And, remember,
  that it is you who have brought us this great deliverance. Good-night,
  Paul.'</p>

  <p>'Good-night, sweetheart.'</p>

  <p>She put up her face frankly to be kissed and then ran up to the ancient
  door; whence she waved me a last good-bye. The shabby gate in the wall closed
  behind me and hid her from my sight; but the light of her love went with me
  and turned the dull street into a path of glory.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XIX. A STRANGE SYMPOSIUM</h3>

  <p>IT came upon me with something of a shock of surprise to find the scrap of
  paper still tacked to the oak of Thorndyke's chambers. So much had happened
  since I had last looked on it that it seemed to belong to another epoch of my
  life. I removed it thoughtfully and picked out the tack before entering, and
  then, closing the inner door, but leaving the oak open, I lit the gas and
  fell to pacing the room.</p>

  <p>What a wonderful episode it had been! How the whole aspect of the world
  had been changed in a moment by Thorndyke's revelation! At another time,
  curiosity would have led me to endeavour to trace back the train of reasoning
  by which the subtle brain of my teacher had attained this astonishing
  conclusion. But now my own happiness held exclusive possession of my
  thoughts. The image of Ruth filled the field of my mental vision. I saw her
  again as I had seen her in the cab with her sweet, pensive face and downcast
  eyes; I felt again the touch of her soft cheek and the parting kiss by the
  gate, so frank and simple, so intimate and final.</p>

  <p>I must have waited quite a long time, though the golden minutes sped
  unreckoned, for when my two colleagues arrived they tendered needless
  apologies.</p>

  <p>'And I suppose,' said Thorndyke, 'you have been wondering what I wanted
  you for.'</p>

  <p>I had not, as a matter of fact, given the matter a moment's
  consideration.</p>

  <p>'We are going to call on Mr. Jellicoe,' Thorndyke explained. 'There is
  something behind this affair, and until I have ascertained what it is, the
  case is not complete from my point of view.'</p>

  <p>'Wouldn't it have done as well to-morrow?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'It might; and then it might not. There is an old saying as to catching a
  weasel asleep. Mr. Jellicoe is a somewhat wide-awake person, and I think it
  best to introduce him to Inspector Badger at the earliest possible
  moment.'</p>

  <p>'The meeting of a weasel and a badger suggests a sporting interview,'
  remarked Jervis. 'But you don't expect Jellicoe to give himself away, do
  you?'</p>

  <p>'He can hardly do that, seeing that there is nothing to give away. But I
  think he may make a statement. There were some exceptional circumstances, I
  feel sure.'</p>

  <p>'How long have you known that the body was in the Museum?' I asked.</p>

  <p>'About thirty or forty seconds longer than you have, I should say.'</p>

  <p>'Do you mean,' I exclaimed, 'that you did not know until the negative was
  developed?'</p>

  <p>'My dear fellow,' he replied, 'do you suppose that, if I had had certain
  knowledge where the body was, I should have allowed that noble girl to go on
  dragging out a lingering agony of suspense that I could have cut short in a
  moment? Or that I should have made these humbugging pretences of scientific
  experiments if a more dignified course had been open to me?'</p>

  <p>'As to the experiments,' said Jervis, 'Norbury could hardly have refused
  if you had taken him into your confidence.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed he could, and probably would. My "confidence" would have involved
  a charge of murder against a highly respectable gentleman who was well known
  to him. He would probably have referred me to the police, and then what could
  I have done? I had plenty of suspicions, but not a single solid fact.'</p>

  <p>Our discussion was here interrupted by hurried footsteps on the stairs and
  a thundering rat-tat on our knocker.</p>

  <p>As Jervis opened the door, Inspector Badger burst into the room in a
  highly excited state.</p>

  <p>'What is all this, Doctor Thorndyke?' he asked. 'I see you've sworn an
  information against Mr. Jellicoe, and I have a warrant to arrest him; but
  before anything else is done I think it right to tell you that we have more
  evidence than is generally known pointing to quite a different quarter.'</p>

  <p>'Derived from Mr. Jellicoe's information,' said Thorndyke. 'But the fact
  is that I have just examined and identified the body at the British Museum,
  where it was deposited by Mr. Jellicoe. I don't say that he murdered John
  Bellingham&mdash;though that is what appearances suggest&mdash;but I do say
  that he will have to account for his secret disposal of the body.'</p>

  <p>Inspector Badger was thunderstruck. Also he was visibly annoyed. The salt
  which Mr. Jellicoe had so adroitly sprinkled on the constabulary tail
  appeared to develop irritating properties, for when Thorndyke had given him a
  brief outline of the facts he stuck his hands in his pockets and exclaimed
  gloomily:</p>

  <p>'Well, I'm hanged! And to think of all the time and trouble I've spent on
  those damned bones! I suppose they were just a plant?'</p>

  <p>'Don't let us disparage them,' said Thorndyke. 'They have played a useful
  part. They represent the inevitable mistake that every criminal makes sooner
  or later. The murderer will always do a little too much. If he would only lie
  low and let well alone, the detective might whistle for a clue. But it is
  time we were starting.'</p>

  <p>'Are we all going?' asked the inspector, looking at me in particular with
  no very gracious recognition.</p>

  <p>'We will all come with you,' said Thorndyke; 'but you will, naturally,
  make the arrest in the way that seems best to you.'</p>

  <p>'It's a regular procession,' grumbled the inspector; but he made no more
  definite objection, and we started forth on our quest.</p>

  <p>The distance from the Temple to Lincoln's Inn is not great. In five
  minutes we were at the gateway in Chancery Lane, and a couple of minutes
  later saw us gathered round the threshold of the stately old house in New
  Square.</p>

  <p>'Seems to be a light in the first-floor front,' said Badger. 'You'd better
  move away before I ring the bell.'</p>

  <p>But the precaution was unnecessary. As the inspector advanced to the
  bell-pull a head was thrust out of the open window immediately above the
  street door.</p>

  <p>'Who are you?' inquired the owner of the head in a voice which I
  recognised as that of Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'I am Inspector Badger of the Criminal Investigation Department. I wish to
  see Mr. Arthur Jellicoe.'</p>

  <p>'Then look at me. I am Mr. Arthur Jellicoe.'</p>

  <p>'I hold a warrant for your arrest, Mr. Jellicoe. You are charged with the
  murder of Mr. John Bellingham, whose body has been discovered in the British
  Museum.'</p>

  <p>'By whom?'</p>

  <p>'By Doctor Thorndyke.'</p>

  <p>'Indeed,' said Mr. Jellicoe. 'Is he here?'</p>

  <p>'Yes.'</p>

  <p>'Ha! and you wish to arrest me, I presume?'</p>

  <p>'Yes. That is what I am here for.'</p>

  <p>'Well, I will agree to surrender myself subject to certain
  conditions.'</p>

  <p>'I can't make any conditions, Mr. Jellicoe.'</p>

  <p>'No, I will make them, and you will accept them. Otherwise you will not
  arrest me.'</p>

  <p>'It's no use for you to talk like that,' said Badger. 'If you don't let me
  in I shall have to break in. And I may as well tell you,' he added
  mendaciously, 'that the house is surrounded.'</p>

  <p>'You may accept my assurance,' Mr. Jellicoe replied calmly, 'that you will
  not arrest me if you do not accept my conditions.'</p>

  <p>'Well, what are your conditions?' demanded Badger.</p>

  <p>'I desire to make a statement,' said Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'You can do that, but I must caution you that anything you say may be used
  in evidence against you.'</p>

  <p>'Naturally. But I wish to make the statement in the presence of Doctor
  Thorndyke, and I desire to hear a statement from him of the method of
  investigation by which he discovered the whereabouts of the body. That is to
  say, if he is willing.'</p>

  <p>'If you mean that we should mutually enlighten one another, I am very
  willing indeed,' said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'Very well. Then my conditions, Inspector, are that I shall hear Doctor
  Thorndyke's statement and that I shall be permitted to make a statement
  myself, and that until those statements are completed, with any necessary
  interrogation and discussion, I shall remain at liberty and shall suffer no
  molestation or interference of any kind. And I agree that, on the conclusion
  of the said proceedings, I will submit without resistance to any course that
  you may adopt.'</p>

  <p>'I can't agree to that,' said Badger.</p>

  <p>'Can't you?' said Mr. Jellicoe coldly; and after a pause he added: 'Don't
  be hasty. I have given you warning.'</p>

  <p>There was something in Mr. Jellicoe's passionless tone that disturbed the
  inspector exceedingly, for he turned to Thorndyke and said in a low tone:</p>

  <p>'I wonder what his game is? He can't get away, you know.'</p>

  <p>'There are several possibilities,' said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'M'm, yes,' said Badger, stroking his chin perplexedly.</p>

  <p>'After all, is there any objection? His statement might save trouble, and
  you'd be on the safe side. It would take you some time to break in.'</p>

  <p>'Well,' said Mr. Jellicoe, with his hand on the window, 'do you
  agree&mdash;yes or no?'</p>

  <p>'All right,' said Badger sulkily. 'I agree.'</p>

  <p>'You promise not to molest me in any way until I have quite finished?'</p>

  <p>'I promise.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Jellicoe's head disappeared and the window closed. After a short pause
  we heard the jar of massive bolts and the clank of a chain, and, as the heavy
  door swung open, Mr. Jellicoe stood revealed, calm and impassive, with an
  old-fashioned office candlestick in his hand.</p>

  <p>Who are the others?' he inquired, peering out sharply through his
  spectacles.</p>

  <p>'Oh, they are nothing to do with me,' replied Badger.</p>

  <p>They are Doctor Berkeley and Doctor Jervis,' said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>Ha!' said Mr. Jellicoe; 'very kind and attentive of them to call. Pray,
  come in, gentlemen. I am sure you will be interested to hear our little
  discussion.'</p>

  <p>He held the door open with a certain stiff courtesy, and we all entered
  the hall led by Inspector Badger. He closed the door softly and preceded us
  up the stairs and into the apartment from the window of which he had dictated
  the terms of surrender. It was a fine old room, spacious, lofty, and
  dignified, with panelled walls and a carved mantelpiece, the central
  escutcheon of which bore the initials 'J. W. P.' with the date '1671.' A
  large writing-table stood at the farther end, and behind it an iron safe.</p>

  <p>'I have been expecting this visit,' Mr. Jellicoe remarked tranquilly as he
  placed four chairs opposite the table. 'Since when?' asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'Since last Monday evening, when I had the pleasure of seeing you
  conversing with my friend Doctor Berkeley at the Inner Temple gate, and then
  inferred that you were retained in the case. That was a circumstance that had
  not been fully provided for. May I offer you gentlemen a glass of
  sherry?'</p>

  <p>As he spoke he placed on the table a decanter and a tray of glasses, and
  looked at us interrogatively with his hand on the stopper.</p>

  <p>'Well, I don't mind if I do, Mr. Jellicoe,' said Badger, on whom the
  lawyer's glance had finally settled. Mr. Jellicoe filled a glass and handed
  it to him with a stiff bow; then, with the decanter still in his hand, he
  said persuasively: 'Doctor Thorndyke, pray allow me to fill you a glass?'</p>

  <p>'No, thank you,' said Thorndyke, in a tone so decided that the inspector
  looked round at him quickly. And as Badger caught his eye, the glass which he
  was about to raise to his lips became suddenly arrested and was slowly
  returned to the table untasted.</p>

  <p>'I don't want to hurry you, Mr. Jellicoe,' said the inspector, 'but it's
  rather late, and I should like to get this business settled. What is it that
  you wish to do?'</p>

  <p>'I desire,' replied Mr. Jellicoe, 'to make a detailed statement of the
  events that have happened, and I wish to hear from Doctor Thorndyke precisely
  how he arrived at his very remarkable conclusion. When this has been done I
  shall be entirely at your service; and I suggest that it would be more
  interesting if Doctor Thorndyke would give us his statement before I furnish
  you with the actual facts.'</p>

  <p>'I am entirely of your opinion,' said Thorndyke.&mdash;I</p>

  <p>'Then in that case,' said Mr. Jellicoe, 'I suggest that you disregard me,
  and address your remarks to your friends as if I were not present.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke acquiesced with a bow, and Mr. Jellicoe, having seated himself
  in his elbow-chair behind the table, poured himself out a glass of water,
  selected a cigarette from a neat silver case, lighted it deliberately, and
  leaned back to listen at his ease.</p>

  <p>'My first acquaintance with this case,' Thorndyke began without preamble,
  'was made through the medium of the daily papers about two years ago; and I
  may say that, although I had no interest in it beyond the purely academic
  interest of a specialist in a case that lies in his particular speciality, I
  considered it with deep attention. The newspaper reports contained no
  particulars of the relations of the parties that could furnish any hints as
  to motives on the part of any of them, but merely a bare statement of the
  events. And this was a distinct advantage, inasmuch as it left one to
  consider the facts of the case without regard to motive&mdash;to balance the
  prima facie probabilities with an open mind. And it may surprise you to learn
  that those prima facie probabilities pointed from the very first to that
  solution which has been put to the test of experiment this evening. Hence it
  will be well for me to begin by giving the conclusions that I reached by
  reasoning from the facts set forth in the newspapers before any of the
  further facts came to my knowledge.</p>

  <p>'From the facts as stated in the newspaper reports it is obvious that
  there were four possible explanations of the disappearance.</p>

  <p>'1. The man might be alive and in hiding. This was highly improbable, for
  the reasons that were stated by Mr. Loram at the late hearing of the
  application, and for a further reason that I shall mention presently.</p>

  <p>'2. He might have died by accident or disease, and his body failed to be
  identified. This was even more improbable, seeing that he carried on his
  person abundant means of identification, including visiting cards.</p>

  <p>'3. He might have been murdered by some stranger for the sake of his
  portable property. This was highly improbable for the same reason: his body
  could hardly have failed to be identified.</p>

  <p>'These three explanations are what we may call the outside explanations.
  They touched none of the parties mentioned; they were all obviously
  improbable on general grounds; and to all of them there was one conclusive
  answer&mdash;the scarab which was found in Godfrey Bellingham's garden. Hence
  I put them aside and gave my attention to the fourth explanation. This was
  that the missing man had been made away with by one of the parties mentioned
  in the report. But, since the reports mentioned three parties, it was evident
  that there was a choice of three hypotheses namely:</p>

  <p>4' (a) That John Bellingham had been made away with by Hurst; or (b) by
  the Bellinghams; or (c) by Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'Now, I have constantly impressed on my pupils that the indispensable
  question that must be asked at the outset of such an inquiry as this is,
  "When was the missing person last undoubtedly seen or known to be alive?"
  That is the question that I asked myself after reading the newspaper report;
  and the answer was, that he was last certainly seen alive on the fourteenth
  of October, nineteen hundred and two, at 141, Queen Square, Bloomsbury. Of
  the fact that he was alive at that time and place there could be no doubt
  whatever; for he was seen at the same moment by two persons, both of whom
  were intimately acquainted with him, and one of whom, Doctor Norbury, was
  apparently a disinterested witness. After that date he was never seen, alive
  or dead, by any person who knew him and was able to identify him. It was
  stated that he had been seen on the twenty-third of November following by the
  housemaid of Mr. Hurst; but as this person was unacquainted with him, it was
  uncertain whether the person whom she saw was or was not John Bellingham.</p>

  <p>'Hence the disappearance dated, not from the twenty-third of November, as
  every one seems to have assumed, but from the fourteenth of October; and the
  question was not, "What became of John Bellingham after he entered Mr.
  Hurst's house?" but, "What became of him after his interview in Queen
  Square?"</p>

  <p>'But as soon as I had decided that that interview must form the real
  starting point of the inquiry, a most striking set of circumstances came into
  view. It became obvious that if Mr. Jellicoe had had any reason for wishing
  to make away with John Bellingham, he had such an opportunity as seldom falls
  to the lot of an intending murderer.</p>

  <p>'Just consider the conditions. John Bellingham was known to be setting out
  alone upon a journey beyond the sea. His exact destination was not stated. He
  was to be absent for an undetermined period, but at least three weeks. His
  disappearance would occasion no comment; his absence would lead to no
  inquiries, at least for several weeks, during which the murderer would have
  leisure quietly to dispose of the body and conceal all traces of the crime.
  The conditions were, from a murderer's point of view, ideal.</p>

  <p>'But that was not all. During that very period of John Bellingham's
  absence Mr. Jellicoe was engaged to deliver to the British Museum what was
  admittedly a dead human body; and that body was to be enclosed in a sealed
  case. Could any more perfect or secure method of disposing of a body be
  devised by the most ingenious murderer? The plan would have had only one weak
  point: the mummy would be known to have left Queen Square after the
  disappearance of John Bellingham, and suspicion might in the end have arisen.
  To this point I shall return presently; meanwhile we will consider the second
  hypothesis&mdash;that the missing man was made away with by Mr. Hurst.</p>

  <p>'Now, there seemed to be no doubt that some person, purporting to be John
  Bellingham, did actually visit Mr. Hurst's house; and he must either have
  left the house or remained in it. If he left, he did so surreptitiously; if
  he remained, there could be no reasonable doubt that he had been murdered and
  that his body had been concealed. Let us consider the probabilities in each
  case.</p>

  <p>'Assuming&mdash;as every one seems to have done&mdash;that the visitor was
  really John Bellingham, we are dealing with a responsible, middle-aged
  gentleman, and the idea that such a person would enter a house, announce his
  intention of staying, and then steal away unobserved is very difficult to
  accept. Moreover, he would appear to have come down to Eltham by rail
  immediately on landing in England, leaving his luggage in the cloak-room at
  Charing Cross. This pointed to a definiteness of purpose quite inconsistent
  with his casual disappearance from the house.</p>

  <p>'On the other hand, the idea that he might have been murdered by Hurst was
  not inconceivable. The thing was physically possible. If Bellingham had
  really been in the study when Hurst came home, the murder could have been
  committed&mdash;by appropriate means&mdash;and the body temporarily concealed
  in the cupboard or elsewhere. But, although possible it was not at all
  probable. There was no real opportunity. The risk and the subsequent
  difficulties would be very great; there was not a particle of positive
  evidence that a murder had occurred; and the conduct of Hurst in immediately
  leaving the house in possession of the servants is quite inconsistent with
  the supposition that there was a body concealed in it. So that, while it is
  almost impossible to believe that John Bellingham left the house of his own
  accord, it is equally difficult to believe that he did not leave it.</p>

  <p>'But there is a third possibility, which, strange to say, no one seems to
  have suggested. Supposing that the visitor was not John Bellingham at all,
  but some one who was personating him? That would dispose of the difficulties
  completely. The strange disappearance ceases to be strange, for a personator
  would necessarily make off before Mr. Hurst should arrive and discover the
  imposture. But if we accept this supposition, we raise two further questions:
  "Who was the personator?" and "What was the object of the personation?"</p>

  <p>'Now, the personator was clearly not Hurst himself, for he would have been
  recognised by his housemaid; he was therefore either Godfrey Bellingham or
  Mr. Jellicoe or some other person; and as no other person was mentioned in
  the newspaper reports I confined my speculations to these two.</p>

  <p>'And, first, as to Godfrey Bellingham. It did not appear whether he was or
  was not known to the housemaid, so I assumed&mdash;wrongly, as it turns
  out&mdash;that he was not. Then he might have been the personator. But why
  should he have personated his brother? He could not have already committed
  the murder. There had not been time enough. He would have had to leave
  Woodford before John Bellingham had set out from Charing Cross. And even if
  he had committed the murder, he would have no object in raising this
  commotion. His cue would have been to remain quiet and know nothing. The
  probabilities were all against the personator being Godfrey Bellingham.</p>

  <p>'Then could it be Mr. Jellicoe? The answer to this question is contained
  in the answer to the further question: What could have been the object of the
  personation?</p>

  <p>'What motive could this unknown person have had in appearing, announcing
  himself as John Bellingham, and forthwith vanishing? There could only have
  been one motive: that, namely, of fixing the date of John Bellingham's
  disappearance&mdash;of furnishing a definite moment at which he was last seen
  alive.</p>

  <p>'But who was likely to have had such a motive? Let us see.</p>

  <p>'I said just now that if Mr. Jellicoe had murdered John Bellingham and
  disposed of the body in the mummy-case, he would have been absolutely safe
  for the time being. But there would be a weak spot in his armour. For a month
  or more the disappearance of his client would occasion no remark. But
  presently, when he failed to return, inquiries would be set on foot; and then
  it would appear that no one had seen him since he left Queen Square. Then it
  would be noted that the last person with whom he was seen was Mr. Jellicoe.
  It might, further, be remembered that the mummy had been delivered to the
  Museum some time after the missing man was last seen alive. And so suspicion
  might arise and be followed by disastrous investigations. But supposing it
  should be made to appear that John Bellingham had been seen alive more than a
  month after his interview with Mr. Jellicoe and some weeks after the mummy
  had been deposited in the Museum? Then Mr. Jellicoe would cease to be in any
  way connected with the disappearance and henceforth would be absolutely
  safe.</p>

  <p>'Hence, after carefully considering this part of the newspaper report, I
  came to the conclusion that the mysterious occurrence at Mr. Hurst's home had
  only one reasonable explanation, namely, that the visitor was not John
  Bellingham, but some one personating him; and that that some one was Mr.
  Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'It remains to consider the case of Godfrey Bellingham and his daughter,
  though I cannot understand how any sane person can have seriously suspected
  either' (here Inspector Badger smiled a sour smile). 'The evidence against
  them was negligible, for there was nothing to connect them with the affair
  save the finding of the scarab on their premises; and that event, which might
  have been highly suspicious under other circumstances, was robbed of any
  significance by the fact that the scarab was found on a spot which had been
  passed a few minutes previously by the other suspected party, Hurst. The
  finding of the scarab did, however, establish two important conclusions:
  namely, that John Bellingham had probably met with foul play, and that of the
  four persons present when it was found, one at least had had possession of
  the body. As to which of the four was the one, the circumstances furnished
  only a hint, which was this: If the scarab had been purposely dropped, the
  most likely person to find it was the one who dropped it. And the person who
  discovered it was Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'Following up this hint, if we ask ourselves what motive Mr. Jellicoe
  could have had for dropping it&mdash;assuming him to be the
  murderer&mdash;the answer is obvious. It would not be his policy to fix the
  crime on any particular person, but rather to set up a complication of
  conflicting evidence which would occupy the attention of investigators and
  divert it from himself.</p>

  <p>'Of course, if Hurst had been the murderer, he would have had a sufficient
  motive for dropping the scarab, so that the case against Mr. Jellicoe was not
  conclusive; but the fact that it was he who found it was highly
  significant.</p>

  <p>'This completes the analysis of the evidence contained in the original
  newspaper report describing the circumstances of the disappearance. The
  conclusions that followed from it were, as you will have seen:</p>

  <p>'1. That the missing man was almost certainly dead, as proved by the
  finding of the scarab after his disappearance.</p>

  <p>'2. That he had probably been murdered by one or more of four persons, as
  proved by the finding of the scarab on the premises occupied by two of them
  and accessible to the others.</p>

  <p>'3. That, of those four persons, one&mdash;Mr. Jellicoe&mdash;was the last
  person who was known to have been in the company of the missing man; had had
  an exceptional opportunity for committing the murder; and was known to have
  delivered a dead body to the Museum subsequently to the disappearance.</p>

  <p>'4. That the supposition that Mr. Jellicoe had committed the murder
  rendered all the other circumstances of the disappearance clearly
  intelligible, whereas on any other supposition they were quite
  inexplicable.</p>

  <p>'The evidence of the newspaper report, therefore, clearly pointed to the
  probability that John Bellingham had been murdered by Mr. Jellicoe and his
  body concealed in the mummy-case.</p>

  <p>'I do not wish to give you the impression that I, then and there, believed
  that Mr. Jellicoe was the murderer. I did not. There was no reason to suppose
  that the report contained all the essential facts, and I merely considered it
  speculatively as a study in probabilities. But I did decide that that was the
  only probable conclusion from the facts that were given.</p>

  <p>'Nearly two years had passed before I heard anything more of the case.
  Then it was brought to my notice by my friend, Doctor Berkeley, and I became
  acquainted with certain new facts, which I will consider in the order in
  which they became known to me.</p>

  <p>'The first new light on the case came from the will. As soon as I had read
  the document I felt convinced that there was something wrong. The testator's
  evident intention was that his brother should inherit the property, whereas
  the construction of the will was such as almost certainly to defeat that
  intention. The devolution of the property depended on the burial
  clause&mdash;clause two; but the burial arrangements would ordinarily be
  decided by the executor, who happened to be Mr. Jellicoe. Thus the will left
  the disposition of the property under the control of Mr. Jellicoe, though his
  action could have been contested.</p>

  <p>'Now, this will, although drawn up by John Bellingham, was executed in Mr.
  Jellicoe's office as is proved by the fact that it was witnessed by two of
  his clerks. He was the testator's lawyer, and it was his duty to insist on
  the will being properly drawn. Evidently he did nothing of the kind, and this
  fact strongly suggested some kind of collusion on his part with Hurst, who
  stood to benefit by the miscarriage of the will. And this was the odd feature
  in the case; for whereas the party responsible for the defective provisions
  was Mr. Jellicoe, the party who benefited was Hurst.</p>

  <p>'But the most startling peculiarity of the will was the way in which it
  fitted the circumstances of the disappearance. It looked as if clause two had
  been drawn up with those very circumstances in view. Since, however, the will
  was ten years old, this was impossible. But if clause two could not have been
  devised to fit the disappearance, could the disappearance have been devised
  to fit clause two? That was by no means impossible: under the circumstances
  it looked rather probable. And if it had been so contrived, who was the agent
  in that contrivance? Hurst stood to benefit, but there was no evidence that
  he even knew the contents of the will. There only remained Mr. Jellicoe, who
  had certainly connived at the misdrawing of the will for some purpose of his
  own&mdash;some dishonest purpose.</p>

  <p>'The evidence of the will, then, pointed to Mr. Jellicoe as the agent in
  the disappearance, and, after reading it, I definitely suspected him of the
  crime.</p>

  <p>'Suspicion, however, is one thing and proof is another; I had not nearly
  enough evidence to justify me in laying an information, and I could not
  approach the Museum officials without making a definite accusation. The great
  difficulty of the case was that I could discover no motive. I could not see
  any way in which Mr. Jellicoe would benefit by the disappearance. His own
  legacy was secure, whenever and however the testator died. The murder and
  concealment apparently benefited Hurst alone; and, in the absence of any
  plausible motive, the facts required to be much more conclusive than they
  were.'</p>

  <p>'Did you form absolutely no opinion as to motive?' asked Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>He put the question in a quiet, passionless tone, as if he were discussing
  some cause celebre in which he had nothing more than a professional interest.
  Indeed, the calm, impersonal interest that he displayed in Thorndyke's
  analysis, his unmoved attention, punctuated by little nods of approval at
  each telling point in the argument, were the most surprising features of this
  astounding interview.</p>

  <p>'I did form an opinion,' replied Thorndyke, 'but it was merely
  speculative, and I was never able to confirm it. I discovered that about ten
  years ago Mr. Hurst had been in difficulties and that he had suddenly raised
  a considerable sum of money, no one knew how or on what security. I observed
  that this event coincided with the execution of the will, and I surmised that
  there might be some connection between them. But that was only a surmise;
  and, as the proverb has it, "He discovers who proves." I could prove nothing,
  so that I never discovered Mr. Jellicoe's motive, and I don't know it
  now.'</p>

  <p>'Don't you really?' said Mr. Jellicoe, in something approaching a tone of
  animation. He laid down the end of his cigarette, and, as he selected another
  from the silver case, he continued: 'I think that is the most interesting
  feature of your really remarkable analysis. It does you great credit. The
  absence of motive would have appeared to most persons a fatal objection to
  the theory of, what I may call, the prosecution. Permit me to congratulate
  you on the consistency and tenacity with which you have pursued the actual,
  visible facts.'</p>

  <p>He bowed stiffly to Thorndyke (who returned his bow with equal stiffness),
  lighted a fresh cigarette, and once more leaned back in his chair with the
  calm, attentive manner of a man who is listening to a lecture or a musical
  performance.</p>

  <p>'The evidence, then, being insufficient to act upon,' Thorndyke resumed,
  'there was nothing for it but to wait for some new facts. Now, the study of a
  large series of carefully conducted murders brings into view an almost
  invariable phenomenon. The cautious murderer, in his anxiety to make himself
  secure, does too much; and it is this excess of precaution that leads to
  detection. It happens constantly; indeed, I may say that it always
  happens&mdash;in those murders that are detected; of those that are not we
  say nothing&mdash;and I had strong hopes that it would happen in this case.
  And it did.</p>

  <p>'At the very moment when my client's case seemed almost hopeless, some
  human remains were discovered at Sidcup. I read the account of the discovery
  in the evening paper, and, scanty as the report was, it recorded enough facts
  to convince me that the inevitable mistake had been made.'</p>

  <p>'Did it, indeed?' said Mr. Jellicoe. 'A mere, inexpert, hearsay report! I
  should have supposed it to be quite valueless from a scientific point of
  view.'</p>

  <p>'So it was,' said Thorndyke. 'But it gave the date of the discovery and
  the locality, and it also mentioned what bones had been found. Which were all
  vital facts. Take the question of time. These remains, after lying perdu for
  two years, suddenly come to light just as the parties&mdash;who have also
  been lying perdu&mdash;have begun to take action in respect of the will; in
  fact, within a week or two of the hearing of the application. It was
  certainly a remarkable coincidence. And when the circumstances that
  occasioned the discovery were considered, the coincidence became more
  remarkable still. For these remains were found on land actually belonging to
  John Bellingham, and their discovery resulted from certain operations (the
  clearing of the watercress-beds) carried out on behalf of the absent
  landlord. But by whose orders were those works undertaken? Clearly by the
  orders of the landlord's agent. But the landlord's agent was known to be Mr.
  Jellicoe. Therefore these remains were brought to light at this peculiarly
  opportune moment by the action of Mr. Jellicoe. The coincidence, I say again,
  was very remarkable.</p>

  <p>'But what instantly arrested my attention on reading the newspaper report
  was the unusual manner in which the arm had been separated; for, beside the
  bones of the arm proper, there were those of what anatomists call the
  "shoulder-girdle"&mdash;the shoulder-blade and collar-bone. This was very
  remarkable. It seemed to suggest a knowledge of anatomy, and yet no murderer,
  even if he possessed such knowledge, would make a display of it on such an
  occasion. It seemed to me that there must be some other explanation.
  Accordingly, when other remains had come to light and all had been collected
  at Woodford, I asked my friend Berkeley to go down there and inspect them. He
  did so, and this is what he found:</p>

  <p>'Both arms had been detached in the same peculiar manner; both were
  complete, and all the bones were from the same body. The bones were quite
  clean&mdash;of soft structures, I mean. There were no cuts, scratches or
  marks on them. There was not a trace of adipocere&mdash;the peculiar waxy
  soap that forms in bodies that decay in water or in a damp situation. The
  right hand had been detached at the time the arm was thrown into the pond,
  and the left ring finger had been separated and had vanished. This latter
  fact had attracted my attention from the first, but I will leave its
  consideration for the moment and return to it later.'</p>

  <p>'How did you discover that the hand had been detached?' Mr. Jellicoe
  asked.</p>

  <p>'By the submersion marks,' replied Thorndyke. 'It was lying on the bottom
  of the pond in a position which would have been impossible if it had been
  attached to the arm.'</p>

  <p>'You interest me exceedingly,' said Mr. Jellicoe. 'It appears that a
  medico-legal expert finds "books in the running brooks, sermons in bones, and
  evidence in everything." But don't let me interrupt you.'</p>

  <p>'Doctor Berkeley's observations,' Thorndyke resumed, 'together with the
  medical evidence at the inquest, led me to certain conclusions.</p>

  <p>'Let me state the facts which were disclosed.</p>

  <p>'The remains which had been assembled formed a complete human skeleton
  with the exception of the skull, one finger, and the legs from the knee to
  the ankle, including both knee-caps. This was a very impressive fact; for the
  bones that were missing included all those which could have been identified
  as belonging or not belonging to John Bellingham; and the bones that were
  present were the unidentifiable remainder.</p>

  <p>'It had a suspicious appearance of selection.</p>

  <p>'But the parts that were present were also curiously suggestive. In all
  cases the mode of dismemberment was peculiar; for an ordinary person would
  have divided the knee-joint leaving the kneecap attached to the thigh,
  whereas it had evidently been left attached to the shin-bone; and the head
  would most probably have been removed by cutting through the neck instead of
  being neatly detached from the spine. And all these bones were almost
  entirely free from marks or scratches such as would naturally occur in an
  ordinary dismemberment, and all were quite free from adipocere. And now as to
  the conclusions which I drew from these facts. First, there was the peculiar
  grouping of the bones. What was the meaning of that? Well, the idea of a
  punctilious anatomist was obviously absurd, and I put it aside. But was there
  any other explanation? Yes, there was. The bones had appeared in the natural
  groups that are held together by ligaments; and they had separated at points
  where they were attached principally by muscles. The knee-cap, for instance,
  which really belongs to the thigh, is attached to it by muscle, but to the
  shin-bone by a stout ligament. And so with the bones of the arm; they are
  connected to one another by ligaments; but to the trunk only by muscle,
  excepting at one end of the collarbone.</p>

  <p>But this was a very significant fact. Ligament decays much more slowly
  than muscle, so that in a body of which the muscles had largely decayed the
  bones might still be held together by ligament. The peculiar grouping
  therefore suggested that the body had been partly reduced to a skeleton
  before it was dismembered; that it had then been merely pulled apart and not
  divided with a knife.</p>

  <p>'This suggestion was remarkably confirmed by the total absence of
  knife-cuts or scratches.</p>

  <p>'Then there was the fact that all the bones were quite free from
  adipocere. Now, if an arm or a thigh should be deposited in water and left
  undisturbed to decay, it is certain that large masses of adipocere would be
  formed. Probably more than half of the flesh would be converted into this
  substance. The absence of adipocere therefore proved that the bulk of the
  flesh had disappeared or been removed from the bones before they were
  deposited in the pond. That, in fact, it was not a body, but a skeleton, that
  had been deposited.</p>

  <p>'But what kind of skeleton? If it was the recent skeleton of a murdered
  man, then the bones had been carefully stripped of flesh so as to leave the
  ligaments intact. But this was highly improbable; for there could be no
  object in preserving the ligaments. And the absence of scratches was against
  this view.</p>

  <p>'Then they did not appear to be graveyard bones. The collection was too
  complete. It is very rare to find a graveyard skeleton of which many of the
  small bones are not missing. And such bones are usually more or less
  weathered or friable.</p>

  <p>'They did not appear to be bones such as may be bought at an osteological
  dealer's, for these usually have perforations to admit the macerating fluid
  to the marrow cavities. Dealers' bones, too, are very seldom all from the
  same body; and the small bones of the hand are drilled with holes to enable
  them to be strung on catgut.</p>

  <p>'They were not dissecting-room bones, as there was no trace of red lead in
  the openings for the nutrient arteries.</p>

  <p>'What the appearances did suggest was that these were parts of a body
  which had decayed in a very dry atmosphere (in which no adipocere would be
  formed), and which had been pulled or broken apart. Also that the ligaments
  which held the body&mdash;or rather skeleton&mdash;together were brittle and
  friable as suggested by the detached hand, which had probably broken off
  accidentally. But the only kind of body that completely answered this
  description is an Egyptian mummy. A mummy, it is true, has been more or less
  preserved; but on exposure to the air of such a climate as ours it perishes
  rapidly, the ligaments being the last of the soft parts to disappear.</p>

  <p>'The hypothesis that these bones were parts of a mummy naturally suggested
  Mr. Jellicoe. If he had murdered John Bellingham and concealed his body in
  the mummy-case, he would have a spare mummy on his hands, and that mummy
  would have been exposed to the air and to somewhat rough handling.</p>

  <p>'A very interesting circumstance connected with these remains was that the
  ring finger was missing. Now, fingers have on sundry occasions been detached
  from dead hands for the sake of the rings on them. But in such cases the
  object has been to secure a valuable ring uninjured. If this hand was the
  hand of John Bellingham, there was no such object. The purpose was to prevent
  identification; and that purpose would have been more easily, and much more
  completely, achieved by sacrificing the ring, by filing through it or
  breaking it off the finger. The appearances, therefore, did not quite agree
  with the apparent purpose.</p>

  <p>'Then, could there be any other purpose with which they agreed better?
  Yes, there could.</p>

  <p>'If it had happened that John Bellingham were known to have worn a ring on
  that finger, and especially if that ring fitted tightly, the removal of the
  finger would serve a very useful purpose. It would create an impression that
  the finger had been removed on account of a ring, to prevent identification;
  which impression would, in turn, produce a suspicion that the hand was that
  of John Bellingham. And yet it would not be evidence that could be used to
  establish identity. Now, if Mr. Jellicoe were the murderer and had the body
  hidden elsewhere, vague suspicion would be precisely what he would desire,
  and positive evidence what he would wish to avoid.</p>

  <p>'It transpired later that John Bellingham did wear a ring on that finger
  and that the ring fitted very tightly. Whence it followed that the absence of
  the finger was an additional point tending to implicate Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'And now let us briefly review this mass of evidence. You will see that it
  consists of a multitude of items, each either trivial or speculative. Up to
  the time of the actual discovery I had not a single crucial fact, nor any
  clue as to motive. But, slight as the individual points of evidence were,
  they pointed with impressive unanimity to one person&mdash;Mr. Jellicoe.
  Thus:</p>

  <p>'The person who had the opportunity to commit murder and dispose of the
  body was Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'The deceased was last certainly seen alive with Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'An unidentified human body was delivered to the Museum by Mr.
  Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'The only person who could have a motive for personating the deceased was
  Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'The only known person who could possibly have done so was Mr.
  Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'One of the two persons who could have had a motive for dropping the
  scarab was Mr. Jellicoe. The person who found that scarab was Mr. Jellicoe,
  although, owing to his defective eyesight and his spectacles, he was the most
  unlikely person of those present to find it.</p>

  <p>'The person who was responsible for the execution of the defective will
  was Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'Then as to the remains. They were apparently not those of John
  Bellingham, but parts of a particular kind of body. But the only person who
  was known to have had such a body in his possession was Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'The only person who could have had any motive for substituting those
  remains for the remains of the deceased was Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'Finally, the person who caused the discovery of those remains at that
  singularly opportune moment was Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'This was the sum of the evidence that was in my possession up to the time
  of the hearing and, indeed, for some time after, and it was not enough to act
  upon. But when the case had been heard in Court, it was evident either that
  the proceedings would be abandoned&mdash;which was unlikely&mdash;or that
  there would be new developments.</p>

  <p>'I watched the progress of events with profound interest. An attempt had
  been made (by Mr. Jellicoe or some other person) to get the will administered
  without producing the body of John Bellingham; and that attempt had failed.
  The coroner's jury had refused to identify the remains; the Probate Court had
  refused to presume the death of the testator. As affairs stood the will could
  not be administered.</p>

  <p>'What would be the next move?</p>

  <p>'It was virtually certain that it would consist in the production of
  something which would identify the unrecognised remains as those of the
  testator.</p>

  <p>'But what would that something be?</p>

  <p>'The answer to that question would contain the answer to another question:
  Was my solution of the mystery the true solution?</p>

  <p>'If I was wrong, it was possible that some of the undoubtedly genuine
  bones of John Bellingham might presently be discovered; for instance, the
  skull, the knee-cap, or the left fibula, by any of which the remains could be
  positively identified.</p>

  <p>'If I was right, only one thing could possibly happen. Mr. Jellicoe would
  have to play the trump card that he had been holding back in case the Court
  should refuse the application; a card that he was evidently reluctant to
  play.</p>

  <p>'He would have to produce the bones of the mummy's finger, together with
  John Bellingham's ring. No other course was possible.</p>

  <p>'But not only would the bones and the ring have to be found together. They
  would have to be found in a place which was accessible to Mr. Jellicoe, and
  so far under his control that he could determine the exact time when the
  discovery should be made.</p>

  <p>'I waited patiently for the answer to my question. Was I right or was I
  wrong?</p>

  <p>'And, in due course, the answer came.</p>

  <p>'The bones and the ring were discovered in the well in the grounds of
  Godfrey Bellingham's late house. That house was the property of John
  Bellingham. Mr. Jellicoe was John Bellingham's agent. Hence it was
  practically certain that the date on which the well was emptied was settled
  by Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'The oracle had spoken.</p>

  <p>'The discovery proved conclusively that the bones were not those of John
  Bellingham (for if they had been the ring would have been unnecessary for
  identification). But if the bones were not John Bellingham's, the ring was;
  from which followed the important corollary that whoever had deposited those
  bones in the well had had possession of the body of John Bellingham. And
  there could be no doubt that that person was Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'On receiving this final confirmation of my conclusions, I applied
  forthwith to Doctor Norbury for permission to examine the mummy of
  Sebekhotep, with the result that you are already acquainted with.'</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke concluded, Mr. Jellicoe regarded him thoughtfully for a
  moment and then said: 'You have given us a most complete and lucid exposition
  of your method of investigation, sir. I have enjoyed it exceedingly, and
  should have profited by it hereafter&mdash;under other circumstances. Are you
  sure you won't allow me to fill your glass?' He touched the stopper of the
  decanter, and Inspector Badger ostentatiously consulted his watch.</p>

  <p>'Time is running on, I fear,' said Mr. Jellicoe.</p>

  <p>'It is, indeed,' Badger assented emphatically.</p>

  <p>'Well, I need not detain you long,' said the lawyer. 'My statement is a
  narration of events. But I desire to make it, and you, no doubt, will be
  interested to hear it.'</p>

  <p>He opened the silver case and selected a fresh cigarette, which, however,
  he did not light. Inspector Badger produced a funereal notebook, which he
  laid open on his knee; and the rest of us settled ourselves in our chairs
  with no little curiosity to hear Mr. Jellicoe's statement.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XX. THE END OF THE CASE</h3>

  <p>A PROFOUND silence had fallen on the room and its occupants. Mr. Jellicoe
  sat with his eyes fixed on the table as if deep in thought, the unlighted
  cigarette in one hand, the other grasping the tumbler of water. Presently
  Inspector Badger coughed impatiently and he looked up. 'I beg your pardon,
  gentlemen,' he said. 'I am keeping you waiting.'</p>

  <p>He took a sip from the tumbler, opened a match-box and took out a match,
  but apparently altering his mind, laid it down and commenced:</p>

  <p>'The unfortunate affair which has brought you here to-night, had its
  origin ten years ago. At that time my friend Hurst became suddenly involved
  in financial difficulties&mdash;am I speaking too fast for you, Mr.
  Badger?'</p>

  <p>'No not at all,' replied Badger. 'I am taking it down in shorthand.'</p>

  <p>'Thank you,' said Mr. Jellicoe. 'He became involved in serious
  difficulties and came to me for assistance. He wished to borrow five thousand
  pounds to enable him to meet his engagements. I had a certain amount of money
  at my disposal, but I did not consider Hurst's security satisfactory;
  accordingly I felt compelled to refuse. But on the very next day, John
  Bellingham called on me with a draft of his will which he wished me to look
  over before it was executed.</p>

  <p>'It was an absurd will, and I nearly told him so; but then an idea
  occurred to me in connection with Hurst. It was obvious to me, as soon as I
  glanced through the will, that, if the burial clause was left as the testator
  had drafted it, Hurst had a very good chance of inheriting the property; and,
  as I was named as the executor I should be able to give full effect to that
  clause. Accordingly, I asked for a few days to consider the will, and then I
  called upon Hurst and made a proposal to him; which was this: That I should
  advance him five thousand pounds without security; that I should ask for no
  repayment, but that he should assign to me any interest that he might have or
  acquire in the estate of John Bellingham up to ten thousand pounds, or
  two-thirds of any sum that he might inherit if over that amount. He asked if
  John had yet made any will, and I replied, quite correctly, that he had not.
  He inquired if I knew what testamentary arrangements John intended to make,
  and again I answered, quite correctly, that I believed John proposed to
  devise the bulk of his property to his brother, Godfrey.</p>

  <p>'Thereupon, Hurst accepted my proposal; I made him the advance and he
  executed the assignment. After a few days' delay, I passed the will as
  satisfactory. The actual document was written from the draft by the testator
  himself; and a fortnight after Hurst had executed the assignment, John signed
  the will in my office. By the provisions of that will I stood an excellent
  chance of becoming virtually the principal beneficiary, unless Godfrey should
  contest Hurst's claim and the Court should override the conditions of clause
  two.</p>

  <p>'You will now understand the motives which governed my subsequent actions.
  You will also see, Doctor Thorndyke, how very near to the truth your
  reasoning carried you; and you will understand, as I wish you to do, that Mr.
  Hurst was no party to any of those proceedings which I am about to
  describe.</p>

  <p>'Coming now to the interview in Queen Square in October, nineteen hundred
  and two, you are aware of the general circumstances from my evidence in
  Court, which was literally correct up to a certain point. The interview took
  place in a room on the third floor, in which were stored the cases which John
  had brought with him from Egypt. The mummy was unpacked, as were some other
  objects that he was not offering to the Museum, but several cases were still
  unopened. At the conclusion of the interview I accompanied Doctor Norbury
  down to the street door, and we stood on the doorstep conversing for perhaps
  a quarter of an hour. Then Doctor Norbury went away and I returned
  upstairs.</p>

  <p>'Now the house in Queen Square is virtually a museum. The upper part is
  separated from the lower by a massive door which opens from the hall and
  gives access to the staircase and which is fitted with a Chubb night-latch.
  There are two latch-keys, of which John used to keep one and I the other. You
  will find them both in the safe behind me. The caretaker had no key and no
  access to the upper part of the house unless admitted by one of us.</p>

  <p>'At the time when I came in, after Doctor Norbury had left, the caretaker
  was in the cellar, where I could hear him breaking coke for the hot-water
  furnace. I had left John on the third floor opening some of the packing-cases
  by the light of a lamp with a tool somewhat like a plasterer's hammer; that
  is, a hammer with a small axe-blade at the reverse of the head. As I stood
  talking to Doctor Norbury, I could hear him knocking out the nails and
  wrenching up the lids; and when I entered the doorway leading to the stairs,
  I could still hear him. Just as I closed the staircase door behind me, I
  heard a rumbling noise from above; then all was still.</p>

  <p>'I went up the stairs to the second floor, where, as the staircase was all
  in darkness, I stopped to light the gas. As I turned to ascend the next
  flight, I saw a hand projecting over the edge of the halfway landing. I ran
  up the stairs, and there, on the landing, I saw John lying huddled up in a
  heap at the foot of the top flight. There was a wound at the side of his
  forehead from which a little blood was trickling. The case-opener lay on the
  floor close by him and there was blood on the axe-blade. When I looked up the
  stairs I saw a rag of torn matting over the top stair.</p>

  <p>'It was quite easy to see what had happened. He had walked quickly out on
  the landing with the case-opener in his hand. His foot had caught in the torn
  matting and he had pitched head foremost down the stairs still holding the
  case-opener. He had fallen so that his head had come down on the upturned
  edge of the axe-blade; he had then rolled over and the case-opener had
  dropped from his hand.</p>

  <p>'I lit a wax match and stooped down to look at him. His head was in a very
  peculiar position, which made me suspect that his neck was broken. There was
  extremely little bleeding from the wound; he was perfectly motionless; I
  could detect no sign of breathing; and I felt no doubt that he was dead.</p>

  <p>'It was an exceedingly regrettable affair, and it placed me, as I
  perceived at once, in an extremely awkward position. My first impulse was to
  send the caretaker for a doctor and a policeman; but a moment's reflection
  convinced me that there were serious objections to this course.</p>

  <p>'There was nothing to show that I had not, myself, knocked him down with
  the case-opener. Of course, there was nothing to show that I had; but we were
  alone in the house with the exception of the caretaker, who was down in the
  basement out of earshot.</p>

  <p>'There would be an inquest. At the inquest inquiries would be made as to
  the will which was known to exist. But as soon as the will was produced,
  Hurst would become suspicious. He would probably make a statement to the
  coroner and I should be charged with the murder. Or, even if I were not
  charged, Hurst would suspect me and would probably repudiate the assignment;
  and, under the circumstances, it would be practically impossible for me to
  enforce it. He would refuse to pay and I could not take my claim into
  Court.</p>

  <p>I sat down on the stairs just above poor John's body and considered the
  matter in detail. At the worst, I stood a fair chance of hanging; at the
  best, I stood to lose close upon fifty thousand pounds. These were not
  pleasant alternatives.</p>

  <p>'Supposing, on the other hand, I concealed the body and gave out that John
  had gone to Paris. There was, of course, the risk of discovery, in which case
  I should certainly be convicted of the murder. But if no discovery occurred,
  I was not only safe from suspicion, but I secured the fifty thousand pounds.
  In either case there was considerable risk, but in one there was the
  certainty of loss, whereas in the other there was a material advantage to
  justify the risk. The question was whether it would be possible to conceal
  the body. If it were, then the contingent profit was worth the slight
  additional risk. But a human body is a very difficult thing to dispose of,
  especially to a person of so little scientific culture as myself.</p>

  <p>'It is curious that I considered this question for a quite considerable
  time before the obvious solution presented itself. I turned over at least a
  dozen methods of disposing of the body, and rejected them all as
  impracticable. Then, suddenly, I remembered the mummy upstairs.</p>

  <p>'At first it only occurred to me as a fantastic possibility that I could
  conceal the body in the mummy-case. But as I turned over the idea I began to
  see that it was really practicable; and not only practicable but easy; and
  not only easy but eminently safe. If once the mummy-case was in the Museum, I
  was rid of it for ever.</p>

  <p>'The circumstances were, as you, sir, have justly observed, singularly
  favourable. There would be no hue and cry, no hurry, no anxiety; but ample
  time for all the necessary preparations. Then the mummy-case itself was
  curiously suitable. Its length was ample, as I knew from having measured it.
  It was a cartonnage of rather flexible material and had an opening behind,
  secured with a lacing so that it could be opened without injury. Nothing need
  be cut but the lacing, which could be replaced. A little damage might be done
  in extracting the mummy and in introducing the deceased; but such cracks as
  might occur would be of no importance. For here again Fortune favoured me.
  The whole of the back of the mummy-case was coated with bitumen, and it would
  be easy when once the deceased was safely inside to apply a fresh coat, which
  would cover up not only the cracks but also the new lacing.</p>

  <p>'After careful consideration, I decided to adopt the plan. I went
  downstairs and sent the caretaker on an errand to the Law Courts. Then I
  returned and carried the deceased up to one of the third-floor rooms, where I
  removed his clothes and laid him out on a long packing-case in the position
  in which he would lie in the mummy-case. I folded his clothes neatly and
  packed them, with the exception of his boots, in a suit-case that he had been
  taking to Paris and which contained nothing but his night-clothes, toilet
  articles, and a change of linen. By the time I had done this and thoroughly
  washed the oilcloth on the stairs and landing, the caretaker had returned. I
  informed him that Mr. Bellingham had started for Paris and then I went home.
  The upper part of the house was, of course, secured by the Chubb lock, but I
  had also&mdash;ex abundantia caulela&mdash;locked the door of the room in
  which I had deposited the deceased.</p>

  <p>'I had, of course, some knowledge of the methods of embalming, but
  principally of those employed by the ancients. Hence, on the following day, I
  went to the British Museum library and consulted the most recent works on the
  subject; and exceedingly interesting they were, as showing the remarkable
  improvements that modern knowledge has effected in this ancient art. I need
  not trouble you with details that are familiar to you. The process that I
  selected as the simplest for a beginner was that of formalin injection, and I
  went straight from the Museum to purchase the necessary materials. I did not,
  however, buy an embalming syringe: the book stated that an ordinary
  anatomical injecting syringe would answer the same purpose, and I thought it
  a more discreet purchase.</p>

  <p>'I fear that I bungled the injection terribly, although I had carefully
  studied the plates in a treatise on anatomy&mdash;Gray's, I think. However,
  if my methods were clumsy, they were quite effectual. I carried out the
  process on the evening of the third day; and when I locked up the house that
  night, I had the satisfaction of knowing that poor John's remains were secure
  from corruption and decay.</p>

  <p>'But this was not enough. The great weight of a fresh body as compared
  with that of a mummy would be immediately noticed by those who had the
  handling of the mummy-case. Moreover, the damp from the body would quickly
  ruin the cartonnage and would cause a steamy film on the inside of the glass
  case in which it would be exhibited. And this would probably lead to an
  examination. Clearly, then, it was necessary that the remains of the deceased
  should be thoroughly dried before they were enclosed in the cartonnage.</p>

  <p>'Here my unfortunate deficiency in scientific knowledge was a great
  drawback. I had no idea how this result would be achieved and, in the end,
  was compelled to consult a taxidermist, to whom I represented that I wished
  to collect some small animals and reptiles and rapidly dry them for
  convenience of transport. By this person I was advised to immerse the dead
  animals in a jar of methylated spirit for a week and then expose them in a
  current of warm, dry air.</p>

  <p>'But the plan of immersing the remains of the deceased in ajar of
  methylated spirit was obviously impracticable. However, I bethought me that
  we had in our collection a porphyry sarcophagus, the cavity of which had been
  shaped to receive a small mummy in its case. I tried the deceased in the
  sarcophagus and found that he just fitted the cavity loosely. I obtained a
  few gallons of methylated spirit, which I poured into the cavity, just
  covering the body, and then I put on the lid and luted it down air-tight with
  putty. I trust I do not weary you with these particulars?'</p>

  <p>'I'll ask you to cut it as short as you can, Mr. Jellicoe,' said Badger.
  'It has been a long yarn and time is running on.'</p>

  <p>'For my part,' said Thorndyke, 'I find these details deeply interesting
  and instructive. They fill in the outline that I had drawn by inference.'</p>

  <p>'Precisely,' said Mr. Jellicoe; 'then I will proceed.</p>

  <p>'I left the deceased soaking in the spirit for a fortnight and then took
  him out, wiped him dry, and laid him on four cane-bottomed chairs just over
  the hot-water pipes, and I let a free current of air pass through the room.
  The result interested me exceedingly. By the end of the third day the hands
  and feet had become quite dry and shrivelled and horny&mdash;so that the ring
  actually dropped off the shrunken finger&mdash;the nose looked like a fold of
  parchment; and the skin of the body was so dry and smooth that you could have
  engrossed a lease on it. For the first day or two I turned the deceased at
  intervals so that he should dry evenly, and then I proceeded to get the case
  ready. I divided the lacing and extracted the mummy with great
  care&mdash;with great care as to the case, I mean; for the mummy suffered
  some injury in the extraction. It was very badly embalmed, and so brittle
  that it broke in several places while I was getting it out; and when I
  unrolled it the head separated and both the arms came off.</p>

  <p>'On the sixth day after the removal from the sarcophagus, I took the
  bandages that I had removed from Sebekhotep and very carefully wrapped the
  deceased in them, sprinkling powdered myrrh and gum benzoin freely on the
  body and between the folds of the wrappings to disguise the faint odour of
  the spirit and the formalin that still lingered about the body. When the
  wrappings had been applied, the deceased really had a most workmanlike
  appearance; he would have looked quite well in a glass case even without the
  cartonnage, and I felt almost regretful at having to put him out of sight for
  ever.</p>

  <p>'It was a difficult business getting him into the case without assistance,
  and I cracked the cartonnage badly in several places before he was safely
  enclosed. But I got him in at last, and then, when I had closed up the case
  with a new lacing, I applied a fresh layer of bitumen which effectually
  covered up the cracks and the new cord. A dusty cloth dabbed over the bitumen
  when it was dry disguised its newness, and the cartonnage with its tenant was
  ready for delivery. I notified Doctor Norbury of the fact, and five days
  later he came and removed it to the Museum.</p>

  <p>'Now that the main difficulty was disposed of, I began to consider the
  further difficulty to which you, sir, have alluded with such admirable
  perspicuity. It was necessary that John Bellingham should make one more
  appearance in public before sinking into final oblivion.</p>

  <p>'Accordingly, I devised the visit to Hurst's house, which was calculated
  to serve two purposes. It created a satisfactory date for the disappearance,
  eliminating me from any connection with it, and by throwing some suspicion on
  Hurst it would make him more amenable&mdash;less likely to dispute my claim
  when he learned the provisions of the will.</p>

  <p>'The affair was quite simple. I knew that Hurst had changed his servants
  since I was last at his house, and I knew his habits. On that day I took the
  suit-case to Charing Cross and deposited it in the cloak-room, called at
  Hurst's office to make sure that he was there, and went from thence direct to
  Cannon Street and caught the train to Eltham. On arriving at the house, I
  took the precaution to remove my spectacles&mdash;the only distinctive
  feature of my exterior&mdash;and was duly shown into the study at my request.
  As soon as the housemaid had left the room I quietly let myself out by the
  French window, which I closed behind me but could not fasten, went out at the
  side gate and closed that also behind me, holding the bolt of the latch back
  with my pocket-knife so that I need not slam the gate to shut it.</p>

  <p>'The other events of that day, including the dropping of the scarab, I
  need not describe, as they are known to you. But I may fitly make a few
  remarks on the unfortunate tactical error into which I fell in respect of the
  bones. That error arose, as you have doubtless perceived, from the lawyer's
  incurable habit of underestimating the scientific expert. I had no idea mere
  bones were capable of furnishing so much information to a man of science.</p>

  <p>'The way in which the affair came about was this: the damaged mummy of
  Sebekhotep, perishing gradually by exposure to the air, was not only an
  eyesore to me: it was a definite danger. It was the only remaining link
  between me and the disappearance. I resolved to be rid of it and cast about
  for some means of destroying it. And then, in an evil moment, the idea of
  utilising it occurred to me.</p>

  <p>'There was an undoubted danger that the Court might refuse to presume
  death after so short an interval; and if the permission should be postponed,
  the will might never be administered during my lifetime. Hence, if these
  bones of Sebekhotep could be made to simulate the remains of the deceased
  testator, a definite good would be achieved. But I knew that the entire
  skeleton could never be mistaken for his. The deceased had broken his
  knee-caps and damaged his ankle, injuries which I assumed would leave some
  permanent trace. But if a judicious selection of the bones were deposited in
  a suitable place, together with some object clearly identifiable as
  appertaining to the deceased, it seemed to me that the difficulty would be
  met. I need not trouble you with details. The course which I adopted is known
  to you with the attendant circumstances, even to the accidental detachment of
  the right hand&mdash;which broke off as I was packing the arm in my handbag.
  Erroneous as that course was, it would have been successful but for the
  unforeseen contingency of your being retained in the case.</p>

  <p>'Thus, for nearly two years, I remained in complete security. From time to
  time I dropped in at the Museum to see if the deceased was keeping in good
  condition; and on those occasions I used to reflect with satisfaction on the
  gratifying circumstance&mdash;accidental though it was&mdash;that his wishes,
  as expressed (very imperfectly) in clause two, had been fully complied with,
  and that without prejudice to my interests.</p>

  <p>'The awakening came on that evening when I saw you at the Temple gate
  talking with Doctor Berkeley. I suspected immediately that something was gone
  amiss and that it was too late to take any useful action. Since then, I have
  waited here in hourly expectation of this visit. And now the time has come.
  You have made the winning move and it remains only for me to pay my debts
  like an honest gambler.'</p>

  <p>He paused and quietly lit his cigarette. Inspector Badger yawned and put
  away his notebook.</p>

  <p>'Have you done, Mr. Jellicoe?' the inspector asked. 'I want to carry out
  my contract to the letter, you know, though it's getting devilish late.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Jellicoe took his cigarette from his mouth and drank a glass of
  water.</p>

  <p>'I forgot to ask,' he said, 'whether you unrolled the mummy&mdash;if I may
  apply the term to the imperfectly treated remains of my deceased client.'</p>

  <p>'I did not open the mummy-case,' replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>'You did not!' exclaimed Mr. Jellicoe. 'Then how did you verify your
  suspicions?'</p>

  <p>'I took an X-ray photograph.'</p>

  <p>'Ah! Indeed!' Mr. Jellicoe pondered for some moments. 'Astonishing!' he
  murmured; 'and most ingenious. The resources of science at the present day
  are truly wonderful.'</p>

  <p>'Is there anything more that you want to say?' asked Badger; 'because if
  you don't, time's up.'</p>

  <p>'Anything more?' Mr. Jellicoe repeated slowly; 'anything more?
  No&mdash;I&mdash;think&mdash;think&mdash;the time&mdash;is&mdash;up.
  Yes&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;time&mdash;'</p>

  <p>He broke off and sat with a strange look fixed on Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>His face had suddenly undergone a curious change. It looked shrunken and
  cadaverous and his lips had assumed a peculiar cherry-red colour.</p>

  <p>'Is anything the matter, Mr. Jellicoe?' Badger asked uneasily. 'Are you
  not feeling well, sir?'</p>

  <p>Mr. Jellicoe did not appear to have heard the question, for he returned no
  answer, but sat motionless, leaning back in his chair, with his hands spread
  out on the table and his strangely intent gaze bent on Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>Suddenly his head dropped on his breast and his body seemed to collapse;
  and as with one accord we sprang to our feet, he slid forward off his chair
  and disappeared under the table.</p>

  <p>'Good Lord! The man's fainted!' exclaimed Badger.</p>

  <p>In a moment he was down on his hands and knees, trembling with excitement,
  groping under the table. He dragged the unconscious lawyer out into the light
  and knelt over him, staring into his face.</p>

  <p>'What's the matter with him, Doctor?' he asked, looking up at Thorndyke.
  'Is it apoplexy? Or is it a heart attack, think you?'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke shook his head, though he stooped and put his fingers on the
  unconscious man's wrist.</p>

  <p>'Prussic acid or potassium cyanide is what the appearances suggest,' he
  replied.</p>

  <p>'But can't you do anything?' demanded the inspector.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke dropped the arm, which fell limply to the floor.</p>

  <p>'You can't do much for a dead man,' he said.</p>

  <p>'Dead! Then he has slipped through our fingers after all!'</p>

  <p>'He has anticipated the sentence. That is all.' Thorndyke spoke in an
  even, impassive tone which struck me as rather strange, considering the
  suddenness of the tragedy, as did also the complete absence of surprise in
  his manner. He seemed to treat the occurrence as a perfectly natural one.</p>

  <p>Not so Inspector Badger; who rose to his feet and stood with his hands
  thrust into his pockets scowling sullenly down at the dead lawyer.</p>

  <p>'I was an infernal fool to agree to his blasted conditions,' he growled
  savagely.</p>

  <p>'Nonsense,' said Thorndyke. 'If you had broken in you would have found a
  dead man. As it was you found a live man and obtained an important statement.
  You acted quite properly.'</p>

  <p>'How do you suppose he managed it?' asked Badger.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke held out his hand.</p>

  <p>'Let us look at his cigarette case,' said he.</p>

  <p>Badger extracted the little silver case from the dead man's pocket and
  opened it. There were five cigarettes in it, two of which were plain, while
  the other three were gold-tipped. Thorndyke took out one of each kind and
  gently pinched their ends. The gold-tipped one he returned; the plain one he
  tore through, about a quarter of an inch from the end; when two little black
  tabloids dropped out on to the table. Badger eagerly picked one up and was
  about to smell it when Thorndyke grasped his wrist. 'Be careful,' said he;
  and when he had cautiously sniffed at the tabloid&mdash;held at a safe
  distance from his nose&mdash;he added: 'Yes, potassium cyanide. I thought so
  when his lips turned that queer colour. It was in that last cigarette; you
  can see that he has bitten the end off.'</p>

  <p>For some time we stood silently looking down at the still form stretched
  on the floor. Presently Badger looked up.</p>

  <p>'As you pass the porter's lodge on your way out,' said he, 'you might just
  drop in and tell him to send a constable to me.'</p>

  <p>'Very well,' said Thorndyke. 'And by the way, Badger, you had better tip
  that sherry back into the decanter and put it under lock and key, or else
  pour it out of the window.'</p>

  <p>'Gad, yes!' exclaimed the inspector. 'I'm glad you mentioned it. We might
  have had an inquest on a constable as well as a lawyer. Good-night,
  gentlemen, if you are off.'</p>

  <p>We went out and left him with his prisoner&mdash;passive enough, indeed,
  according to his ambiguously worded promise. As we passed through the gateway
  Thorndyke gave the inspector's message, curtly and without comment, to the
  gaping porter, and then we issued forth into Chancery Lane.</p>

  <p>We were all silent and very grave, and I thought that Thorndyke seemed
  somewhat moved. Perhaps Mr. Jellicoe's last intent look&mdash;which I suspect
  he knew to be the look of a dying man&mdash;lingered in his memory as it did
  in mine. Half-way down Chancery Lane he spoke for the first time; and then it
  was only to ejaculate, 'Poor devil!'</p>

  <p>Jervis took him up. 'He was a consummate villain, Thorndyke.'</p>

  <p>'Hardly that,' was the reply. 'I should rather say that he was non-moral.
  He acted without malice and without scruple or remorse. His conduct exhibited
  a passionateless expediency which was dreadful because utterly unhuman. But
  he was a strong man&mdash;a courageous, self-contained man, and I had been
  better pleased if it could have been ordained that some other hand than mine
  should let the axe fall.'</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's compunction may appear strange and inconsistent, but yet his
  feeling was also my own. Great as was the misery and suffering that this
  inscrutable man had brought into the lives of those I loved, I forgave him;
  and in his downfall forgot the callous relentlessness with which he had
  pursued his evil purpose. For it was he who had brought Ruth into my life;
  who had opened for me the Paradise of Love into which I had just entered. And
  so my thoughts turned away from the still shape that lay on the floor of the
  stately old room in Lincoln's Inn, away to the sunny vista of the future,
  where I should walk hand in hand with Ruth until my time, too, should come;
  until I, too, like the grim lawyer, should hear the solemn evening bell
  bidding me put out into the darkness of the silent sea.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-03"
     id="ch-03"></a>III. &mdash; THE ART OF THE DETECTIVE STORY</h2>

  <p class="first">THE status in the world of letters of that type of fiction
  which finds its principal motive in the unravelment of crimes or similar
  intricate mysteries presents certain anomalies. By the critic and the
  professedly literary person the detective story&mdash;to adopt the
  unprepossessing name by which this class of fiction is now universally
  known&mdash;is apt to be dismissed contemptuously as outside the pale of
  literature, to be conceived of as a type of work produced by half-educated
  and wholly incompetent writers for consumption by office boys, factory girls,
  and other persons devoid of culture and literary taste.</p>

  <p>That such works are produced by such writers for such readers is an
  undeniable truth; but in mere badness of quality the detective story holds no
  monopoly. By similar writers and for similar readers there are produced love
  stories, romances, and even historical tales of no better quality. But there
  is this difference: that, whereas the place in literature of the love story
  or the romance has been determined by the consideration of the masterpieces
  of each type, the detective story appears to have been judged by its
  failures. The status of the whole class has been fixed by an estimate formed
  from inferior samples.</p>

  <p>What is the explanation of this discrepancy? Why is it that, whereas a bad
  love story or romance is condemned merely on its merits as a defective
  specimen of a respectable class, a detective story is apt to be condemned
  without trial in virtue of some sort of assumed original sin? The assumption
  as to the class of reader is manifestly untrue. There is no type of fiction
  that is more universally popular than the detective story. It is a familiar
  fact that many famous men have found in this kind of reading their favourite
  recreation, and that it is consumed with pleasure, and even with enthusiasm,
  by many learned and intellectual men, not infrequently in preference to any
  other form of fiction.</p>

  <p>This being the case, I again ask for an explanation of the contempt in
  which the whole genus of detective fiction is held by the professedly
  literary. Clearly, a form of literature which arouses the enthusiasm of men
  of intellect and culture can be affected by no inherently base quality. It
  cannot be foolish, and is unlikely to be immoral. As a matter of fact, it is
  neither. The explanation is probably to be found in the great proportion of
  failures; in the tendency of the tyro and the amateur perversely to adopt
  this difficult and intricate form for their 'prentice efforts; in the crude
  literary technique often associated with otherwise satisfactory productions;
  and perhaps in the falling off in quality of the work of regular novelists
  when they experiment in this department of fiction, to which they may be
  adapted neither by temperament nor by training.</p>

  <p>Thus critical judgment has been formed, not on what the detective story
  can be and should be, but on what it too frequently was in the past when
  crudely and incompetently done. Unfortunately, this type of work is still
  prevalent; but it is not representative. In late years there has arisen a new
  school of writers who, taking the detective story seriously, have set a more
  exacting standard, and whose work, admirable alike in construction and
  execution, probably accounts for the recent growth in popularity of this
  class of fiction. But, though representative, they are a minority; and it is
  still true that a detective story which fully develops the distinctive
  qualities proper to its genus, and is, in addition, satisfactory in diction,
  in background treatment, in characterization, and in general literary
  workmanship is probably the rarest of all forms of fiction.</p>

  <p>The rarity of good detective fiction is to be explained by a fact which
  appears to be little recognized either by critics or by authors; the fact,
  namely, that a completely executed detective story is a very difficult and
  highly technical work, a work demanding in its creator the union of qualities
  which, if not mutually antagonistic, are at least seldom met with united in a
  single individual. On the one hand, it is a work of imagination, demanding
  the creative, artistic faculty; on the other, it is a work of ratiocination,
  demanding the power of logical analysis and subtle and acute reasoning; and,
  added to these inherent qualities, there must be a somewhat extensive outfit
  of special knowledge. Evidence alike of the difficulty of the work and the
  failure to realize it is furnished by those occasional experiments of
  novelists of the orthodox kind which have been referred to, experiments which
  commonly fail by reason of a complete misunderstanding of the nature of the
  work and the qualities that it should possess.</p>

  <p>A widely prevailing error is that a detective story needs to be highly
  sensational. It tends to be confused with the mere crime story, in which the
  incidents&mdash;tragic, horrible, even repulsive&mdash;form the actual theme,
  and the quality aimed at is horror&mdash;crude and pungent sensationalism.
  Here the writer's object is to make the reader's flesh creep; and since that
  reader has probably, by a course of similar reading, acquired a somewhat
  extreme degree of obtuseness, the violence of the means has to be
  progressively increased in proportion to the insensitiveness of the subject.
  The sportsman in the juvenile verse sings:</p>

  <p class="verse">I shoot the hippopotamus with bullets made of platinum<br>
  Because if I use leaden ones his hide is sure to flatten 'em;</p>

  <p class="first">and that, in effect, is the position of the purveyor of
  gross sensationalism. His purpose is, at all costs, to penetrate his reader's
  mental epidermis, to the density of which he must needs adjust the weight and
  velocity of his literary projectile.</p>

  <p>Now no serious author will complain of the critic's antipathy to mere
  sensationalism. It is a quality that is attainable by the least gifted writer
  and acceptable to the least critical reader; and, unlike the higher qualities
  of literature, which beget in the reader an increased receptiveness and more
  subtle appreciation, it creates, as do drugs and stimulants, a tolerance
  which has to be met by an increase of the dose. The entertainments of the
  cinema have to be conducted on a scale of continually increasing
  sensationalism. The wonders that thrilled at first become commonplace, and
  must be reinforced by marvels yet more astonishing. Incident must be piled on
  incident, climax on climax, until any kind of construction becomes
  impossible. So, too, in literature. In the newspaper serial of the
  conventional type, each instalment of a couple of thousand words, or less,
  must wind up with a thrilling climax, blandly ignored at the opening of the
  next instalment; while that ne plus ultra of wild sensationalism, the film
  novel, in its extreme form is no more than a string of astonishing incidents,
  unconnected by any intelligible scheme, each incident an independent
  "thrill," unexplained, unprepared for, devoid alike of antecedents and
  consequences.</p>

  <p>Some productions of the latter type are put forth in the guise of
  detective stories, with which they apparently tend to be confused by some
  critics. They are then characterized by the presentation of a
  crime&mdash;often in impossible circumstances which are never accounted
  for&mdash;followed by a vast amount of rushing to and fro of detectives or
  unofficial investigators in motor cars, aeroplanes, or motor boats, with a
  liberal display of revolvers or automatic pistols and a succession of
  hair-raising adventures. If any conclusion is reached, it is quite
  unconvincing, and the interest of the story to its appropriate reader is in
  the incidental matter, and not in the plot. But the application of the term
  "detective story" to works of this kind is misleading, for in the essential
  qualities of the type of fiction properly so designated they are entirely
  deficient. Let us now consider what those qualities are.</p>

  <p>The distinctive quality of a detective story, in which it differs from all
  other types of fiction, is that the satisfaction that it offers to the reader
  is primarily an intellectual satisfaction. This is not to say that it need be
  deficient in the other qualities appertaining to good fiction: in grace of
  diction, in humour, in interesting characterization, in picturesqueness of
  setting or in emotional presentation. On the contrary, it should possess all
  these qualities. It should be an interesting story, well and vivaciously
  told. But whereas in other fiction these are the primary, paramount
  qualities, in detective fiction they are secondary and subordinate to the
  intellectual interest, to which they must be, if necessary, sacrificed. The
  entertainment that the connoisseur looks for is an exhibition of mental
  gymnastics in which he is invited to take part; and the excellence of the
  entertainment must be judged by the completeness with which it satisfies the
  expectations of the type of reader to whom it is addressed.</p>

  <p>Thus, assuming that good detective fiction must be good fiction in general
  terms, we may dismiss those qualities which it should possess in common with
  all other works of imagination and give our attention to those qualities in
  which it differs from them and which give to it its special character. I have
  said that the satisfaction which it is designed to yield to the reader is
  primarily intellectual, and we may now consider in somewhat more detail the
  exact nature of the satisfaction demanded and the way in which it can best be
  supplied. And first we may ask: What are the characteristics of the
  representative reader? To what kind of person is a carefully constructed
  detective story especially addressed?</p>

  <p>We have seen that detective fiction has a wide popularity. The general
  reader, however, is apt to be uncritical. He reads impartially the bad and
  the good, with no very clear perception of the difference, at least in the
  technical construction. The real connoisseurs, who avowedly prefer this type
  of fiction to all others, and who read it with close and critical attention,
  are to be found among men of the definitely intellectual class: theologians,
  scholars, lawyers, and to a less extent, perhaps, doctors and men of science.
  Judging by the letters which I have received from time to time, the
  enthusiast par excellence is the clergyman of a studious and scholarly
  habit.</p>

  <p>Now the theologian, the scholar and the lawyer have a common
  characteristic: they are all men of a subtle type of mind. They find a
  pleasure in intricate arguments, in dialectical contests, in which the matter
  to be proved is usually of less consideration than the method of proving it.
  The pleasure is yielded by the argument itself and tends to be proportionate
  to the intricacy of the proof. The disputant enjoys the mental exercise, just
  as a muscular man enjoys particular kinds of physical exertion. But the
  satisfaction yielded by an argument is dependent upon a strict conformity
  with logical methods, upon freedom from fallacies of reasoning, and
  especially upon freedom from any ambiguities as to the data.</p>

  <p>By schoolboys, street-corner debaters, and other persons who are ignorant
  of the principles of discussion, debates are commonly conducted by means of
  what we may call "argument by assertion." Each disputant seeks to overwhelm
  his opponent by pelting him with statements of alleged fact, each of which
  the other disputes, and replies by discharging a volley of counterstatements,
  the truth of which is promptly denied. Thus the argument collapses in a chaos
  of conflicting assertions. The method of the skilled dialectician is exactly
  the opposite of this. He begins by making sure of the matter in dispute and
  by establishing agreement with his adversary on the fundamental data.
  Theological arguments are usually based upon propositions admitted as true by
  both parties; and the arguments of counsel are commonly concerned, not with
  questions of fact, but with the consequences deducible from evidence admitted
  equally by both sides.</p>

  <p>Thus the intellectual satisfaction of an argument is conditional on the
  complete establishment of the data. Disputes on questions of fact are of
  little, if any, intellectual interest; but in any case an argument&mdash;an
  orderly train of reasoning&mdash;cannot begin until the data have been
  clearly set forth and agreed upon by both parties. This very obvious truth is
  continually lost sight of by authors. Plots, i.e., arguments, are frequently
  based upon alleged "facts"&mdash;physical, chemical, and other&mdash;which
  the educated reader knows to be untrue, and of which the untruth totally
  invalidates conclusions drawn from them and thus destroys the intellectual
  interest of the argument.</p>

  <p>The other indispensable factor is freedom from fallacies of reasoning. The
  conclusion must emerge truly and inevitably from the premises; it must be the
  only possible conclusion, and must leave the competent reader in no doubt as
  to its unimpeachable truth.</p>

  <p>It is here that detective stories most commonly fail. They tend to be
  pervaded by logical fallacies, and especially by the fallacy of the
  undistributed middle term. The conclusion reached by the gifted investigator,
  and offered by him as inevitable, is seen by the reader to be merely one of a
  number of possible alternatives. The effect when the author's "must have
  been" has to be corrected by the reader into "might have been" is one of
  anti-climax. The promised and anticipated demonstration peters out into a
  mere suggestion; the argument is left in the air and the reader is balked of
  the intellectual satisfaction which he was seeking.</p>

  <p>Having glanced at the nature of the satisfaction sought by the reader, we
  may now examine the structure of a detective story and observe the means
  employed to furnish that satisfaction. On the general fictional qualities of
  such a story we need not enlarge excepting to contest the prevalent belief
  that detective fiction possesses no such qualities. Apart from a sustained
  love interest&mdash;for which there is usually no room&mdash;a detective
  novel need not, and should not, be inferior in narrative interest or literary
  workmanship to any other work of fiction. Interests which conflict with the
  main theme and hinder its clear exposition are evidently inadmissible; but
  humour, picturesque setting, vivid characterization and even emotional
  episodes are not only desirable on aesthetic grounds, but, if skilfully used,
  may be employed to distract the reader's attention at critical moments in
  place of the nonsensical "false clues" and other exasperating devices by
  which writers too often seek to confuse the issues. The Mystery of Edwin
  Drood shows us the superb fictional quality that is possible in a detective
  story from the hand of a master.</p>

  <p>Turning now to the technical side, we note that the plot of a detective
  novel is, in effect, an argument conducted under the guise of fiction. But it
  is a peculiar form of argument. The problem having been stated, the data for
  its solution are presented inconspicuously and in a sequence purposely
  dislocated so as to conceal their connexion; and the reader's task is to
  collect the data, to rearrange them in their correct logical sequence and
  ascertain their relations, when the solution of the problem should at once
  become obvious. The construction thus tends to fall into four stages: (1)
  statement of the problem; (2) production of the data for its solution
  ("clues"); (3) the discovery, i.e., completion of the inquiry by the
  investigator and declaration by him of the solution; (4) proof of the
  solution by an exposition of the evidence.</p>

  <p>1. The problem is usually concerned with a crime, not because a crime is
  an attractive subject, but because it forms the most natural occasion for an
  investigation of the kind required. For the same
  reason&mdash;suitability&mdash;crime against the person is more commonly
  adopted than crime against property; and murder&mdash;actual, attempted or
  suspected&mdash;is usually the most suitable of all. For the villain is the
  player on the other side; and since we want him to be a desperate player, the
  stakes must be appropriately high. A capital crime gives us an adversary who
  is playing for his life, and who consequently furnishes the best subject for
  dramatic treatment.</p>

  <p>2. The body of the work should be occupied with the telling of the story,
  in the course of which the data, or "clues," should be produced as
  inconspicuously as possible, but clearly and without ambiguity in regard to
  their essentials. The author should be scrupulously fair in his conduct of
  the game. Each card as it is played should be set down squarely, face
  upwards, in full view of the reader. Under no circumstances should there be
  any deception as to the facts. The reader should be quite clear as to what he
  may expect as true. In stories of the older type, the middle action is filled
  out with a succession of false clues and with the fixing of suspicion first
  on one character, then on another, and again on a third, and so on. The clues
  are patiently followed, one after another, and found to lead nowhere. There
  is feverish activity, but no result. All this is wearisome to the reader and
  is, in my opinion, bad technique. My practice is to avoid false clues
  entirely and to depend on keeping the reader occupied with the narrative. If
  the ice should become uncomfortably thin, a dramatic episode will distract
  the reader's attention and carry him safely over the perilous spot. Devices
  to confuse and mislead the reader are bad practice. They deaden the interest,
  and they are quite unnecessary; the reader can always be trusted to mislead
  himself, no matter how plainly the data are given. Some years ago I devised,
  as an experiment, an inverted detective story in two parts ["The Case of
  Oscar Brodski"]. The first part was a minute and detailed description of a
  crime, setting forth the antecedents, motives, and all attendant
  circumstances. The reader had seen the crime committed, knew all about the
  criminal, and was in possession of all the facts. It would have seemed that
  there was nothing left to tell. But I calculated that the reader would be so
  occupied with the crime that he would overlook the evidence. And so it turned
  out. The second part, which described the investigation of the crime, had to
  most readers the effect of new matter. All the facts were known; but their
  evidential quality had not been recognized.</p>

  <p>This failure of the reader to perceive the evidential value of facts is
  the foundation on which detective fiction is built. It may generally be taken
  that the author may exhibit his facts fearlessly provided only that he
  exhibits them separately and unconnected. And the more boldly he displays the
  data, the greater will be the intellectual interest of the story. For the
  tacit understanding of the author with the reader is that the problem is
  susceptible of solution by the latter by reasoning from the facts given; and
  such solution should be actually possible. Then the data should be produced
  as early in the story as is practicable. The reader should have a body of
  evidence to consider while the tale is telling. The production of a leading
  fact near the end of the book is unfair to the reader, while the introduction
  of capital evidence&mdash;such as that of an eye-witness&mdash;at the extreme
  end is radically bad technique, amounting to a breach of the implied covenant
  with the reader.</p>

  <p>3. The "discovery," i.e., the announcement by the investigator of the
  conclusion reached by him, brings the inquiry formally to an end. It is
  totally inadmissible thereafter to introduce any new matter. The reader is
  given to understand that he now has before him the evidence and the
  conclusion, and that the latter is contained in the former. If it is not, the
  construction has failed, and the reader has been cheated. The "discovery"
  will usually come as a surprise to the reader and will thus form the dramatic
  climax of the story, but it is to be noted that the dramatic quality of the
  climax is strictly dependent on the intellectual conviction which accompanies
  it. This is frequently overlooked, especially by general novelists who
  experiment in detective fiction. In their eagerness to surprise the reader,
  they forget that he has also to be convinced. A literary friend of mine,
  commenting on a particularly conclusive detective story, declared that "the
  rigid demonstration destroyed the artistic effect." But the rigid
  demonstration was the artistic effect. The entire dramatic effect of the
  climax of a detective story is due to the sudden recognition by the reader of
  the significance of a number of hitherto uncomprehended facts; or if such
  recognition should not immediately occur, the effect of the climax becomes
  suspended until it is completed in the final stage.</p>

  <p>4. Proof of the solution. This is peculiar to "detective" construction. In
  all ordinary novels, the climax, or denouement, finishes the story, and any
  continuation is anti-climax. But a detective story has a dual character.
  There is the story, with its dramatic interest, and enclosed in it, so to
  speak, is the logical problem; and the climax of the former may leave the
  latter apparently unsolved. It is then the duty of the author, through the
  medium of the investigator, to prove the solution by an analysis and
  exposition of the evidence. He has to demonstrate to the reader that the
  conclusion emerged naturally and reasonably from the facts known to him, and
  that no other conclusion was possible.</p>

  <p>If it is satisfactorily done, this is to the critical reader usually the
  most interesting part of the book; and it is the part by which he&mdash;very
  properly&mdash;judges the quality of the whole work. Too often it yields
  nothing but disappointment and a sense of anticlimax. The author is unable to
  solve his own problem. Acting on the pernicious advice of the pilot in the
  old song to "Fear not, but trust in Providence," he has piled up his
  mysteries in the hope of being able to find a plausible explanation; and now,
  when he comes to settle his account with the reader, his logical assets are
  nil. What claims to be a demonstration turns out to be a mere specious
  attempt to persuade the reader that the inexplicable has been explained; that
  the fortunate guesses of an inspired investigator are examples of genuine
  reasoning. A typical instance of this kind of anti-climax occurs in Poe's
  "Murders in the Rue Morgue" when Dupin follows the unspoken thoughts of his
  companion and joins in at the appropriate moment. The reader is astonished
  and marvels how such an apparently impossible feat could have been performed.
  Then Dupin explains; but his explanation is totally unconvincing, and the
  impossibility remains. The reader has had his astonishment for nothing. It
  cannot be too much emphasized that to the critical reader the quality in a
  detective story which takes precedence of all others is conclusiveness. It is
  the quality which, above all others, yields that intellectual satisfaction
  that the reader seeks; and it is the quality which is the most difficult to
  attain, and which costs more than any other in care and labour to the
  author.</p>

  <h2><a name="ch-04"
     id="ch-04"></a>IV. &mdash; THE MYSTERY OF ANGELINA FROOD</h2>

  <h3>CHAPTER I&mdash;THE DOPER'S WIFE</h3>

  <p>It takes a good deal to surprise a really seasoned medical practitioner,
  and still more to arouse in him an abiding curiosity. But at the time when I
  took charge of Dr. Humphrey's practice in Osnaburgh-street, Regent's Park, I
  was far from being a seasoned practitioner, having, in fact, been qualified
  little more than a year, in which short period I had not yet developed the
  professional immunity from either of the above mental states. Hence the
  singular experience which I am about to relate not only made a deep
  impression on me at the time, but remained with me for long after as a matter
  of curious speculation.</p>

  <p>It was close upon midnight, indeed an adjacent church clock had already
  struck the third quarter, when I laid aside my book and yawned profoundly,
  without prejudice to the author who had kept me so long from my bed. Then I
  rose and stretched myself, and was in the act of knocking the long-extinct
  ashes out of my pipe when the bell rang. As the servants had gone to bed, I
  went out to the door, congratulating myself on having stayed up beyond my
  usual bedtime, but wishing the visitor at the devil all the same. The opening
  of the door gave me a view of a wet street with a drizzle of rain falling, a
  large closed car by the kerb, and a tallish man on the doorstep, apparently
  about to renew his attack on the bell.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Pumphrey?" he asked; and by that token I gathered that he was a
  stranger.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered; "he is out of town, but I am looking after his
  practice."</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said, somewhat brusquely. "I want you to come and see a
  lady who has been suddenly taken ill. She has had a rather severe shock."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean a mental or a physical shock?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I should say mental," he replied, but so inconclusively that I
  pressed him for more definite particulars.</p>

  <p>"Has she sustained any injuries?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, but still indecisively. "No; that is, so far as I know.
  I think not."</p>

  <p>"No wound, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, promptly and very definitely, from which I was disposed
  to suspect that there was an injury of some other kind. But it was of no use
  guessing. I hurried back into the surgery, and, having snatched up the
  emergency bag and my stethoscope, rejoined my visitor, who forthwith hustled
  me into the car. The door slammed, and the vehicle moved off with the silent,
  easy motion of a powerful engine.</p>

  <p>We started towards Marylebone-road and swept round into Albany-street, but
  after that I lost my bearings: for the fine rain had settled on the windows
  so that it was difficult to see through them, and I was not very familiar
  with the neighbourhood. It seemed quite a short journey, but a big car is
  very deceptive as to distance. At any rate, it occupied but a few minutes,
  and during that time my companion and I exchanged hardly a word. As the car
  slowed down I asked:</p>

  <p>"What is this lady's name?"</p>

  <p>"Her name," he replied, in a somewhat hesitating manner, "is&mdash;she is
  a Mrs. Johnson."</p>

  <p>The manner of the reply suggested a not very intimate acquaintance, which
  seemed odd under the circumstances, and I reflected on it rapidly as I got
  out of the car and followed my conductor. We seemed to be in a quiet bystreet
  of the better class, but it was very dark, and I had but a glimpse as I
  stepped from the car to the gate of the house. Of the latter, all that I was
  able to note was that it appeared to be of a decent, rather old-fashioned
  type, standing behind a small front garden, that the windows were fitted with
  jalousie shutters, and that the number on the door was 43.</p>

  <p>As we ascended the steps the door opened, and a woman was dimly
  discernible behind it. A lighted candle was on the hall table, and this my
  conductor picked up, requesting me to follow him up the stairs. When we
  arrived at the first floor landing, he halted and indicated a door which was
  slightly ajar.</p>

  <p>"That is the room," said he; and with that he turned and retired down the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>I stood for a few moments on the dark landing, deeply impressed by the
  oddity of the whole affair, and sensible of a growing suspicion, which was
  not lessened when, by the thin line of light from within the room, I observed
  on the door-jamb one or two bruises as if the door had been forced from
  without. However, this was none of my business, and thus reflecting, I was
  about to knock at the door when four fingers appeared round the edge of it
  and drew it further open, and a man's head became visible in the opening.</p>

  <p>The fingers and the head were alike such as instantly to rivet the
  attention of a doctor. The former were of the kind known as "clubbed
  fingers," fingers with bulbous ends, of which the nails curved over like
  nut-shells. The head, in form like a great William pear, presented a long,
  coffin-shaped face with high cheek-bones, deep-set eyes with narrow, slanting
  eye-slits, and a lofty, square forehead surmounted by a most singular mop of
  mouse-coloured hair which stood straight up like the fur of a mole.</p>

  <p>"I am the doctor," said I, having taken in these particulars in an
  instantaneous glance, and having further noted that the man's eyes were
  reddened and wet. He made no reply, but drew the door open and retired,
  whereupon I entered the room, closing the door behind me, and thereby
  becoming aware that there was something amiss with the latch.</p>

  <p>The room was a bed-room, and on the bed lay a woman, fully clothed, and
  apparently in evening dress, though the upper part of her person was
  concealed by a cloak which was drawn up to her chin. She was a young
  woman&mdash;about twenty-eight, I judged&mdash;comely, and, in fact, rather
  handsome, but deadly pale. She was not, however, unconscious, for she looked
  at me listlessly, though with a certain attention. In some slight
  embarrassment, I approached the bed, and, as the man had subsided into a
  chair in a corner of the room, I addressed myself to the patient.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mrs. Johnson. I am sorry to see you looking so ill. What is
  the matter? I understand that you have had some kind of shock."</p>

  <p>As I addressed her, I seemed to detect a faint expression of surprise, but
  she replied at once, in a weak voice that was little more than a whisper:
  "Yes. I have had rather an upset. That is all. They need not really have
  troubled you."</p>

  <p>"Well, you don't look very flourishing," said I, taking the wrist that was
  uncovered by her mantle, "and your hand is as cold as a fish."</p>

  <p>I felt her pulse, checking it by my watch, and meanwhile looking her over
  critically. And not her alone. For on the wall opposite me was a mirror in
  which, by a little judicious adjustment of position, I was able to observe
  the other occupant of the room while keeping my back towards him; and what I
  observed was that he was sitting with his elbows on his knees, and his face
  buried in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Might one inquire," I asked, as I put away my watch, "what kind of shock
  it is that you are suffering from?"</p>

  <p>The faintest trace of a smile stole across her pale face as she answered:
  "That isn't really a medical question, Doctor, is it?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it isn't," I replied, though, of course, it was.</p>

  <p>But I thought it best to waive the question, as there seemed to be some
  reservation; and, noting this latter fact, I again considered her
  attentively. Whatever her condition was, and whatever it might be due to, I
  had to form my opinion unassisted, for I could see that no information would
  be furnished; and the question that I had to settle was whether her state was
  purely mental, or whether it was complicated by any kind of physical injury.
  The waxen pallor of her face made me uneasy, and I found it difficult to
  interpret the expression of the set features. Some strong emotion had left
  its traces; but whether that emotion was grief, horror, or fear, or whether
  the expression denoted bodily pain, I could not determine. She had closed her
  eyes, and her face was like a death mask, save that it lacked the serenity of
  a dead face.</p>

  <p>"Are you in any pain!" I asked, with my fingers still on the thready
  pulse. But she merely shook her head wearily, without opening her eyes.</p>

  <p>It was very unsatisfactory. Her appearance was consistent with all kinds
  of unpleasant possibilities, as was also the strange atmosphere of secrecy
  about the whole affair. Nor was the attitude of that ill-favoured man whom I
  could see in the glass, still sitting hunched up with his face buried in his
  hands, at all reassuring. And gradually my attention began to focus itself
  upon the cloak which covered the woman's body and was drawn around her neck
  up to her chin. Did that cloak conceal anything? It seemed incredible, seeing
  that they had sent for a doctor. But the behaviour of everybody concerned was
  incredibly irrational. I produced my stethoscope, which was fitted with a
  diaphragm that enabled one to hear through the clothing, and, drawing the
  cloak partly aside, applied the chest-piece over the heart. On this the
  patient opened her eyes and made a movement of her hand towards the upper
  part of the cloak. I listened carefully to her heart&mdash;which was
  organically sound, though a good deal disordered in action&mdash;and moved
  the stethoscope once or twice, drawing aside the cloak by degrees. Finally,
  with a somewhat quick movement, I turned it back completely.</p>

  <p>"Why," I exclaimed, "what on earth have you been doing to your neck?"</p>

  <p>"That mark?" she said in a half-whisper. "It is nothing. It was made by a
  gold collar that I wore yesterday. It was rather tight."</p>

  <p>"I see," said I, truthfully enough; for the explanation of her condition
  was now pretty clear up to a certain point.</p>

  <p>Of course, I did not believe her. I did not suppose that she expected me
  to. But it was evidently useless to dispute her statement or make any
  comment. The mark upon her neck was a livid bruise made by some cord or band
  that had been drawn tight with considerable force; and it was not more than
  an hour old. How or by whom the injury had been inflicted was not, in a
  medical sense, my concern. But I was by no means clear that I had not some
  responsibilities in the case other than the professional ones.</p>

  <p>At this moment the man in the corner uttered a deep groan and exclaimed in
  low, intense tones, "My God! My God!" Then, to my extreme embarrassment, he
  began to sob audibly.</p>

  <p>It was excessively uncomfortable. I looked from the woman&mdash;into whose
  ghastly face an expression of something like disgust and contempt had
  stolen&mdash;to the huddled figure in the glass. And as I looked, the man
  plunged one hand into his pocket and dragged out a handkerchief, bringing
  with it a little paper packet that fell to the floor. Something in the
  appearance of that packet, and especially in the hasty grab to recover it and
  the quick, furtive glance towards me that accompanied the action, made a new
  and sinister suggestion&mdash;a suggestion that the man's emotional, almost
  hysterical state supported, and that lent a certain unpleasant congruity to
  the otherwise inexplicable circumstances. That packet, I had little doubt,
  contained cocaine. The question was how did that fact&mdash;if it were a
  fact&mdash;bear on my patient's condition.</p>

  <p>I inspected her afresh, and felt her pulse again. In the man's case the
  appearances were distinctive enough. His nerves were in rags, and even across
  the room I could see that the hand that held the handkerchief shook as if
  with a palsy. But in the woman's condition there was no positive suggestion
  of drugs; and something in her face&mdash;a strong, resolute face despite its
  expression of suffering&mdash;and her quiet, composed manner when she spoke,
  seemed to exclude the idea. However, there was no use in speculating. I had
  got all the information I was likely to get, and all that remained for me to
  do was to administer such treatment as my imperfect understanding of the case
  indicated. Accordingly I opened my emergency bag, and, taking out a couple of
  little bottles and a measure-glass, went over to the washstand and mixed a
  draught in the tumbler, diluting it from the water-bottle.</p>

  <p>In crossing the room, I passed the fire-place, where, on and above the
  mantelpiece, I observed a number of signed photographs, apparently of actors
  and actresses, including two of my patient, both of which were in character
  costume and unsigned. From which it seemed probable that my patient was an
  actress; a probability that was strengthened by the hour at which I had been
  summoned and by certain other appearances in the room with which Dr.
  Pumphrey's largely theatrical practice had made me familiar. But, as my
  patient would have remarked, this was not a medical question.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mrs. Johnson," I said, when I had prepared the draught&mdash;and as
  I spoke she opened her eyes and looked at me with a slightly puzzled
  expression&mdash;"I want you to drink this."</p>

  <p>She allowed me to sit her up enough to enable her to swallow the draught;
  and as her head was raised, I took the opportunity to glance at the back of
  her neck, where I thought I could distinctly trace the crossing of the cord
  or band that had been drawn round it. She sank back with a sigh, but remained
  with her eyes open, looking at me as I repacked my bag.</p>

  <p>"I shall send you some medicine," I said, "which you must take regularly.
  It is unnecessary for me to say," I added, addressing the man, "that Mrs.
  Johnson must be kept very quiet, and in no way agitated."</p>

  <p>He bowed, but made no reply; and I then took my leave.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Mrs. Johnson," I said, shaking her cold hand gently. "I hope
  you will be very much better in an hour or two. I think you will if you keep
  quite quiet and take your medicine."</p>

  <p>She thanked me in a few softly spoken words and with a very sweet smile,
  of which the sad wistfulness went to my heart. I was loath to leave her, in
  her weak and helpless state, to the care of her unprepossessing companion,
  encompassed by I knew not what perils. But I was only a passing stranger, and
  could do no more than my professional office.</p>

  <p>As I approached the door&mdash;with an inquisitive eye on its disordered
  lock and loosened striking-box&mdash;the man rose, and made as if to let me
  out. I wished him good-night, and he returned the salutation in a pleasant
  voice, and with a distinctly refined accent, quite out of character with his
  uncouth appearance. Feeling my way down the dark staircase, I presently
  encountered my first acquaintance, who came to the foot of the stairs with
  the candle.</p>

  <p>'''Well,'' he said, in his brusque way, "how is she?"</p>

  <p>"She is very weak and shaken," I replied. "I want to send her some
  medicine. Shall I take the address, or are you driving me back?"</p>

  <p>"I will take you back in the car," said he, "and you can give me the
  medicine."</p>

  <p>The car was waiting at the gate, and we went out together. As I turned to
  close the gate after me, I cast a quick glance at the house and its
  surroundings, searching for some distinctive feature in case recognition of
  the place should be necessary later. But it was a dark night, though the rain
  had now ceased, and I could see no more than that the adjoining house seemed
  to have a sort of corner turret, crowned with a small cupola, and surmounted
  by a weather-vane.</p>

  <p>During the short journey home not a word was spoken, and when the car drew
  up at Dr. Pumphrey's door and I let myself in with the key, my companion
  silently followed me in. I prepared the medicine at once, and handed it to
  him with a few brief instructions. He took it from me, and then asked what my
  fee was.</p>

  <p>"Do I understand that I am not required to continue the attendance?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"They will send for you, I suppose, if they want you," he replied. "But I
  had better pay your fee for this visit as I came for you."</p>

  <p>I named the fee, and, when he had paid it, I said: "You understand that
  she will require very careful and tender treatment while she is so weak?"</p>

  <p>"I do," he answered; "but I am not a member of the household. Did you make
  it clear to Mr.&mdash;her husband?"</p>

  <p>I noted the significant hesitation, and replied: "I told him, but as to
  making it clear to him, I can't say. His mental condition was none of the
  most lucid. I hope she has someone more responsible to look after her."</p>

  <p>"She has," he replied; and then he asked: "You don't think she is in any
  danger, I hope?"</p>

  <p>"In a medical sense," I answered, "I think not. In other respects you know
  better than I do."</p>

  <p>He gave me a quick look, and nodded slightly. Then, with a curt
  "good-night," he turned and went out to the car.</p>

  <p>When he was gone, I made a brief record of the visit in the day-book, and
  entered the fee in the cash column. In the case of the experienced Dr.
  Pumphrey, this would have been the end of the transaction. But, new as I was
  to medical practice, I was unable to take this matter-of-fact view of its
  incidents. My mind still surged with surprise, curiosity, and a deep concern
  for my fair patient. Filling my pipe, I sat down before the gas fire to think
  over the mystery to which I had suddenly become a party.</p>

  <p>What was it that had happened in that house T Obviously, something
  scandalous and sinister. The secrecy alone made that manifest. Not only had
  the whereabouts of the house been withheld from me, but a false name had been
  given. I realized that when my late visitor stumbled over the name and
  substituted "her husband," He had forgotten what name it was that he had
  given on the spur of the moment. I understood, too, the look of surprise that
  my patient had given when I addressed her by that false name. Clearly,
  something had happened which had to be hushed up if possible.</p>

  <p>What was it? The elements of the problem, and the material for solving it,
  were the mark on the woman's neck, the condition of the door, and a packet
  which I felt morally certain contained cocaine. I considered these three
  factors separately and together.</p>

  <p>The mark on the neck was quite recent. Its character was unmistakable. A
  cord or band had been drawn tight and with considerable violence, either by
  the woman herself, or by some other person: that is to say, it was a case
  either of attempted suicide or attempted murder. To which of these
  alternatives did the circumstances point?</p>

  <p>There was the door. It had been broken in, and had therefore been locked
  on the inside. That was consistent with suicide, but not inconsistent with
  murder. Then, by whom had it been broken in? By a murderer to get at his
  victim? Or by a rescuer? And if the latter, was it to avert suicide or
  murder?</p>

  <p>Again, there was the drug&mdash;assumed, but almost certain.</p>

  <p>What was the bearing of that? Could these three persons be a party of
  "dopers," and the tragedy the outcome of an orgy of drug-taking? I rejected
  this possibility at once. It was not consistent with the patient's condition
  nor with her appearance or manner; and the man who had fetched me and brought
  me back was a robust, sane-looking man who seemed quite beyond suspicion.</p>

  <p>I next considered the persons. There were three of them: two men and a
  woman. Of the men, one was a virile, fairly good-looking man of perhaps
  forty; the other&mdash;the husband&mdash;was conspicuously unprepossessing,
  physically degenerate and mentally, as I judged, a hysterical poltroon. Here
  there seemed to be the making of trouble, especially when one considered the
  personal attractiveness of the woman.</p>

  <p>I recalled her appearance very vividly. A handsome woman, not, perhaps,
  actually beautiful&mdash;though she might have been that if the roses of
  youth and health had bloomed in those cheeks that I had seen blanched with
  that ghastly pallor. But apart from mere comeliness, there was a suggestion
  of a pleasing, gracious personality. I don't know how it had been conveyed to
  me, excepting by the smile with which she had thanked me and bidden me
  farewell: a smile that had imparted a singular sweetness to her face. But I
  had received that impression, and also that she was a woman of decided
  character and intelligence.</p>

  <p>Her appearance was rather striking. She had a great mass of dark hair,
  parted in the middle, and drawn down over the temples, nearly covering the
  ears; darkish grey eyes, and unusually strong, black, level eyebrows, that
  almost met above the straight, shapely nose. Perhaps it was those eyebrows
  that gave the strength and intensity to her expression, aided by the
  compressed lips&mdash;though this was probably a passing condition due to her
  mental state.</p>

  <p>My cogitations were prolonged well into the small hours, but they led to
  nothing but an open verdict. At length I rose with a slight shiver, and,
  dismissing the topic from my mind, crept up to bed.</p>

  <p>But both the persons and the incident refused to accept their dismissal.
  For many days afterwards I was haunted by two faces; the one, ugly,
  coffin-shaped, surmounted by a shock of soft, furry, mouse-coloured hair; the
  other, sweet, appealing, mutely eloquent of tragedy and sorrow. Of course, I
  received no further summons; and the whereabouts of the house of mystery
  remained a secret until almost the end of my stay in Osnaburgh-street.
  Indeed, it was on the very day before Dr. Pumphrey's return that I made the
  discovery.</p>

  <p>I had been making a visit to a patient who lived near Regent's Park, and
  on my way back had taken what I assumed to be a short cut. This led me into a
  quiet, old fashioned residential street, of which the houses stood back
  behind small front gardens. As I walked along the street I seemed to be aware
  of a faint sense of familiarity which caused me to observe the houses with
  more than usual attention. Presently I observed a little way ahead on the
  opposite side a house with a corner turret topped by a cupola, which bore
  above it a weather-vane. I crossed the road as I approached it, and looked
  eagerly at the next house. Its identity was unmistakable. My attention was
  immediately attracted by the jalousies with which the windows were fitted,
  and on looking at the front door I observed that the number was
  forty-three.</p>

  <p>This, then, was the house of mystery, perhaps of crime.</p>

  <p>But whatever that tragedy had been, its actors were there no longer. The
  windows were curtainless and blank; an air of Spring-cleaning and preparation
  pervaded the premises, and a bill on a little notice-board announced a
  furnished house to let, and invited inquiries. For a moment, I was tempted to
  accept that invitation. But I was restrained by a feeling that it would be in
  a way a breach of confidence. The names of those persons had been purposely
  withheld from me, doubtless for excellent reasons, and professional ethics
  seemed to forbid any unauthorized pryings into their private affairs.
  Wherefore, with a valedictory glance at the first-floor window, which I
  assumed to be that of the room that I had entered, I went on my way, telling
  myself that, now, the incident was really closed, and that I had looked my
  last on the persons who had enacted their parts in it.</p>

  <p>In which, however, I was mistaken. The curtain was down on the first act,
  but the play was not over. Only the succeeding acts were yet in the
  unfathomed future. "Coming events cast their shadows before them"; but who
  can interpret those shadows, until the shapes which cast them loom up, plain
  and palpable, to mock at their own unheeded premonitions?</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER II&mdash;RE-ENTER "MR. JOHNSON"</h3>

  <p>It was a good many months before the curtain rose on the second act of the
  drama of which this narrative is the record. Rather more than a year had
  passed, and in that time certain changes had taken place in my condition, of
  which I need refer only to the one that, indirectly, operated as the cause of
  my becoming once more a party to the drama aforesaid. I had come into a small
  property, just barely sufficient to render me independent, and to enable me
  to live in idleness, if idleness had been my hobby. As it was not, I betook
  myself to Adam-street, Adelphi, to confer with my trusty medical agent, Mr.
  Turcival, and from that conference was born my connexion with the strange
  events which will be hereafter related.</p>

  <p>Mr. Turcival had several practices to sell, but only one that he thought
  quite suitable. "It is a death vacancy," said he, "at Rochester. A very small
  practice, and you won't get much out of it, as the late incumbent was an old
  man and you are a young man&mdash;and you look ten years younger since you
  shaved off that fine beard and moustache. But it is going for a song, and you
  can afford to wait; and you couldn't have a more pleasant place to wait in
  than Rochester. Better go down and have a look at it. I'll write to the local
  agents, Japp and Bundy, and they will show you the house and effects. What do
  you say?"</p>

  <p>I said "yes"; and so favourably was I impressed that the very next day
  found me in a first-class compartment en route for Rochester, with a
  substantial portmanteau in the guard's van.</p>

  <p>At Dartford it became necessary to change, and as I sauntered on the
  platform, waiting for the Rochester train, my attention was attracted to a
  man who sat, somewhat wearily and dejectedly, on a bench, rolling a
  cigarette. I was impressed by the swift dexterity with which he handled the
  paper and tobacco, a dexterity that was explained by the colour of his
  fingers, which were stained to the hue of mahogany. But my attention was
  quickly diverted from the colour of the fingers to their shape. They were
  clubbed fingers. At the moment when I observed the fact I was looking over
  his shoulder from behind, and could not see his face. But I could see that he
  had a large, pear-shaped head, surmounted by an enormous cap, from beneath
  which a mass of mouse-coloured hair stuck out like untidy thatch.</p>

  <p>I suppose I must have halted unconsciously, for he suddenly looked round,
  casting at me a curious, quick, furtive, suspicious glance. He evidently did
  not recognize me&mdash;naturally, since my appearance was so much changed;
  but I recognized him instantly. He was "Mr.&mdash;, her husband." And his
  appearance was not improved since I had last seen him. Inspecting him from
  the front, I observed that he was sordidly shabby and none too clean, and
  that his large, rough boots were white with dust as if from a long tramp on
  the chalky Kentish roads.</p>

  <p>When the train came in, I watched him saunter to a compartment a few doors
  from my own, rolling a fresh cigarette as he went: and at each station when
  we stopped, I looked out of the window to see where he got out. But he made
  no appearance until the train slowed down at Rochester when I alighted
  quickly and strolled towards his compartment. It had evidently been well
  filled, for a number of passengers emerged before he appeared, contesting the
  narrow doorway with a stout workman. As he squeezed past, the skirt of his
  coat caught and was drawn back, revealing a sheath-knife of the kind known to
  seamen as "Green River," attached to a narrow leather belt. I did not like
  the look of that knife. No landsman has any legitimate use for such a weapon.
  And the fact that this man habitually carried about him the means of
  inflicting lethal injuries&mdash;for it had no other purpose&mdash;threw a
  fresh light, if any were needed, on the sinister events of that memorable
  night in the quiet house near Regent's Park.</p>

  <p>As I had to look after my luggage, I lost sight of him; and when having
  deposited my portmanteau in the cloak room, I walked out across the station
  approach and looked up and down the street, he was nowhere to be seen. Dimly
  wondering what this man might be doing in Rochester, and whether his handsome
  wife were here, too&mdash;assuming her to be still in existence&mdash;I
  turned and began to saunter slowly westward. I had walked but two or three
  hundred yards when the door of a tavern which I was approaching opened, and a
  man emerged, licking his lips with uncommon satisfaction, and rolling a
  cigarette. It was my late fellow-traveller. He stood by the tavern door,
  looking about him, and glancing at the people on the footway. Just as I was
  passing him, he approached me and spoke.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said he, "if you happen to know a Mrs. Frood who lives
  somewhere about here."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I don't," I replied, thankful to be able to tell the
  truth&mdash;for I should have denied knowledge of her in any case. "I am a
  stranger to the town at present."</p>

  <p>He thanked me and turned away, and I walked on, but no longer at a
  saunter, wondering who Mrs. Frood might be and keeping an eye on the numbers
  of the houses on the opposite side of the street.</p>

  <p>A few minutes walk brought into view the number I was seeking, painted in
  the tympanum of a handsome Georgian portico appertaining to one of a pair of
  pleasant old redbrick houses. I halted to inspect these architectural twins
  before crossing the road. Old houses always interest me, and these two were
  particularly engaging, as their owners apparently realized, for they were in
  the pink of condition, and the harmony of the quiet green woodwork and the
  sober red brick was no chance effect. Moreover they were painted alike to
  carry out the intention of the architect, who had evidently designed them to
  form a single composition; to which end he had very effectively placed,
  between the twin porticoes, a central door which gave access to a passage
  common to the two houses and leading, no doubt, to the back premises.</p>

  <p>Having noted these particulars, I crossed the road and approached the twin
  which bore beside its doorway a brass plate, inscribed "Japp and Bundy,
  Architects and Surveyors." In the adjoining bay window, in front of a green
  curtain, was a list of houses to let; and as I paused for a moment to glance
  at this, a face decorated with a pair of colossal tortoiseshell-rimmed
  spectacles, rose slowly above the curtain, and then, catching my eye, popped
  down again with some suddenness.</p>

  <p>I ascended the short flight of steps to the open street door, and entering
  the hall, opened the office door and walked in. The owner of the spectacles
  was perched on a high stool at a higher desk with his back to me, writing in
  a large book. The other occupant of the office was a small, spare, elderly
  man, with a pleasant wrinkly face and a cockatoo-like crest of white hair,
  who confronted me across a large table on which a plan was spread out. He
  looked up interrogatively as I entered, and I proceeded at once to announce
  myself.</p>

  <p>"I am Dr. Strangeways," said I, drawing a bundle of papers from my pocket.
  "Mr. Turcival&mdash;the medical agent, you know&mdash;thought I had better
  come down and settle things up on the spot. So here I am."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," said my new acquaintance, motioning me to a chair&mdash;it
  was a shield-back Heppelwhite, I noticed&mdash;"I agree with Mr. Turcival. It
  is all quite plain sailing. The position is this: Old Dr. Partridge died
  about three weeks ago, and the executor of his will, who lives in
  Northumberland, has instructed us to realize his estate. We have valued the
  furniture, fittings, and effects, have added a small amount to cover the
  drugs and instruments and the goodwill of the practice, and this is the
  premium. It is practically just the value of the effects."</p>

  <p>"And the lease of the house?"</p>

  <p>"Expired some years ago and we allowed Dr. Partridge to remain as a yearly
  tenant, which he preferred. You could do the same or you could have a lease,
  if you wished."</p>

  <p>"Is the house your property?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No; but we manage it for the owner, a Mrs. Frood."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it belongs to Mrs. Frood, does it?"</p>

  <p>He looked up at me quickly, and I noticed that the gentleman at the desk
  had stopped writing. "Do you know Mrs. Frood?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No; but it happens that a man who came down by my train asked me a few
  minutes ago if I could give him her address. Fortunately I couldn't."</p>

  <p>"Why fortunately?"</p>

  <p>The question brought me, up short. My prejudice against the man was due to
  my knowledge of his antecedents, which I was not prepared to disclose. I
  therefore replied evasively:</p>

  <p>"Well, I wasn't very favourably impressed by his appearance. He was a
  shabby-looking customer. I suspected that he was a cadger of some kind."</p>

  <p>"Indeed! Now, what sort of a person was he? Could you describe him?"</p>

  <p>"He was a youngish man&mdash;from thirty-five to forty, I should
  say&mdash;apparently well educated but very seedy and not particularly clean.
  A queer-looking man, with a big, pear-shaped head and a mop of hair like the
  fur of a Persian cat. His fingers are clubbed at the ends, and stained with
  tobacco to the knuckles. Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"I rather suspect I do. What do you say, Bundy?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Bundy grunted. "Hubby, I ween," said he.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean Mrs. Frood's husband?" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I do. And it is, as you said, very fortunate that you were not able to
  give him her address, as she is unable to live with him and is at present
  unwilling to let him know her whereabouts. It is an unfortunate affair.
  However, to return to your business; you had better go up and have a look at
  the house and see what you think of it. You might just walk up with Dr.
  Strangeways, Bundy."</p>

  <p>Mr. Bundy swung round on his stool, and, taking off his spectacles, stuck
  in his right eye a gold-rimmed monocle, through which he inspected me
  critically. Then he hopped off the stool, and, lifting the lid of the desk,
  took out a velour hat and a pair of chamois gloves, the former of which he
  adjusted carefully on his head before a small mirror, and, having taken down
  a labelled key from a key-board and provided himself with a smart,
  silver-mounted cane, announced that he was ready.</p>

  <p>As I walked along the picturesque old street at Mr. Bundy's side, I
  reverted to my late fellow passenger and my prospective landlady.</p>

  <p>"I gather," said I, "that Mrs. Frood's matrimonial affairs are somewhat
  involved."</p>

  <p>"So do I." said Bundy. "Seems to have made a regular mucker of it. I don't
  know much about her, myself, but Japp knows the whole story. He's some sort
  of relative of hers; uncle or second cousin or something of the kind. But
  Japp is a bit like the sailor's parrot: he doesn't let on unnecessarily."</p>

  <p>"'What sort of a woman is Mrs. Frood?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite a tidy sort of body. I've only seen her once or twice; haven't
  been here long myself: tallish woman, lot of black hair; thick eye-brows;
  rather squeaky voice. Not exactly my idea of a beauty, but Frood seems quite
  keen on her."</p>

  <p>"By the way, how comes it that he doesn't know her address? She's a
  Rochester woman, isn't she?"</p>

  <p>"No. I don't know where she comes from. London, I think. This property was
  left to her by an aunt who lived here: a cousin of Japp's. Angelina came down
  here a few weeks ago on the q.t. to get away from hubby, and I fancy she's
  been keeping pretty close."</p>

  <p>"She's living in lodgings, then, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; at least she lives in a set of offices that Japp furnished for her,
  and the lady who rents the rest of the house looks after her. As a matter of
  fact, the offices are next door to ours; but you had better consider that
  information as confidential, at any rate while hubby is in the neighbourhood.
  This is your shanty."</p>

  <p>He halted at the door of a rather small, red brick house, and while I was
  examining the half-obliterated inscription on the brass plate, he thrust the
  key into the lock and made ineffectual efforts to turn it. Suddenly there was
  a loud click from within, followed by the clanking of a chain and the drawing
  of bolts. Then the door opened slowly, and a long-faced, heavy-browed,
  elderly woman surveyed us with a gloomy stare.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you ring the bell?" she demanded, gruffly. "Had a key,"
  replied Bundy, extracting it, and flourishing it before her face.</p>

  <p>"And what's the good of a key when the door was bolted and chained?"</p>

  <p>"But, naturally, I couldn't see that the door was bolted and chained."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you couldn't with that thing stuck in your eye. Well, what do
  you want?"</p>

  <p>"I have brought this gentleman, Dr. Strangeways, to see you. He has seen
  your portraits in the shop windows and wished to be introduced. Also he wants
  to look over the house. He thinks of taking the practice."</p>

  <p>"Well, why couldn't you say that before?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Before what?" he inquired blandly.</p>

  <p>She made no reply other than a low growl, and Bundy continued:</p>

  <p>"This lady, Dr. Strangeways, is the renowned Mrs. Dunk, more familiarly
  known as La Giaconda, who administered the domestic affairs of the late Dr.
  Partridge, and is at present functioning as custodian of the premises." He
  concluded the presentation by a ceremonious bow and a sweep of his hat, which
  Mrs. Dunk acknowledged by turning her back on him and producing a large bunch
  of keys, with which she proceeded to unlock the doors that opened on the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"The upstairs rooms are unlocked," she said, adding: "If you want me you
  can ring the bell," and with this she retired to the basement stairs and
  vanished.</p>

  <p>My examination of the rooms was rather perfunctory, for I had made up my
  mind already. The premium was absurdly small, and I could see that the house
  was furnished well enough for my immediate needs. As to the practice, I had
  no particular expectations.</p>

  <p>"Better have a look at the books," said Bundy when we went into the little
  surgery, "though Mr. Turcival has been through them, and I daresay he has
  told you all about the practice."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered, "he told me that the practice was very small and that I
  probably shouldn't get much of it, as Partridge was an old man and I am a
  young one. Still, I may as well glance through the books."</p>

  <p>Bundy laid the day book and ledger on the desk and placed a stool by the
  latter, and I seated myself and began to turn over the leaves and note down a
  few figures on a slip of paper, while my companion beguiled the time by
  browsing round the surgery, taking down bottles and sniffing at their
  contents, pulling out drawers and inspecting the instruments and appliances.
  A very brief examination of the books served to confirm Mr. Turcival's modest
  estimate of the practice, and when I had finished, I closed them and turned
  round to report to Mr. Bundy, who was, at the moment, engaged in "sounding"
  the surgery clock with the late Dr. Partridge's stethoscope.</p>

  <p>"I think it will do," said I. "The practice is negligible, but the
  furniture and fittings are worth the money, and I daresay I shall get some
  patients in time. At any rate, the premises are all in going order."</p>

  <p>"You are not dependent on the practice, then?" said he.</p>

  <p>"No. I have enough just barely to exist on until the patients begin to
  arrive. But what about the house?"</p>

  <p>"You can have a lease if you like, or you can go on with the arrangement
  that Partridge had. If I were you, I should take the house on a three years'
  agreement with the option of a lease later if you find that the venture turns
  out satisfactorily."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "that seems a good arrangement. And when could I have
  possession?"</p>

  <p>"You've got possession now if you agree to the terms. Say yes, and I'll
  draft out the agreement when I get back. You and Mrs. Frood can sign it this
  evening. You give us a cheque and we give you your copy of the document, and
  the thing is d-u-n, done."</p>

  <p>"And what about this old woman?"</p>

  <p>"La Giaconda Dunkibus? I should keep her if I were you. She looks an old
  devil, but she's a good servant. Partridge had a great opinion of her, so
  Japp tells me, and you can see for yourself that the house is in apple-pie
  order and as clean as a new pin."</p>

  <p>"You think she would be willing to stay?"</p>

  <p>Bundy grinned (he was a good deal given to grinning, and he certainly had
  a magnificent set of teeth). "Willing?" he exclaimed. "She's going to stay
  whether you want her or not. She has been here the best part of her life and
  nothing short of a torpedo would shift her. You'll have to take her with the
  fixtures, but I don't think you'll regret it."</p>

  <p>As Bundy was speaking, I had been, half-unconsciously, looking him over,
  interested in the queer contrast between his almost boyish appearance and gay
  irresponsible manner on the one hand, and, on the other, his shrewdness, his
  business capacity, and his quick, decisive, evidently forceful character.</p>

  <p>To look at, he was just a young "nut," small, spruce, dandified, and
  apparently not displeased with himself. His age I judged to be about
  twenty-five, his height about five feet six. In figure, he was slight, but
  well set-up, and he seemed active and full of life and energy. He was
  extraordinarily well turned-out. From his close-cropped head, with the
  fore-lock "smarmed" back in the correct "nuttish" fashion, so that his
  cranium resembled a large black-topped filbert, to his immaculately polished
  and remarkably small shoes, there was not an inch of his person that had not
  received the most careful attention. He was clean-shaved; so clean that on
  the smooth skin nothing but the faint blue tinge on cheek and chin remained
  to suggest the coarse and horrid possibilities of whiskers. And his hands had
  evidently received the same careful attention as his face; indeed, even as he
  was talking to me, he produced from his pocket some kind of ridiculous little
  instrument with which he proceeded to polish his finger-nails.</p>

  <p>"Shall I ring the bell?" he asked after a short pause, "and call up the
  spirit of the Dunklett from the vasty deep? May as well let her know her
  luck."</p>

  <p>As I assented he pressed the bell-push, and in less than a minute Mrs.
  Dunk made her appearance and stood in the doorway, looking inquiringly at
  Bundy, but uttering no sound.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Strangeways is going to take the practice, Mrs. Dunk," said Bundy,
  "inclusive of the house, furniture, and all effects, and he is also prepared
  to take you at a valuation."</p>

  <p>As the light of battle began to gleam in Mrs. Dunk's eyes, I thought it
  best to intervene and conduct the negotiations myself.</p>

  <p>"I understand from Mr. Bundy," said I, "that you were Dr. Partridge's
  housekeeper for many years, and it occurred to me that you might be willing
  to act in the same capacity for me. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"Very well," she replied. "When do you want to move in?"</p>

  <p>"I propose to move in at once. My luggage is at the station."</p>

  <p>"Have you checked the inventory?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't, but I suppose nothing has been taken away?"</p>

  <p>"No," she answered. "Everything is as it was when Dr. Partridge died."</p>

  <p>"Then we can go over the inventory later. I will have my things sent up
  from the station, and I shall come in during the afternoon to unpack."</p>

  <p>She agreed concisely to this arrangement, and, when we had settled a few
  minor details, I departed with Bundy to make my way to the station and
  thereafter to go in search of lunch.</p>

  <p>"You think," said I, as we halted opposite the station approach, "that we
  can get everything completed today?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "I will get the agreement drawn up in the terms that we
  have just settled on, and will make an appointment with Mrs. Frood. You had
  better look in at the office about half-past six."</p>

  <p>He turned away with a friendly nod and a flash of his white teeth, and
  bustled off up the street, swinging his smart cane jauntily, and looking,
  with his trim, well-cut clothes, his primrose-coloured gloves, and his
  glistening shoes, the very type of cheerful, prosperous, self-respecting and
  self-satisfied youth.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER III&mdash;ANGELINA FROOD</h3>

  <p>Punctually at half-past six I presented myself at the office of Messrs.
  Japp and Bundy. The senior partner was seated at a writing-table covered with
  legal-looking documents, and, as I entered, he looked up with a genial,
  wrinkly smile of recognition, and then turned to his junior.</p>

  <p>"You've got Dr. Strangeways's agreement ready, haven't you, Bundy?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Just finished it five minutes ago," was the reply. "Here you are."</p>

  <p>Bundy swung round on his stool and held out the two copies. "Would you
  mind going through it with Dr. Strangeways?" said Japp. "And then you might
  go with him to Mrs. Frood's and witness the signatures. I told her you were
  coming."</p>

  <p>Bundy pulled out his watch, and glared at it through his great
  spectacles.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed, "I'm afraid I can't. There's old Baldwin, you
  know. I've got to be there at a quarter to seven."</p>

  <p>"So you have," said Japp, "I had forgotten that. You had better be off
  now. I'll see to Dr. Strangeways, if he isn't in a hurry for a minute or
  two."</p>

  <p>"I'm not in a hurry at all," said I. "Don't put yourself out for me."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you really are not," said Japp, "I'll just finish what I am
  doing, and then I'll run in with you and get the agreement completed. You
  might look through it while you are waiting and see that it is all in
  order."</p>

  <p>Bundy handed me the agreement, and, as I sat down to study it, he removed
  his spectacles, stuck his eye-glass in his eye, hopped off his perch, brought
  forth his hat, gloves, and stick, and, having presented his teeth for my
  inspection, took his departure.</p>

  <p>I read through the agreement carefully to ascertain that it embodied the
  terms agreed on verbally and compared the two copies. Then, while Mr. Japp
  continued to turn over the leaves of his documents, I let my thoughts stray
  from the trim, orderly office to the house of mystery in London and the
  strange events that had befallen there on that rainy night more than a year
  ago. Once more I called up before the eyes of memory the face of my
  mysterious patient, sweet and gracious in spite of its deathly pallor. Many a
  time, in the months that had passed, had I recalled it: so often that it
  seemed, in a way, to have become familiar. In a few minutes I was going to
  look upon that face again&mdash;for there could be no reasonable doubt that
  my prospective landlady was she. I looked forward expectantly, almost with
  excitement, to the meeting. Would she recognize me? I wondered. And if she
  did not, should I make myself known? This was a difficult question, and I had
  come to no decision upon it when I was aroused from my reverie by a movement
  on the part of Mr. Japp, whose labours had apparently come to an end. Folding
  up the documents and securing them in little bundles with red tape, he
  deposited them in a cupboard with his notes, and from the same receptacle
  took out his hat.</p>

  <p>"Now," said he, "if you find the agreement in order, we will proceed to
  execute it. Are you going to pay the premium now'"</p>

  <p>"I have my cheque-book with me," I replied. "When we have signed the
  agreement, I will settle up for everything."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said he. "I have prepared a receipt which is, practically, an
  assignment of the furniture and effects and of all rights in the
  practice."</p>

  <p>He held the door open and I passed out. We descended the steps, and
  passing the central door common to the two houses, ascended to that of the
  adjoining house, where Mr. Japp executed a flourish on a handsome brass
  knocker. In a few moments the door was opened by a woman whom I couldn't see
  very distinctly in the dim hall, especially as she turned about and retired
  up the stairs. Mr. Japp advanced to the door of the front room and rapped
  with his knuckles, whereupon a high, clear, feminine voice bade him come in.
  He accordingly entered, and I followed.</p>

  <p>The first glance disposed of any doubts that I might have had. The lady
  who stood up to receive us was unquestionably my late patient, though she
  looked taller than I had expected. But it was the well-remembered face, less
  changed, indeed, than I could have wished, for it was still pale, drawn, and
  weary, as I could see plainly enough in spite of the rather dim light; for,
  although it was not yet quite dark, the curtains were drawn and a lamp
  lighted on a small table, beside which was a low easy-chair, on which some
  needlework had been thrown down.</p>

  <p>Mr. Japp introduced me to my future landlady, who bowed, and having
  invited us to be seated, took up her needlework and sat down in the
  easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"You are not looking quite up to the mark," Japp observed, regarding her
  critically, as he turned over the papers.</p>

  <p>"No," she admitted, "I think I am a little run down."</p>

  <p>"H'm," said Japp. "Oughtn't to get run down at your age. Why, you are only
  just wound up. However, you've got a doctor for a tenant, so you will be able
  to take out some of the rent in medical advice. Let me see, I told you what
  the terms of the agreement were, but you had better look through it before
  you sign."</p>

  <p>He handed her one of the documents, which she took from him, and, dropping
  her needlework in her lap, leaned back in her chair to read it. Meanwhile, I
  examined her with a good deal of interest and curiosity, wondering how she
  had fared and what had happened to her in the months that had elapsed since I
  had last seen her. The light was not very favourable for a minute inspection,
  for the lamp on the table was the sole luminary, and that was covered by a
  red silk shade. But I was confirmed in my original impression of her. She was
  more than ordinarily good-looking, and rather striking in appearance, and I
  judged that under happier conditions she might have appeared even more
  attractive. As, it was, the formally parted dark hair, the strongly marked,
  straight eyebrows, the firm mouth, rather compressed and a little drawn down
  at the corners, and the pale complexion imparted to her face a character that
  was somewhat intense, sombre, and even troubled. But, for this I could fully
  account from my knowledge of her circumstances, and I was conscious of
  looking on her with a very sympathetic and friendly eye.</p>

  <p>"This is quite satisfactory to me," she said at length, in the clear,
  high-pitched voice to which Bundy had objected, "and if it is equally so to
  Dr. Strangeways, I suppose I had better sign."</p>

  <p>She laid the paper on the table, and, taking the fountain-pen that Japp
  proffered, signed her name, Angelina Frood, in a bold, legible hand, and then
  returned the pen to its owner; who forthwith affixed his signature as witness
  and spread out the duplicate for me to sign. When this also was completed, he
  handed me the copy signed by Mrs. Frood and the receipt for the premium, and
  I drew a cheque for the amount and delivered it to him.</p>

  <p>"Many thanks," said he, slipping it into a wallet and pocketing it. "That
  concludes our business and puts you finally in possession. I wish you every
  success in your practice. By the way, I mentioned to Mrs. Frood that you had
  seen her husband and that you know how she is placed; and she agreed with me
  that it was best that you should understand the position in case you should
  meet him again."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Mrs. Frood agreed. "There is no use in trying to make a
  secret of it. He came down with you from London, Mr. Japp tells me."</p>

  <p>"Not from London," said I. "He got in at Dartford." Here Mr. Japp rose and
  stole towards the door. "Don't let me interrupt you," said he, "but I must
  get back to the office and hear what Bundy has to report. Don't get up. I can
  let myself out."</p>

  <p>He made his exit quietly, shutting the door after him, and as soon as he
  was gone Mrs. Frood asked:</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that he changed into your train at Dartford?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "I think he came to Dartford on foot. He looked tired
  and his boots were covered with white dust."</p>

  <p>"You are very observant, Dr. Strangeways," she said.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what made you notice him so particularly?"</p>

  <p>"He is rather a noticeable man," I said, and then, deciding that it was
  better to be quite frank, I added: "But the fact is I had seen him
  before."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said she. "Would you think me very inquisitive if I asked where
  you had seen him?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," I answered. "It was a little more than a year ago, about
  twelve o'clock at night, in a house near Regent's Park, to which I was taken
  in a closed car to see a lady."</p>

  <p>As I spoke she dropped her needlework and sat up, gazing at me with a
  startled and rather puzzled expression. "But," she said, "you are not the
  doctor who came to see me that night?"</p>

  <p>"I am, indeed," said I.</p>

  <p>"Now," she exclaimed, "isn't that an extraordinary thing? I had a feeling
  that I had seen you somewhere before. I seemed to recognize your voice. But
  you don't look the same. Hadn't you a beard then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am but the shaven and shorn remnant of my former self, but I am
  your late medical attendant."</p>

  <p>She looked at me with an odd, reflective, questioning expression, but
  without making any further comment. Presently she said:</p>

  <p>"You were very kind and sympathetic though you were so quiet. I wonder
  what you thought of it all."</p>

  <p>"I hadn't much to go on beyond the medical facts," I replied
  evasively.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you needn't be so cautious," said she, "now that the cat is out of
  the bag."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "it was pretty obvious that there had been trouble of some
  kind. The door had been broken open, there was one man in a state of
  hysterics, another man considerably upset and rather angry, and a woman with
  the mark on her neck of a cord or band&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was a knitted silk neck-tie, to be accurate. But you put the matter in
  a nut-shell very neatly; and I see that you diagnosed what novelists call
  'the eternal triangle.' And to a certain extent you were right; only the
  triangle was imaginary. If you don't mind, I will tell you just what did
  happen. The gentleman who came for you was a Mr. Fordyce, the lessee of one
  or two provincial theatres&mdash;I was on the stage then; but perhaps you
  guessed that."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I did."</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Fordyce had an idea of producing a play at one of his houses,
  and was going to give me a leading part. He had been to our house once or
  twice to talk the matter over with Nicholas (my husband) and me, and we were
  more or less friendly. He was quite a nice, sober kind of man, and perfectly
  proper and respectful. On this night he had been at the theatre where I had
  an engagement, and, as it was a wet night, he drove me home in his car, and
  was coming in to have a few words with us about our business. He wanted to
  see a photograph of me in a particular costume, and when we arrived home I
  ran upstairs to fetch it. There I found Nicholas, who had seen our arrival
  from the window, and was in a state of furious jealousy. Directly I entered
  the room, he locked the door and flew at me like a wild beast. As to what
  followed, I think you know as much as I do, for I fainted, and when I
  recovered Nicholas was sobbing in a corner, and Mr. Fordyce was standing by
  the door, looking as black as thunder."</p>

  <p>"Had your husband been jealous of Mr. Fordyce previously?"</p>

  <p>"Not a bit. But on this occasion he was in a very queer state. I think he
  had been drinking, and taking some other things that were bad for
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Such as cocaine," I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yes. But, dear me! What a very noticing person you are, Dr. Strangeways!
  But you are quite right. It was the cocaine that was the cause of the
  trouble. He was always a difficult man; emotional, excitable, eccentric, and
  not very temperate, but after he had acquired the drug habit he went to the
  bad completely. He became slovenly, and even dirty in his person, frightfully
  emotional, and gave up work of all kind, so that but for my tiny income and
  my small earnings we should have starved."</p>

  <p>"So you actually supported him?"</p>

  <p>"Latterly I did. And I daresay, if I had remained on the stage, we should
  have done fairly well, as I was supposed to have some talent, though I didn't
  like the life. But, of course, after this affair, I didn't dare to live with
  him. He wasn't safe. I should have been constantly in fear of my life."</p>

  <p>"Had he ever been violent before'"</p>

  <p>"Not seriously. He had often threatened horrible things, and I had looked
  on his threats as mere vapourings, but this was a different affair. I must
  have had a really narrow escape. So the very next day, I went into lodgings.
  But that didn't answer. He wouldn't agree to the separation, and was
  continually dogging me and making a disturbance. In the end, I had to give up
  my engagement and go off, leaving no address."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you went back to your people?"</p>

  <p>"No," she replied. "As a matter of fact, I haven't any people. My mother
  died when I was quite a child, and I lost my father when I was about
  seventeen. He died on the Gold Coast, where he held an appointment as
  District Commissioner."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said I, "I thought you were in some way connected with West Africa.
  I noticed the zodiac ring on your finger when you were signing the agreement.
  When I was newly qualified I took a trip down the West Coast as a ship's
  surgeon, and bought one of those rings at Cape Coast."</p>

  <p>"They are quaint little things, aren't they?" she remarked, slipping the
  ring off her finger and handing it to me. "I don't often wear it, though. It
  is rather clumsy, and it doesn't fit very well; and I don't care much for
  rings."</p>

  <p>I turned the little trinket over in my hand and examined it with
  reminiscent interest. It was a roughly wrought band of yellow native gold,
  with the conventional signs of the zodiac worked round it in raised figures.
  Inside I noticed that the letters A. C. had been engraved.</p>

  <p>"It was given to you before you were married, I presume," said I, as I
  returned it to her.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied, "those are the initials of my maiden
  name&mdash;Angelina Carthew." She took the ring from me, but instead of
  replacing it on her finger, dropped it into a little pouch-like purse with
  metal jaws, which she had taken from her pocket.</p>

  <p>"Your position is a very disagreeable one," said I, reverting to the main
  topic. "I wonder that you haven't applied for a judicial separation. There
  are ample grounds for making the application."</p>

  <p>"I suppose there are. But it wouldn't help me really, even if it were
  granted. I shouldn't get rid of him."</p>

  <p>"You could apply to the police if he molested you."</p>

  <p>"No doubt. But that doesn't sound very restful, does it?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it doesn't. But it would be better than being constantly
  molested without having any remedy or refuge."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it would," she agreed doubtfully, and then, with a faint smile,
  she added: "I suppose you are wondering what on earth made me marry him?"</p>

  <p>"Well," I replied, "it appears to me that his good fortune was more
  remarkable than his personal attractions."</p>

  <p>"He wasn't always like he is now," said she. "I married him nearly ten
  years ago, and he was fairly presentable then. His manners were quite nice
  and he had certain accomplishments that rather appealed to a young
  girl&mdash;I was only eighteen and rather impressionable. He was then getting
  a living by writing magazine stories&mdash;love stories, they were, of a
  highly emotional type&mdash;and occasional verses. They were second-rate
  stuff, really, but to me he seemed a budding genius. It was not until after
  we were married that the disillusionment came, and then only gradually as his
  bad habits developed."</p>

  <p>"By the way, what do you suppose he has come down here for? What does he
  want? I suppose he wishes you to go back to him?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose he does. But, primarily, I expect he wants money. It is a
  horrible position," she added, with sudden passion. "I hate the idea of
  hiding away from him when I suspect that the poor wretch has come down to his
  last few shillings. After all, he is my husband; and I am not so deadly poor
  now."</p>

  <p>"He seemed to have the wherewith to provide a fair supply of tobacco, to
  say nothing of the cocaine and a 'modest quencher' at the tavern," I remarked
  drily. "At any rate, I hope he won't succeed in finding out where you
  live."</p>

  <p>"I hope not," said she. "If he does, I shall have to move on, as I have
  had to do several times already, and I don't want to do that. I have only
  been here a little over two months, and it has been very pleasant and
  peaceful. But you see, Dr. Strangeways, that, if I am to follow Mr. Japp's
  advice, I shall inflict on you a very unpromising patient. There is no
  medical treatment for matrimonial troubles."</p>

  <p>"No," I agreed, rising and taking up my hat, "but the physical effects may
  be dealt with. If I am appointed your medical advisor, I shall send you a
  tonic, and if I may look in now and again to see how you are getting on, I
  may be able to help you over some of your difficulties."</p>

  <p>"It is very kind of you," she said, rising and shaking my hand warmly;
  and, accepting my suggestion that she had better not come to the street door,
  she showed me out into the hall and dismissed me with a smile and a little
  bow.</p>

  <p>When I reached the bottom of the steps, I stood irresolutely for a few
  moments and then, instead of making my way homeward, turned up the street
  towards the cathedral and the bridge, walking slowly and reflecting
  profoundly on the story I had just heard. It was a pitiful story; and the
  quiet, restrained manner of the telling made it the more impressive. All that
  was masculine in me rose in revolt against the useless, inexcusable wrecking
  of this poor woman's life. As to the man, he was, no doubt, to be pitied for
  being the miserable, degenerate wretch that he was. But he was doomed beyond
  any hope of salvation. Such wretches as he are condemned in the moment of
  their birth; they are born to an inheritance of misery and dishonour. But it
  is infamous that in their inevitable descent into the abyss&mdash;from which
  no one can save them&mdash;they should have the power to drag down with them
  sane and healthy human beings who were destined by nature to a life of
  happiness, of usefulness, and honour. I thought of the woman I had just
  left&mdash;comely, dignified, energetic, probably even talented. What was her
  future to be? So far as I could see, the upas shadow of this drug-sodden
  wastrel had fallen upon her, never to be lifted until merciful death should
  dissolve the ill-omened union.</p>

  <p>This last reflection gave my thoughts a new turn. What was this man's
  purpose in pursuing her? Was he bent merely on extorting money or on sharing
  her modest income? Or was there some more sinister motive? I recalled his
  face; an evil, sly, vindictive face. I considered what I knew of him; that he
  had undoubtedly made one attempt to murder this woman, and that, to my
  knowledge, he carried about his person the means of committing murder. For
  what purpose could he have provided himself with that formidable weapon? It
  might be merely as a means of coercion, or it might be as a means of
  revenge.</p>

  <p>Thus meditating, I had proceeded some distance along the street when I
  observed, on the opposite side, an old, three-gabled house which looked like
  some kind of institution. A lamp above the doorway threw its light on a stone
  tablet on which I could see an inscription of some length, and, judging this
  to be an ancient almshouse, I crossed the road to inspect it more closely. A
  glance at the tablet told me that this was the famous rest-house established
  in the sixteenth century by worthy Richard Watts, to give a night's lodging
  and entertainment to six poor travellers, with the express proviso that the
  said travellers must be neither rogues nor proctors. I had read through the
  quaint inscription and was speculating, as many others have speculated, on
  the nature of Richard Watts's grievance against proctors as a class, when the
  door opened suddenly and a man rushed out with such impetuosity that he
  nearly collided with me. I had moved out of his way when he halted and
  addressed me excitedly.</p>

  <p>"I say, governor, can you tell me where I can find a doctor?"</p>

  <p>"You have found one," I replied. "I am a doctor. What is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"There's a bloke in here throwing a fit," he answered, backing into the
  doorway and holding the door open for me. I entered, and followed him down a
  passage to a largish, barely furnished room, where I found four men and a
  woman, who looked like a hospital nurse, standing around and watching
  anxiously a man who lay on the floor.</p>

  <p>"Here's a doctor, matron," said my conductor, as he ushered me in.</p>

  <p>"Well, Simmonds," said the matron, "you haven't wasted much time."</p>

  <p>"No, mum," replied Simmonds, "I struck it lucky. Caught him just
  outside."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile I had stepped up to the prostrate man, and at the first glance I
  recognized him. He was Mrs. Frood's husband. And, whatever he might be
  "throwing," it was not a fit&mdash;in the ordinary medical sense; that is to
  say, it was not epilepsy or apoplexy; nor was it a fainting fit of an
  orthodox kind. If the patient had been a woman one would have called it a
  hysterical seizure, and I could give it no other name, though I was not
  unmindful of the paper packet that I had seen on that former occasion. But
  the emotional element was obvious. The man purported to be insensible, and
  manifestly was not. The tightly closed eyes, the everted lips&mdash;showing a
  row of blackened teeth&mdash;the clutching movements of the clawlike
  hands&mdash;all were suggestive of at least half-conscious simulation. I
  stood for a while, stooping over him and watching him intently, and as I did
  so the bystanders watched me. Then I felt his pulse, and found it, as I had
  expected, quick, feeble, and irregular; and finally, producing my
  stethoscope, listened to his heart with as little disturbance of his clothing
  as possible.</p>

  <p>"Well, doctor," said the matron, "what do you think of him?"</p>

  <p>"He is decidedly ill," I replied. "His heart is rather jumpy, and not very
  strong. Too much tobacco, I fancy, and perhaps some other things that are not
  very good, and possibly insufficient food."</p>

  <p>"He told me, when he came in," said the matron, "that he was practically
  destitute."</p>

  <p>"Ah," murmured Simmonds, "I expect he's been blowing all his money on
  Turkish baths," whereupon the other poor travellers sniggered softly, and
  were immediately extinguished by a reproving glance from the matron.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what brought this attack on?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied; "he had a little dispute with Simmonds, here, and
  suddenly became violently excited, and then he fell down insensible, as you
  see him. It was all about nothing."</p>

  <p>"I jest arsked 'im," said Simmonds, "if 'e could give me the name of the
  cove what done 'is 'air, 'cos I thought I'd like to 'ave mine done in the
  same fashionable style. That seemed to give 'im the fair pip. 'E jawed me
  something chronic, until I got shirty and told 'im if 'e didn't shut 'is face
  I'd give 'im a wipe acrost the snout. Then blow me if 'e didn't start to
  throw a fit."</p>

  <p>While this lucid explanation was proceeding I noticed that the patient was
  evidently listening intently, though he continued to twitch his face, exhibit
  his unlovely teeth, and wriggle his fingers. He was apparently waiting for my
  verdict with some anxiety.</p>

  <p>"The question is," said the matron, "what is to be done with him? Do you
  think he is in any danger?"</p>

  <p>As she spoke, we drifted towards the door, and when we were in the
  passage, out of earshot, I said:</p>

  <p>"The best place for that man is the infirmary. There is nothing much the
  matter with him but dope. He has been dosing himself with cocaine, and he has
  probably got some more of the stuff about him. He is in no danger now, but if
  he takes any more he may upset himself badly."</p>

  <p>"It is rather late to send him to the infirmary," she said, "and I don't
  quite like to do it. Poor fellow, he seems fearfully down on his luck, and he
  is quite a superior kind of man. Do you think it would be safe for him to
  stay here for the night if he had a little medicine of some kind?"</p>

  <p>"It would be safe enough," I replied, "if you could get possession of his
  coat and waistcoat and lock them up until the morning."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll manage that," said she; "and about the medicine?"</p>

  <p>"Let Simmonds walk up with me&mdash;I have taken Dr. Partridge's
  practice&mdash;and I will give it to him."</p>

  <p>We re-entered the supper-room and found the conditions somewhat changed.
  Whether it was that the word "infirmary" had been wafted to the patient's
  attentive ears, I cannot say; but there were evident signs of recovery. Our
  friend was sitting up, glaring wildly about him, and inquiring where he was;
  to which questions Simmonds was furnishing answers of a luridly inaccurate
  character. When I had taken another look at the patient, and received a
  vacant stare of almost aggressive unrecognition, I took possession of the
  facetious Simmonds, and, having promised to look in in the morning, wished
  the matron good-night and departed with my escort; who entertained me on the
  way home with picturesque, unflattering, and remarkably shrewd comments on
  the sufferer.</p>

  <p>I had made up a stimulant mixture, and handed it to Simmonds when I
  remembered Mrs. Frood and that Simmonds would pass her house on his way back.
  For an instant, I thought of asking him to deliver her medicine for me; and
  then, with quite a shock, I realized what a hideous blunder it would have
  been. Evidently, the poor travellers gave their names, and if the man, Frood,
  had given his correctly, the coincidence of the names would have impressed
  Simmonds instantly, and then the murder would have been out, and the fat
  would have been in the fire properly. It was a narrow escape, and it made me
  realize how insecure was that unfortunate lady's position with this man
  lurking in the town. And, realizing this, I determined to trust the addressed
  bottle to nobody, but to leave it at the house myself. Accordingly, having
  made up the medicine and wrapped it neatly in paper, I thrust it into my
  pocket, and, calling out to Mrs. Dunk that I should be back to supper in
  about half an hour, I set forth, and in a few minutes arrived at the little
  Georgian doorway and plied the elegant brass knocker. The door was
  opened&mdash;rather incautiously, I thought&mdash;by Mrs. Frood herself.</p>

  <p>"I am my own bottle-boy, you see, Mrs. Frood," said I, handing her the
  medicine. "I thought it safer not to send an addressed packet under the
  circumstances."</p>

  <p>"But how good of you!" she exclaimed. "How kind and thoughtful! But you
  shouldn't have troubled about it tonight."</p>

  <p>"It was only a matter of five minutes' walk," said I, "and besides, there
  was something that I thought you had better know," and hereupon I proceeded
  to give her a brief account of my recent adventures and the condition of her
  precious husband. "Is he subject to attacks of this kind?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered. "When he is put out about anything in some ways he is
  rather like a hysterical woman. But, you see, I was right. He is penniless.
  And that&mdash;now I come to think of it&mdash;makes it rather odd that he
  should be here. But won't you come in for a moment?"</p>

  <p>I entered and shut the door. "Why is it odd?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Because he would be getting some money tomorrow. I make him a small
  allowance; it is very little, but it is as much as I can possibly manage; and
  it is paid monthly, on the fifteenth of the month. But he has to apply for it
  personally at the bank or send an accredited messenger with a receipt; and as
  tomorrow is the fifteenth, the question is, why on earth is he down here now?
  I mean that it is odd that he should not have waited to collect the allowance
  before coming to hunt me up."</p>

  <p>"If he is in communication with your banker," said I, "he could, I
  suppose, get a letter forwarded to you?"</p>

  <p>"No," she replied; "the banker who pays him is the London agent of Mr.
  Japp's banker, and he doesn't know on whose behalf the payments are made. I
  had to make that arrangement, or he would have bombarded me with
  letters."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "you had better keep close for a day or two. If his search
  for you is unsuccessful, he may get discouraged and raise the siege. I will
  let you know what his movements are, so far as I can."</p>

  <p>She thanked me once more with most evident sincerity, and as I made my way
  to the door, she let me out with a cordial and friendly shake of the
  hand.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IV&mdash;DEALS WITH CHARITY AND ARCHAEOLOGY</h3>

  <p>Immediately after breakfast on the following morning I made my way to Mr.
  Richard Watts's establishment, where I learned that all the poor travellers
  had departed with the exception of my patient, who had been allowed to stay
  pending my report on him.</p>

  <p>"I shall be glad to see the back of him, poor fellow," said the matron,
  "for, of course, we have no arrangements for dealing with sick men."</p>

  <p>"Do you often get cases of illness here?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I really don't know," she answered. "You see, I am only doing temporary
  duty here while the regular matron is away. But I should think not, though
  little ailments are apt to occur in the case of a poor man who has been on
  the road for a week or so."</p>

  <p>"This man is on tramp, is he'" said I.</p>

  <p>"Well, no," she replied. "It seems, from what he tells me, that his wife
  has left him, and he had reason to believe that she was staying in this town.
  So he came down here to try to find her. He supposed that Rochester was a
  little place where everybody knew everybody else, and that he would have no
  difficulty in discovering her whereabouts. But all his inquiries have come to
  nothing. Nobody seems to have heard of her. I suppose you don't happen to
  know the name&mdash;Frood?"</p>

  <p>"I only came here yesterday, myself," was my evasive reply. "I am a
  stranger to the town. But is he certain that she is here?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think he is. At any rate, he seems inclined to give up the search
  for the present, and he is very anxious to get back to London. But I don't
  know how he is going to manage it. He isn't fit to walk."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "if it is only the railway fare that stands in the way,
  that difficulty can be got over. I will pay for his ticket; but I should like
  to be sure that he really goes."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll see to that," she said, with evident relief. "I will go with him
  to the station, and get his ticket and see him into the train. But you had
  better just have a look at him, and see that he is fit to go."</p>

  <p>She conducted me to the supper-room, where our friend was sitting in a
  Windsor armchair, looking the very picture of misery and dejection.</p>

  <p>"Here is the doctor come to see you, Mr. Frood," the matron said
  cheerfully, "and he is kind enough to say that, if you are well enough to
  travel, he will pay your fare to London. So there's an end of your
  difficulties."</p>

  <p>The poor devil glanced at me for an instant, and then looked away; and, to
  my intense discomfort, I saw that his eyes were filling.</p>

  <p>"It is indeed good of you, Sir," he murmured, shakily, but in a very
  pleasant voice and with a refined accent; "most good and kind to help a lame
  dog over a stile in this way. I don't know how to thank you."</p>

  <p>Here, as he showed a distinct tendency to weep, I replied hastily:</p>

  <p>"Not at all. We've all got to help one another in this world. And how are
  you feeling? Hand is still a little bit shaky, I see."</p>

  <p>I put my finger on his wrist and then looked him over generally. He was a
  miserable wreck, but I judged that he was as well as he was ever likely to
  be.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "you are not in first-class form, but you are up to a
  short railway journey. I suppose you have somewhere to go to in London?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, dismally, "I have a room. It isn't in the Albany, but
  it is a shelter from the weather."</p>

  <p>"Never mind," said I. "We must hope for better times. The matron is going
  to see you safely to the station and comfortably settled in the
  train&mdash;and"&mdash;here I handed her a ten shilling note&mdash;"you will
  get Mr. Frood's ticket, matron, and you had better give him the change. He
  may want a cab when he gets to town."</p>

  <p>He glowered sulkily at this arrangement&mdash;I suspect he had run out of
  cigarettes&mdash;but he thanked me again, and, when I had privately
  ascertained the time of the train which was to bear him away, I wished him
  adieu.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said I, "there is no likelihood of his hopping out at Strood
  to get a drink and losing the train?"</p>

  <p>The matron smiled knowingly. "He will start from Strood," said she. "I
  shall take him over the bridge in the tram and put him into the London
  express there. We don't want him back here tonight."</p>

  <p>Much relieved by the good lady's evident grasp of the situation, I turned
  away up the street and began to consider my next move. I had nothing to do
  this morning, for at present there was not a single patient on my books with
  the exception of Mrs. Frood; and it may have been in accordance with the
  prevailing belief that to persons in my condition, an individual, familiarly
  known as "the old gentleman," obligingly functions as employment agent, that
  my thoughts turned to that solitary patient. At any rate they did. Suddenly,
  it was borne in on me that I ought, without delay, to convey to her the glad
  tidings of her husband's departure. Whether the necessity would have appeared
  as urgent if her personal attractions had been less, I will not presume to
  say; nor whether had I been more self-critical, I should not have looked with
  some suspicion on this intense concern respecting the welfare of a woman who
  was almost a stranger to me. As it was, it appeared to me that I was but
  discharging a neighbourly duty when I executed an insinuating rat-tat on the
  handsome brass knocker which was adorned&mdash;somewhat inappropriately,
  under the circumstances&mdash;with a mask of Hypnos.</p>

  <p>After a short interval, the door was opened by a spare, middle-aged woman
  of melancholic aspect, with tow-coloured hair and a somewhat anemic
  complexion, who regarded me inquiringly with a faded blue eye.</p>

  <p>"Is Mrs. Frood at home?" I asked briskly.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid she is not," was the reply, uttered in a dejected tone. "I
  saw her go out some time ago, and I haven't heard her come back. But I'll
  just see, if you will come in a moment."</p>

  <p>I entered the hall and listened with an unaccountable feeling of
  disappointment as she rapped on the door first of the front room, and then of
  the back.</p>

  <p>"She isn't in her rooms there," was the dispirited report, "but she may be
  in the basement. I'll call out and ask."</p>

  <p>She retired to the inner hall and gave utterance to a wail like that of an
  afflicted sea-gull. But there was no response; and I began to feel myself
  infected by her melancholy.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry you have missed her, Sir," said she; and then she asked: "Are
  you her doctor, Sir?"</p>

  <p>I felt myself justified in affirming that I was, whereupon she
  exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"Ah, poor thing! It is a comfort to know that she has someone to look
  after her. She has been looking very sadly of late. Very sadly, she has."</p>

  <p>I began to back cautiously towards the door, but she followed me up and
  continued: "I am afraid she has had a deal of trouble; a deal of trouble,
  poor dear. Not that she ever speaks of it to me. But I know. I can see the
  lines of grief and sorrow&mdash;like a worm in the bud, so to speak,
  Sir&mdash;and it makes my heart ache. It does, indeed."</p>

  <p>I mumbled sympathetically and continued to back towards the door.</p>

  <p>"I don't see very much of her," she continued in a plaintive tone. "She
  keeps herself very close. Too close, I think. You see, she does for herself
  entirely. Now and again, when she asks me, which is very seldom, I put a bit
  of supper in her room. That is all. And I do think that it isn't good for a
  young woman to live so solitary; and I do hope you'll make her take a little
  more change."</p>

  <p>"I suppose she goes out sometimes," said I, noting that she was out at the
  present moment.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," was the reply. "She goes out a good deal. But always alone. She
  never has any society."</p>

  <p>"And what time does she usually come in?" I asked, with a view to a later
  call.</p>

  <p>"About six; or between that and seven. Then she has her supper and puts
  the things out on the hall table. And that is the last I usually see of
  her."</p>

  <p>By this time I had reached the door and softly unfastened the latch.</p>

  <p>"If you should see her," I said, "you might tell her that I shall look in
  this evening about half-past seven."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Sir," she replied. "I shall see her at lunch-time, and I will
  give her your message."</p>

  <p>I thanked her, and, having now got the door open, I wished her good
  morning, and retreated down the steps.</p>

  <p>As I was in the act of turning away, my eye lighted on the adjacent bay
  window, appertaining to the office of Messrs. Japp and Bundy, and I then
  perceived' above the green curtain the upper half of a human face, including
  a pair of tortoiseshell-rimmed spectacles; an apparition which informed me
  that Mr. Bundy had been&mdash;to use Sam Weller's
  expression&mdash;"a-twigging of me." On catching my eye, the face rose
  higher, disclosing a broad grin; whereupon, without any apparent reason, I
  felt myself turning somewhat red. However, I mounted the official steps, and,
  opening the office door, confronted the smiler and his more sedate
  partner.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said the former, "you drew a blank, doctor. I saw the lovely
  Angelina go out about an hour ago. Whom did you see?"</p>

  <p>"The lady of the house, I presume; a pale, depressed female."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Bundy. "Looks like an undertaker's widow. That's Mrs.
  Gillow. Rhymes with willow&mdash;very appropriate, too," and he began to
  chant in an absurd, Punch-like voice: "Oh, all round my hat I'll wear the
  green&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Be quiet, Bundy," said Mr. Japp, regarding his partner with a wrinkly and
  indulgent smile.</p>

  <p>Bundy clapped his hand over his mouth and blew out his cheeks, and I took
  the opportunity to explain: "I called on Mrs. Frood to let her know that her
  husband is leaving the town."</p>

  <p>"Leaving the town, is he?" said Mr. Japp, elevating his eyebrows and
  thereby causing his forehead to resemble a small Venetian blind. "Do you know
  when?"</p>

  <p>"He goes this morning by the ten-thirty express to London."</p>

  <p>"Hooray!" ejaculated Bundy, with a flourish of his arms that nearly
  capsized his stool. He recovered himself with an effort, and then, fixing his
  eyes on me, proceeded to whistle the opening bars of "O! Thou that tellest
  good tidings to Zion!"</p>

  <p>"That'll do, Bundy," said Mr. Japp. Then turning to me, he asked: "Where
  did you learn these good tidings, Doctor'"</p>

  <p>I gave them a brief account of the happenings of the previous night and
  this morning's sequel, to which they listened with deep attention. When I had
  finished Mr. Japp said: "You have done a very great kindness to my friend
  Mrs. Frood. It will be an immense relief to her to know that she can walk
  abroad without the danger of encountering this man. Besides, if he had stayed
  here he would probably have found her out."</p>

  <p>"He might even have found her at home," said Bundy, "and that would have
  been worse. So I propose a vote of thanks to the doctor&mdash;with musical
  honours. For-hor he's a jolly good fell&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There, that'll do, Bundy, that'll do," said Mr. Japp. "I never saw such a
  fellow. You'll have the neighbours complaining."</p>

  <p>Bundy leaned towards me confidentially and remarked in a stage whisper,
  glancing at his partner: "Fidgetty old cove; regular old killjoy." Then, with
  a sudden change of manner, he asked: "What about that wall job, Japp? Are you
  going to have a look at them?"</p>

  <p>"I can't go at present," said Japp. "Bulford will be coming in presently
  and I must see him. Have you got anything special to do?"</p>

  <p>"Only old Jeff'son's lease, and that can wait. Shall I trot over and see
  what sort of mess they are making of things?"</p>

  <p>"I wish you would," said Japp; whereupon Mr. Bundy removed his spectacles,
  stuck in his eye-glass, extracted from the desk his hat and gloves which he
  assumed with the aid of the looking-glass, and took his stick from the
  corner. Then he looked at me reflectively and asked:</p>

  <p>"Are you interested in archaeology, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhat," I replied. "Why do you ask?"</p>

  <p>"Because we are putting some patches in the remains of the city wall. It
  isn't much to look at, and there isn't a great deal of the original Roman
  work left; but if you would care to have a look at it you might walk up there
  with me."</p>

  <p>I agreed readily, being, as I have said, somewhat at a loose end, and we
  set forth together, Bundy babbling cheerfully as we went.</p>

  <p>"I have often thought," said he, "that there must have been something
  rather pleasant and restful about the old walled cities, particularly after
  curfew when the gates were shut&mdash;that is, provided you were inside at
  the time."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said I. "An enclosed precinct has a certain agreeable quality of
  seclusion that you can't get in an open town or village. When I was a
  student, I lived for a time in chambers in Staple Inn, and it was, as you
  say, rather pleasant, when one came home at night, and the porter had let one
  in at the wicket, to enter and find the gates closed, the courts all quiet
  and empty, and to know that all traffic was stopped and all strangers shut
  out until the morning. But it doesn't appear to be in accordance with modern
  taste, for those old Chancery Inns have nearly all gone, and there is no
  tendency to replace them with anything similar."</p>

  <p>"No," Bundy agreed, stopping to look up at an old timber house, "taste in
  regard to buildings, if there is any&mdash;Japp says there isn't&mdash;has
  changed completely in the last hundred years or so. Look at this alley we are
  in now. Every house has got a physiognomy of its own. But when we rebuild it,
  we shall fill it up with houses that will look as if they had been bought in
  packets like match-boxes."</p>

  <p>Gossiping thus, we threaded our way through all sorts of queer little
  alleys and passages. At length Bundy stopped at a wooden gate in a high
  fence, and, pushing it open, motioned for me to enter; and as I did so he
  drew out the key which was in the lock and put it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>The place which we had entered was a space of waste land, littered with
  the remains of some old houses that had been demolished and enclosed on three
  sides by high fences. The fourth side was formed by a great mass of crumbling
  rubble, patched in places with rough masonry and brickwork, and showing in
  its lower part the remains of courses of Roman bricks. It rose to a
  considerable height, and was evidently of enormous thickness, as could be
  seen where large areas of the face had crumbled away, exposing great
  cavities, in which wall-flowers, valerian and other rock-haunting plants, had
  taken up their abode. On one of these a small gang of men were at work, and
  it was evident that repairs on a considerable scale were contemplated, for
  there were several large heaps of rough stone and old bricks, and in a
  cart-shed in a corner of the space were a large number of barrels of
  lime.</p>

  <p>As we entered, the foreman came forward to meet us, and Bundy handed him
  the key from the gate.</p>

  <p>"Better keep it in your pocket," said he. "Mr. Japp is rather particular
  about keys that he has charge of. He doesn't like them left in doors or
  gates. How are the men getting on?"</p>

  <p>"As well as you can expect of a lot of casuals like these," was the reply.
  "There isn't a mason or a bricklayer among them, excepting that old chap
  that's mixing the mortar. However, it's only a rough job."</p>

  <p>We walked over to the part of the old wall where the men were at work, and
  the appearances certainly justified the foreman's last remark. It was a very
  rough job. The method appeared to consist in building up outside the cavity a
  primitive wall of unhewn stone with plenty of mortar, and, when it had risen
  a foot or two, filling up the cavity inside with loose bricks, lumps of
  stone, shovelfuls of liquid mortar, and chunks of lime.</p>

  <p>I ventured to remark that it did not look a very secure method of
  building, upon which Bundy turned his eyeglass on me and smiled
  knowingly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Doctor," said he, "you don't appear to appreciate the subtlety of
  the method. The purpose of these activities is to create employment. That has
  been clearly stated by the town council. But if you want to create employment
  you build a wall that will tumble down and give somebody else the job of
  putting it up again."</p>

  <p>Here, as a man suddenly bore down on us with a bucket of mortar, Bundy
  hopped back to avoid the unclean contact, and nearly sat down on a heap of
  smoking lime.</p>

  <p>"You had a narrow escape that time, mister," remarked the old gentleman
  who presided over the mortar department, as Bundy carefully dusted his
  delicate shoes with his handkerchief; "that stuff would 'ave made short work
  of them fine clothes of yourn."</p>

  <p>"Would it?" said Bundy, dusting his shoes yet more carefully and wiping
  the soles on the turf.</p>

  <p>"Ah," rejoined the old man; "terrible stuff is quicklime. Eats up
  everything same as what fire does." He rested his hands on his shovel, and,
  assuming a reminiscent air, continued: "There was a pal o' mine what was
  skipper of a barge. A iron barge, she was, and he had to take on a lading of
  lime from some kilns. The stuff was put aboard with a shoot. Well, my pal, he
  gets 'is barge under the shoot and then 'e goes off, leavin' 'is mate to see
  the lime shot into the hold. Well, it seems the mate had been takin' some
  stuff aboard, too. Beer, or p'raps whisky. At any rate, he'd got a skinful.
  Well, presently the skipper comes back, and he sees 'em a-tippin' the trucks
  of lime on to the shoot, and he sees the barge's hold beginning to fill, but
  'e don't see 'is mate nowhere. He goes aboard, down to the cabin, but there
  ain't no signs of the mate there, nor yet anywheres else. Well, they gets the
  barge loaded and the hatch-covers on, and everything ready for sea; and still
  there ain't no signs of the mate. So my pal, rememberin' that the
  mate&mdash;his name was Bill&mdash;rememberin' that Bill seemed a bit
  squiffy, supposed he must 'ave gone overboard. So 'e takes on a fresh hand
  temporary and off 'e goes on 'is trip.</p>

  <p>"Well, they makes their port all right and brings up alongside the wharf,
  but owing to a strike among the transport men they can't unload for about
  three weeks. However, when the strike is over, they rigs a whip and a basket
  and begins to get the stuff out. All goes well until they get down to the
  bottom tier. Then one of the men brings upa bone on his shovel. 'Hallo!' says
  the skipper, 'what's bones a-doin' in a cargo of fresh lime?' He rakes over
  the stuff on the floor and up comes a skull with a hole in the top of it.
  'Why, blow me,' says the skipper, 'if that don't look like Bill. He warn't as
  thin in the face as all that, but I seem to know them teeth.' Just then one
  of the men finds a clay pipe&mdash;a nigger's head, it was&mdash;and the
  skipper reckernizes it at once. 'That there's Bill's pipe,' sez he, 'and them
  bones is Bill's bones,' 'e sez. And so they were. They found 'is belt-buckle
  and 'is knife, and 'is trouser buttons and the nails out of 'is boots. And
  that's all there was left of Bill. He must have tumbled down into the hold
  and cracked his nut, and then the first truckful of lime must 'ave covered
  'im up. So, if you sets any value on them 'andsome shoes o' yourn, don't you
  go a-treadin' in quick lime."</p>

  <p>Bundy looked down anxiously at his shoes, and, having given them an
  additional wipe, he moved away from the dangerous neighbourhood of the lime
  and we went together to examine the ancient wall.</p>

  <p>"That was rather a tall yarn of the old man's," remarked Bundy. "Is it a
  fact that lime is as corrosive as he made out?"</p>

  <p>"I don't really know very much about it," I replied. "There is a general
  belief that it will consume almost anything but metal. How true that is I
  can't say, but I remember that at the Crippen trial one of the medical
  experts&mdash;I think it was Pepper&mdash;said that if the body had been
  buried in quicklime it would have been entirely consumed&mdash;excepting the
  bones, of course. But it is difficult to believe that a body could disappear
  completely in three weeks, or thereabouts, as our friend said. How fine this
  old wall looks with those clumps of valerian and wallflowers growing on it! I
  suppose it encircled the town completely at one time?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "and it is a pity there isn't more of it left, or at
  least one or two of the gateways. A city gate is such a magnificent
  adornment. Think of the gates of Canterbury and Rye, and especially at
  Sandwich, where you actually enter the town through the barbican; and think
  of what Rochester must have been before all the gates were pulled down. But
  you must hear Japp on the subject. He's a regular architectural Jeremiah. By
  the way, what did you think of Mrs. Frood? You saw her last night, didn't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I was rather taken with her. She is very nice and friendly and
  unaffected, and good-looking, too. I thought her distinctly handsome."</p>

  <p>"She isn't bad-looking," Bundy admitted. "But I can't stand her voice. It
  gets on my nerves. I hate a squeaky voice."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't call it squeaky," said I. "It is a high voice, and rather
  sing-song; and it isn't, somehow, quite in keeping with her appearance and
  manner."</p>

  <p>"No," said Bundy, "that's what it is. She's too big for a voice like
  that."</p>

  <p>I laughed at the quaint expression. "People's voices," said I, "are not
  like steamers' whistles, graduated in pitch according to their tonnage.
  Besides, Mrs. Frood is not such a very big woman."</p>

  <p>"She is a good size," said he. "I should call her rather tall. At any
  rate, she is taller than I am. But I suppose you will say that she might be
  that without competing with the late Mrs. Bates."</p>

  <p>"Comparisons between the heights of men and women," I said cautiously,
  "are rather misleading," and here I changed the subject, though I judged that
  Bundy was not sensitive in regard to his stature, for while he was cleaning
  the lime from his shoes I had noticed that he wore unusually low heels. Nor
  need he have been, for though on a small scale, he was quite an
  important-looking person.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think," he asked, after a pause, "that it is rather queer that
  the man Frood should have gone off so soon T He only came down yesterday, and
  he can't have made much of a search for Madame."</p>

  <p>"The queer thing is that he should have come down on that particular day,"
  I replied. "It seems that he draws a monthly allowance on the fifteenth. That
  was what made him so anxious to get back; but it is odd that he didn't put
  off his visit here until he had collected the money."</p>

  <p>"If he had run his wife to earth, he could have collected it from her,"
  said Bundy. "I wonder how he found out that she was here."</p>

  <p>"He evidently hadn't very exact information," I said, "nor did he seem
  quite certain that she really was here. And his failure to get any news of
  her appears to have discouraged him considerably. It is just possible that he
  has gone back to get more precise information if he can, when he has drawn
  his allowance."</p>

  <p>"That is very likely," Bundy agreed; "and it is probable that we haven't
  seen the last of him yet."</p>

  <p>"I have a strong suspicion that we haven't," said I.</p>

  <p>"If he is sure she is here, and can get enough money together to come and
  spend a week here, he will be pretty certain to discover her whereabouts. It
  is a dreadful position for her. She ought to get a judicial separation."</p>

  <p>"I doubt if she could," said he. "You may be sure he would contest that
  application pretty strongly, and what case would she have in support of it?
  He is an unclean blighter; he doesn't work; he smokes and drinks too much,
  and you say he takes drugs. But he doesn't seem to be violent or dangerous or
  threatening, or to be on questionable terms with other women-at least, I have
  never heard anything to that effect. Have you?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered&mdash;I had said nothing to him or Japp about the London
  incident. "He seems to have married the only woman in the world who would
  look at him."</p>

  <p>Bundy grinned. "An unkind cut, that, Doctor," said he; "but I believe
  you're right. And here we are, back at the official premises. Are you coming
  in?"</p>

  <p>I declined the invitation, and as he skipped up the steps I turned my face
  homewards.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER V&mdash;JOHN THORNDYKE</h3>

  <p>The sexual preferences or affinities of men and women have always
  impressed me as very mysterious and inexplicable. I am referring to the
  selective choice of individuals, not to the general attraction of the sexes
  for one another. Why should a particular pair of human beings single one
  another out from the mass of their fellows as preferable to all others? Why
  to one particular man does one particular woman and no other become the
  exciting cause of the emotion of love? It is not a matter of mere physical
  beauty or mental excellence, for if it were men and women would be simply
  classifiable into the attractive and the non-attractive; whereas we find in
  practice that a woman who may be to the majority of men an object of
  indifference, is to some one man an object of passionate love; and
  vice-versa. Nor is love necessarily accompanied by any delusions as to the
  worth of its object, for it will persist in spite of the clear recognition of
  personal defects and in conscious conflict with judgment and reason.</p>

  <p>The above reflections, with others equally profound, occupied my mind as I
  sat on a rather uncomfortable little rush-seated chair in the nave of
  Rochester Cathedral; whither I had proceeded in obedience to orders from Mrs.
  Dunk, to attend the choral afternoon service; and they were occasioned by the
  sudden recognition&mdash;not without surprise&mdash;of the very deep
  impression that had been made on me by my patient, Mrs. Frood. For the
  intensity of that impression I could not satisfactorily account. It is true
  that her circumstances were interesting and provocative of sympathy. But that
  was no reason for the haunting of my thoughts by her, of which I was
  conscious. She was not a really beautiful woman, though I thought her more
  than commonly good-looking; and she had evidently made no particular
  impression on Bundy. Yet, though I had seen her but three times, including my
  first meeting with her a year ago, I had to recognize that she had hardly
  been out of my thoughts since, and I was aware of looking forward with
  ridiculous expectancy to my proposed visit to her this evening.</p>

  <p>Thus, speculations on the meaning of this preoccupation mingled themselves
  with other speculations, as, for instance, on the abrupt changes of intention
  suggested by half of an Early English arch clapped up against a Norman pier;
  and as my thoughts rambled on, undisturbed by a pleasant voice, intoning with
  soothing unintelligibility somewhere beyond the stone screen, I watched with
  languid curiosity the strangers who entered and stole on tiptoe to the
  nearest vacant chair. Presently, however, as the intoning voice gave place to
  the deep, pervading hum of the organ, a visitor entered who instantly
  attracted my attention.</p>

  <p>He was obviously a personage&mdash;a real personage; not one of those who
  have achieved greatness by the free use of their elbows, or have had it
  thrust upon them by influential friends. This was an unmistakable
  thoroughbred. He was a tall man, very erect and dignified in carriage, and in
  spite of his iron-grey hair, evidently strong, active, and athletic. But it
  was his face that specially riveted my attention: not merely by reason that
  it was a handsome, symmetrical face, inclining to the Greek type, with level
  brows, a fine, straight nose, and a shapely mouth, but rather on account of
  its suggestion of commanding strength and intelligence. It was a strangely
  calm&mdash;even immobile&mdash;face; but yet it conveyed a feeling of
  attentiveness and concentration, and especially of power.</p>

  <p>I watched the stranger curiously as he stepped quietly to a seat not far
  from me, noting how he seemed to stand out from the ordinary men who
  surrounded him, and wondering who he was. But I was not left to wonder very
  long. A few moments later another visitor arrived, but not a stranger this
  time; for in this newcomer I recognized an old acquaintance, a Dr. Jervis,
  whom I had known when I was a student and when he had taken temporary charge
  of my uncle's practise. Since then, as I had learned, he had qualified as a
  barrister and specialized in legal medicine as the coadjutor of the famous
  medical jurist, Dr. John Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>For a few moments Jervis stood near the entrance looking about the nave,
  as if in search of someone. Then, suddenly, his eye lighted on the
  distinguished stranger, and he walked straight over to him and sat down by
  his side; from which, and from the smile of recognition with which he was
  greeted, I inferred that the stranger was none other than Dr. Thorndyke
  himself.</p>

  <p>Jervis had apparently not seen, or at least not recognized me, but, as I
  observed that there was a vacant chair by his side, I determined to renew our
  acquaintance and secure, if possible, a presentation to his eminent
  colleague. Accordingly, I crossed the nave, and, taking the vacant chair,
  introduced myself, and was greeted with a cordial hand-shake.</p>

  <p>The circumstances did not admit of conversation, but presently, when the
  anthem appeared to be drawing to a close, Jervis glanced at his watch and
  whispered to me: "I want to hear all your news, Strangeways, and to introduce
  you to Thorndyke; and we must get some tea before we go to the station. Shall
  we clear out now?"</p>

  <p>As I assented he whispered to Thorndyke, and we all rose and filed
  silently towards the door, our exit covered by the concluding strains of the
  anthem. As soon as we were outside Jervis presented me to his colleague, and
  suggested an immediate adjournment to some place of refreshment. I proposed
  that they should come and have tea with me, but Jervis replied: "I'm afraid
  we haven't time today. There is a very comfortable teashop close to the
  Jasperian gate-house. You had better come there and then perhaps you can walk
  to the station with us."</p>

  <p>We adopted this plan, and when we had established ourselves on a settle by
  the window of the ancient, low-ceiled room and given our orders to a young
  lady in a becoming brown costume, Jervis proceeded to interrogate.</p>

  <p>"And what might you be doing in Rochester, Strangeways?"</p>

  <p>"Nominally," I replied, "I am engaged in medical practice. Actually, I am
  a gentleman at large. I have taken a death vacancy here, and I arrived
  yesterday morning."</p>

  <p>"Any patients?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Two at present," I answered. "One I brought down with me and returned
  empty this morning. The other is his wife."</p>

  <p>"Ha," said Jervis, "a concise statement, but obscure. It seems to require
  amplification."</p>

  <p>I accordingly proceeded to amplify, describing in detail my journey from
  town and my subsequent dealings with my fellow-traveller. The circumstances
  of Mrs. Frood, being matters of professional confidence, I was at first
  disposed to suppress; but then, reflecting that my two friends were in a
  position to give expert opinions and advice, I put them in possession of all
  the facts that were known to me, excepting the Regent's Park incident, which
  I felt hardly at liberty to disclose.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Jervis, when I had finished, "if the rest of your practice
  develops on similar lines, we shall have to set up a branch establishment in
  your neighbourhood. There are all sorts of possibilities in this case. Don't
  you think so, Thorndyke?"</p>

  <p>"I should hardly say 'all sorts,'" was the reply. "The possibilities seem
  to me to be principally of one sort; extremely disagreeable for the poor
  lady. She has the alternatives of allowing herself to be associated with this
  man&mdash;which seems to be impossible&mdash;or of spending the remainder of
  her life in a perpetual effort to escape from him; which is an appalling
  prospect for a young woman."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Jervis, "it is bad enough. But there seems to me worse
  possibilities with a fellow of this kind; a drinking, drug-swallowing,
  hysterical degenerate. You never know what a man of that type will do."</p>

  <p>"You always hope that he will commit suicide," said Thorndyke; "and to do
  him justice, he does fairly often show that much perception of his proper
  place in nature. But, as you say, the actions of a mentally and morally
  abnormal man are incalculable. He may kill himself or he may kill somebody
  else, or he may join with other abnormals to commit incomprehensible and
  apparently motiveless political crimes. But we will hope that Mr. Frood will
  limit his activities to sponging on his wife."</p>

  <p>The conversation now turned from my affairs to those of my friends, and I
  ventured to inquire what had brought them to Rochester.</p>

  <p>"We came down," said Jervis, "to watch an inquest for one of our insurance
  clients. But after all it has had to be adjourned for a fortnight. So we may
  have the pleasure of seeing you again."</p>

  <p>"We won't leave it to chance," said I. "Let us settle that you come to
  lunch with me, if that will be convenient. You can fix your own time."</p>

  <p>My two friends consulted, and, having referred to their time-table,
  accepted the invitation for one o'clock on that day fortnight; and when I had
  "booked the appointment," we finished our tea and sallied forth, making our
  way over the bridge to Strood Station, at the main entrance to which I wished
  them adieu.</p>

  <p>As I turned away from the station and sauntered slowly along the shore
  before recrossing the bridge, I recalled the conversation of my two
  colleagues with a certain vague discomfort. To both of them, it was evident,
  the relations of my fair patient and her husband presented sinister
  possibilities, although I had not informed them of the actual murderous
  attack; and though the more cautious reticent Thorndyke had seemed to
  minimize them, his remarks had expressed what was already in my own mind,
  accentuated by what I knew. These nervy, abnormal men are never safe to deal
  with. Their unstable emotions may be upset in a moment and then no one can
  tell what will happen. It was quite possible that Frood had come to Rochester
  with the perfectly peaceable intention of inducing his wife to return to him.
  But this was far from certain, and I shuddered to think of what might follow
  a refusal on her part. I did not like that knife. I have a sane man's dislike
  of lethal weapons of all kinds; but especially do I dislike them in the hands
  of those whose self-control is liable to break down suddenly.</p>

  <p>It was true that this man had not succeeded in finding his wife, and even
  seemed to have given up the search. But I felt pretty certain that he had
  not. Somehow, he had discovered that she was in the town, and from the same
  source he might get further information; and, in any case, I felt no doubt
  that he would renew the pursuit, and that, in the end, he would find her. And
  then&mdash;but at this point I found myself opposite the house and observed
  Mrs. Gillow standing on the doorstep, fumbling in her pocket for the
  latch-key. She had just extracted it, and was in the act of inserting it into
  the latch when I crossed the road and made my presence known. She greeted me
  with a wan smile as I ascended the steps, and, having by this time got the
  door open, admitted me to the hall.</p>

  <p>"I gave Mrs. Frood your message at lunch-time, sir," said she, in a
  depressed tone, "and I believe she has come in." Here, having closed the
  street door, she rapped softly with her knuckles at that of the front room,
  whereupon the voice to which Bundy objected so much called out: "Come in,
  Mrs. Gillow."</p>

  <p>The latter threw the door open. "It is the doctor, Madam," said she; and
  on this announcement, I walked in.</p>

  <p>"I didn't hear you knock," said Mrs. Frood, rising, and holding out her
  hand.</p>

  <p>"I didn't knock," I replied. "I sneaked in under cover of Mrs.
  Gillow."</p>

  <p>"That was very secret and cautious of you," said she.</p>

  <p>"You make me feel like a sort of feminine Prince Charlie, lying perdu in
  the robbers' cavern; whereas, I have actually been taking my walks abroad and
  brazenly looking in the shop windows. But I have kept a sharp lookout, all
  the same."</p>

  <p>"There really wasn't any need," said I. "The siege is raised.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that my husband has gone?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I do, indeed," I answered; and I gave her a brief account of the events
  of the morning, suppressing my unofficial part in the transaction.</p>

  <p>"Do you think," she asked, "that the matron paid his fare out of her own
  pocket?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure she didn't," I answered hastily. "She touched some local
  altruist for the amount; it was only a few shillings, you know."</p>

  <p>"Still," she said, "I feel that I ought to refund those few shillings.
  They were really expended for my benefit."</p>

  <p>"Well, you can't," I said with some emphasis. "You couldn't do it without
  disclosing your identity, and then you would have some philanthropist trying
  to effect a reconciliation. Your cue is to keep yourself to yourself for the
  present."</p>

  <p>"For the present!" she echoed. "It seems to me that I have got to be a
  fugitive for the rest of my natural life. It is a horrible position, to have
  to live in a state of perpetual concealment, like a criminal, and never dare
  to make an acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"Don't you know anyone in Rochester?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Not a soul," she replied, "excepting Mr. Japp, who is a relative by
  marriage&mdash;he was my aunt's brother-in-law&mdash;his partner, and Mrs.
  Gillow and you. And you all know my position."</p>

  <p>"Does Mrs. Gillow know the state of affairs?" I asked in some
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered, "I thought it best to tell her, in confidence, so
  that she should understand that I want to live a quiet life."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you haven't cut yourself off completely from all your friends?"
  said I.</p>

  <p>"Very nearly. I haven't many friends that I really care about much, but I
  keep in touch with one or two of my old comrades. But I have had to swear
  them to secrecy&mdash;though it looks as if the secret had leaked out in some
  way. Of course they all know Nicholas&mdash;my husband."</p>

  <p>"And I suppose you have been able to learn from them how your husband
  views the separation?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Of course he thinks I have treated him abominably, and he evidently
  suspects that I have some motive for leaving him other than mere dislike of
  his unpleasant habits. The usual motive, in fact."</p>

  <p>"What Sam Weller would call a 'priory attachment'?" I suggested.</p>

  <p>"Yes. He is a jealous and suspicious man by nature. I had quite a lot of
  trouble with him in that way before that final outbreak, though I have always
  been most circumspect in my relations with other men. Still, a woman doesn't
  complain of a little jealousy. Within reason, it is a natural, masculine
  failing."</p>

  <p>"I should consider a tendency to use a knitted silk necktie for purposes
  which I need not specify as going rather beyond ordinary masculine failings,"
  I remarked drily; on which she laughed and admitted that perhaps it was so.
  There was a short pause; then, turning to a fresh subject, she asked: "Do you
  think you will get any of Dr. Partridge's practice?"</p>

  <p>"I suspect not, or at any rate very little; and that reminds me that I
  have not yet inquired as to my patient's condition. Are you any better?"</p>

  <p>As I asked the question, I looked at her attentively, and noted that she
  was still rather pale and haggard, so far as I could judge by the subdued
  light of the shaded lamp, and that the darkness under the eyes remained
  undiminished.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I am not doing you much credit," she replied, with a faint
  smile. "But you can't expect any improvement while these unsettled conditions
  exist. If you could induce my respected husband to elope with another woman
  you would effect an immediate cure."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," said I, "that is beyond my powers, to say nothing of the
  inhumanity to the other woman. But we must persevere. You must let me look in
  on you from time to time, just to keep an eye on you."</p>

  <p>"I hope you will," she replied, energetically. "If it doesn't weary you to
  listen to my complaints and gossip a little, please keep me on your visiting
  list. With the exception of Mr. Japp, you are the only human creature that I
  hold converse with. Mrs. Gillow is a dear, good creature, but instinct warns
  me not to get on conversational terms with her. She's rather lonely,
  too."</p>

  <p>"Yes; you might find it difficult to turn the tap off. I am always very
  cautious with housekeepers and landladies."</p>

  <p>She darted a mischievous glance at me. "Even if your landlady happens to
  be your patient?" she asked.</p>

  <p>I chuckled as I remembered our dual relationship.</p>

  <p>"That," said I "is an exceptional case. The landlady becomes merged in the
  patient, and the patient tends to become a friend."</p>

  <p>"The doctor," she retorted, "tends very strongly to become a friend, and a
  very kind and helpful friend. I think you have been exceedingly good to
  me&mdash;a mere waif who has drifted across your horizon."</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, "if you think so, far be it from me to contradict you. One
  may as well pick up gratefully a stray crumb of commendation that one doesn't
  deserve to set off against the deserved credit that one doesn't get. But I
  should like to think that all my good deeds in the future will be as
  agreeable in the doing."</p>

  <p>She gave me a prim little smile. "We are getting monstrously polite," she
  remarked, upon which we both laughed.</p>

  <p>"However," said I, "the moral of it all is that you ought to have a
  friendly medical eye kept on you, and, as mine is the eye that happens to be
  available, and as you are kind enough to accept the optical supervision, I
  shall give myself the pleasure of looking in on you from time to time to see
  how you are and to hear how the world wags. What is the best time to find you
  at home'"</p>

  <p>"I am nearly always at home after seven o'clock, but perhaps that is not
  very convenient for you. I don't know how you manage your practice."</p>

  <p>"The fact is," said I, "that at present you are my practice, so I shall
  adapt my visiting round to your circumstances, and make my call at, or after,
  seven. I suppose you get some exercise?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. Quite a lot. I walk out in the country, and wander about Chatham
  and Gillingham and out to Frindsbury. I have been along the Watling Street as
  far as Cobham. Rochester itself I rather avoid for fear of making
  acquaintances, though it is a pleasant old town in spite of the
  improvements."</p>

  <p>As she spoke of these solitary rambles the idea floated into my mind that,
  later on, I might perchance offer to diminish their solitude. But I quickly
  dismissed it. Her position was, in any case, one of some delicacy&mdash;that
  of a young woman living apart from her husband. It would be an act the very
  reverse of friendly to compromise her in any way; nor would it tend at all to
  my own professional credit. A doctor's reputation is nearly as tender as a
  woman's.</p>

  <p>Our conversation had occupied nearly three quarters of an hour, and,
  although I would willingly have lingered, it appeared to me that I had made
  as long a visit as was permissible. I accordingly rose, and, having given a
  few words of somewhat perfunctory professional advice, shook hands with my
  patient and let myself out.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VI&mdash;THE SHADOWS DEEPEN</h3>

  <p>The coming events, whose premonitory shadows had been falling upon me
  unnoted since I came to Rochester, were daily drawing nearer. Perhaps it may
  have been that the deepening shadows began dimly to make themselves felt;
  that some indistinct sense of instability and insecurity had begun to steal
  into my consciousness. It may have been so. But, nevertheless, looking back,
  I can see that when the catastrophe burst upon me it found me all
  unsuspicious and unprepared.</p>

  <p>Nearly a fortnight had passed since my meeting with my two friends in the
  Cathedral, and I was looking forward with some eagerness to their impending
  visit. During that fortnight little seemed to have happened, though the
  trivial daily occurrences were beginning to acquire a cumulative significance
  not entirely unperceived by me. My promise to Mrs. Frood had been carried out
  very thoroughly: for at least every alternate evening had found me seated by
  the little table with the red-shaded lamp, making the best pretence I could
  of being there in a professional capacity.</p>

  <p>It was unquestionably indiscreet. The instant liking that I had taken to
  this woman should have warned me that here was one of those unaccountable
  "affinities" that are charged with such immense potentialities of blessing or
  disaster. The first impression should have made it clear to me that I could
  not safely spend much time in her society. But unfortunately the very
  circumstance that should have warned me to keep away was the magnet that drew
  me to her side.</p>

  <p>However, there was one consoling fact: if the indiscretion was mine, so by
  me alone were the consequences supported. Our relations were of the most
  unexceptionable kind; indeed, she was not the sort of woman with whom any man
  would have taken a liberty. As to my feelings towards her, I could not
  pretend to deceive myself, but similarly, I had no delusions as to her
  feelings towards me. She welcomed my visits with that frank simplicity that
  is delightful to a friend and hopeless to a lover. It was plain to me that
  the bare possibility of anything beyond straightforward, honest friendship
  never entered her head. But this very innocence and purity, while at once a
  rebuke and a reassurance, but riveted my fetters the more firmly.</p>

  <p>Such as our friendship was (and disregarding the secret reservation on my
  side), it grew apace; indeed, it sprang into existence at our first meeting.
  There was between us that ease and absence of reserve that distinguishes the
  intercourse of those who like and understand one another. I never had any
  fear of unwittingly giving offence. In our long talks and discussions, we had
  no need of choosing our words or phrases or of making allowances for possible
  prejudices. We could say plainly what we meant with the perfect assurance
  that it would be neither misunderstood nor resented. In short, if my feelings
  towards her could only have been kept at the same level as hers towards me,
  our friendship would have been perfect.</p>

  <p>In the course of these long and pleasant gossiping visits, I observed my
  patient somewhat closely, and, quite apart from the personal affinity, I
  became more and more favourably impressed. She was a clever woman, quick and
  alert in mind, and evidently well informed. She seemed to be kindly, and was
  certainly amiable and even-tempered, though not in the least weak or
  deficient in character. Probably, in happier circumstances, she would have
  been more gay and vivacious, for, though she was habitually rather grave and
  even sombre, there were occasional flashes of wit that suggested a naturally
  lively temperament.</p>

  <p>As to her appearance&mdash;to repeat in more detail what I have already
  said&mdash;she was a rather large woman, very erect and somewhat stately in
  bearing; distinctly good-looking (though of this I was not, perhaps, a very
  good judge). Her features were regular, but not in any way striking. Her
  expression was, as I have said, a little sombre and severe, the mouth firmly
  set and slightly depressed at the corners, the eyebrows black, straight, and
  unusually well-marked and nearly meeting above the nose. She had an abundance
  of black, or nearly black, hair, parted low on the forehead and drawn back
  loosely, covering the ears and temples, and she wore a largish coil nearly on
  the top of the head; a formal, matronly style that accentuated the gravity of
  her expression.</p>

  <p>Such was Angelina Frood as I looked on her in those never-to-be-forgotten
  evenings; as she rises before the eyes of memory as I write, and as she will
  remain in my recollection so long as I live.</p>

  <p>In this fortnight one really arresting incident had occurred. It was just
  a week after my meeting with Dr. Thorndyke, when, returning from a walk along
  the London Road as far as Gad's Hill, I stopped on Rochester Bridge to watch
  a barge which had just passed under, and was rehoisting her lowered mast. As
  I was leaning on the parapet, a man brushed past me, and I turned my head
  idly to look at him. Then, in an instant, I started up; for though the man's
  back was towards me, there was something unmistakably familiar in the gaunt
  figure, the seedy clothes, the great cloth cap, the shock of mouse-coloured
  hair, and the thick oaken stick that he swung in his hand. But I was not
  going to leave myself in any doubt on the subject. Cautiously I began to
  retrace my steps, keeping him in view but avoiding overtaking him, until he
  reached the western end of the bridge, when he halted and looked back. Then
  any possible doubt was set at rest. The man was Nicholas Frood. I don't know
  whether he saw me; he made no sign of recognition; and when he turned and
  walked on, I continued to follow, determined to make sure of his
  destination.</p>

  <p>As I had hoped and expected, he took the road to the right, leading to the
  river bank and the station. Still following him, I noted that he walked at a
  fairly brisk pace and seemed to have recovered completely from his
  debility&mdash;if that debility had not been entirely counterfeit. Opposite
  the pier he turned into the station approach, and when from the corner I had
  watched him enter the station, I gave up the pursuit, assuming that he was
  returning to London.</p>

  <p>But how long had he been in Rochester? What had he been doing, and what
  success had he had in his search? These were the questions that I asked
  myself as I walked back over the bridge. Probably he had come down for the
  day; and since he was returning, it was reasonable to infer that he had had
  no luck. As I entered the town and glanced up at the great clock that hangs
  out across the street from the Corn Exchange, like a sort of horological
  warming-pan, I saw that it was close upon eight. It was a good deal after my
  usual time for calling on Mrs. Frood, but the circumstances were exceptional
  and I felt that it was necessary to ascertain whether anything untoward had
  occurred. I was still debating what I should do when, as I came opposite the
  house, I saw Mrs. Gillow coming out of the door. Immediately I crossed the
  road and accosted her.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen Mrs. Frood this evening, Mrs. Gillow?" I asked, after
  passing the usual compliments.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," was the reply. "I left her only a few minutes ago working at
  one of the drawings that she does for Mr. Japp. She seems better this
  evening&mdash;brighter and more cheerful. I think your visits have done her
  good, sir. It is a lonely life for a young woman&mdash;having no one to talk
  to all through the long evenings. I'm always glad to hear your knock, and so,
  I think, is she."</p>

  <p>"I'm pleased to hear you say so, Mrs. Gillow," said I. "However, as it is
  rather late, and she has something to occupy her, I don't think I will call
  this evening."</p>

  <p>With this I took my leave and went on my way in better spirits. Evidently
  all was well so far. Nevertheless, the reappearance of this man was an
  uncomfortable incident. It was clear that he had not given up the pursuit,
  and, seeing that Rochester was only some thirty miles from London, it would
  be quite easy for him to make periodical descents on the place to continue
  the search. There was no denying that Mrs. Frood's position was extremely
  insecure, and I could think of no plan for making it less so, excepting that
  of leaving Rochester, for a time at least, a solution which ought to have
  commended itself to me, but did not.</p>

  <p>Perhaps it was this fact that decided me not to say anything about the
  incident. The obvious thing was to have told her and put her on her guard.
  But I persuaded myself that it would only make her anxious to no purpose;
  that she could not prevent him from coming nor could she take any further
  measures for concealment. And then there was the possibility that he might
  never come again.</p>

  <p>So far as I know, he never did. During the rest of the week I perambulated
  the town hour after hour, looking into the shops, scanning the faces of the
  wayfarers in the streets and even visiting the stations at the times when the
  London trains were due; but never a glimpse did I catch of that ill-omened
  figure.</p>

  <p>And all the time, the shadows were deepening, and that which cast them was
  drawing nearer.</p>

  <p>It was nearly a week after my meeting with Nicholas Frood that an event
  befell at which I looked askance at the time and which was, as it turned out,
  the opening scene of a new act. It was on the Saturday. I am able to fix the
  date by an incident, trivial enough in itself, but important by reason of its
  forming thus a definite point of departure. My visitors were due on the
  following Monday, and it had occurred to me that I had better lay in a little
  stock of wine; and as Mr. Japp was an old resident who knew everybody in the
  town, I decided to consult him as to the choice of a wine merchant.</p>

  <p>It was a little past mid-day when I arrived at the office, and as I
  entered I observed that some kind of conference was in progress. A man, whom
  I recognized as the foreman of the gang who were working on the old wall, was
  standing sheepishly with his knuckles resting on the table; Bundy had swung
  round on his stool and was glaring owlishly through his great spectacles,
  while Mr. Japp was sitting bolt upright, his forehead in a state of extreme
  corrugation and his eyes fixed severely on the foreman.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Bundy, "you left it in the gate?"</p>

  <p>"I expect Evans did," replied the foreman. "You see, I had to call in at
  the office, so I gave the key to Evans and told him to go on with the other
  men and let them in. When I got there the gate was open and the men were at
  work, and I forgot all about the key until it was time to come away and lock
  up. Then I asked Evans for it, and he said he'd left it in the gate. But when
  I went to look for it it wasn't there. Someone must have took it out."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't seem very likely," said Bundy. "However, I suppose it will turn
  up. It had one of our wooden labels tied to it. Shall I give him the
  duplicate to lock up the place?"</p>

  <p>"You must, I suppose," said Japp; "but it must be brought straight back
  and given to me. You understand, Smith? Bring it back at once, and deliver it
  to me or to Mr. Bundy. And look here, Smith. I shall offer ten shillings
  reward for that key; and if it is brought back and I have to pay the reward
  you will have to make it up among you. You understand that?"</p>

  <p>Smith indicated grumpily that he understood; and when Bundy had handed him
  the duplicate key, he took his departure in dudgeon.</p>

  <p>When he had gone I stated my business, and Bundy pricked up his ears.</p>

  <p>"Wine, hey?" said he, removing his spectacles and assuming his eyeglass.
  "Tucker will be the man for him, won't he, Japp? Very superior wine merchant
  is Tucker. Old and crusted; round and soft; rare and curious. I'd better pop
  round with him and introduce him, hadn't I? You'll want to taste a few
  samples, I presume, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not giving a wholesale order," said I, smiling at his enthusiasm. "A
  dozen or so of claret and one or two bottles of port is all I want."</p>

  <p>"Still," said Bundy, "you want to know what the stuff's like. Not going to
  buy a pig in a poke. You'll have to taste it, of course. I'll help you. Two
  heads are better than one. Come on. You said Tucker, didn't you, Japp?"</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," said Japp, wrinkling his face up into an
  appreciative smile, "I didn't say anything. But Tucker will do; only he won't
  let you taste anything until you have bought it."</p>

  <p>"Won't he!" said Bundy. "We shall see. Come along, Doctor."</p>

  <p>He dragged me out of the office and down the steps, and we set forth
  towards the bridge; but we had not walked more than a couple of hundred yards
  when he suddenly shot up a narrow alley and beckoned to me mysteriously. I
  followed him up the alley, and as he halted I asked:</p>

  <p>"What have you come here for?"</p>

  <p>"I want you," he replied impressively, "to take a look at this wall."</p>

  <p>I scrutinized the wall with minute attention but failed to discover any
  noteworthy peculiarities in it.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, at length, "I don't see anything unusual about this
  wall."</p>

  <p>"Neither do I," he replied, looking furtively down the alley.</p>

  <p>"Then, what the deuce&mdash;" I began.</p>

  <p>"It's all right," said he. "She's gone. That damsel in the pink hat. I
  just popped up here to let her pass. The fact is," he explained, as he
  emerged cautiously into the High Street, glancing up and down like an Indian
  on the war-path, "these women are the plague of my life; always trying to
  hook me for teas or bazaars or garden fetes or some sort of confounded
  foolishness; and that pink-hatted lady is a regular sleuth-hound."</p>

  <p>We walked quickly along the narrow pavement, Bundy looking about him
  warily, until we reached the wine-merchant's premises, into which my
  companion dived like a harlequin and forthwith proceeded to introduce me and
  my requirements. Mr. Tucker was a small, elderly man; old and crusted and as
  dry as his own Amontillado; but he was not proof against Bundy's
  blandishments. Before I had had time to utter a protest, I found myself in a
  dark cavern at the rear of the shop, watching Mr. Tucker fill a couple of
  glasses from a mouldy-looking cask.</p>

  <p>"Ha!" said Bundy, sipping the wine with a judicial air. "H'm. Yes. Not so
  bad. Slightly corked, perhaps."</p>

  <p>"Corked!" exclaimed Tucker, staring at Bundy in amazement. "How can it be
  corked when it is just out of the cask?"</p>

  <p>"Well, bunged, then," Bundy corrected.</p>

  <p>"I never heard of wine being bunged," said Tucker. "There's no such
  thing."</p>

  <p>"Isn't there? Well, then, it can't be. Must be my fancy. What do you think
  of it, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"It seems quite a sound claret," said I, inwardly wishing my volatile
  friend at the devil, for I felt compelled, by way of soothing the wine
  merchant's wounded feelings, to order twice the quantity that I had intended.
  We had just completed the transaction, and were crossing the outer shop when
  the doorway became occluded by two female figures, and Bundy uttered a
  half-suppressed groan. I drew aside to make way for the newcomers&mdash;two
  ladies whom polite persons would have described as middle-aged, on the
  assumption that they contemplated a somewhat extreme degree of
  longevity&mdash;and I was aware that Bundy was endeavouring to take cover
  behind me. But it was of no use. One of them espied him instantly and
  announced her discovery with a little squeak of ecstasy.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Mr. Bundy. I do declare! Now, where <i>have</i> you been all
  this long time? It's ages and ages and ages since you came to see us, isn't
  it, Martha? Let me see, now, when was it?" She fixed a reflective eye on her
  companion, while Bundy smiled a sickly smile and glanced wistfully at the
  open door.</p>

  <p>"I know," she exclaimed, triumphantly. "It was when we had the
  feeble-minded children to tea, and Mr. Blote showed them the gold fish
  trick&mdash;at least he tried to, but the glass bowl stuck in the bag under
  his coat-tails and wouldn't come out; and when he tried to pull it out it
  broke&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I think you are mistaken, Marian," the other lady interrupted. "It wasn't
  the feeble-minded tea. It was after that, when we helped the Jewbury-Browns
  to get up that rumble sale&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Jumble sale, you mean, dear," her companion corrected.</p>

  <p>"I mean rummage sale," the lady called Martha insisted, severely. "If you
  will try to recall the circumstances, you will remember that the jumble sale
  took place after&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not after," the other lady corrected. "It was before&mdash;several days
  before, I should say, speaking from a somewhat imperfect memory. If you will
  try to recollect, Martha, dear&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I recollect quite distinctly," the lady called Martha interposed, a
  little haughtily. "There was the feeble-minded tea&mdash;that was on a
  Tuesday&mdash;or was it a Thursday&mdash;no, it was a Tuesday, or at
  least&mdash;well, at any rate, it was some days before the
  jum&mdash;rum&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," the other lady dissented emphatically. At this point,
  catching the eye of the lady called Marian, I crept by slow degrees out on
  the threshold and turned an expectant eye on Bundy. The rather broad hint
  took immediate effect, for the lady said to her companion: "I am afraid,
  Martha, dear, you are detaining Mr. Bundy and his friend. <i>Good-bye,</i>
  Mr. Bundy. Shall we see you next Friday evening? We are giving a little
  entertainment to the barge-boys. We are inviting them to come and bring their
  mouth-organs and get up a little informal concert. <i>Do</i> come if you can.
  We shall be <i>so</i> delighted. <i>Good-bye</i>."</p>

  <p>Bundy shook hands effusively with the two ladies and darted out after me,
  seizing my arm and hurrying me along the pavement.</p>

  <p>"Bit of luck for me, Doctor, having you with me. If I had been alone and
  unprotected I shouldn't have escaped for half-an-hour; and I should have been
  definitely booked for the barge-boys' pandemonium. Hallo! What's Japp up to?
  Oh, I see. He's sticking up the notice about that key. I ought to have done
  that. Japp writes a shocking fist. I must see if it is possible to make it
  out."</p>

  <p>As we approached the office I glanced at the sheet of paper which Mr. Japp
  had just affixed to the window, and was able to read the rather crabbed
  heading, "Ten Shillings Reward." The rest of the inscription being of no
  interest to me, I wished Bundy adieu and went on my way, leaving him engaged
  in a critical inspection of the notice. Happening to look back a few moments
  later, I saw him still gazing earnestly at the paper, all unconscious of a
  lady in a pink hat who was tripping lightly across the road and bearing down
  on him with an alluring smile.</p>

  <p>Threading my way among the foot-passengers who filled the narrow
  pavements, I let my thoughts ramble idly from subject to subject; from the
  expected visit of my two friends on the following Monday to the alarming
  character of the local feminine population. But always they tended to come
  back to my patient, Mrs. Frood. I had seen her on the preceding night and had
  been very ill-satisfied with her appearance. She had been paler than
  usual&mdash;more heavy-eyed and weary-looking; and she had impressed me as
  being decidedly low-spirited. It seemed as though the continual uncertainty
  and unrest, the abiding threat of some intolerable action on the part of her
  worthless husband, were becoming more than she could endure; and unwillingly
  I was beginning to recognize that it was my duty, both as her doctor and as
  her friend, to advise her to move, at least for a time, to some locality
  where she would be free from the constant fear of molestation.</p>

  <p>The question was: when should I broach the subject?</p>

  <p>And that involved the further question: when should I make my next visit?
  Inclination suggested the present evening, but discretion hinted that I ought
  to allow a decent interval between my calls; and thus oscillating between the
  two, I found myself in a state of indecision which lasted for the rest of the
  day. Eventually discretion conquered, and I decided to postpone the visit and
  the proposal until the following evening.</p>

  <p>The decision was reached about the time I should have been setting forth
  to make the visit, and no sooner had that time definitely passed than I began
  to regret my resolution and to be possessed by a causeless anxiety.
  Restlessly I wandered from room to room; taking up books, opening them and
  putting them down again, and generally displaying the typical symptoms of an
  acute attack of fidgets until Mrs. Dunk proceeded with a determined air to
  lay the supper, and drew my attention to it with an emphasis which it was
  impossible to disregard.</p>

  <p>I had just drawn the cork of a bottle of Mr. Tucker's claret when the
  door-bell rang, an event without precedent in my experience. Silently I
  replaced the newly-extracted cork and listened. Apparently it was a patient,
  for I heard the street door close and footsteps proceed to the
  consulting-room. A minute later Mrs. Dunk opened the dining-room door and
  announced:</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Frood to see you, sir."</p>

  <p>With a slight thrill of anxiety at this unexpected visit, I strode out,
  and, crossing the hall, entered the somewhat dingy and ill-lighted
  consulting-room. Mrs. Frood was seated in the patients' chair, but she rose
  as I entered and held out her hand; and as I grasped it, I noticed how tall
  she looked in her outdoor clothes. But I also noticed that she was looking
  even more pale and haggard than when I had seen her last.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing the matter, I hope?" said I.</p>

  <p>"No," she answered; "nothing much more than usual; but I have come to
  present a petition."</p>

  <p>I looked at her inquiringly, and she continued:</p>

  <p>"I have been sleeping very badly, as you know. Last night I had
  practically no sleep at all, and very little the night before; and I feel
  that I really can't face the prospect of another sleepless night. Would you
  think it very immoral if I were to ask you for something that would give me a
  few hours' rest?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," I answered, though with no great enthusiasm, for I am
  disposed to take hypnotics somewhat seriously. "You can't go on without
  sleep. I will give you one or two tablets to take before you go to bed. They
  will secure you a decent night's rest, and then I hope you will feel a little
  brighter."</p>

  <p>"I hope so," she said, with a weary sigh.</p>

  <p>I looked at her critically. She was, as I have said, pale and haggard; but
  there seemed to be something more; a certain wildness in her eyes and a
  suggestion or fear.</p>

  <p>"You are not looking yourself at all to-night," I said. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she answered. "The same old thing, I suppose. But I do
  feel rather miserable. I seem to have come to the end of my' endurance. I
  look into the future and it all seems dark. I am afraid of it. In fact, I
  seem to have&mdash;you'll think me very silly, I know&mdash;but I have a sort
  of presentiment of evil. Of course, it's all nonsense. But that is what I
  feel."</p>

  <p>"Is there any reason for this presentiment?" I asked uneasily; for my
  thoughts flew at once to that ill-omened figure that I had seen on the
  bridge. "Has anything happened to occasion these forebodings?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing in particular," she replied. But she spoke without looking at
  me&mdash;an unusual thing for her to do&mdash;and I found in her answer
  something ambiguous and rather evasive. Could it be that she had seen her
  husband on that day when I had followed him? Or had he been in the town
  again-this very day, perhaps? Or was there something yet more significant,
  something even more menacing? That this deep depression of spirits, these
  forebodings, were not without some exciting cause I felt the strongest
  suspicion. But whatever the cause might be, she was evidently unwilling to
  speak about it.</p>

  <p>While I was speculating thus, I found myself looking her over with a
  minute attention of which I was not conscious at the time; noting little
  trivial details of her appearance and belongings with an odd exactness of
  observation. My eyes travelled over the little hand-bag, stamped with her
  initials, that rested on her lap; her dainty, high-heeled shoes with their
  little oval buckles of darkened bronze; the small brooch at her throat with
  the large opal in the middle and the surrounding circle of little pearls, and
  even noted that one of the pearls was missing and that the vacant place
  corresponded to the figure three on a clock-dial. And then they would come
  back to her face; to the set mouth and the downcast eyes with their
  expression of gloomy reverie.</p>

  <p>I was profoundly uneasy and was on the point of opening the subject of her
  leaving the town. Then I decided that I would see her on the morrow and would
  go into the matter then. Accordingly I went into the surgery and put a few
  tablets of sulphonal into a little box, and having stuck one of Dr.
  Partridge's labels on it, wrote the directions and then wrapped it up and
  sealed it.</p>

  <p>"There," I said, giving it to her, "take a couple of those tablets and go
  to bed early, and let me find you looking a little more cheerful
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>She took the packet and dropped it into her bag. "It is very good of you,"
  she said warmly. "I know you don't like doing it, and that makes it the more
  kind. But I will do as you tell me. I have just to go in to Chatham, but when
  I get back I will go to bed quite early."</p>

  <p>I walked with her to the door, and when I had opened it she stopped and
  held out her hand. "Good night," she said, "and thank you so very much. I
  expect you will find me a great deal better to-morrow." She pressed my hand
  slightly, made me a little bow, smiled, and, turning away, passed out; and I
  now noticed that the haze which had hung over the town all the afternoon had
  thickened into a definite fog. I stepped out on to the threshold and watched
  her as she walked quickly down the street, following the erect, dignified
  figure wistfully with my eyes as it grew more and more shadowy and
  unsubstantial until it faded into the fog and vanished. Then I went in to my
  solitary supper, with an unwonted sense of loneliness; and throughout the
  long evening I turned over again and again our unsatisfying talk and wondered
  afresh whether that presentiment of evil was but the product of insomnia and
  mental fatigue, or whether behind it was some sinister reality.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VII&mdash;MRS. GILLOW SOUNDS THE ALARM</h3>

  <p>Nine o'clock on the following morning found me still seated at the
  breakfast table, with the debris of the meal before me and the Sunday paper
  propped up against the coffee-pot. It was a pleasant, sunny morning at the
  end of April. The birds were twittering joyously in the trees at the back of
  the house, a premature bluebottle perambulated the window-pane, after an
  unsuccessful attempt to crawl under the dish-cover, and somewhere in the town
  an optimistic bell-ringer was endeavouring to lure unwary loiterers out of
  the sunshine into the shadow of the sanctuary.</p>

  <p>It was all very agreeable and soothing. The birds were delightful in the
  exuberance of their spirits; even the bluebottle was a harbinger of summer;
  and the solo of the bellringer, softened by distance, impinged gently on the
  appreciative ear, awakening a grateful sense of immunity. The sunshine and
  the placid sounds were favourable to reflection, which the Sunday paper was
  powerless to disturb. As my eye roamed inattentively down the inconsequent
  column of printers' errors, my mind flitted, beelike, from topic to topic;
  from my vague professional prospects to the visitors whom I was expecting on
  the morrow and from them to the rather disturbing incident of the previous
  evening. But here my thoughts had a tendency to stick; and I was just
  considering whether the proprieties admitted of my making a morning call on
  Mrs. Frood, with a view to clearing up the obscurity, when the street-door
  bell rang. The unusual sound at such an unlikely time caused me to sit up and
  listen with just a tinge of uneasy expectancy. A few moments later Mrs. Dunk
  opened the door, and having stated concisely and impassively, "Mrs. Gillow,"
  retired, leaving the door ajar. I started up in something approaching alarm,
  and hurried across to the consulting-room, where I found Mrs. Gillow standing
  by the chair with anxiety writ large on her melancholy face.</p>

  <p>"There's nothing amiss, I hope, Mrs. Gillow?" said I.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say there is, sir," she replied. "I hope you'll excuse me
  for disturbing you on a Sunday morning, but I thought, as you were her
  doctor, and a friend, too, and I may say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what has happened?" I interrupted impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Why, sir, the fact is that she went out last night and she hasn't come
  back."</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure she hasn't come back?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly. I saw her just before she went out, and she said she was
  coming to see you, to get something to make her sleep, and then she was just
  going into Chatham, and that she would be back soon, so that she could go to
  bed early. I sat up quite late listening for her, and before I went to bed I
  went down and knocked at both her doors, and as I didn't get any answer, I
  looked into both rooms. But she wasn't in either, and her little supper was
  untouched on the table in the sitting-room. I couldn't sleep a wink all night
  for worrying about her, and the first thing this morning I went down, and,
  when I found the door unbolted and unchained, I went into her rooms again.
  But there was no sign of her. Her supper was still there, untouched, and her
  bed had not been slept in."</p>

  <p>"Did you look downstairs?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. She usually kept the door of the basement stairs locked, I think,
  but it was unlocked this morning, so I went down and searched all over the
  basement; but she wasn't there."</p>

  <p>"It is very extraordinary, Mrs. Gillow," I said, "and rather alarming. I
  certainly understood that she was going home as soon as she had been to
  Chatham. By the way, do you know what she was going to Chatham for?"</p>

  <p>"I don't, sir. She might have been going there to do some shopping, but it
  was rather late, though it was Saturday night."</p>

  <p>"You don't know, I suppose, whether she took any things with
  her&mdash;though she couldn't have taken much, as she had only a little
  handbag with her when she came here."</p>

  <p>"She hasn't taken any of her toilet things," said Mrs. Gillow, "because I
  looked over her dressing-table, and all her brushes and things were there;
  and, as you say, she couldn't have taken much in that little bag. What do you
  think we had better do, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I think," said I, "that, in the first place, I will go and see Mr. Japp.
  He is a relative and knows more about her than we do, and, of course, it will
  be for him to take any measures that may seem necessary. At any rate, I will
  see him and hear what he says."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think we ought to let the police know?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mrs. Gillow," I said, "we mustn't be too hasty. Mrs. Frood had
  reasons for avoiding publicity. Perhaps we had better not busy ourselves too
  much until we are quite certain that she has gone. She may possibly return in
  the course of the day."</p>

  <p>"I am sure I hope so," she replied despondently. "But I am very much
  afraid she won't. I have a presentiment that something dreadful has happened
  to her."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that?" I asked. "Have you any reason for thinking so?"</p>

  <p>"I have no actual reason," she answered, "but I have always thought that
  there was something behind her fear of meeting her husband."</p>

  <p>Having no desire to discuss speculative opinions, I made no direct reply
  to this. Apparently Mrs. Gillow had no more to tell, and as I was anxious to
  see Mr. Japp and hear if he could throw any light on the mystery, I adjourned
  the discussion on which she would have embarked and piloted her persuasively
  towards the door. "I shall see you again later, Mrs. Gillow," I said, "and
  will let you know if I hear anything. Meanwhile, I think you had better not
  speak of the matter to anybody."</p>

  <p>As soon as she was gone I made rapid preparations to go forth on my
  errand, and a couple of minutes later was speeding down the street at a pace
  dictated rather by the agitation of my mind than by any urgency of purpose.
  Although, by an effort of will, I had preserved a quiet, matter-of-fact
  demeanour while I was talking to Mrs. Gillow, her alarming news had fallen on
  me like a thunderbolt; and even now, as I strode forward swiftly, my thoughts
  seemed numbed by the suddenness of the catastrophe. That something terrible
  had happened I had little more doubt than had Mrs. Gillow, and a good deal
  more reason for my fears; for that last interview with the missing woman,
  looked back upon by the light of her unaccountable disappearance, now
  appeared full of dreadful suggestions. I had thought that she looked
  frightened, and she admitted to a presentiment of evil. Of whom or of what
  was she afraid? And what did she mean by a presentiment? Reasonable people do
  not have gratuitous presentiments; and I recalled her evasive reply when I
  asked if she had any reasons for her foreboding of evil. Now, there was
  little doubt that she had; that the shadow of some impending danger had
  fallen on her and that she knew it.</p>

  <p>As I approached the premises of Japp and Bundy, I was assailed by a sudden
  doubt as to whether Mr. Japp lived there; and this doubt increased when I had
  executed two loud knocks at the door without eliciting any response. I was
  just raising my hand to make a third attack when I became aware of Bundy's
  head rising above the curtain of the office window; and even in my agitation
  I could not but notice its extremely dishevelled state. His
  hair&mdash;usually "smarmed" back neatly from the forehead and brushed over
  the crown of his head&mdash;now hung down untidily over his face like a bunch
  of rat's tails, and the unusualness of his appearance was increased by the
  fact that he wore neither spectacles nor the indispensable eyeglass. The
  apparition, however, was visible but for a moment, for even as I glanced at
  him he made a sign to me to wait and forthwith vanished.</p>

  <p>There followed an interval of about a minute, at the end of which the door
  opened and I entered, discovering Bundy behind it in a dressing-gown and
  pyjamas, but with his hair neatly brushed and his eye-glass duly
  adjusted.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to keep you waiting, Doc." said he. "Fact is, your knock woke me.
  The early bird catches the worm in his pyjamas."</p>

  <p>"I apologize for disturbing your slumbers," said I, "but I wanted to see
  Japp. Isn't he in?"</p>

  <p>"Japp doesn't live here," said Bundy, motioning to me to follow him
  upstairs. "He used to, but the house began to fill up with the business stuff
  and we had to make a drawing office and a store-room, so he moved off to a
  house on Boley Hill, and now I live here like Robinson Crusoe."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you do your own cooking and housework?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, no," he replied. "I get most of my meals at Japp's place. Prepare
  my own breakfast sometimes&mdash;I'm going to now: and I make tea for us
  both. Got a little gas-stove in the kitchen. And a charlady comes in every
  day to wash up and do my rooms. If you are not in a hurry, I'll walk round
  with you to Japp's house."</p>

  <p>"I am in rather a hurry," said I; "at least&mdash;well, I don't know why I
  should be; but I am rather upset. The fact is, a very alarming thing has
  happened. I have just heard of it from Mrs. Gillow. It seems that Mrs. Frood
  went out last evening and has not come back."</p>

  <p>Bundy whistled. "She's done a bolt," said he. "I wonder why. Do you think
  she can have run up against hubby in the town?"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe for a moment that she has gone away voluntarily," said I.
  "She came to see me last night to get a sedative because she couldn't sleep,
  and she said that she was going home as soon as she had been to Chatham, and
  that she was going to take her medicine and go to bed early."</p>

  <p>"That might have been a blind," suggested Bundy; "or she might have run up
  against her husband in Chatham."</p>

  <p>I shook my head impatiently. "That is all nonsense, Bundy. A woman doesn't
  walk off into space in that fashion. Something has happened to her, I feel
  sure. I only hope it isn't something horrible; one doesn't dare to think of
  the possibilities that the circumstances suggest."</p>

  <p>"No," said Bundy, "and it's better not to. Great mistake to let your
  imagination run away with you. Don't you worry, Doc. She'll probably turn up
  all right, or send Japp a line to say where she has gone to."</p>

  <p>"Devil take it, Bundy!" I exclaimed irritably, "you are talking as if she
  were just a cat that had strayed away. If you don't care a hang what becomes
  of her, I do. I am extremely alarmed about her. How soon will you be
  ready?"</p>

  <p>"I'll run and get on my things at once," he replied, with a sudden change
  of manner. "You must excuse me, old chap. I didn't realize that you were so
  upset. I'll be with you in a few minutes and then we will start. Japp will be
  able to give me some breakfast."</p>

  <p>He bustled off&mdash;to the next room, as I gathered from the
  sound&mdash;and left me to work off my impatience by gazing out of the window
  and pacing restlessly up and down the barely-furnished sitting-room. But,
  impatient as I was, the rapidity with which he made his toilet surprised me,
  for in less than ten minutes he reappeared, spick and span, complete with
  hat, gloves, and stick, and announced that he was ready.</p>

  <p>"I am not usually such a sluggard," he said, as we walked quickly along
  the street, "but yesterday evening I got a novel. I ought not to read novels.
  When I do, I am apt to make a single mouthful of it; and that is what I did
  last night. I started the book at nine and finished it at two this morning;
  and the result is that I am as sleepy as an owl even now."</p>

  <p>In illustration of this statement he gave a prodigious yawn and then
  turned up the steep little thoroughfare, where be presently halted at the
  door of a small, old-fashioned house and rang the bell. The door was opened
  by a middle-aged servant, from whom he learned that Mr. Japp was at home, and
  to whom Bundy communicated his needs in the matter of breakfast. We found Mr.
  Japp seated by the dining-room window, studying a newspaper with the aid of a
  large pipe, and Bundy proceeded to introduce me and the occasion of my visit
  in a few crisp sentences.</p>

  <p>Mr. Japp's reception of the news was very different from his partner's.
  Starting up from his chair and taking his pipe from his mouth, he gazed at me
  for some seconds in silent dismay.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said at length, "there is no mistake. It is really certain
  that she did not come back last night?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid there is no doubt of the fact," I replied, and I gave him the
  details with which Mrs. Gillow had furnished me.</p>

  <p>"Dear! dear!" he exclaimed. "I don't like the look of this at all. What
  the deuce can have happened to her?"</p>

  <p>Here Bundy repeated the suggestion that he had made to me, but Japp shook
  his head. "She wouldn't have gone off without letting me or the doctor know.
  Why should she? We are friends, and she knew she could trust us. Besides, the
  thing isn't possible. A middle-class woman can't set out like a tramp without
  any luggage or common necessaries. There's only one possibility," he added
  after a pause. "She might have seen Nicholas prowling about and gone straight
  to the station and taken a train to London. One of her woman friends would
  have been able to put her up for the night."</p>

  <p>"Or," suggested Bundy, "she might even have gone up to town with Nick
  himself if he met her and threatened to make a scene."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Japp doubtfully, "that is, I suppose, possible. But it isn't
  in the least likely. For that matter, nothing is likely. It is a most
  mysterious affair, and very disturbing, very disturbing, indeed."</p>

  <p>"The question is," said I, "what is to be done? Do you think we ought to
  communicate with the police?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no," he replied; "not immediately. If we don't hear anything, say
  to-morrow, I suppose we shall have to. But we had better not be precipitate.
  If we go to the police, we shall have to tell them everything. Let us give
  her time to communicate, in case she has had to make a sudden
  retirement&mdash;a clear forty-eight hours, as it is a week-end. But we had
  better make some cautious inquiries meanwhile. I suggest that we walk up to
  the hospital. They know me pretty well there, and I could just informally
  ascertain whether any accidents had been admitted, without giving any
  detailed reasons for the inquiry. Are you coming with us, Bundy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Bundy, who, having been provided with a light breakfast,
  was despatching it with lightning speed; "I shall be ready by the time you
  have got your boots on."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later we set forth together, and made our way straight to
  the hospital. Bundy and I waited outside while Japp went in to make his
  inquiries; and, as we walked up and down, my imagination busied itself in
  picturing the hideous possibilities suggested by a somewhat extensive
  experience of the casualty department of a general hospital. Presently Japp
  emerged, shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"She is not there," said he. "There were no casualties of any kind
  admitted last night or since."</p>

  <p>"Is there no other hospital?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"None but the military hospital," he replied. "All the casualties from the
  district would be brought here. So we seem to be at the end of our resources,
  short of inquiring at the police-station; and even if that were advisable, it
  would be useless, for if&mdash;anything had happened&mdash;anything, I mean,
  that we hope has not happened&mdash;Mrs. Gillow would have heard. She will be
  sure to have had something about her by which she could have been
  identified."</p>

  <p>"She had," said I. "The little box that I gave her had her name and my
  address on it."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Japp. "I don't see that we can do anything more. We can only
  wait until to-morrow evening or Tuesday morning, and if we don't get any news
  of her by then, notify the police."</p>

  <p>Unwillingly I had to admit that this was so; and when I had walked back
  with the partners to Mr. Japp's house, I left them and proceeded to report to
  Mrs. Gillow and to ascertain whether, in the meantime, she had received any
  tidings of her missing tenant.</p>

  <p>It was with more of fear than hope that I plied the familiar knocker, but
  the eager, expectant face that greeted me when the door opened, while it
  relieved the one, banished the other. She had heard nothing, and when I had
  communicated my own unsatisfactory report she groaned and shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure," I said, after an interval of silence, "that she did
  not return from Chatham?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see how she could have done," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"You see, it was like this: I was going to see my sister at Frindsbury,
  and as I came down to the hall, Mrs. Frood opened her door and spoke to me.
  She had her hat on then, and she told me she was coming to you, and then
  going on to Chatham, but that she would be back pretty soon, and was going to
  bed early. I went out, leaving her at her room door, and took the tram to
  Frindsbury, and I got back home about a quarter to ten. Her sitting-room door
  was open, and I could see that she hadn't gone to bed, because her lamp was
  alight and her supper tray was on the table and hadn't been touched. I
  knocked at her bedroom door, but there was no answer, so I went upstairs and
  sat up listening for her, and before I went to bed I went down again, as I
  told you."</p>

  <p>"What time was it when you went out?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"About a quarter past eight. I told her I was going to Frindsbury, and
  that I should be home before ten, and I asked her not to bolt the door if she
  came in before me."</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, "she must have gone out directly after you, because it was
  only a little after half-past eight when she called on me; and presumably she
  went straight on to Chatham. If we only knew what she was going there for we
  might be able to trace her. Did she know anybody at Chatham?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I know," replied Mrs. Gillow, "she didn't know anybody here but
  you and Mr. Japp. I can't imagine what she could have been going to Chatham
  for."</p>

  <p>After a little further talk, I took my leave and walked homeward in a very
  wretched frame of mind. Tormented as I was with a gnawing anxiety, inaction
  was intolerable. Yet there was nothing to be done; nothing but to wait in the
  feeble hope that the morning might bring some message of relief, and with a
  heavy foreboding that the tidings, when they came, would be evil tidings. But
  I found it impossible to wait passively at home. At intervals during the day
  I went forth to wander up and down the streets; and some impulse which I
  hardly dared to recognize directed my steps again and again to the wharves
  and foreshore that lie by the bend of the river between Rochester and
  Chatham.</p>

  <p>On the following morning I betook myself as early as I decently could to
  the office of Japp and Bundy. No letter had arrived by the early post, nor,
  when I repeated my visit later, was there any news, either by post or
  telegram, or from Mrs. Gillow. I paid a furtive visit to the police-station
  and glanced nervously over the bills on the notice-board, and I made another
  perambulation of the waterside districts, which occupied me until it was time
  for me to repair to the station to meet the train by which my friends were
  expected to arrive, and did, in fact, arrive.</p>

  <p>As we walked from the station to my house Jervis looked at me critically
  from time to time. After one of these inspections he remarked:</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether it is my fancy, Strangeways, but it seems to me that
  the cares of medical practice are affecting your spirits. You look
  worried."</p>

  <p>"I am worried," I replied. "There has been a very disturbing development
  of that case that I was telling you about."</p>

  <p>"The doper, you mean?"</p>

  <p>"His wife. She has disappeared. She went out on Saturday night and has not
  been seen since."</p>

  <p>"That sounds rather ominous," said Jervis. "I presume the
  circumstances&mdash;if you know them&mdash;could be communicated without any
  breach of confidence."</p>

  <p>"They will have to be made fully public if she doesn't turn up by this
  evening," I replied, "and I am only too glad of the chance to talk the matter
  over with you," and forthwith I proceeded to give a circumstantial account of
  the events connected with the disappearance, not omitting any detail that
  seemed to have the slightest bearing. And I now felt justified in relating my
  experience when I was acting for Dr. Pumphrey. The narrative was interrupted
  by our arrival at my house, but when we had taken our places at the table it
  was continued and listened to with intense interest by my two friends.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Jervis, when I had finished, "it has an ugly look, especially
  when one considers it in connexion with that affair in London. But there is
  something to be said for your friend Bundy's suggestion. Don't you think so,
  Thorndyke?"</p>

  <p>"Something, perhaps," Thorndyke agreed, "but not much; and if no letter
  arrives to-night or to-morrow morning, I should say it is excluded. This lady
  seems to have had complete confidence in Strangeways and in Mr. Japp. She
  could depend on their secrecy if she had to move suddenly to a fresh
  locality; and she seems to have been a responsible person who would not
  unnecessarily expose them to anxiety about her safety. Moreover, she would
  know that, if she kept them in the dark, they must unavoidably put the police
  on her track, which would be the last thing that she would wish."</p>

  <p>"Can you make any suggestion as to what has probably happened?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"It is not of much use to speculate," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"If we exclude a voluntary disappearance, an accident or sudden illness,
  as we apparently can, there seems to remain only the possibility of crime.
  But to the theory of crime&mdash;of murder, to put it bluntly&mdash;there is
  a manifest objection. So far as the circumstances are known to us, a murder,
  if it had occurred, would have been an impromptu murder, committed in a more
  or less public place. But the first indication of a murder of that kind is
  usually&mdash;the discovery of the body. Here, however, thirty-six hours have
  elapsed, and no body has come to light. On the other hand, we have to bear in
  mind that there is a large, tidal river skirting the town. Into that river
  the missing lady might have fallen accidentally, or have been thrown, dead or
  alive. But it is not very profitable to speculate. We can neither form any
  opinion nor take any action until we have some further facts."</p>

  <p>I must confess that, as I listened to Thorndyke thus calmly comparing the
  horrible possibilities, I experienced a dreadful sinking of the heart, but
  yet I realized that this passionless consideration of the essential evidence
  was more to the point, and promised more result than any amount of unskilful
  groping under the urge of emotion and personal feeling. And, realizing this,
  I formed the bold resolution of enlisting Thorndyke's aid in a regular,
  professional capacity, and began to cast about for the means of introducing
  the rather delicate subject. But while I was reflecting, the opportunity, was
  gone, at least for the present. Lunch had virtually come to an end, for Mrs.
  Dunk had silently and with iron visage just placed the port and the coffee on
  the table and retired, when, Jervis, who had observed her with evident
  interest, inquired: "Does that old Sphinx do the cooking, Strangeways?"</p>

  <p>"She does everything," I answered. "I have suggested that she should get
  some help, but she just growled and ignored the suggestion."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Jervis, "she doesn't give you much excuse for growling. She
  has turned out a lunch that would have done credit to Delmonico's. Are you
  coming to the inquest with us? We shall have to be starting in a few
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"I may as well," said I. "Then I can bring you back to tea. And I want to
  make a proposal, which we can discuss as we go along. It is with regard to
  the case of Mrs. Frood."</p>

  <p>As my two friends looked at me inquiringly but made no remark, I poured
  out the coffee and continued: "You see, Mrs. Frood was my patient, and, in a
  way, my friend; in fact, with the exception of Japp, I was the only friend
  she had in the place. Consequently I take it as my duty to ascertain what has
  happened to her, and, if she has come to any harm, to see that the wrongdoers
  are brought to account. Of course, I am not competent to investigate the case
  myself, but I am in the position to bear any costs that the investigation
  would entail."</p>

  <p>"Lucky man," said Jervis. "And what is the proposal?"</p>

  <p>"I was wondering," I replied, a little nervously, "whether I could prevail
  on you to undertake the case."</p>

  <p>Jervis glanced at his senior, and the latter replied:</p>

  <p>"It is just a little premature to speak of a 'case.' The missing lady may
  return or communicate with her friends. If she does not, the inquiry will
  fall into the hands of the police; and there is no reason to suppose that
  they will not be fully competent to deal with it. They have more means and
  facilities than we have. But if the inquiry should become necessary, and the
  police should be unsuccessful, Jervis and I would be prepared to render you
  any assistance that we could."</p>

  <p>"On professional terms," I stipulated.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled. "The financial aspects of the case," said he, "can be
  considered when they arise. Now, I think, it is time for us to start."</p>

  <p>As we walked down to the building where the inquest was to be held, we
  pursued the topic, and Thorndyke pointed out my position in the case.</p>

  <p>"You notice, Strangeways," said he, "that you are the principal witness.
  You are the last person who saw Mrs. Frood before her disappearance, you
  heard her state her intended movements, you knew her circumstances, you saw
  and examined her husband, and you alone can give an exact description of her
  as she was at the time when she disappeared. I would suggest that, during the
  inquest, which will not interest you, you might usefully try to reconstitute
  that last interview and make full notes in writing of all that occurred with
  a very careful and detailed description of the person, clothing, and
  belongings of the missing lady. The police will want this information, and so
  shall I, if I am to give any consideration to the case."</p>

  <p>On this suggestion I proceeded to act as soon as we had taken our places
  at the foot of the long table occupied by the coroner and the jury, detaching
  myself as well as I could from the matter of the inquest; and by the time
  that the deliberations were at an end and the verdict agreed upon, I had
  drafted out a complete set of notes and made two copies, one for the police
  and one for Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>As soon as we were outside the court I presented the latter copy, which
  Thorndyke read through.</p>

  <p>"This is <i>admirable</i>, Strangeways," said he, as he placed it in his
  note-case. "I must compliment you upon your powers of observation. The
  description of the missing lady is remarkably clear and exhaustive. And now I
  would suggest that you call in at Mr. Japp's office on our way back, and
  ascertain whether any letter has been received. If there has been no
  communication we shall have to regard the appearances as suspicious, and
  calling for investigation."</p>

  <p>Secretly gratified at the interest which Thorndyke seemed to be developing
  in the mystery, I conducted my friends up the High-street until we reached
  the office, which I entered, leaving my colleagues outside. Mr. Japp looked
  up from a letter which he was writing, and Bundy, who had been peeping over
  the curtain, revolved on his stool and faced me.</p>

  <p>"Any news?" I asked.</p>

  <p>Japp shook his head gloomily. "Not a sign," said he.</p>

  <p>"I shall wait until the first post is in to-morrow morning, and then, if
  there are no tidings of her, I shall go across to the police station. Perhaps
  you had better come with me, as you are able to give the particulars that
  they will want."</p>

  <p>"Very well," I said, "I will look in at half-past nine"; and with this I
  was turning away when Bundy inquired: "Are those two toffs outside friends of
  yours?" and, on my replying in the affirmative, he continued: "They seem to
  be taking a deuce of an interest in Japp's proclamation. You might tell them
  that if they happen to have found that key, the money is quite safe. I will
  see that Japp pays up."</p>

  <p>I promised to deliver the message, and, as Bundy craned up to make a
  further inspection of my colleagues, I departed to join the latter.</p>

  <p>"There is no news up to the present," I said, "but Japp proposes to wait
  until to-morrow morning for a last chance before applying to the police."</p>

  <p>"Was that Japp who was inspecting us through that preposterous pair of
  barnacles?" Jervis asked.</p>

  <p>"No," I answered. "That was Bundy. He suspects you of having found that
  key and of holding on to it until you are sure of the reward."</p>

  <p>"What key is it?" asked Jervis. "The key of the strong-room? They seem to
  be in a rare twitter about it."</p>

  <p>"No; it is just a gate-key belonging to a piece of waste land where they
  are doing some repairs to the old city wall. And, by the way, thereby hangs a
  tale; a horrible and tragic tale of a convivial bargee, which ought to have a
  special interest for a pair of medical jurists"&mdash;and here I related to
  them the gruesome story that was told to Bundy and me by the old
  mortar-mixer.</p>

  <p>They both chuckled appreciatively at the denouement, and Jervis
  remarked:</p>

  <p>"It would seem that the late Bill was a rather inflammable gentleman. The
  yarn recalls the tragic end of Mr. Krook in 'Bleak House,' only that Krook
  went one better than Bill, for he managed to combust himself in an hour or
  two without any lime at all."</p>

  <p>The story and the comment brought us to my house, which we had no sooner
  entered than Mrs. Dunk, who seemed to have been lying in wait for us, made
  her appearance with the tea; and while we were disposing of this refreshment
  Thorndyke reverted to the case of my missing patient.</p>

  <p>"As I am to keep an eye on this ease," said he, "I shall want to be kept
  in touch with it. Of course, the actual investigation&mdash;if there has to
  be one&mdash;will need to be conducted on the spot, which is not possible to
  me. What I suggest is that you write out a detailed account of everything
  that is known to you in connexion with it. Don't select your facts. Put down
  everything in any way connected with the case and say all you know about the
  person concerned&mdash;Mrs. Frood herself and everybody who was acquainted
  with her. Send this statement to me and keep a copy. Then, if any new fact
  becomes known, let me have it and make a note of it for your own information.
  You are on the spot and I shall look to you for the data; and if I want any
  of them amplified or confirmed I shall communicate with you.</p>

  <p>"There is one other matter. Do not confide to anyone that you have
  consulted me or that I am interested in the case; neither to Mr. Japp, to the
  police, nor to anybody else whatsoever; and I advise you to keep your own
  interest in the mystery to yourself as far as possible."</p>

  <p>"What is the need of this secrecy?" I asked, in some surprise.</p>

  <p>"The point is," replied Thorndyke, "that when you are investigating a
  crime you are playing against the criminal. But if the criminal is unknown to
  you, you are playing against an unseen adversary. If you are visible to him
  he can watch your moves and reply to them. Obviously your policy is to keep
  out of sight and make your moves unseen. And remember that as long as you do
  not know who the criminal is, you don't know who he is not. Anyone may be the
  criminal, or may be his unconscious agent or coadjutor. If you make
  confidences they may be innocently passed on to the guilty parties. So keep
  your own counsel rigorously. If there has been a crime, that crime has local
  connexions and probably a local origin. The solution of the mystery will
  probably be discovered here. And if you intend to take a hand in the solution
  let it be a lone hand; and keep me informed of everything that you do or
  observe; and for my part, I will give you all the help I can."</p>

  <p>By the time we had finished our tea and our discussion the hour of my
  friends' departure was drawing nigh. I walked with them to the station, and
  when I bade them farewell I received a warm invitation to visit them at their
  chambers in the Temple; an invitation of which I determined to avail myself
  on the first favourable opportunity.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;SERGEANT COBBLEDICK TAKES A HAND</h3>

  <p>Punctually at half-past nine on the following morning I presented myself
  at the office, and, if I had indulged in any hopes of favourable
  news&mdash;which I had not&mdash;they would have been dispelled by a glance
  at Mr. Japp's troubled face.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you have heard nothing?" I said, when we had exchanged brief
  greetings.</p>

  <p>He shook his head gloomily as he opened the cupboard and took out his
  hat.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, "and I am afraid we never shall."</p>

  <p>He sighed heavily, and, putting on his hat, walked slowly to the door. "It
  is a dreadful affair," he continued, as we went out together. "How she would
  have hated the idea of it, poor girl! All the horrid publicity, the posters,
  the sensational newspaper paragraphs, the descriptions of her person and
  belongings. And then, at the end of it all, God knows what horror may come to
  light. It won't bear thinking of."</p>

  <p>He trudged along at my side with bent head and eyes cast down, and for the
  remainder of the short journey neither of us spoke. On reaching the
  police-station we made our way into a small, quiet office, the only tenant of
  which was a benevolent-looking, bald-headed sergeant, who was seated at a
  high desk, and, who presented that peculiar, decapitated aspect that
  appertains to a police officer minus his helmet. As we entered the sergeant
  laid down his pen and turned to us with a benign smile.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr. Japp," said he. "What can I have the pleasure of doing
  for you?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to say, Sergeant," replied Japp, "that I have come here on
  very unpleasant business," and he proceeded to give the officer a concise
  summary of the facts, to which our friend listened with close attention. When
  it was finished, the sergeant produced a sheet of blue foolscap, and, having
  folded a wide margin on it, dipped his pen in the ink and began his
  examination.</p>

  <p>"I'd better take the doctor's statement first," said he. "The lady's name
  is Angelina Frood, married, living apart from husband&mdash;I shall want his
  address presently&mdash;last seen alive by&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"John Strangeways, M.D.," said I, "of Maidstone-road, Rochester."</p>

  <p>The sergeant wrote this down, and continued: "Last seen at about 8.30 P.M.
  on Saturday, 26th April, proceeding towards Chatham, on unknown business. Can
  you give me a description of her?"</p>

  <p>I described her person, assisted by Japp, and the sergeant, having
  committed the particulars to writing, read them out:</p>

  <p>"'Age 28, height 5 ft. 7 in., complexion medium, hazel eyes, abundant dark
  brown hair, strongly marked black eyebrows, nearly meeting over nose.'"</p>

  <p>"No special marks that you know of?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Now, doctor, can you tell us how she was dressed?"</p>

  <p>"She was wearing a snuff-brown coat and skirt," I replied, "and a straw
  hat of the same colour with a broad, dull green band. The hat was fixed on by
  two hat-pins with silver heads shaped like poppy-capsules. The coat had six
  buttons, smallish, bronze buttons&mdash;about half an inch in
  diameter&mdash;with a Tudor rose embossed on each. Brown suede gloves with
  fasteners&mdash;no buttons&mdash;brown silk stockings, and brown suede shoes
  with small, oval bronze buckles. She had a narrow silk scarf, dull green,
  with three purple bands at each end&mdash;one broad band and two
  narrow&mdash;and knotted fringe at the ends. She wore a small circular brooch
  with a largish opal in the centre and a border of small pearls, of which one
  was missing. The missing pearl was in the position of the figure three on a
  clock dial. She carried a small morocco hand-bag with the initials A. F.
  stamped on it, which contained a little cardboard box, in which were six
  white tablets; the box was labelled with one of Dr. Partridge's labels, on
  which her name was written, and it was wrapped in white paper and sealed with
  sealing-wax. That is all I can say for certain. But she always wore a
  wedding-ring, and occasionally an African Zodiac ring; but sometimes she
  carried this ring in a small purse with metal jaws and a ball fastening. I
  believe she always carried the purse."</p>

  <p>As I gave this description, the sergeant wrote furiously, glancing at me
  from time to time with an expression of surprise, while Japp sat and stared
  at me open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>"Well, doctor," said the sergeant, when he had taken down my statement and
  read it out, "if I find myself ailing I'm going to pop along and consult you.
  I reckon there isn't much that escapes your notice. With regard to that
  African ring now, I daresay you cart tell us what it is like."</p>

  <p>I was, of course, able to describe it in detail, including the initials A.
  C. inside, and even to give a rough sketch of some of the signs embossed on
  it, upon which the sergeant chuckled admiringly and wagged his head as he
  wrote down the description and pinned the sketch on the margin of his paper.
  The rest of my statement dealt with the last interview and the incidents
  connected with Nicholas Frood's visits to Rochester, all of which the
  sergeant listened to with deep interest and committed to writing.</p>

  <p>Finally, I recounted the sinister incident&mdash;now more sinister than
  ever&mdash;of the murderous assault in the house near Regent's Park, whereat
  the sergeant looked uncommonly serious and took down the statement
  verbatim.</p>

  <p>"Did you know about this, Mr. Japp?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I knew that something unpleasant had happened," was the reply, "but I
  didn't know that it was as bad as this."</p>

  <p>"Well," said the sergeant, "it gives the present affair rather an ugly
  look. We shall have to make some inquiries about that gentleman."</p>

  <p>Having squeezed me dry, he turned his attention to Japp, from whom he
  extracted a variety of information, including the address of the banker who
  paid the allowance to Nicholas Frood, and that of a lady who had formerly
  been a theatrical colleague of Mrs. Frood's, and with whom Mr. Japp believed
  the latter had kept up a correspondence.</p>

  <p>"You haven't a photograph of the missing lady, I suppose?" said the
  sergeant.</p>

  <p>With evident reluctance Japp drew from his pocket an envelope and produced
  from it a cabinet photograph, which he looked at sadly for a few moments and
  then handed to me.</p>

  <p>"I brought this photograph with me," he said, "as I knew you would want
  it, but I rather hope that you won't want to publish it."</p>

  <p>"Now, why do you hope that?" the sergeant asked in a soothing and
  persuasive tone. "You want this lady found&mdash;or, at any rate, traced. But
  what better means can you suggest than publishing her portrait?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are right," said Japp; "but it is a horrible thing to think
  of the poor girl's face looking out from posters and newspaper pages."</p>

  <p>"It is," the sergeant agreed. "But, you see, if she is alive it is her own
  doing, and if she is dead it won't affect her."</p>

  <p>While they were talking I had been looking earnestly at the beloved face,
  which I now felt I should never look upon again. It was an excellent
  likeness, showing her just as I had known her, excepting that it was free
  from the cloud of trouble that had saddened her expression in these latter
  days. As the sergeant held out his hand for it, I turned it over and read the
  photographer's name and address and the register number, and, having made a
  mental note of them, I surrendered it with a sigh.</p>

  <p>Our business was now practically concluded. When we had each read over the
  statements and added our respective signatures, the sergeant attested them
  and, having added the date, placed the documents in his desk and rose.</p>

  <p>"I am much obliged to you, gentlemen," said he as he escorted us to the
  door. "If I hear anything that will interest you I will let you know, and if
  I should want any further information I shall take the liberty of calling on
  you."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Japp, as we turned to walk back, "the fat's in the fire now.
  I mean to say," he added quickly, "that we've fairly committed ourselves. I
  hope we haven't been too precipitate. We should catch it if she came back and
  found that we had raised the hue and cry and set the whole town agog."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid there is no hope of that," said I. "At any rate, we had no
  choice or discretion in the matter. A suspected crime is the business of the
  police."</p>

  <p>Mr. Japp agreed that this was so; and having by this time arrived at the
  office, we separated, he to enter his premises and I to betake myself to
  Chatham with no very, defined purpose, but lured thither by a vague
  attraction.</p>

  <p>As I walked along the High-street, making occasional digressions into
  narrow alleys to explore wharves and water-side premises, I turned over the
  statements that had been given to the police and wondered what they conveyed
  to our friend, the sergeant, with his presumably extensive experience of
  obscure crime. To me they seemed to furnish no means whatever of starting an
  investigation, excepting by inquiring as to the movements of Nicholas Frood,
  by communicating with Angelina's late colleague or by publishing the
  photograph. And here I halted to write down in my notebook before I should
  forget them the name and address of that lady&mdash;Miss Cumbers&mdash;and of
  the photographers, together with the number of the photograph; for I had
  decided to obtain a copy of the latter for myself, and it now occurred to me
  that I had better get one also for Thorndyke. And this latter reflection
  reminded me that I had to prepare my prcis of the facts for him, and that I
  should do well to get this done at once while the matter of the two
  statements was fresh in my mind. Accordingly, as I paced the deck of the Sun
  Pier, looking up and down the busy river, with its endless procession of
  barges, bawleys, tugs, and cargo boats, striving ineffectually to banish the
  dreadful thought that, perchance, somewhere, at this very moment there was
  floating on its turbid waters the corpse of my dear, lost friend: I tried to
  recall and write down the substance of Japp's statement, as I had heard it
  made and had afterwards read it. At length, finding the neighbourhood of the
  river too disturbing, I left the pier and took my way homewards, calling in
  at a stationer's on the way to provide myself with a packet of sermon paper
  on which to write out my summary.</p>

  <p>When Thorndyke had given me my instructions, they had appeared to me a
  little pedantic. The full narrative which he asked for of all the events,
  without selection as to relevancy, and the account of what I knew of all the
  persons concerned in the case, seemed an excessive formality. But when I came
  to write the case out the excellence of his method became apparent in two
  respects. In the first place, the ordered narrative put the events in their
  proper sequence and exhibited their connexions; and in the second, the
  endeavour to state all that I knew, particularly of the persons, showed me
  how very little that was. Of the persons in any way concerned in the case
  there were but five: Angelina herself, her husband, Mrs. Gillow, Mr. Japp,
  and Bundy. Of the first two I knew no more than what I had observed myself
  and what Angelina had told me; of the last three I knew practically nothing.
  Not that this appeared to me of the slightest importance, but I had my
  instructions, and in compliance with them I determined to make such cautious
  inquiries as would enable me to give Thorndyke at least a few particulars of
  them. And this during the next few days I did; and I may as well set down
  here the scanty and rather trivial information that my inquiries elicited,
  and which I duly sent on to Thorndyke in a supplementary report.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gillow was the wife of a mariner who was the second mate of a sailing
  ship that plied to Australia, who had now been away about four months and was
  expected home shortly. She was a native of the locality and had known Mr.
  Japp for several years. She occupied the part of the house above the ground
  floor and kept no servant or dependent, living quite alone when her husband
  was at sea. She had no children. Her acquaintance with Angelina began when
  the latter became the tenant of the ground floor and basement; it was but a
  slight acquaintance, and she knew nothing of Angelina's antecedents or
  affairs excepting that she had left her husband.</p>

  <p>Mr. Japp was a native of Rochester and had lived in the town all his life,
  having taken over his business establishment from his late partner, a Mr.
  Borden. He was a bachelor and was related to Angelina by marriage, his
  brother&mdash;now deceased&mdash;having married Angelina's aunt.</p>

  <p>As to Bundy, he was hardly connected with the case at all, since he had
  seen Angelina only once or twice and had scarcely exchanged a dozen words
  with her. Moreover, he had but recently come to Rochester&mdash;about six
  weeks ago, I gathered&mdash;having answered an advertisement of Japp's for an
  assistant with a view to partnership; and the actual deed had not yet been
  executed, though the two partners were evidently quite well satisfied with
  one another.</p>

  <p>That was all the information that I had to give Thorndyke; and with the
  exception of the London incident it amounted to nothing. Nevertheless, it was
  as well to have established the fact that if anyone were concerned in
  Angelina's disappearance, that person would have to be sought elsewhere than
  in Rochester.</p>

  <p>Having sent off my summary and read over again and again the copy which I
  had kept, I began to realize the justice of Thorndyke's observation that the
  inquiry was essentially a matter for the police, who had both the experience
  and the necessary facilities; for whenever I tried to think of some plan for
  tracing my lost friend, I was brought up against the facts that I had,
  nothing whatever to go on and no idea how to make a start. As to Thorndyke,
  he had no data but those that I had given him, and I realized clearly that
  these were utterly insufficient to form the basis of any investigation; and I
  found myself looking expectantly to the police to produce some new facts that
  might throw at least a glimmer of light on this dreadful and baffling
  mystery.</p>

  <p>I had not very long to wait. On the Friday after our call on the sergeant,
  I was sitting after lunch in my dining-room with a book in my hand, while my
  thoughts strayed back to those memorable evenings of pleasant converse with
  the sweet friend who, I felt, had gone from me for ever, when the door bell
  rang, and Mrs. Dunk presently announced:</p>

  <p>"Sergeant Cobbledick."</p>

  <p>"Show him in here, Mrs. Dunk," said I, laying aside my book, and rising to
  receive my visitor; who proved to be, as I had expected, the officer who had
  taken our statements. He entered with his helmet in his hand, and greeted me
  with a smile of concentrated benevolence.</p>

  <p>"Sit down, Sergeant," said I, offering him an easy chair. "I hope you have
  some news for us."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, beaming on me. "I am glad to say we are getting on as
  well as we can expect. We have made quite a nice little start."</p>

  <p>He spoke as if he had something particularly gratifying to communicate,
  and, having carefully placed his helmet on the table, he drew from his pocket
  a small paper packet, which he opened with great deliberation, extracting
  from it a small object, which he held out in the palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>"There, Doctor," said he, complacently; "what do you say to that?"</p>

  <p>I looked at the object, and my heart seemed to stand still. It was
  Angelina's brooch! I stared at it in speechless dismay for some moments. At
  length I asked, huskily:</p>

  <p>"Where did you get it?"</p>

  <p>"I found it," said the sergeant, gazing fondly at the little trinket,
  "where I hardly hoped to find it&mdash;in a pawnbroker's shop in
  Chatham."</p>

  <p>"Did you discover who pawned it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"In a sense, yes," the sergeant replied with a bland smile.</p>

  <p>"How do you mean&mdash;in a sense?" I inquired.</p>

  <p>"I mean that his name was John Smith&mdash;only, of course, it wasn't; and
  that his address was 26, Swoffer's-alley, Chatham&mdash;only he didn't live
  there, because there is no such number. You see, Doctor, John Smith is the
  name of nearly every man who gives a false description of himself; and I went
  straight off to Swoffer's-alley&mdash;it was close by&mdash;and found that
  there wasn't any number 26."</p>

  <p>"Then you really don't know who pawned it?"</p>

  <p>"We won't exactly say that," he replied. "I got a fair description of the
  man from the pawnbroker's wife, who made out the ticket and says she could
  swear to the man if she saw him. He was a seafaring man, dressed in sailor's
  clothes&mdash;a peaked cap and pea-jacket&mdash;a shortish fellow, rather
  sunburnt, with a small, stubby, dark moustache and dark hair, and a mole or
  wart on the left side of his nose, near the tip. She asked him where he had
  got the brooch, and he said it had belonged to his old woman. I should say he
  probably picked it up."</p>

  <p>"Why do you think so?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, if he had-er-got it in any other way, he would hardly have popped
  it in Chatham forty-eight hours after the&mdash;after it was lost, with the
  chance that the pawnbrokers had already been notified-he pawned it on Monday
  night."</p>

  <p>"Then," said I, "if he picked it up, he isn't of much importance; and in
  any case you don't know who he is."</p>

  <p>"Oh, but he is of a good deal of importance," said the sergeant. "I've no
  doubt he picked it up, but that is only a guess. He may have got it the other
  way. But at any rate, he had it in his possession and he will have to give an
  account of how he obtained it. The importance of it is this: taken with the
  disappearance, the finding of this brooch raises a strong suspicion that a
  crime has been committed, and if we could find out where it was picked up, we
  should have a clue to the place where the affair took place. I want that man
  very badly, and I'm going to have a good try to get him."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see how," said I. "You haven't much to go on."</p>

  <p>"I've got his nose to go on," replied the sergeant.</p>

  <p>"But there must be plenty of other men with moles on their noses."</p>

  <p>"That's their look-out," he retorted. "If I come across a man who answers
  the description, I shall hang on to him until Mrs. Pawnbroker has had a look
  at him. Of course, if she says he's not the man, he'll be released."</p>

  <p>"But she won't," said I. "If he has a mole on his nose, she will be
  perfectly certain that he is the man."</p>

  <p>The sergeant smiled benignly. "There's something in that," he admitted.
  "Ladies are a bit cock-sure when it comes to identification. But you can
  generally check 'em by other evidence. And if this chap picked the brooch up,
  he would be pretty certain to tell us all about it when he heard where it
  came from. Still, we haven't got him yet."</p>

  <p>For a while we sat, without speaking, each pursuing his own thoughts. To
  me, this dreadful discovery, though it did but materialize the vague fears
  that had been surging through my mind, had fallen like a thunderbolt. For,
  behind those fears, I now realized that there had lurked a hope that the
  mystery might presently be resolved by the return of the lost one. Now that
  hope had suddenly become extinct. I knew that she had gone out of my life for
  ever. She was dead. This poor little waif that had drifted back into our
  hands brought the unmistakable message of her death, with horrible
  suggestions of hideous and sordid tragedy. I shuddered at the thought; and in
  that moment, from the grief and horror that possessed my soul, there was born
  a passion of hatred for the wretch who had done this thing and a craving for
  revenge.</p>

  <p>"There's another queer thing that has come to light," the sergeant resumed
  at length. "There may be nothing in it, but it's a little queer. About the
  husband, Nicholas Frood."</p>

  <p>"What about him?" I asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Why, he seems to have disappeared, too. Of course, you understand,
  Doctor, that what I'm telling you is confidential. We are not talking about
  this affair outside, and we aren't telling the Press much, at present."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," said I. "You can trust me to keep my own counsel, and yours,
  too."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I can. Well, about this man, Frood. It seems that last Friday he
  went away from his lodgings for a couple of days; but he hasn't come back,
  and nobody knows what has become of him. He was supposed to be going to
  Brighton, where he has some relatives from whom he gets a little assistance
  occasionally, but they have seen or heard nothing of him. Quaint, isn't it?
  You said you saw him here on the Monday."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and I haven't seen him since, though I have kept a look-out for him.
  But he may have been here, all the same. It looks decidedly suspicious."</p>

  <p>"It is queer," the sergeant agreed, "but we've no evidence that he has
  been in this neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"Have you made any other inquiries?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"We looked up that lady, Miss Cumbers, but we got nothing out of her. She
  had had a letter from Mrs. Frood on the 24th-yesterday week&mdash;quite an
  ordinary letter, giving no hint of any intention to go away from Rochester.
  So there you are. The mystery seems to be concerned entirely with this
  neighbourhood, and I expect we shall have to solve it on the spot."</p>

  <p>This last observation impressed me strongly. The sergeant's view of the
  case was the same as Thorndyke's, and expressed in almost the same words.</p>

  <p>"Have you any theory as to what has actually happened?" I asked.</p>

  <p>The sergeant smiled in his benignant fashion. "It isn't much use inventing
  theories," said he. "We've got to get the facts before we can do anything.
  Still, looking at the case as we find it, there are two or three things that
  hit us in the face. There is a strong suspicion of murder, there is no trace
  of the body, and there is a big tidal river close at hand. On Saturday night
  it was high water at half-past eleven, so there wouldn't have been much of
  the shore uncovered at, say, half-past nine, and there would have been plenty
  of water at any of the piers or causeways."</p>

  <p>"Then you think it probable that she was murdered and her body flung into
  the river?"</p>

  <p>"It is the likeliest thing, so far as we can judge. There is the river,
  and there is no sign of the body on shore. But, as I say, it is no use
  guessing. We've got people watching the river from Allington Lock to
  Sheerness, and that's all we can do in that line. The body is pretty certain
  to turn up, sooner or later. Of course, until it does, there is no real
  criminal case; and even when we've got the body, we may not be much nearer
  getting the murderer. Excepting the man Frood, there is no one who seems to
  have had any motive for making away with her; and if it was just a casual
  robbery with murder it is unlikely that we shall ever spot the man at
  all."</p>

  <p>Having given expression to this rather pessimistic view, the sergeant
  rose, and, picking up his helmet, took his departure, after promising to let
  me know of any further developments.</p>

  <p>As soon as he was gone, I wrote down the substance of what he had said,
  and then embodied it in a report for Thorndyke. While I was thus occupied,
  the afternoon post was delivered, and included a packet from the London
  photographer, to whom I had written, enclosing two copies of the photograph
  of Angelina that Mr. Japp had handed to the sergeant. Of these, I enclosed
  one copy in my communication to Thorndyke, on the bare chance that it might
  be of some assistance to him, and, having closed up the large envelope and
  stamped it, I went forth to drop it into the post-box.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IX&mdash;JETSAM</h3>

  <p>That portion of Chatham High-street which lies adjacent to the River
  Medway presents a feature that is characteristic of old riverside towns in
  the multitude of communications between the street and the shore. Some of
  these are undisguised entrances to wharves, some are courts or small
  thoroughfares lined with houses and leading to landing-stages, while others
  are mere passages or flights of steps, opening obscurely and inconspicuously
  on the street by narrow apertures, unnoticed by the ordinary wayfarer and
  suggesting the burrows of some kind of human water-rat.</p>

  <p>In the days that followed the sergeant's visit to me I made the
  acquaintance of all of them. Now I would wander down the cobbled cartway that
  led to a wharf, there to cast a searching eye over the muddy fore-shore or
  scan the turbid water at high tide as it eddied between the barges and around
  the piles. Or I would dive into the mouths of the burrows, creeping down
  slimy steps and pursuing the tortuous passages through a world of uncleanness
  until I came out upon the shore, where the fresh smell of seaweed mingled
  with odours indescribable. I began to be an object of curiosity&mdash;and
  perhaps of some suspicion&mdash;to the denizens of the little, ruinous,
  timber houses that lined these alleys, and of frank interest to the children
  who played around the rubbish heaps or dabbled in the grey mud. But never did
  my roving eye light upon that which it sought with such dreadful
  expectation.</p>

  <p>One afternoon, about a week after the sergeant's visit, when I was
  returning home from one of these explorations, I observed a man on my
  doorstep as I approached the house. His appearance instantly aroused my
  attention, for he was dressed in the amphibious style adopted by waterside
  dwellers, and he held something in his hand at which he looked from time to
  time. Before I reached the door it had opened and admitted him, and when I
  arrived I found him in the hall nervously explaining his business to Mrs.
  Dunk.</p>

  <p>"Here is the doctor," said the latter; "you'd better tell him about
  it."</p>

  <p>The man turned to me and held out an amazingly dirty fist. "I've got
  something here, sir," said he, "what belongs to you, I think." Here he
  unclosed his hand and exhibited a little cardboard box bearing one of Dr.
  Partridge's labels. It was smeared with mud and grime, but I recognized it
  instantly; indeed, when I took it with trembling fingers from his palm and
  looked at it closely, the name, "Mrs. Frood," was still decipherable under
  the smears of dirt.</p>

  <p>"Where did you find this?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I picked it up on the strand," he replied, "about halfway betwixt the Sun
  Pier and the end of Ship Alley, and just below spring tide high-water mark.
  Is it any good?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered; "it is very important. I will get you to walk along
  with me to the police station."</p>

  <p>"What for?" he demanded suspiciously. "I don't want no police stations. If
  it's any good, give us what you think it's worth, and have done with it."</p>

  <p>I gave him half-a-crown to allay his suspicions, and then said: "You had
  better come with me to the station. I expect the police will want you to show
  them exactly where you found this box and help them to search the place; and
  I will see that you are paid for your trouble."</p>

  <p>"But look 'ere, mister," he objected; "what's the police got to do with
  this 'ere box?"</p>

  <p>I explained the position to him briefly, and then, suddenly, his face lit
  up. "I know," he said excitedly. "I seen the bills stuck up on the dead-'ouse
  door. And d'you mean to say as this 'ere box was 'ers? Cos if it was it's
  worth more 'n 'arf-a-crown."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is," said I. "We will hear what the sergeant thinks," and with
  this I opened the door and went out, and my new acquaintance now followed
  with the greatest alacrity, taking the opportunity, as we walked along, to
  remind me of my promise and to offer tentative suggestions as to the scale of
  remuneration for his services.</p>

  <p>Our progress along the High-street was not unnoticed. Doubtless, we
  appeared a somewhat ill-assorted pair, for I observed a good many persons
  turn to look at us curiously, and when we passed the office, on the opposite
  side of the road, I saw Bundy's face rise above the curtain with an
  expression of undissembled curiosity.</p>

  <p>On arriving at the station, I inquired for Sergeant Cobbledick, and was
  fortunate enough to find him in his office. As I entered with my companion,
  he bestowed on the latter a quick glance of professional interest and then
  greeted me with a genial smile. It was hardly necessary for me to state my
  business, for the single quick glance of his experienced eye at my companion
  had furnished the diagnosis. I had only to produce the box and indicate the
  finder.</p>

  <p>"This looks like a lead," said he, reaching his helmet down from a peg.
  "What's your name, sonny, and where do you live?"</p>

  <p>Sonny affirmed, with apparent reluctance, that his name was Samuel Hooper
  and that his abode was situated in Foul Anchor Alley; and when these facts
  had been committed to writing by the sergeant, the latter put on his helmet
  and invited the said Hooper to "come along," evidently assuming that I was to
  form one of the party.</p>

  <p>As we approached the office this time I saw Bundy from afar off; and by
  the time we were abreast of the house he was joined by Japp, who must have
  stood upon tip-toe to bring his eyes above the curtain. Both men watched us
  with intense interest, and we had barely passed the house when Bundy's head
  suddenly disappeared, and a few moments later its owner emerged from the
  doorway and hurriedly crossed the road.</p>

  <p>"What is in the wind, Doctor?" he asked, as he came up with us. "Japp is
  in a rare twitter. Have they found the body?"</p>

  <p>"No," I answered; "only the little box that was in her hand-bag. We are
  going to have a look at the place where it was found."</p>

  <p>"To see if the bag is there, too?" said he. "It probably is, unless it has
  been picked up already. I think I'll come along with you, if you don't
  object. Then I can give Japp all the news."</p>

  <p>I did not object, nor did the sergeant&mdash;verbally; but his expression
  conveyed to me that he would willingly have dispensed with Mr. Bundy's
  society. However, he was a suave and tactful man, and he made the best of the
  unwelcome addition to the party, even going so far as to offer the box for
  Bundy's inspection.</p>

  <p>"It is pretty dirty," the latter observed, holding it delicately in his
  fingers. "Wasn't it wrapped in paper when you gave it to her, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"It was wrapped up in paper when I found it," said Hooper, "but I took off
  the paper to see what was inside, and, yer see, my 'ands wasn't very clean,
  a-grubbin' about in the mud." In conclusive confirmation of this statement,
  he exhibited them to us, and then gave them a perfunctory wipe on his
  trousers.</p>

  <p>"What struck me," said Bundy, "was that it doesn't seem to have been in
  the water."</p>

  <p>"It hadn't," said Hooper. "The outside paper was quite clean when I picked
  it up."</p>

  <p>"It looks," observed the sergeant, "as if they had turned out the bag and
  thrown away what they didn't want; and then they probably threw away the bag,
  too. It is ten chances to one that it has been picked up, but if it hasn't it
  will probably be somewhere along the high-water mark. How are the tides,
  Hooper?"</p>

  <p>"Just past the bottom of the nips," was the reply; and a few moments later
  our guide added; "It's down here," and plunged into what looked like an open
  doorway. We followed, one at a time, cautiously descending a flight of very
  filthy stone steps and stooping to avoid knocking our heads against the
  overhanging story of an ancient timber house. At the bottom we proceeded,
  still in single file, along a narrow, crooked passage between grimy walls and
  ruinous tarred fences until, after many twistings and turnings, we came to a
  flight of rough wooden steps, thickly coated with yellow mud and slimy
  sea-grass, which led down to the shore.</p>

  <p>"Now," said the sergeant, turning up the bottoms or his trousers, "show us
  exactly where you picked the box up."</p>

  <p>"It was just oppersight that there schooner," said our guide, taking his
  way along the muddy streak between the two lines of jetsam that corresponded
  to the springtide and neap-tide high-water marks; "betwixt her and the
  wharf."</p>

  <p>We followed him, picking our way daintly, and, having inspected the spot
  that he indicated, squeezed in between the schooner's bilge and the piles and
  raked over the rubbish that the tide had deposited on the shore.</p>

  <p>"Was you looking for anything in partickler?" Hooper asked.</p>

  <p>"We are looking for a small leather handbag," replied the sergeant, "or
  anything else we can find."</p>

  <p>"A 'and-bag wouldn't 'ave been 'ere long," Hooper remarked. "Somebody
  would 'ave twigged it pretty quick, unless it got hidden under something
  big." He straightened himself up and gave a searching look up and down the
  shore; and then suddenly he started off with an air of definite purpose.
  Glancing in the direction towards which he was shaping his course, I
  observed, in the corner of a stage that jutted out from the quay, a heap of
  miscellaneous rubbish surmounted by the mortal remains of a large hamper. It
  looked a likely spot and we all followed, though not at his pace, being
  somewhat more fastidious as to where we stepped. Consequently he arrived
  considerably before us, and having flung away the hamper, began eagerly to
  grub among the underlying raffle. Just as we had come within a dozen yards of
  him, anxiously making the perilous passage over a stretch of peculiarly slimy
  mud, he stood up with a howl of triumph, and we all stopped to look at him.
  His arm was raised above his head, and from his hand hung by its handle a
  little morocco bag.</p>

  <p>"There's no need to ask you to identify it, Doctor," said the sergeant, as
  he despoiled the water-rat of his prize. "It fits your description to a
  T."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, he handed it to me, drawing my attention to the initials "A.
  F." stamped on the leather. I turned it over gloomily, noting that it showed
  signs of having been in the water&mdash;though not, apparently, for any
  considerable time&mdash;and that none of its contents remained excepting a
  handkerchief tucked into an inner pocket, and returned it to him without
  remark.</p>

  <p>"Now, look here, Hooper," said he, "I want you to stay down here and keep
  an eye on this shore until I send some of our men up, and then you can stay
  and help them, if you like. And remember that anything that you find&mdash;no
  matter what it is&mdash;you keep and hand over to me or my men; and you will
  be paid the full value and a reward for finding it as well. Do you understand
  that?"</p>

  <p>"I do," replied Hooper. "That's a fair orfer, and you can depend on me to
  do the square thing. I'll stay down here until your men come."</p>

  <p>Thereupon we left him, pursuing our way along the shore and keeping an
  attentive eye on all the rubbish and litter that we passed, until we came to
  a set of rough wooden steps by the Ship Pier.</p>

  <p>"I had no authority to offer to pay that chap," said the sergeant, as we
  walked up Ship Alley, "but the superintendent has put me on to work at this
  case, and I'm not going to lose any chances for the sake of a few shillings.
  It is well to keep in with these waterside people."</p>

  <p>"Have you published a list of things that are likely to turn up?" Bundy
  asked.</p>

  <p>"We've posted up a description of the missing woman with full details of
  her dress and belongings," replied the sergeant. "But perhaps a list of the
  things that might be washed up would be useful. People are such fools. Yes,
  it's a good idea. I'll have a list printed of everything that might get loose
  and be picked up, and stick it up on the wharves and waterside premises. Then
  there will be nothing left to their imagination."</p>

  <p>At the top of Ship Alley he halted, and having thanked me warmly for my
  prompt and timely information, turned towards Chatham Town, leaving me and
  Bundy to retrace our steps westward.</p>

  <p>"That was a bit of luck," the latter remarked, "finding that bag; and he
  hardly deserved it. He ought to have had that piece of shore under
  observation from the first. But he was wise to make an acceptable offer to
  that bodysnatcher, Hooper. I expect he lives on the shore, watching for
  derelict corpses and any unconsidered trifles that the river may throw up. I
  see there is a reward of two pounds for the body."</p>

  <p>"You have seen the bills, then?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. We have got one to stick up in the office window. Rather gruesome,
  isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Horrible," I said; and for a while we walked on in silence. Presently
  Bundy exclaimed: "By Jove! I had nearly forgotten. I have a message for you.
  It is from Japp. He is taking a distinguished American archaeologist for a
  personally conducted tour round the town to show him the antiquities, and he
  thought you might like to join the party."</p>

  <p>"That is very good of him," said I. "It sounds as if it should be rather
  interesting."</p>

  <p>"It will be," said Bundy. "Japp is an enthusiast in regard to architecture
  and ancient buildings, and he is quite an authority on the antiquities of
  this town. You'd better come. The American&mdash;his name is Willard&mdash;is
  going to charter a photographer to come round with us and take records of all
  the objects of interest, and we shall be able to get copies of any
  photographs that we want. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"When does the demonstration take place?"</p>

  <p>"The day after tomorrow. We shall do the Cathedral in the morning and the
  castle and the town in the afternoon. Shall I tell Japp you will join the
  merry throng?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, please; and convey my very warm thanks for the invitation."</p>

  <p>"I will," said he, halting as we arrived at the office, "unless you would
  like to come in and convey the joyful tidings yourself."</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "I won't come in now. I will get home and change my
  boots."</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Jingo!" Bundy agreed, with a rueful glance at his own delicate
  shoes. "Mudlarking calls for a special outfit. And I clean my own shoes; but
  I'd rather do that than face Mrs. Dunk."</p>

  <p>With this he retired up the steps, and I turned homeward, deciding to
  profit by his last remark and forestall unfavourable comment by shedding my
  boots on the doormat.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER X&mdash;WHICH DEALS WITH ANCIENT MONUMENTS AND A BLUE BOAR</h3>

  <p>On arriving home, I found awaiting me a letter from Dr. Thorndyke
  suggesting&mdash;in response to a general invitation that I had given him
  some time previously&mdash;that he should come down on Saturday to spend the
  week-end with me. Of course, I adopted the suggestion with very great
  pleasure, not a little flattered at receiving so distinguished a guest; and
  now I was somewhat disposed to regret my engagement to attend Mr. Japp's
  demonstration. However, as Thorndyke was not due until lunch time, I should
  have an opportunity of modifying my arrangement, if necessary.</p>

  <p>But, as events turned out, I congratulated myself warmly on not having
  missed the morning visit to the Cathedral. It was a really remarkable
  experience; and not the least interesting part of it to me was the revelation
  of the inner personality of my friend, Mr. Japp. That usually dry and
  taciturn man of business was transfigured in the presence of the things that
  he really loved. He glowed with enthusiasm; he exhaled the very spirit of
  mediaeval romance; at every pore he exuded strange and recondite knowledge.
  Obedient to his behest, the ancient building told the vivid story of its
  venerable past, presented itself in its rude and simple beginnings; exhibited
  the transformations that had marked the passing centuries; peopled itself
  with the illustrious departed, whose heirs we were and whose resting-places
  we looked upon; and became to us a living thing whose birth and growth we
  could watch, whose vicissitudes and changing conditions we could trace until
  they brought us to its august old age. Under his guidance we looked down the
  long vista of the past, from the time when simple masons scalloped the Norman
  capitals within, while illustrious craftsmen fashioned the wonderful west
  doorway, to that last upheaval that swept away the modern shoddy and restored
  to the old fabric its modest comeliness.</p>

  <p>Architectural antiquities, however, are not the especial concern of this
  history, though they were not without a certain influence in its unfolding.
  Accordingly, I shall not follow our progress&mdash;attended by the
  indispensable photographic recording angel&mdash;through nave and aisles,
  form choir to transepts, and from tower to undercroft. At the close of a
  delightful morning I betook myself homeward, charged with new and varied
  knowledge, and with a cordial invitation to my guest to join the afternoon's
  expedition if he were archaeologically inclined.</p>

  <p>Apparently he was, for when, shortly after his arrival, I conveyed the
  invitation to him he accepted at once.</p>

  <p>"I always take the opportunity," said he, "of getting what is practically
  first-hand information. Your friend, Mr. Japp, is evidently an enthusiast; he
  has expert technical knowledge, and he has apparently filled in his detail by
  personal investigation. A man like that can tell you more in an hour than
  guide-books could tell you in a lifetime. We had better get a large-scale map
  of the town to enable us to follow the description, unless you have one."</p>

  <p>"I haven't," said I, "but we can get one on the way to the rendezvous. You
  got my report, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "I got it yesterday. That, in fact, was what determined
  me to come down. The discovery of that bag upon the shore dispels to some
  extent the ambiguity of our data. The finding of the brooch did not enlighten
  us much. It might simply have been dropped and picked up by some casual
  wayfarer. In fact, that is what the appearances suggested, for it is
  manifestly improbable that a person who had committed a crime would take the
  risk of pawning the product of robbery with violence in the very
  neighbourhood where the crime had been committed, and after an interval of
  time which would allow of the hue and cry having already been raised. Your
  sergeant is probably right in assuming that the man with the mole had nothing
  to do with the affair. But the finding of this bag is a different matter. It
  connects that disappearance with the river and it offers a strong suggestion
  of crime."</p>

  <p>"Don't you think it possible that she might have fallen into the river
  accidentally?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is possible," he admitted. "But that is where the significance of the
  brooch comes in. If she had fallen into the river from some wharf or pier,
  there does not seem to be any reason why the brooch should have become
  detached and fallen on land&mdash;as it apparently did. The finding of the
  bag where it had been thrown up by the river, and of the brooch on shore,
  suggests a struggle on land previous to the fall into the water. You don't
  happen, I suppose, to know what the bag contained?"</p>

  <p>"I don't&mdash;excepting the packet of tablets that I gave her. When the
  bag was found, it was empty; at least, it contained only the handkerchief, as
  I mentioned in my report."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said reflectively. "By the way, I must compliment you on those
  reports. They are excellent, and with regard to this one, there are two or
  three rather curious circumstances. First, as to the packet of tablets. You
  mention that it had not been unwrapped and that, when it was found, the paper
  was quite clean. Therefore it had never been in the water. Therefore it had
  been taken out of the bag&mdash;by somebody with moderately clean
  hands&mdash;before the latter was dropped into the river; and it must have
  been thrown away on the shore above highwater mark. Incidentally, since the
  disappearance occurred&mdash;presumably&mdash;on the evening of the 26th of
  April, and the packet was found on the 7th of May, it had been lying on the
  shore for a full ten days. Perhaps there is nothing very remarkable in that;
  but the point is that Mrs. Frood was carrying the bag in her hand and she
  would almost certainly have dropped it if there had been any struggle. How,
  then, did the bag come to be in the river, and how came some of its contents
  to be found on the shore clean and free from any traces of submersion?"</p>

  <p>"We can only suppose," said I, with an inward shudder&mdash;for the
  discussion of these hideous details made my very flesh creep&mdash;"that the
  murderer picked up the bag when he had thrown the body into the river, took
  out any articles of value, if there were any, and threw the rest on the
  shore."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Thorndyke, a little doubtfully, "that would seem to be what
  happened. And in that case, we should have to assume that the place where the
  packet was found was, approximately, the place where the crime was committed.
  For, as the packet was never immersed, it could not have been carried to that
  place by the tide, and one cannot think of any other agency by which it could
  have been moved. Its clean and unopened condition seems to exclude human
  agency. The question then naturally arises, Is the place where the packet was
  found, a place at, or near, which the tragedy could conceivably have
  occurred? What do you say to that?"</p>

  <p>I considered for a few moments, recalling the intricate and obscure
  approach of the shore and the absence of anything in the nature of a public
  highway.</p>

  <p>"I can only say," I replied at length, "that it seems perfectly
  inconceivable that Mrs. Frood could have been at that place, or even near it,
  unless she went there for some specific purpose&mdash;unless, for instance,
  she were lured there in some way. It is a place that is, I should say,
  unknown to any but the waterside people."</p>

  <p>"We must go there and examine the place carefully," said he, "for if it
  is, as you say, a place to which no one could imaginably have strayed by
  chance, that fact has an important evidential bearing."</p>

  <p>"Do you think it quite impossible that the package could have been carried
  to that place and dropped there?"</p>

  <p>"Not impossible, of course," he replied, "but I can think of no reasonably
  probable way in which it could have happened, supposing the murderer to have
  pocketed it, and afterwards to have thrown it away. That would be a
  considered and deliberate act; and it is almost inconceivable that he should
  not have opened the packet to see what was inside, and that he should have
  dropped it on the dry beach when the river was close at hand. Remember that
  the bag was found quite near, and that it had been in the water."</p>

  <p>"And assuming the crime to have been committed at that place, what would
  it prove?"</p>

  <p>"In the first place," he replied, "it would pretty definitely exclude the
  theory of accidental death. Then it would suggest at least a certain amount
  of premeditation, since the victim would have had, as you say, to be enticed
  to that unlikely spot. And it would suggest that the murderer was a person
  acquainted with the locality."</p>

  <p>"One of the waterside people," said I. "They are a pretty shady lot, but I
  don't see why any of them should want to murder her."</p>

  <p>"It is not impossible," said he. "She was said to be shopping in Chatham,
  and she might have had a well-filled purse and allowed it to be seen. But
  that is mere speculation. The fact is that we have no data at present. We
  know practically nothing about Mrs. Frood. We can't say if she had any secret
  enemies, or if there was anyone who might have profited by her death or have
  had any motive for making away with her."</p>

  <p>"We know something about her husband," said I, "and that he has
  disappeared in a rather mysterious fashion; and that his disappearance
  coincides with that of his wife."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke agreed, "those are significant facts. But we mustn't lose
  sight of the legal position. Until the body is recovered, there is no
  evidence of death. Until the death is proved, no charge of murder can be
  sustained. When the body is found it will probably furnish some evidence as
  to bow the death occurred, if it is recovered within a reasonable time. As a
  matter of fact, it is rather remarkable that it has not yet been found. The
  death occurred&mdash;presumably&mdash;nearly a fortnight ago. Considering how
  very much frequented this river is, it is really rather unaccountable that
  the body has not come to light. But I suppose it is time that we started for
  the rendezvous."</p>

  <p>I looked at my watch and decided that it was, and we accordingly set forth
  in the direction of the office, which was the appointed meeting-place,
  calling at a stationer's to provide ourselves each with a map. We chose the
  six inch town plan, which contained the whole urban area, including the
  winding reaches of the river, folding them so as to show at an opening the
  peninsula on which the city of Rochester is built.</p>

  <p>"A curious loop of the river, this," said Thorndyke, scanning the map as
  we went along. "Rather like that of the Thames at the Isle of Dogs. You
  notice that there are quite a number of creeks on the low shore at both
  sides. Those will be places to watch. A floating body has rather a tendency
  to get carried into shallow creeks and to stay there. But I have no doubt the
  longshoremen are keeping an eye on them as a reward has been offered. Perhaps
  we might be able to go down and have a look at the shore when we have
  finished our perambulation of the town."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why not," I replied, though, to tell the truth, I was not
  very keen on this particular exploration. To Thorndyke this quest was just an
  investigation to be pursued with passionless care and method. To me it was a
  tragedy that would colour my whole life. To him, Angelina was but a missing
  woman whose disappearance had to be explained by patient inquiry. To me she
  was a beloved friend whose loss would leave me with a life-long sorrow. Of
  course, he was not aware of this; he had no suspicion of the shuddering
  horror that his calm, impersonal examination of the evidential details
  produced in me. Nor did I intend that he should. It was my duty and my
  privilege to give him what assistance I could, and keep my emotions to
  myself.</p>

  <p>"You will bear in mind," said he, as we approached the office, "that my
  connexion with the case of Mrs. Frood is not to be referred to. I am simply a
  friend staying with you for a day or two."</p>

  <p>"I won't forget," said I, "though I don't quite see why it should
  matter."</p>

  <p>"It probably doesn't matter at all," he replied. "But one never knows.
  Facts which might readily be spoken of before a presumably disinterested
  person might be withheld from one who was known to be collecting evidence for
  professional purposes. At any rate, I make it a rule to keep out of sight as
  far as possible."</p>

  <p>These observations brought us to the office, where we found our three
  friends together with a young man, who was apparently acting as deputy during
  the absence of the partners, and the photographer. I presented Thorndyke to
  my friends, and when the introduction had been made Mr. Japp picked up his
  hat, and turned to the deputy.</p>

  <p>"You know where to find me, Stevens," he said, "if I should be really
  wanted&mdash;really, you understand. But I don't particularly want to be
  found. Shall we start now? I propose to begin at the bridge, follow the
  Highstreet as far as Eastgate House, visit Restoration House, trace the city
  wall on the southwest side, and look over the castle. By that time we shall
  be ready for tea. After tea we can trace the north-east part of the wall and
  the gates that opened through it, and that will finish our tour of
  inspection."</p>

  <p>Hereupon the procession started, Mr. Japp and his guest leading,
  Thorndyke, Bundy, and I following, and the photographer bringing up the
  rear.</p>

  <p>"Let me see," said Bundy, looking up at Thorndyke with a sort of pert
  shyness, "weren't you down here a week or two ago?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke; "and I think I had the honour of being inspected
  by you while I was reading your proclamation respecting a certain lost
  key."</p>

  <p>"You had," said Bundy; "in fact, I may say that you raised false hopes in
  my partner and me. We thought you were going to find it."</p>

  <p>"What, for ten shillings!" exclaimed Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"We would have raised the fee if you had made a firm offer," said Bundy,
  removing his eyeglass to polish it with his handkerchief. "It was a valuable
  key. Belonged to a gate that encloses part of the city wall."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said Thorndyke. "I don't wonder you were anxious about it
  considering what numbers of dishonest persons there are about. Ha! Here is
  the bridge. Let us hear what Mr. Japp has to say about it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Japp's observations were concise. Having cast a venomous glance at the
  unlovely structure, he turned his back on it and remarked acidly: "That is
  the new bridge. It is, as you see, composed of iron girders. It is not an
  antiquity, and I hope it never will be. Let us forget it and go on to the
  Guildhall." He strode forward doggedly and Bundy turned to us with a
  grin.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Japp," said he, "he does hate that bridge. He has an engraving
  of the old stone one in his rooms, and I've seen him stand in front of it and
  groan. And really you can't wonder. It is an awful come-down. Just think what
  the town must have looked like from across the river when that stone bridge
  was standing."</p>

  <p>Here we halted opposite the Guildhall, and when we had read the
  inscription, admired the magnificent ship weathercock&mdash;said to be a
  model of the Rodney&mdash;and listened to Japp's observations on the
  architectural features of the building, the photographer was instructed to
  operate on its exterior while we entered to explore the Justice Room and
  examine the portraits. From the Guildhall we passed on to the Corn Exchange,
  the quaint and handsome overhanging clock of which had evidently captured Mr.
  Willard's fancy.</p>

  <p>"That clock," said he, "is a stroke of genius. It gives a character to the
  whole street. But what in creation induced your City Fathers to allow that
  charming little building to be turned into a picture theatre?"</p>

  <p>Japp shook his head and groaned. "You may well ask that," said he, glaring
  viciously at the inane posters and the doorway, decorated in the film taste.
  "If good Sir Cloudesley Shovel, who gave it to the town, could rise from his
  grave and look at it, now he'd&mdash;bah! The crying need of this age is some
  means of protecting historic buildings from town councils. To these men an
  ancient building is just old-fashioned&mdash;out-of-date; a thing to be
  pulled down and replaced by something smart and up-to-date in the corrugated
  iron line." He snorted fiercely, and as the photographer dismounted his
  camera, he turned and led the way up the street. I lingered to help the
  photographer with his repacking, and meanwhile Thorndyke and Bundy walked on
  together, chatting amicably and suggesting to my fancy an amiable mastiff
  accompanied by a particularly well-groomed fox terrier.</p>

  <p>"Do you usually give your patients a week-end holiday?" Bundy was
  inquiring as I overtook them.</p>

  <p>"I haven't any patients," replied Thorndyke. "My medical practice is
  conducted mostly in the Law Courts."</p>

  <p>"Good gracious!" exclaimed Bundy. "Do you mean that you live by
  resuscitating moribund jurymen and fattening up murderers for execution, and
  that sort of thing?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," replied Thorndyke. "Nothing so harmless. I am what is known
  as a Medical Expert. I give opinions on medical questions that affect legal
  issues."</p>

  <p>"Then you are really a sort of lawyer?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. A medico-legal hybrid; a sort of centaur or merman, with a doctor's
  head and a lawyer's tail."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Bundy, "there are some queer professions; I once knew a chap
  in the furniture trade who described himself as a 'worm-eater'&mdash;drilled
  worm-holes in faked antiques, you know."</p>

  <p>"And what," asked Thorndyke, "might be the analogy that you are
  suggesting? You don't propose to associate me with the diet of worms, I
  hope."</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," said Bundy, "though I suppose your practice is sometimes
  connected with exhumations. But I was thinking that you must know quite a lot
  about crime."</p>

  <p>"A good deal of my practice is concerned with criminal cases," Thorndyke
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"Then you will be rather interested in our local mystery. Has the doctor
  told you about it?"</p>

  <p>"You mean the mystery of the disappearing lady? But of what interest
  should it be to me? I was not acquainted with her."</p>

  <p>"I meant a professional interest. But I suppose you are not taking a
  'bus-man's holiday': don't want to be bothered with mysteries that don't
  concern you. Still, I should like to hear your expert opinion on the
  case."</p>

  <p>"You mistake my functions," said Thorndyke. "A common witness testifies to
  facts known to himself. An expert witness interprets facts presented to him
  by others. Present me your facts, and I will try to give you an
  interpretation of them."</p>

  <p>"But there are no facts. That is what constitutes the mystery."</p>

  <p>"Then there is nothing to interpret. It is a case for the police, and not
  for the scientific expert."</p>

  <p>Here our conversation was interrupted by our arrival at the House of the
  Six Poor Travellers, and by a learned disquisition by Japp on the connotation
  of the word Proctor&mdash;which, it appeared, was sometimes used in the
  Middle Ages in the sense of a cadger or swindler. Thence we proceeded to
  Eastgate House, where Japp mounted his hobby and discoursed impressively on
  the subject of ceilings, taking as his text a specimen modelled <i>in
  situ</i>, and bearing the date 1590.</p>

  <p>"The fellow who put up that ceiling," said he, "took his time about it, no
  doubt. But his work has lasted three hundred and fifty years. That is the
  best way to save time. Your modern plasterer will have his ceiling up in a
  jiffy; and it will be down in a jiffy, and to do all over again. And never
  worth looking at at all."</p>

  <p>Mr. Willard nodded. "It is very true," said he. "What is striking me in
  looking at all this old work is the great economy of time that is effected by
  taking pains and using good material, to say nothing of the beauty of the
  things created."</p>

  <p>"If he goes on talking like that," whispered Bundy, "Japp'll kiss him. We
  must get them out of this."</p>

  <p>Mercifully&mdash;if such a catastrophe was imminent&mdash;the ceiling
  discourse brought our inspection here to an end. From Eastgate House we went
  back to the Maidstone-road, and when we had inspected Restoration House,
  began to trace out the site of the city wall, which Thorndyke carefully
  marked on his map, to Japp's intense gratification. This perambulation
  brought us to the castle&mdash;which was dealt with rather summarily, as Mr.
  Willard had already examined it&mdash;and we then returned to the office for
  tea, which Bundy prepared and served with great success in his own
  sitting-room, while Japp dotted in with red ink on Thorndyke's map the entire
  city wall, including the part which we had yet to trace; and ridiculously
  small the ancient city looked when thus marked out on the modern town.</p>

  <p>After tea we retraced our steps to the site of the East Gate, and, having
  inspected a large fragment of the wall at the end of an alley, traced its
  line across the Highstreet, and then proceeded down Free School-lane to the
  fine angle-bastion at the northern corner of the lane. Thence we followed the
  scanty indications as far as the site of the North Gate, and thereafter
  through a confused and rather unlovely neighbourhood until, on the edge of
  the marshes, we struck into a narrow lane, enclosed by a dilapidated tarred
  fence, a short distance along which we came to a closed gate, which I
  recognized as the one through which I had passed with Bundy on the day when
  we were made acquainted with the tragic history of Bill the Bargee. As Japp
  unlocked the gate and admitted us to the space of waste land, Bundy remarked
  to Thorndyke: "That is the gate that the missing key belonged to. You see
  there is no harm done so far. The wall is still there."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "and not much improved in appearance by your
  builders' attentions. Those patches suggest the first attempts of an
  untalented dental student at conservation."</p>

  <p>"They are rather a disfigurement," said Japp. "But the men had to have a
  job found for them, and that is the result. Perhaps they won't show so much
  in the photograph."</p>

  <p>While the photographer was setting up his camera and making the exposure,
  Japp explained the relation of this piece of wall to the North Gate and the
  Gate that faced the bridge, and marked its position on Thorndyke's map.</p>

  <p>"And that," he continued, "concludes our perambulation. The photographer
  is chartered by Mr. Willard, but I understand that we are at liberty to
  secure copies of the photographs, if we want them. Is that not so, Mr.
  Willard?"</p>

  <p>"Surely," was the cordial reply; "only I stipulate that they shall be a
  gift from me, and I shall ask a favour in return. If there is a plate left, I
  should like to have a commemorative group taken, so that when I recall this
  pleasant day, I can also recall the pleasant society in which I spent
  it."</p>

  <p>We all acknowledged the kindly compliment with a bow, and as the
  photographer announced that he had a spare plate, we grouped ourselves
  against a portion of undisfigured wall, removed our hats, and took up easy
  and graceful postures on either side of Mr. Willard. When the exposure had
  been made, and the photographer proceeded to pack up his apparatus, Thorndyke
  tendered his very hearty thanks to Mr. Japp and his friend for their
  hospitality.</p>

  <p>"It has been a great privilege," said he, "to be allowed to share in the
  products of so much study and research, and I assure you it is far from being
  unappreciated. Whenever I revisit Rochester&mdash;which I hope to do before
  long&mdash;I shall think of you gratefully, and of your very kind and
  generous friend, Mr. Willard."</p>

  <p>Our two hosts made suitable acknowledgments; and while these compliments
  were passing, I turned to Bundy.</p>

  <p>"Can we get down to the shore from here?" I asked. "Thorndyke was saying
  that he would like to have a look at the river. If it is accessible from here
  we might take it on the way home."</p>

  <p>"It isn't difficult to get at," replied Bundy. "If he wants to get a
  typical view of the river with the below-bridge traffic, by far the best
  place is Blue Boar Pier. It isn't very far, and it is on your way home-more
  or less. I'll show you the way there if you like. Japp is dining with
  Willard, so he won't want me."</p>

  <p>I accepted the offer gladly, and as the exchange of compliments seemed to
  be completed and our party was moving towards the gate, I tendered my thanks
  for the day's entertainment and bade my hosts farewell, explaining that we
  were going riverwards. Accordingly we parted at the gate, Japp and Willard
  turning towards the town, while Thorndyke, Bundy, and I retraced our steps
  towards the marshes.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the lane Bundy paused to explain the topography. "That
  path," said he, "leads to Gas House road and the marshes by the North Shore.
  But there isn't much to see there. If we take this other track we shall
  strike Blue Boar-lane, which will take us to the pier. From there we can get
  a view of the whole bend of the river right across to Chatham."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke followed the description closely with the aid of his map,
  marking off our present position with a pencil. Then we struck into a rough
  cart-track, with the wide stretch of the marshes on our left, and, following
  this, we presently came out into the lower part of Blue Boar-lane and turned
  our faces towards the river. We had not gone far when I observed a man
  approaching whose appearance seemed to be familiar. Bundy also observed him,
  for he exclaimed: "Why, that is old Cobbledick! Out of uniform, too. Very
  irregular. I shall have to remonstrate with him. I wonder what he has been up
  to. Prowling about the river bank in search of clues, I expect. And he'll
  suspect us of being on the same errand."</p>

  <p>Bundy's surmise appeared to be correct, for as the sergeant drew nearer
  and recognized us, his face took on an expression of shrewd inquiry. But I
  noticed with some surprise that his curiosity seemed to be principally
  concerned with Thorndyke, at whom he gazed with something more than common
  attention. Under the circumstances I should have passed him with a friendly
  greeting, but he stopped, and, having wished me "Good evening," said: "Could
  I have a few words with you, Doctor?" upon which I halted, and Thorndyke and
  Bundy walked on slowly. The sergeant looked after them, and, turning his back
  to them, drew from his pocket with a mysterious air a small dirty brown
  bundle, which he handed to me.</p>

  <p>"I wanted you just to have a look at that," he said.</p>

  <p>I opened out the bundle, though I had already tentatively recognized it.
  But when it was unrolled it was unmistakable. It was poor Angelina's
  scarf.</p>

  <p>"I thought there couldn't be any doubt about it," the sergeant said
  cheerfully when I had announced the identification. "Your description was so
  clear and exact. Well, this gives us a pretty fair kick-off. You can see that
  it has been in the water-some time, too. So we know where to look for the
  body. The mysterious thing is, though, that we've still got to look for it.
  It ought to have come up on the shore days ago. And it hasn't. There isn't a
  longshoreman for miles up and down that isn't on the look-out for it. You can
  see them prowling along the seawalls and searching the creeks in their boats.
  I can't think how they can have missed it. The thing is getting serious."</p>

  <p>"Serious?" I repeated.</p>

  <p>"Well," he explained, "there's no need for me to point out to a medical
  gentleman like you that bodies don't last for ever, especially in mild
  weather such as we've been having, and in a river where the shore swarms with
  rats and shore-crabs. Every day that passes is making the identification more
  difficult."</p>

  <p>The horrible suggestions that emerged from his explanation gave me a
  sensation of physical sickness. I fidgeted uneasily, but still I managed to
  rejoin huskily: "There's the clothing, you know."</p>

  <p>"So there is," he agreed; "and very good means of identification in an
  ordinary case&mdash;accidental drowning, for instance. But this is a criminal
  case. I don't want to have to depend on the clothing."</p>

  <p>"Was the scarf found floating?" I asked, a little anxious to change the
  subject to one less gruesome.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "It was on the shore by the small creek just below Blue
  Boar Pier, under an empty fish-trunk. One of the Customs men from the
  watch-house found it. He noticed the trunk lying out on the shore as he was
  walking along and went out to see if there was anything in it. Then, when he
  found it was empty, he turned it over, and there was the scarf. He recognized
  it at once&mdash;there's a list of the articles stuck up on the
  watch-house&mdash;and kept it to bring to me. But it happened that I came
  down here&mdash;as I do every day&mdash;just after he'd found it. But I
  mustn't keep you here talking, though I'm glad I met you and got your
  confirmation about this scarf."</p>

  <p>He smiled benignly and raised his hat, whereupon I wished him "Good
  evening" and went on my way with a sigh of relief. He was a pleasant, genial
  man, but his matter-of-fact way of looking at this tragedy that had eaten so
  deeply into my peace of mind, was to me positively harrowing. But, of course,
  he did not understand my position in the case.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Bundy, when I hurried up, "what's the news? Old Cobbledick
  was looking mighty mysterious. And wasn't he interested in us? Why he's
  gazing after us still. Has he had a bite? Because if he hasn't, I have. Some
  beastly mosquito."</p>

  <p>"Don't rub it." said Thorndyke, as Bundy clapped his hand to his cheek.
  "Leave it alone. We'll put a spot of ammonia or iodine on it presently."</p>

  <p>"Very well," replied Bundy, with a grimace expressive of resignation. "I
  am in the hands of the Faculty. What sort of fish was it that Isaak Walton
  Cobbledick had hooked? Or is it a secret?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think there is any secrecy about it," said I. "One of the Customs
  men has found Mrs. Frood's scarf," and I repeated what the sergeant had told
  me as to the circumstances.</p>

  <p>"It is a gruesome affair," said Bundy, "this search for these ghastly
  relics. Look at those ghouls down on the shore there. I suppose that is the
  fish-trunk."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, we came out on the shore to the right of the pier and halted
  to survey the rather unlovely prospect. Outside the stunted sea-wall a level
  stretch of grey-green grass extended to the spring high-water mark, beyond
  which a smooth sheet of mud&mdash;now dry and covered with multitudinous
  cracks&mdash;spread out to the slimy domain of the ordinary tides. At the
  edge of the dry mud lay a derelict fish-trunk around which a group of
  bare-legged boys had gathered&mdash;and all along the shore, on the faded
  grass, on the dry mud and wading in the soft slime, the human water-rats were
  to be seen, turning over drift-rubbish, prying under stranded boats or
  grubbing in the soft mud. Hard by, on the grass near the sea-wall, an old
  ship's long-boat had been hauled up above tide-marks to a permanent berth and
  turned into a habitation by the erection in it of a small house. A short
  ladder gave access to it from without and the resident had laid down a little
  causeway of flat stones leading to the wall.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Noah seems to be at home," observed Bundy, as we approached the
  little amphibious residence to inspect it. He pointed to a thin wisp of smoke
  that issued from the iron chimney; and, almost as he spoke, the door opened
  and an old man came out into the open stern-sheets of the boat with a
  steaming tin pannikin in his hand. His appearance fitted his residence to a
  nicety; for whereas the latter appeared to have been constructed chiefly from
  driftwood and wreckage, his costume suggested a collection of assorted marine
  salvage, with a leaning towards oil-skin.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Noah" cast a malevolent glance at the searchers; then, having
  fortified himself with a pull at the pannikin, he turned a filmy blue eye on
  us.</p>

  <p>"Good evening," said Thorndyke. "There seems to be a lot of business-doing
  here," and he indicated the fish-trunk and the eager searchers.</p>

  <p>The old man grunted contemptuously. "Parcel of fules," said he, "a-busyin'
  theirselves with what don't concern 'em, and lookin' in the wrong place at
  that."</p>

  <p>"Still," said Bundy, "they have found something here."</p>

  <p>"Yes," the old man admitted, "they have. And that's why they ain't goin'
  to find anything more." He refreshed himself with a drink
  of&mdash;presumably&mdash;tea, and continued: "But the things is a-beginning
  to come up. It's about time she come up. But she won't come up here."</p>

  <p>"Where do you suppose she will come up?" asked Bundy.</p>

  <p>The old man regarded him with a cunning leer. "Never you mind where she'll
  come up," said he. "It ain't no consarn o' yourn."</p>

  <p>"But how do you know where she'll come up?" Bundy persisted.</p>

  <p>"I knows," the old scarecrow replied conclusively, "becos I do. Becos I
  gets my livin' along-shore, and it's my business for to know."</p>

  <p>Having made this pronouncement, Mr. Noah looked inquiringly into the
  pannikin, emptied it at a draught, and, turning abruptly, retired into the
  ark, shutting the door after him with a care suited to its evident physical
  infirmity.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he really does know," said Bundy, as we walked away past the
  Customs watch-house.</p>

  <p>"We can fairly take it that he doesn't," said Thorndyke, "seeing that the
  matter is beyond human calculation. But I have no doubt that he knows the
  places where bodies and other floating objects are most commonly washed
  ashore, and we may assume that he is proposing to devote his probably
  extensive leisure to the exploration of those places. It wouldn't be amiss to
  put the sergeant in communication with him."</p>

  <p>"Probably the sergeant knows him," said I, "but I will mention the matter
  the next time I see him."</p>

  <p>At the top of Blue Boar-lane Bundy halted and held out his hand to
  Thorndyke. "This is the parting of the ways," said he.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, it isn't," replied Thorndyke. "You've got to have your
  mosquito-bite treated. Never neglect an insect-bite, especially on the
  face."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," said I, "you have got to come and have dinner with
  us. We can't let you break up the party in this way."</p>

  <p>"It's very nice of you to ask me," he began, hesitatingly, a little shy,
  as I guessed, of intruding on me and my visitor; but I cut him short, and,
  hooking my arm through his, led him off, an obviously willing captive. And if
  his presence hindered me from discussing with Thorndyke the problem that had
  occasioned his visit, that was of no consequence, since we should have the
  following day to ourselves; and he certainly contributed not a little to the
  cheerfulness of the proceedings. Indeed, I seemed to find in his high spirits
  something a little pathetic; a suggestion that the company or two live
  men&mdash;one of them a man of outstanding intellect&mdash;was an unusual
  treat, and that his life with old Japp and the predatory females might be a
  trifle dull. He took to Thorndyke amazingly, treating him with a sort of
  respectful cheekiness, like a schoolboy dining with a favourite head-master;
  while Thorndyke, fully appreciative of his irresponsible gaiety, developed a
  quiet humour and playfulness which rather took me by surprise. The solemn
  farce of the diagnosis and treatment of the mosquito bite was an instance;
  when Thorndyke, having seated the patient in the surgery chair and invested
  him with a large towel, covered the table with an assortment of preposterous
  instruments and bottles of reagents, and proceeded gravely to examine the
  bite through a lens until Bundy was as nervous as a cat, and then to apply
  the remedy with meticulous precision on the point of a fine sable brush.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant evening, pervaded by a sense of frivolous gaiety that
  was felt gratefully by the two elder revellers and was even viewed
  indulgently by Mrs. Dunk. As to Bundy, his high spirits flowed
  unceasingly&mdash;but, I may add, with faultless good manners&mdash;and when,
  at length, he took his departure, he shook our hands with a warmth which,
  again, I found slightly pathetic.</p>

  <p>"I <i>have</i> had a jolly evening!" he exclaimed, looking at me with a
  queer sort of wistfulness. "It has been a red-letter day"; and with this he
  turned abruptly and walked away.</p>

  <p>We watched him from the threshold, bustling jauntily along the pavement;
  and as I looked at him, there came unbidden to my mind the recollection of
  that other figure that I had watched from this same threshold, walking away
  in the fading light&mdash;walking into the fog that was to swallow her up and
  hide her from my sight for ever.</p>

  <p>From these gloomy reflections I was recalled by Thorndyke's voice.</p>

  <p>"A nice youngster, that, Strangeways. Gay and sprightly, but not in the
  least shallow. I often think that there was a great deal of wisdom in that
  observation of Spencer's, that happy people are the greatest benefactors to
  mankind. Your friend, Bundy, has helped me to renew my youth; and who could
  have done one a greater service?"</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XI&mdash;THE MAN WITH THE MOLE</h3>

  <p>When I had seen my guest off by the last train on Saturday night, I walked
  homeward slowly, cogitating on the results of his visit. It seemed to me that
  they were very insignificant. In the morning we had explored the piece of
  shore on which the bag and the box of tablets had been found, making our way
  to it by the narrow and intricate alleys which seemed to be the only
  approach; and we had reached the same conclusion. It was an impossible
  place.</p>

  <p>"If we assume," said Thorndyke, "as we must, on the apparent
  probabilities, that the tragedy occurred here, we must assume that there are
  some significant circumstances that are unknown to us. Mrs. Frood could not
  have strayed here by chance. We can think of no business that could have
  brought her here; and since she was neither a child nor a fool, she could not
  have been enticed into such an obviously sinister locality without some
  plausible pretext. There is evidently something more than meets the eye."</p>

  <p>"Something, you mean, connected with her past life and the people she
  knew?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly. I am having careful inquiries made on the subject in likely
  quarters, including the various theatrical photographers. They form quite a
  promising' source of information, as they are not only able to give addresses
  but they can furnish us with photographs of members of the companies who
  would have been colleagues, and, at least, acquaintances."</p>

  <p>"If you come across any photographs of Mrs. Frood," I said, "I should like
  to see them."</p>

  <p>"You shall," he replied. "I shall certainly collect all I can get, on the
  chance that they may help us with the identification of the body; which may
  possibly present some difficulty."</p>

  <p>Here I was reminded of Cobbledick's observations, and, distasteful as they
  were, I repeated them to Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"The sergeant is quite right," said he. "This is apparently a criminal
  case, involving a charge of wilful murder. To sustain that charge, the
  prosecution will have to produce incontestable evidence as to the identity of
  the deceased. Clothing alone would not be sufficient to secure a conviction.
  The body would have to be identified. And the sergeant's anxiety is quite
  justified. Have you had any experiences of bodies recovered from the
  water?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied; "and I don't like to think of them." I shuddered as I
  spoke, for his question had recalled to my memory the incidents or a
  professional visit to Poplar Mortuary. There rose before my eyes the picture
  of a long black, box with a small glass window in the lid, and of a thing
  that appeared at that window; a huge, bloated, green and purple thing, with
  groups or radiating wrinkles, and in the middle a button-like object that
  looked like the tip of a nose. It was a frightful picture; and yet I knew
  that when the river that we stood by should give up its dead&mdash;</p>

  <p>I put the thought away with a shiver and asked faintly: "About the man
  Frood. Don't you think that his disappearance throws some light on the
  mystery?"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't throw much light," replied Thorndyke, "because nothing is
  known about it. Obviously the coincidence in time of the disappearance, added
  to the known character of the man and his relations with his wife, make him
  an object of deep suspicion. His whereabouts will have to be traced and his
  time accounted for. But I have ascertained that the police know nothing about
  him, and my own inquiries have come to nothing, so far. He seems to have
  disappeared without leaving a trace. But I shall persevere. Your
  object&mdash;and mine&mdash;is to clear up the mystery, and if a crime has
  been committed, to bring the criminal to justice."</p>

  <p>So that was how the matter stood; and it did not appear to me that much
  progress had been made towards the elucidation of the mystery. As to the
  perpetrator or that crime, he remained a totally unknown quantity, unless the
  deed could be fixed on the missing man, Frood. And so matters remained for
  some days. Then an event occurred which seemed to promise some illumination
  of the darkness; a promise that it failed to fulfil.</p>

  <p>It was about a week after Thorndyke's visit. I had gone out after lunch to
  post off to him the set of photographs which had been delivered to me by the
  photographer with my own set. I went into the post-office to register the
  package, and here I found Bundy in the act of sending off a parcel. When we
  had transacted our business we strolled out together, and he asked: "What are
  you going to do now, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"I was going to walk down to Blue Boar Pier," said I, "to see if anything
  further has been discovered."</p>

  <p>"Should I be in the way if I walked there with you?" he asked. "I've got
  nothing to do at the moment. But perhaps you would rather go alone. You've
  had a good deal of my society lately."</p>

  <p>"Not more than I wanted, Bundy," I answered. "You are my only chum here,
  and you are not unappreciated, I can assure you."</p>

  <p>"It's nice of you to say that," he rejoined, with some emotion. "I've
  sometimes felt that I was rather thrusting my friendship on you."</p>

  <p>"Then don't ever feel it again," said I. "It has been a bit of luck for me
  to find a man here whom I could like and chum in with."</p>

  <p>He murmured a few words of thanks, and we walked on for a while without
  speaking. Presently, as we turned into the lane by the Blue Boar Inn, he
  said, a little hesitatingly. "Don't you think, Doc, that it is rather a
  mistake to let your mind run so much on this dreadful affair? It seems to be
  always in your thoughts. And it isn't good for you to think so much about it.
  I've noticed you quite a lot, and you haven't been the same since&mdash;since
  it happened. You have looked worried and depressed."</p>

  <p>"I haven't felt the same," said I. "It has been a great grief to me."</p>

  <p>"But," he urged, "don't you think you should try to forget it? After all,
  she was little more than an acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"She was a great deal more than that, Bundy," said I. "While she was
  alive, I would not admit even to myself that my feeling towards her was
  anything more than ordinary friendship. But it was; and now that she is gone,
  there can be no harm in recognizing the fact, or even in confessing it to
  you, as we are friends."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean, Doc," he said in a low voice, "that you were in love with
  her?"</p>

  <p>"That is what it comes to, I suppose," I answered. "She was the only woman
  I had ever really cared for."</p>

  <p>"And did she know it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course she didn't," I replied indignantly. "She was a lady and a woman
  of honour. Of course she never dreamed that I cared for her, or she would
  never have let me visit her."</p>

  <p>For a few moments he walked at my side in silence. Then he slipped his arm
  through mine, and pressing it gently with his hand, said softly and very
  earnestly: "I'm awfully sorry, Doc. It is frightfully hard luck for you,
  though it couldn't have been much better even if&mdash;but it's no use
  talking of that. I <i>am</i> sorry, old chap. But still, you know, you ought
  to try to put it away. <i>She</i> wouldn't have wished you to make yourself
  unhappy about her."</p>

  <p>"I know," said I. "But I feel that the office belongs to me, who cared
  most for her, to see that the mystery of her death is cleared up and that
  whoever wronged her is brought to justice."</p>

  <p>He made no reply to this but walked at my side with his arm linked in
  mine, meditating with an air of unwonted gravity.</p>

  <p>When we reached the head of the pier the place was deserted excepting for
  one man; a sea-faring person, apparently, who was standing with his back to
  us, studying intently the bills that were stuck on the wall of the lookout.
  As we were passing, my eye caught the word "Wanted" on a new bill, and
  pausing to read it over the man's shoulder, I found that it was a description
  of the unknown man&mdash;"with a mole on the left side of his nose"&mdash;who
  had pawned the opal brooch. Bundy read it, too, and as we walked away he
  remarked: "They are rather late in putting out those bills. I should think
  that gentleman will have left the locality long ago, unless he was a local
  person"; an opinion with which I was disposed to agree.</p>

  <p>After a glance round the shore and at "the Ark"&mdash;which was closed but
  of which the chimney emitted a cheerful smoke suggestive of culinary
  activities on the part of "Mr. Noah "&mdash;we sauntered up past the head of
  the creek, along the rough path by the foundry, and out upon the upper
  shore.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm hanged!" exclaimed Bundy, glancing back at the watch-house,
  "that chap is still reading that bill. He must be a mighty slow reader, or he
  must find it more thrilling than I did. Perhaps he knows somebody with a mole
  on his nose."</p>

  <p>I looked back at the motionless figure; and at that moment another figure
  appeared and advanced, as we had done, to look over the reader's
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Why, that looks like old Cobbledick&mdash;come to admire his own literary
  productions. There's vanity for you. Hallo! What's up now?"</p>

  <p>As Bundy spoke, the reader had turned to move away and had come face to
  face with the sergeant. For a moment both men had stood stock still; then
  there was a sudden, confused movement on both sides, with the final result
  that the sergeant fell, or was knocked, down and that the stranger raced off,
  apparently in our direction. He disappeared at once, being hidden from us by
  the foundry buildings, and we advanced towards the end of the fenced lane by
  which we had come, to intercept him, waiting by the edge of a trench or dry
  ditch.</p>

  <p>"Here he comes," said Bundy, a trifle nervously, as rapid footfalls became
  audible in the narrow, crooked lane. Suddenly the man appeared, running
  furiously, and as he caught sight of us, he whipped out a large knife, and,
  flourishing it with a menacing air, charged straight at us. I watched an
  opportunity to trip him up; but as he approached Bundy pulled me back with
  such energy that he and I staggered on the brink of the ditch, capsized, and
  rolled together to the bottom. By the time we had managed to scramble up, the
  man had disappeared into the wilderness of sheds, scrap-heaps, derelict
  boilers, and stray railway-waggons that filled the area of land between the
  foundry and the coal-wharves and jetties.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Bundy," said I, as my companion stood tenderly rubbing various
  projecting portions of his person; "we mustn't lose sight of him."</p>

  <p>But Bundy showed no enthusiasm; and at this moment a rapid crescendo of
  heavy foot-falls was followed by the emergence of the sergeant, purple-faced
  and panting, from the end of the lane.</p>

  <p>"Which way did he go?" gasped Cobbledick.</p>

  <p>I indicated the wilderness, briefly explaining how the fugitive had
  escaped us, whereupon the sergeant started forward at a lumbering trot and we
  followed. But it was an unfavourable hunting-ground, for the bulky
  litter&mdash;the heaps of coal-dust, the wagons, the cranes, the piles of
  condemned machinery, mingled with clumps of bushes&mdash;gave the fugitive
  every opportunity to disappear. And, in fact, he had disappeared without
  leaving a trace. Presently we came out on a wharf beside which a schooner was
  berthed; a trim-looking little craft with a white under-body and black
  top-sides, bearing a single big yard on her fore-mast and the name Anna on
  her counter. She was all ready for sea and was apparently waiting for high
  water, for her deck was all clear and a man on it was engaged in placidly
  coiling a rope on the battened hatch while another watched him from the door
  of the deckhouse. On this peaceful scene the sergeant burst suddenly and
  hailing the rope-coiler demanded:</p>

  <p>"Have you seen a man run past here?"</p>

  <p>The mariner dropped the rope, and looking up drowsily, repeated: "Have I
  seen a mahn?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, a sea-faring man with a mole on his nose."</p>

  <p>The mariner brightened up perceptibly. "Please?" said he.</p>

  <p>"A sailor-man with a mole on his nose."</p>

  <p>"Ach!" exclaimed the mariner. "Vos it tied on?"</p>

  <p>"Tied on!" the sergeant snorted impatiently. "Of course it wasn't. It grew
  there."</p>

  <p>Here the second mariner apparently asked some question, for our friend
  turned to him and replied: "<i>Ja. Maulwurf</i>"; on which I heard Bundy
  snigger softly.</p>

  <p>"No, no," I interposed; "not that sort of mole. A kind of wart, you know.
  <i>Das Mal</i>."</p>

  <p>On this the second mariner fell out of the deckhouse door, and the pair
  burst into yells of laughter, rolling about the deck in agonies of mirth,
  wiping their eyes, muttering <i>Maulwurf, Maulwurf</i>, and screeching like
  demented hyenas.</p>

  <p>"Well," Cobbledick demanded impatiently, "have you seen him '"</p>

  <p>The mariner shook his head. "No," he replied, shakily. "I have not any
  mahn seen."</p>

  <p>"Well, why couldn't you say so at first" the sergeant growled.</p>

  <p>"I vos zo zubbraised," the mariner explained, glancing at his shipmate;
  and the pair burst out into fresh howls of laughter.</p>

  <p>The sergant turned away with a sort of benevolent contempt and ran his eye
  despairingly over the wilderness. "I suppose we had better search this
  place," said he, "though he is pretty certain to have got away."</p>

  <p>At his suggestion we separated and examined the possible hiding-places
  systematically, but, of course, with no result. Once only I had a momentary
  hope that we had not lost our quarry, when the sergeant suddenly stooped and
  began cautiously to stalk an abandoned boiler surrounded by a clump of
  bushes; but when the grinning countenance of Bundy appeared at the opposite
  end and that reprobate crept out stealthily and proceeded to stalk the
  sergeant, the last hope faded.</p>

  <p>"I certainly thought I saw someone moving in those bushes," said
  Cobbledick, with a disappointed air.</p>

  <p>"So did Mr. Bundy," said I "You must have seen one another."</p>

  <p>The sergeant glanced suspiciously at our colleague, but made no remark;
  and we continued our rather perfunctory search. At length we gave it up and
  slowly returned to the neighbourhood of the pier. By this time the tide had
  turned, and a few loiterers were standing about watching the procession of
  barges moving downstream on the ebb. Among them was a grave-looking,
  sandy-haired man who leaned against the watch-house, smoking reflectively as
  he surveyed the river. To this philosopher Cobbledick addressed himself,
  explaining, as he was in plain clothes:</p>

  <p>"Good afternoon. I am a police officer and I am looking for a man who is
  described on that bill." Here he indicated the poster.</p>

  <p>The philosopher turned a pale grey, and somewhat suspicious eye on him,
  and having removed his pipe, expectorated thoughtfully but made no comment on
  the statement.</p>

  <p>"A sea-faring man," continued the sergeant, "with a mole on the left side
  of his nose." He looked enquiringly at the philosopher, who replied
  impassively:</p>

  <p>"Nhm&mdash;nhm."</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to have seen a man answering that description?"</p>

  <p>"Nhm&mdash;nhm," was the slightly ambiguous reply.</p>

  <p>"You <i>have</i> seen him?" the sergeant asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Aye."</p>

  <p>"Do you know if he belongs to any of the craft that trade here?"</p>

  <p>"Nhm&mdash;nhm."</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to know which particular vessel he belongs to?"</p>

  <p>"Aye," was the answer, accompanied by a grave nod.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me," the sergeant asked patiently, "which vessel that is,
  and where she is at present?"</p>

  <p>Our friend replaced his pipe and took a long draw at it, gazing
  meditatively at a schooner which was moving swiftly down the river under the
  power of an auxiliary motor, and setting her sails as she went. I had noticed
  her already, and observed that she had a white underbody and black top-sides,
  and that she carried a single long yard on her fore-mast. At length our
  friend removed his pipe, expectorated, and nodded gravely at the
  schooner.</p>

  <p>"Yon," said he, and replaced his pipe, as a precaution, I supposed,
  against unnecessary loquacity.</p>

  <p>Cobbledick gazed wistfully at the receding schooner. "Pity," said he. "I
  should have liked to have a look at that fellow."</p>

  <p>"You could get the schooner held up at Sheerness, couldn't you?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes; I could send a 'phone message to Garrison Point Fort. But, you see,
  she's a foreigner. Might make trouble. And he is probably not the man we
  want. After all, it's only a matter of a mole."</p>

  <p>"Maulwurf," murmured Bundy.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the sergeant, with a faint grin; "those beggars were laughing
  at us. Well, it can't be helped."</p>

  <p>We stood for a moment or two watching the schooner set one sail after
  another. Presently Bundy observed:</p>

  <p>"Methinks, Sergeant, that Mr. Noah is trying to attract your
  attention."</p>

  <p>We glanced towards the Ark, the tenant of which was seated in the
  stern-sheets, scrubbing a length of rusty chain. As he caught the sergeant's
  eye, he beckoned mysteriously, whereupon we descended the bank, and, picking
  our way across the muddy grass by his little causeway of stepping-stones,
  approached the foot of the short ladder.</p>

  <p>"Well, Israel," said the sergeant, resting his hands on the gunwale of the
  old boat as he made a rapid survey of the interior, "giving the family plate
  a bit of a polish, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Plate!" exclaimed the old man, holding up the chain, which, as I now saw,
  had a number of double hooks linked to it, "this ain't plate. 'Tis what we
  calls a creeper."</p>

  <p>"A creeper," repeated the sergeant, looking at it with renewed interest.
  "Ha, yes, hm. A creeper, hey? Well, Israel, what's a-doing? Have you got
  something to show us?"</p>

  <p>The old man laid down the creeper and the scrubbing-brush&mdash;which had
  a strong suggestion of salvage in its appearance&mdash;and moved towards the
  door of the Ark. "Come along inside," said he.</p>

  <p>Cobbledick mounted the ladder and motioned me to follow, which I did,
  while Bundy discretely sauntered away and sat down on the bank. On entering,
  I observed that the Ark followed closely the constructional traditions. Like
  its classical prototype, it was "pitched with pitch, within and without," and
  was furnished with a single small window, let into the door and hermetically
  sealed.</p>

  <p>Seeing that our host looked at me with some disfavour, the tactful
  sergeant hastened to make us known to one another.</p>

  <p>"This is Dr. Strangeways, Israel. He was Mrs. Frood's doctor, and he knows
  all about this affair. This, Doctor, is Mr. Israel Bangs, the eminent
  long-shoreman, a sort of hereditary Grand Duke of the Rochester
  foreshore."</p>

  <p>I bowed ceremoniously, and the Grand Duke acknowledged the introduction
  with a sour grin. Then, lifting the greasy lid of a locker, he dived into it
  and came to the surface, as it were, with a small shoe in his hand.</p>

  <p>"What do you say to that?" he demanded, holding the shoe under the
  sergeant's nose. The sergeant said nothing, but looked at me; and I, suddenly
  conscious of the familiar sickening sensation, could do no more than nod in
  reply. Soiled, muddy and sodden as it was, the poor little relic instantly
  and vividly recalled the occasion when I had last seen it, then all trim and
  smart, peeping coyly beneath the hem of the neat brown skirt.</p>

  <p>"Where did you find it, Israel?" asked Cobbledick.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Bangs, with a sly leer, "that's tellin', that is. Never you
  mind where I found it. There's the shoe."</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Israel," said the sergeant.' "What use do you suppose
  the shoe is to me if I don't know where you found it? I've got to put it in
  evidence, you know."</p>

  <p>"You can put it where you like, so long as you pays for it," the old
  rascal replied, doggedly. "The findin' of it's my business."</p>

  <p>There ensued a lengthy wrangle, but the sergeant, though patient and
  polite, was firm. Eventually Israel gave way.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "if you undertakes not to let on to Sam Hooper or any of
  his lot, I'll tell you. I found it on the mud, side of the long crik betwixt
  Blue Boar Head and Gas-'us Point."</p>

  <p>The sergeant made a note of the locality, and, after having sworn not to
  divulge the secret to Sam Hooper or any other of the shore-rat fraternity,
  and having ascertained that Israel had no further information to dispose of,
  rose to depart; and, I noticed that, as we passed out towards the ladder, he
  seemed to bestow a glance of friendly recognition on the creeper.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Bundy, when we rejoined him, "what had Mr. Noah to say? I
  hope you remembered me kindly to my old friends, Shem, Ham, and Japhet."</p>

  <p>"He has found one of Mrs. Frood's shoes," answered the sergeant, producing
  it from his pocket and offering it for inspection. Bundy glanced at it
  indifferently, and then remarked: "It seems to answer the description, but,
  for my part, I don't quite see the use of all this searching and prying. It
  only proves what we all know. There's no doubt that she fell into the river.
  The question is, how did she get there? It is not likely that it was an
  accident, and, if it wasn't, it must have been a crime. What we want to know
  is, who is the criminal?"</p>

  <p>Cobbledick pocketed the shoe with an impatient gesture. "That's the way
  they always talk," said he. "They will always begin at the wrong end. The
  question, 'Who is the murderer?' does not arise until it is certain that
  there has been a murder; and it can't be certain that there has been a murder
  until it is certain that the missing person is dead. And that certainty can
  hardly be established until the body is found. But, in the meantime, these
  articles are evidence enough to justify us in making other inquiries, and
  they may give us a hint where to look for the body. They do, in fact. They
  suggest that the body is probably not very far away, and more likely to be
  up-stream than down."</p>

  <p>"I don't see how they do," said Bundy.</p>

  <p>"I do," retorted the sergeant, "and that's enough for me."</p>

  <p>Bundy, with his customary discretion, took this as closing the discussion,
  and further&mdash;as I guessed&mdash;surmising that the sergeant might wish
  to have a few words with me alone, took his leave of us when we reached the
  vicinity of the office.</p>

  <p>"That is not a bad idea of old Israel's," said Cobbledick, when Bundy had
  gone. "The, creeper, I mean."</p>

  <p>"What about it?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"You know what a creeper is used for, I suppose," said he. "In the old
  days, the revenue boats used to trail them along over the bottom in shallow
  water where they suspected that the smugglers had sunk their tubs. You see
  they couldn't always get a chance to land the stuff. Then they used to fill
  the spirits into a lot of little ankers or tubs, lash them together into a
  sort of raft and sink the raft close in-shore, on a dark night, in a marked
  place where their pals could go some other night and fish them up. Well the
  revenue cutters knew most of those places and used to go there and drift over
  them trailing creepers. Of course, if there were any tubs there, the creepers
  hooked on to the lashings and up they came."</p>

  <p>"But what do you suppose is Israel's idea?" I asked. "Why, as the body
  ought to have come up long before this, and it hasn't, he thinks it has been
  sunk. It might have been taken up the river in a boat, and sunk in mid-stream
  with a weight of some sort. Or it might have got caught by a lost anchor or
  on some old moorings. That would account for its not coming up and for these
  odd-ments getting detached and drifting ashore. So old Israel is going to get
  to work with a creeper. I expect he spends his nights creeping over the
  likely spots, and that is what makes him so deuced secret about the place
  where he found that shoe. He reckons that the body is somewhere
  thereabouts."</p>

  <p>I made no comment on this rather horrible communication. Of course, it was
  necessary that the body should be searched for, since its discovery was the
  indispensable condition of the search for the murderer. But I did not want to
  hear more of the dreadful details than was absolutely unavoidable.</p>

  <p>When we reached the Guildhall, I halted and was about to take leave of the
  sergeant when he said, somewhat hesitatingly:</p>

  <p>"Do you remember, Doctor, when you met me last Saturday, you had a
  gentleman with you?"</p>

  <p>"I remember," said I.</p>

  <p>"Now, I wonder if you would think I was taking a liberty if I were to ask
  what that gentleman's name was. I had an idea that I knew his face."</p>

  <p>"Of course it wouldn't be a liberty," I replied. "His name is Thorndyke;
  Dr. John Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Cobbledick, "I thought I couldn't be mistaken. It isn't
  the sort of face that one would forget. I once heard him give evidence at the
  Old Bailey. Wonderful evidence it was, too. Since then I've read reports of
  his investigations from time to time. He's a marvellous man. The way he has
  of raking up evidence from nowhere is perfectly astonishing. Did you happen
  to talk to him about this case at all?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, Sergeant," I answered, rather evasively, "he had come down
  here for the week-end as my guest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly, exactly," Cobbledick interrupted, unconsciously helping me to
  avoid answering his question, "he came down for a rest and a change, and
  wouldn't want to be bothered with professional matters. Still, you know, I
  think he would be interested in this case. It is quite in his own line. It is
  a queer case; a very queer case in some respects."</p>

  <p>"In what respects?" I asked.</p>

  <p>It was Cobbledick's turn to be evasive. He had apparently said more than
  he had intended, and now drew in his horns perceptibly.</p>

  <p>"Why," he replied, "when you come to think of&mdash;of
  the&mdash;er&mdash;the character of the lady, for instance. Why should anyone
  want to do her any harm? And then there is the mystery as to how it happened,
  and the place, and&mdash;in fact, there are a number of things that are
  difficult to understand. But I mustn't keep you standing here. If you should
  happen to see Dr. Thorndyke again, it might be as well to tell him about the
  case. It would be sure to interest him; and if he should, by any chance, want
  to know anything that you are not in a position to tell him, why, you know
  where I am to be found. I shouldn't want to make any secrets with him. And he
  might spot something that we haven't noticed."</p>

  <p>I promised to follow the sergeant's advice, and, having bid him adieu,
  turned back, and walked slowly homeward. As I went I reflected profoundly on
  my conversation with Cobbledick; from which, as it seemed to me, two
  conclusions emerged. First, there were elements in this mystery that were
  unknown to me. I had supposed that the essence of the mystery was the mere
  absence of data. But it now appeared from the sergeant's utterances, and
  still more from his evasions, that he saw farther into the affair than I did;
  either because he had more facts, or because, by reason of his greater
  experience, the facts meant more to him than they did to me. The second
  conclusion was that he was in some way in difficulties; that he was conscious
  of an inability to interpret satisfactorily the facts that were known to him.
  His evident eagerness to get into touch with Thorndyke made this pretty
  clear; and the two conclusions together suggested a further question. How
  much did Thorndyke know? Did he know all that the sergeant knew? Did he
  perchance know more? From the scanty data with which I had supplied him,
  might he possibly have drawn some illuminating inferences that had carried
  his understanding of the case beyond either mine or Cobbledick's? It was
  quite possible. Thorndyke's great reputation rested upon his extraordinary
  power of inference and constructive reasoning from apparently unilluminating
  facts. The facts in this case seemed unilluminating enough. But they might
  not be so to him. And again I recalled how both he and the sergeant seemed to
  look to the finding of the body as probably furnishing the solution of the
  mystery.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE PRINTS OF A VANISHED HAND</h3>

  <p>Mr. Bundy's opinion that no particular significance attached to the
  finding of further relics of the missing woman was one that I was myself
  disposed to adopt. The disappearance of poor Angelina was an undeniable fact,
  and there seemed to be no doubt that her body had fallen, or been cast, into
  the river. On these facts, the recovery of further articles belonging to her,
  and presumably detached from the body, shed no additional light. From the
  body itself, whenever it should be surrendered by the river, one hoped that
  something fresh might be learned. But all that anyone could say was that
  Angelina Frood had disappeared, that her disappearance was almost certainly
  connected with a crime, and that the agents of that crime and their motives
  for committing it were alike an impenetrable mystery, a mystery that the
  finding of further detached articles tended in no way to solve.</p>

  <p>I shall, therefore, pass somewhat lightly over the incidents of the
  succeeding discoveries, notwithstanding the keen interest in them displayed
  by Sergeant Cobbledick and even by Thorndyke. On Monday, the 25th of May, the
  second shoe was found (to Israel Bangs' unspeakable indignation) by Samuel
  Hooper of Foul Anchor Alley, who discovered it shortly after high-water,
  lying on the gridiron close to Gas-house Point, and brought it in triumph to
  the police station.</p>

  <p>After this, there followed a long interval, occupied by a feverish contest
  between Israel Bangs and Samuel Hooper. But the luck fell to the experienced
  Israel. On Saturday, the 20th of June, that investigator, having grounded his
  boat below a wharf between Gas-house Point and the bridge, discovered a
  silver-headed hat-pin lying on the shore between two of the piles of the
  wharf. Its identity was unmistakable. The silver poppy-head that crowned the
  pin was no trade production that might have had thousands of
  indistinguishable fellows. It was an individual work wrought by an artist in
  metal, and excepting its fellow, there was probably not another like it in
  the world.</p>

  <p>The discovery of this object roused a positive frenzy of search. The
  stretch of muddy shore between Gas-house Point and the bridge literally
  swarmed with human shore-rats, male and female, adult and juvenile. Every
  day, and all the day, excepting at high-water, Israel Bangs hovered in his
  oozy little basket of a boat on the extreme edge of the mud, scanning every
  inch of slime, and glowering fiercely at the poachers ashore who were raking
  over his preserves. But nothing came of it. Day after day passed. The black
  and odorous mud was churned up by countless feet; the pebbles were sorted out
  severally by innumerable filthy hands; every derelict pot, pan, box, or
  meat-tin was picked up again and again, and explored to its inmost recesses.
  But in vain. Not a single relic of any kind was brought to light by' all
  those searchings and grubbings in the mud. Presently the searchers began to
  grow discouraged. Some of them gave up the search; others migrated to the
  shore beyond the bridge, and were to be seen wading in the mud below the
  Esplanade, the cricket-ground, or the boat-building yards. So the month of
  June ran out, and the third month began. And still there was no sign of the
  body.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile I watched the two professional investigators, and noted a
  certain similarity in their outlook and methods. Both were keenly interested
  in the discoveries; and both, I observed, personally examined the localities
  of the finds. The sergeant conducted me to each spot in turn, making
  appropriate, but not very illuminating, comments; and I perceived that he was
  keeping a careful account of time and place. So, too, with Thorndyke, who had
  now taken to coming down regularly each week-end. He visited each spot where
  anything had been found, marking it carefully on his map, together with a
  reference number, and inquiring minutely as to the character of the object,
  its condition, and the state of the tide and the hour of the day when it was
  discovered; all of which particulars he entered in his note-book under the
  appropriate reference number.</p>

  <p>Both of my friends, too, expressed increasing surprise and uneasiness at
  the non-appearance of the body. The sergeant was really worried, and he
  expressed his sentiments in a tone of complaint as if he felt that he was not
  being fairly treated.</p>

  <p>"It's getting very serious, Doctor," he protested.</p>

  <p>"Nearly three months gone&mdash;three summer months, mind you&mdash;and
  not a sign of it. I don't like the look of things at all. This case means a
  lot to me. It's my chance. It's a detective-inspector's job, and if I bring
  it off it'll be a big feather in my cap. I want to get a conviction, and so
  far I haven't got the material for a coroner's verdict. I've half a mind to
  do a bit of creeping myself."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's observations on the case were much to the same effect.
  Discussing it one Saturday afternoon at the beginning of July, when I had met
  him at Strood Station and was walking with him into Rochester, he said:</p>

  <p>"My feeling is that the crux of this case is going to be the question of
  identity&mdash;if the body ever comes to light. Of course, if it doesn't,
  there is no case: it is simply an unexplained disappearance. But if the body
  is found and is unrecognizable excepting by clothing and other extrinsic
  evidence, it will be hard to get a conviction even if the unrecognizable
  corpse should give some clue to the circumstances of death."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said I, "the police are searching for Nicholas Frood."</p>

  <p>"I doubt it," he replied. "They are not likely to be wasting efforts to
  find a murderer when there is no evidence that a murder has been committed.
  What could they do if they did find him? The woman was not in his custody or
  even living with him. And his previous conduct is not relevant in the absence
  of evidence of his wife's death."</p>

  <p>"You said you were making some inquiries yourself."</p>

  <p>"So I am. And I am not without hopes of picking up his tracks. But that is
  a secondary matter. What we have to settle beyond the shadow of a doubt is
  the question, 'What has become of Angelina Frood? Is she dead' And, if she
  is, what was the cause and what were the circumstances of her death?' The
  evidence in our possession points to the conclusion that she is dead, and
  that she met her death by foul means. That is the belief that the known facts
  produce. But we have got to turn that belief into certainty. Then it will be
  time to inquire as to the identity of the criminal."</p>

  <p>"Do you suppose the body would be unrecognizable now?"</p>

  <p>"I feel no doubt that it would be quite unrecognizable by ordinary means
  if it has been in the water all this time. But it would still be identifiable
  in the scientific sense, if we could only obtain the necessary data. It
  could, for instance, be tested by the Bertillon measurements, if we had them;
  and it would probably yield finger-prints, clear enough to recognize, long
  after the disappearance of all facial character or bodily traits."</p>

  <p>"Would it really?" I exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he replied. "Even if the whole outer skin of the hand had
  come off bodily, like a glove, as it commonly does in long-submerged bodies,
  that glove-like cast would yield fairly clear finger-prints if property
  treated&mdash;with dilute formalin, for instance. And then the fingers from
  which the outer skin had become detached would still yield recognizable
  finger-prints, if similarly treated; for you must remember that the papillary
  ridges which form the finger-print pattern, are in the true skin. The outer
  skin is merely moulded on them. But, unfortunately, the question is one of
  merely academic interest to us as we have no original finger-prints of Mrs.
  Frood's by which to test the body. The only method of scientific
  identification that seems to be available is that of anthropometric
  measurements, as employed by Bertillon."</p>

  <p>"But," I objected, "the Bertillon system is based on the existence of a
  record of the measurements of the person to be identified. We have no record
  of the measurements of Mrs. Frood."</p>

  <p>"True," he agreed. "But you may remember that Dr. George Bertillon was
  accustomed to apply his system, not only to suspected persons who had been
  arrested, but also to stray garments, hat, gloves, shoes, and so forth, that
  came into the possession of the police. But it is clear that, if such
  garments can be compared with a table of recorded measurements, they can be
  used as standards of comparison to determine the identity of a dead body. Of
  course, the measurements would have to be taken, both of the garments and of
  the body, by someone having an expert knowledge of anthropometrical
  methods."</p>

  <p>"Of course," I agreed. "But it seems a sound method. I must mention it to
  Cobbledick. He has the undoubted shoes, and I have no doubt that he could get
  a supply of worn garments from Mrs. Gillow."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke. "And, speaking of Mrs. Gillow reminds me of another
  point that I have been intending to inquire into. You mentioned to me that
  Mrs. Gillow told you, at the time of the disappearance, that she had been
  expecting a tragedy of some kind. She must have had some grounds for that
  expectation."</p>

  <p>"She said it was nothing but a vague, general impression."</p>

  <p>"Still, there must have been something that gave her that impression.
  Don't you think it would be well to question her a little more closely?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it might," said I, not very enthusiastically. "We are close to
  the house now. We can call in and see her, if you like."</p>

  <p>"I think we ought to leave no stone unturned," said he; and a minute or
  two later, when we arrived opposite the office, he remarked, looking across
  attentively at the two houses: "I don't see our friend Bundy's face at the
  window."</p>

  <p>"No," I replied, "he is playing tennis somewhere up at the Vines. But here
  is Mrs. Gillow, herself, all dressed up and evidently going out
  visiting."</p>

  <p>The landlady had appeared at the door just as we were crossing the road.
  Perceiving that we were bearing down on her, she paused, holding the door
  ajar. I ran up the steps, and having wished her "good afternoon" asked if she
  had time to answer one or two questions.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," she replied, "though I mustn't stay long because I have
  promised to go to tea with my sister at Frinsbury. I usually go there on a
  Saturday. Perhaps we had better go into poor Mrs. Frood's room."</p>

  <p>She opened the door of the sitting-room, and we all went in and sat
  down.</p>

  <p>"I have been talking over this mysterious affair, Mrs. Gillow," said I,
  "with my friend, Dr. Thorndyke, who is a lawyer, and he suggested that you
  might be able to throw some light on it. You remember that you had had some
  forebodings of some sort of trouble or disaster."</p>

  <p>"I had," she replied, dismally, "but that was only because she always
  seemed so worried and depressed, poor dear. And, of course, I knew about that
  good-for-nothing husband of hers. That was all. Sergeant Cobbledick asked me
  the same question, but I had nothing to tell him."</p>

  <p>"Did the sergeant examine the rooms?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he looked over the place, and he opened her little
  davenport&mdash;it isn't locked&mdash;and read through one or two letters
  that he found there, but he didn't take them away. All he took with him was a
  few torn-up letters that he found in the waste-paper basket."</p>

  <p>"If those other letters are still in the davenport," said Thorndyke, "I
  think it would be well for us to look through them carefully, if you don't
  mind, Mrs. Gillow."</p>

  <p>"I don't see that there could be any harm in it," she replied. "I've never
  touched anything in her rooms, myself, since she went away. I thought it
  better not to. I haven't even washed up her tea-things. There they are, just
  as she left them, poor lamb. But if you are going to look through those
  letters, I will ask you to excuse me, or I shall keep my sister waiting for
  tea."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Mrs. Gillow," said I. "Don't let us detain you. And, by the
  way," I added, as I walked with her to the door, "it would be as well not to
  say anything to anybody about my having come here with my friend."</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir," she replied. "I think you are right. The least said, the
  soonest mended"; and with this profound generalization she went out and I
  shut the street door after her.</p>

  <p>When I returned to the sitting-room I found Thorndyke engaged in a minute
  examination of the tea-things, and in particular of the spoon. I proceeded at
  once to the davenport, and, finding it unlocked, lifted the desk-lid and
  peered into the interior. It contained a supply of papers and envelopes,
  neatly stacked, and one or two letters, which I took out. They all appeared
  to be from the same person&mdash;the Miss Cumbers, of whom I had
  heard&mdash;and a rapid glance at the contents showed that they were of no
  use as a source of information. I passed them to Thorndyke&mdash;who had laid
  down the spoon and was now looking inquisitively about the room&mdash;who
  scanned them rapidly and returned them to me.</p>

  <p>"There is nothing in them," said he. "Possibly the contents of the
  waste-paper basket were more illuminating. But I suspect not, as the sergeant
  appears to be as much in the dark as we are. Shall we have a look at the
  bedroom before we go?"</p>

  <p>I saw no particular reason for doing so, but, assuming that he knew best,
  I made no objection. Going out into the hall, we entered the deserted
  bed-room, the door of which was locked, though the key had not been removed.
  At the threshold Thorndyke paused and stood for nearly half a minute looking
  about the room in the same queer, inquisitive way that I had noticed in the
  other room, as if he were trying to fix a mental picture of it. Meanwhile,
  full of the Bertillon system, I had walked across to the wardrobe to see what
  garments were available for measurement. I had my hand on the knob of the
  door when my glance fell on two objects on the dressing-table; an empty
  tumbler and a small water-bottle, half-full. There was nothing very
  remarkable about these objects, taken by themselves, but, even from where I
  stood, I could see that both bore a number of finger-marks which stood out
  conspicuously on the plain glass.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" I exclaimed. "Here is the very thing that you were speaking of.
  Do you see what it is?"</p>

  <p>Apparently he had, for he had already taken his gloves out of his pocket
  and was putting them on.</p>

  <p>"Don't touch them, Strangeways," said he, as I was approaching to inspect
  them more closely. "If these are Mrs. Frood's finger-prints they may be
  invaluable. We mustn't confuse them by adding our own."</p>

  <p>"Whose else could they be?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"They might be Sergeant Cobbledick's," he replied. "The sergeant has been
  in here." He drew a chair up to the table, and, taking a lens from his
  pocket, began systematically to examine the markings.</p>

  <p>"They are a remarkably fine set," he remarked, "and a complete
  set&mdash;the whole ten digits. Whoever made them held the bottle in the
  right hand and the tumbler in the left. And I don't think they are the
  sergeant's. They are too small and too clear and delicate."</p>

  <p>"No," I agreed, "and the probabilities are against their being his. There
  is no reason why he should have wanted to take a drink of water during the
  few minutes that he spent here. It would have been different if it had been a
  beer bottle. But it would have been quite natural for Mrs. Frood to drink a
  glass of water while she was dressing or before she started out."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said he. "Those are the obvious probabilities. But we must turn
  them into certainties if we can. Probabilities are not good data to work
  from. But the question is now, what are we to do? I have a small camera with
  me, but it would not be very convenient to take the photographs here, and it
  would occupy a good deal of time. On the other hand, these things would be
  difficult to pack without smearing the finger-prints. We want a couple of
  small boxes."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," said I, "we may find something that will do if we take a look
  round."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he agreed, "we must explore the place. Meanwhile, I think I will
  develop up these prints for our immediate information, as we have to try to
  find some others to verify them."</p>

  <p>He went back to the sitting-room, where he had put down the two cases that
  he always brought with him: a small suit-case that contained his toilet
  necessaries and a similar-sized case covered with green canvas which had been
  rather a mystery to me. I had never seen it open, and had occasionally
  speculated on the nature of its contents. My curiosity was now to be
  satisfied, for, when he returned with it in his hand he explained: "This is
  what I call my research-case. It contains the materials and appliances for
  nearly every kind of medico-legal investigation, and I hardly ever travel
  without it."</p>

  <p>He placed it on a chair and opened it, when I saw that it formed a
  complete portable laboratory, containing, among other things a diminutive
  microscope, a little folding camera, and an insufflator, or powder-spray. The
  latter he now took from its compartment, and, lifting the tumbler with his
  gloved hand, stood it on a corner of the mantelpiece and blew over it with
  the insufflator a cloud of impalpably fine white powder, which settled evenly
  on the surface of the glass. He then tapped the tumbler gently once or twice
  with a lead pencil, when most of the powder coating either jarred off or
  crept down the surface. Finally, he blew at it lightly, which removed the
  rest of the powder, leaving the finger-prints standing out on the clear glass
  as if they had been painted on with Chinese white.</p>

  <p>While he was operating in the same manner on the water-bottle&mdash;having
  first emptied it into the ewer&mdash;I examined the tumbler with the aid of
  his lens. The markings were amazingly clear and distinct. Through the lens I
  could see, not only the whole of the curious, complicated ridge-pattern, but
  even the rows of little round spots that marked the orifices of the sweat
  glands. For the first time, I realized what a perfect means of identification
  these remarkable imprints furnished.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Thorndyke, when he had finished with the bottle, "the two
  questions are, where shall we look for confirmatory finger-prints, and where
  are we to get the boxes that we want for packing these things? You said that
  Mrs. Frood had a kitchen."</p>

  <p>"Yes. But won't you try the furniture here; the wardrobe door, for
  instance. The dark, polished mahogany ought to give good prints."</p>

  <p>"An excellent suggestion, Strangeways," said he. "We might even find the
  sergeant's finger-prints, as he has probably had the wardrobe open."</p>

  <p>He sprayed the three doors of the wardrobe, and when he had tapped them
  and blown away the surplus powder, there appeared near the edge of each a
  number of finger-marks, mostly rather indistinct, and none of them nearly so
  clear as those on the glass.</p>

  <p>"This is very satisfactory," said Thorndyke. "They are poor prints, but
  you can see quite plainly that there are two pairs of hands, one pair much
  larger than the other; and the prints of the larger hands are evidently not
  the same pattern as those on the glass, whereas those of the smaller ones are
  quite recognizable as the same, in spite of their indistinctness. As the
  large ones are almost certainly Cobbledick's, the small ones are pretty
  certainly Mrs. Frood's. But we mustn't take anything for granted. Let us go
  down to the kitchen. We shall have a better chance there."</p>

  <p>The door of the basement staircase was still unlocked, as Mrs. Gillow had
  described it. I threw it open, and we descended together, I carrying the
  insufflator and he bearing the tumbler and bottle in his gloved hands. When
  he had put the two articles down on the kitchen table, he proceeded to powder
  first the kitchen door and then the side-door that gave on to the passage
  between the two houses. Both of them were painted a dark green and both
  yielded obvious finger-marks, and though these were mere oval smudges, devoid
  of any trace of pattern, their size and their groupings showed clearly enough
  that they appertained to a small hand. But we got more conclusive
  confirmation from a small aluminium frying-pan that had been left on the gas
  stove; for, on powdering the handle, Thorndyke brought into view a remarkably
  clear thumbprint, which was obviously identical with that on the
  water-bottle.</p>

  <p>"I think," said he, "that settles the question. If Mrs. Gillow has not
  touched anything in these premises&mdash;as she assures us that she has
  not&mdash;then we can safely assume that these are Mrs. Frood's
  finger-prints."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to annex the frying-pan to produce in evidence?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "This verification is for our own information: to secure
  us against the chance of producing Cobbledick's finger-prints to identify the
  body. I propose, for the present, to say nothing to anyone as to our
  possessing this knowledge. When the time comes we can tell what we know.
  Until then we shall keep our own counsel."</p>

  <p>Once more I found myself dimly surprised at my friend's apparently
  unnecessary secrecy, but, assuming that he knew best, I made no comment, but
  watched with somewhat puzzled curiosity his further proceedings. His interest
  in the place was extraordinary. In a queer, catlike fashion he prowled about
  the premises, examining the most trivial objects with almost ludicrous
  attention. He went carefully through the cooking appliances and the glass and
  china; he peered into cupboards, particularly into a large, deep cupboard in
  which spare crockery was stored, and which was, oddly enough, provided with a
  Yale lock; he sorted out the meagre contents of the refuse-bin, and
  incidentally salved from it a couple of cardboard boxes that had originally
  contained groceries, and he explored the, now somewhat unsavoury, larder.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said reflectively, "the dustman must have used the side
  door. Do you happen to know?"</p>

  <p>"I don't," said I, inwardly wondering what the deuce the dustman had to do
  with the case. "I understand that the door of the passage was not used."</p>

  <p>"But she couldn't have had the dust-bin carried up the stairs and out at
  the front door," he objected.</p>

  <p>"I should think not," said I. "Perhaps we could judge better if we had a
  look at the passage."</p>

  <p>He adopted the suggestion and we opened the side-door&mdash;which had a
  Yale night-latch&mdash;and went out into the covered passage that was common
  to the two houses. The door that opened on to the street was bolted on the
  inside, but the bolts were in good working order, as we ascertained by
  drawing them gently; so this gave no evidence one way or the other. Then
  Thorndyke carefully examined the hard gravel floor of the passage, apparently
  searching for dropped fragments, or the dustman's foot-prints; but though
  there were traces suggesting that the side-doors had been used, there were no
  perceptible tracks leading to the street or in any way specifically
  suggestive of dustmen.</p>

  <p>"Japp seems fond of Yale locks," observed Thorndyke, indicating the second
  side-door, which was also fitted with one. "I wonder where he keeps his
  dust-bin."</p>

  <p>"Would it be worth while to ask him?" said I, more and more mystified by
  this extraordinary investigation.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, very definitely. "A question often gives more
  information than it elicits."</p>

  <p>"It might easily do that in my case," I remarked with a grin; upon which
  he laughed softly and led the way back into the house. There I gathered up
  the two boxes and the insufflator and made my way up to the bed-room, he
  following with the tumbler and the water-bottle. Then came the critical
  business of packing these two precious objects in the boxes in such a way as
  to protect the finger-prints from contact with the sides; which was
  accomplished very neatly with the aid of a number of balls or plasticine from
  the inexhaustible research-case.</p>

  <p>"This is a little disappointing," said Thorndyke, looking at the
  hair-brush and comb as he took off his gloves. "I had hoped to collect a
  useful sample of hair. But her excessive tidiness defeats us. There seems to
  be only one or two short hairs and one full length. However, we may as well
  have them. They won't be of much use for comparison with the naked eye, but
  even a single hair can be used as a colour control under the microscope."</p>

  <p>He combed the brush until the last hair was extracted from it, and then
  drew the little collection from the comb and arranged it on a sheet of paper.
  There were six short hairs, from two to four inches long, and one long hair,
  which seemed to have been broken off, as it had no bulb.</p>

  <p>"Many ladies keep a combing-bag," he remarked, as; he bestowed the
  collection in a seed-envelope from the: research-case; "but I gather from
  your description that Mrs. Frood's hair was luxuriant enough to render that
  economy unnecessary. At any rate, there doesn't seem to be such a bag. And
  now I think we have finished, and we haven't done so badly."</p>

  <p>"We have certainly got an excellent set of fingerprints," said I. "But it
  seems rather doubtful whether there will ever be an opportunity of using
  them; and if there isn't, we shan't be much more forward for our exploration.
  Of course, there is the hair."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke, "there is the hair. That may be quite valuable. And
  perhaps there are some other matters&mdash;but time will show."</p>

  <p>With this somewhat cryptic conclusion he proceeded with great care to pack
  the two boxes in his suit-case, wedging them with his pyjamas so that they
  should not get shaken in transit.</p>

  <p>As we walked home I reflected on Thorndyke's last remark. It seemed to
  contain a suggestion that the mystery of Angelina's death was not so complete
  to him as it was to me. For my own part, I could see no glimmer of light in
  any direction. She seemed to have vanished without leaving a trace excepting
  those few derelict objects which had been washed ashore and which told us
  nothing. But was it possible that those objects bore some significance that I
  had overlooked? That they were charged with some message that I had failed to
  decipher? I recalled a certain reticence on the part of Cobbledick which had
  made me suspect him of concealing from me some knowledge that he held or some
  inferences that he had drawn; and now there was this cryptic remark of
  Thorndyke's, offering the same suggestion. Might it possibly be that the
  profound obscurity was only in my own mind, the product of my inexperience,
  and that to these skilled investigators the problem presented a more
  intelligible aspect? It might easily be. I determined cautiously to approach
  the question.</p>

  <p>"You seemed," said I, "to imply, just now, that there are certain data for
  forming hypotheses as to the solution of this mystery that envelops the
  disappearance of Mrs. Frood. But I am not aware of any such data. Are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Your question, Strangeways," he replied, "turns on the meaning of the
  word 'aware.' If two men, one literate and the other illiterate, look at a
  page of a printed book, both may be said to be aware of it; that is to say
  that in both it produces a retinal image which makes them conscious of it as
  a visible object having certain optical properties. In the case of the
  illiterate man the perception of the optical properties is the total effect.
  But the literate man has something in his consciousness already, and this
  something combines, as it were, with the optical perception, and makes him
  aware of certain secondary properties of the printed characters. To both, the
  page yields a visual impression; but to one only does it yield what we may
  call a psychical impression. Are they both aware of the page?"</p>

  <p>"I appreciate your point," said I, with a sour smile, "and I seem to be
  aware of a rather skilful evasion of my question."</p>

  <p>He smiled in his turn and rejoined: "Your question was a little indirect.
  Shall we have it in a more direct form?"</p>

  <p>"What I wanted to know," said I, "though I suppose I have no right to ask,
  is whether there appears to you to be any prospect whatever of finding any
  solution of the mystery of Mrs. Frood's death."</p>

  <p>"The answer to that question," he replied, "is furnished by my own
  proceedings. I am not a communicative man, as you may have noticed, but I
  will say this much: that I have taken, and am taking, a good deal of trouble
  with this case, and am prepared to take more, and that I do not usually waste
  my efforts on problems that appear to be unsolvable. I am not disposed to say
  more than that, excepting to refer you again to the instance of the printed
  page and to remind you that whatever I know I have either learned from you or
  from the observation, in your company, of objects equally visible to both of
  us."</p>

  <p>This reply, if not very illuminating, at least answered my question, as it
  conveyed to me that I was not likely to get much more information out of my
  secretive friend. Nevertheless, I asked: "About the man Frood: you were
  saying that you had some hopes of running him to earth."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have made a start. I have ascertained that he did apparently set
  out for Brighton the day before Mrs. Frood's disappearance, but he never
  arrived there. That is all I know at present. He was seen getting into the
  Brighton train, but he did not appear at the Brighton barrier&mdash;my
  informant had the curiosity to watch all the passengers go through&mdash;and
  he never made the visit which was the ostensible object of his journey. So he
  must have got out at an intermediate station. It may he difficult to trace
  him, but I am not without hope of succeeding eventually. Obviously, his
  whereabouts on the fatal day is a matter that has to be settled. At present
  he is the obvious suspect; but if an alibi should be proved in his case, a
  search would have to be initiated in some other direction."</p>

  <p>This conversation brought us to my house in time to relieve Mrs. Dunk's
  anxieties on the subject of dinner; and as the daylight was already gone, the
  photographic operations were postponed until the following morning. Indeed,
  Thorndyke had thought of taking the objects to his chambers, where a more
  efficient outfit was available, but, on reflection, he decided to take the
  photographs in my presence so that I could, if necessary, attest their
  genuineness on oath. Accordingly, on the following morning, we very carefully
  extracted the tumbler and the bottle from their respective boxes and set them
  up, with a black coat of mine for a background, at the end of a table. Then
  Thorndyke produced his small folding camera&mdash;which pulled out to a
  surprising length&mdash;and, having fitted it with a short-focus objective,
  made the exposures, and developed the plates in a dark cupboard by the light
  of a little red lamp from the research case. When the plates were dry we
  inspected them through a lens, and found them microscopically sharp. Finally,
  at Thorndyke's suggestion, I scratched my initials with a needle in the
  corner of each plate.</p>

  <p>"Well," I said, when he had finished, "you have got the evidence that you
  wanted, and in a very complete form. It remains to be seen now whether you
  will ever get an opportunity to use it."</p>

  <p>"Don't be pessimistic, Strangeways," said he. "We have had exceptional
  luck in getting this splendid series of finger-prints. Let us hope that
  Fortune will not desert us after making us these gifts."</p>

  <p>"What is to be done with the originals?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Shall I put them back where we found them?"</p>

  <p>"I think not," he replied. "If you have a safe or a secure lock-up
  cupboard, where they could be put away, out of sight, and from whence they
  could be produced if necessary, I will ask you to take charge of them."</p>

  <p>There was a cupboard with a good lock in the old bureau that I had found
  in my bedroom, and to this I conveyed the precious objects and locked them
  in. And so ended&mdash;at least, for the present&mdash;the episode of our
  raid on poor Angelina's abode.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;THE DISCOVERY IN BLACK BOY-LANE</h3>

  <p>On a fine, sunny afternoon, about ten days after our raid on Angelina's
  rooms (it was Tuesday, the 14th of July, to be exact), I was sitting in my
  dining-room, from which the traces of lunch had just been removed, idly
  glancing over the paper, and considering the advisability of taking a walk,
  when I heard the door-bell ring. There was a short interval; then the door
  was opened, and the sounds of strife and wrangling that followed this
  phenomenon informed me that the visitor was Mr. Bundy, between whom and Mrs.
  Dunk there existed a state of chronic warfare. Presently the dining-room door
  opened&mdash;in time for me to catch a concluding growl of defiance from Mrs.
  Dunk&mdash;and that lady announced gruffly: "Mr. Bundy."</p>

  <p>My visitor tripped in smilingly, "all teeth and eyeglass," as his
  inveterate enemy had once expressed it, holding a Panama hat, which had
  temporarily superseded the velour.</p>

  <p>"Well, John," said he, "coming out to play?" He had lately taken to
  calling me John; in fact, a very close and pleasant intimacy had sprung up
  between us. It dated from the occasion when I had confided to him my
  unfortunate passion for poor Angelina. That confidence he had evidently taken
  as a great compliment, and the matter of it had struck a sympathetic chord in
  his kindly nature. From that moment there had been a sensible change in his
  manner towards me. Beneath his habitual flippancy there was an undertone of
  gentleness and sympathy, and even of affection. Nor had I been unresponsive.
  Like Thorndyke, I found in his sunny temperament, his invariable cheerfulness
  and high spirits, a communicable quality that took effect on my own state of
  mind. And then I had early recognized that, in spite of his apparent
  giddiness, Bundy was a man of excellent intelligence and considerable
  strength of character. So the friendship had ripened naturally enough.</p>

  <p>I rose from my chair and, dropping the paper, stretched myself. "You are
  an idle young dog," said I. "Why aren't you at work?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing doing at the office except some specifications. Japp is doing
  them. Come out and have a roll round."</p>

  <p>"Well, Jimmy," said I. "Your name is Jimmy, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"No, it is not," he replied with dignity. "I am called Peter&mdash;like
  the Bishop of Rumtifoo, and, by a curious coincidence, for the very same
  reason."</p>

  <p>"Let me see," said I, falling instantly into the trap, "what was that
  reason?"</p>

  <p>"Why, you see," he replied impressively, "the Bishop was called Peter
  because that was his name."</p>

  <p>"Look here, young fellow my lad," said I, "you'll get yourself into
  trouble if you come up here pulling your elder's legs."</p>

  <p>"It was only a gentle tweak, old chap," said he. "Besides, you aren't so
  blooming senile, after all. You are only cutting your first crop of whiskers.
  Are you coming out? I saw old Cobble dick just now, turning down Blue Boar
  Lane and looking as miserable as a wet cat."</p>

  <p>"What was he looking miserable about?"</p>

  <p>"The slump in relics, I expect. He is making no head way with his
  investigation. I fancy he had reckoned on getting an inspectorship out of
  this case, whereas, if he doesn't reach some sort of conclusion, he is likely
  to get his rapples knucked, as old Miss Barman would say. I suspect he was on
  his way to the Ark to confer with Mr. Noah. What do you say to a stroll in
  the direction of Mount Ararat?"</p>

  <p>It was a cunning suggestion on the part of Bundy, for it drew me
  instantly. Repulsive as old Israel's activities were to me, the presence of
  those finger-prints, securely locked up in my bureau, had created in me a
  fresh anxiety to see the first state of the investigation completed so that
  the search for the murderer could be commenced in earnest. Not that my
  presence would help the sergeant, but that I was eager to hear the tidings of
  any new discovery.</p>

  <p>Bundy's inference had been quite correct. We arrived at the head of the
  Blue Boar pier just in time to see the sergeant slowly descending the ladder,
  watched gloomily by Israel Bangs. As the former reached terra firma he turned
  round and then observed us.</p>

  <p>"Any news, Sergeant?" I asked, as he approached across the grass.</p>

  <p>He shook his head discontentedly. "No," he replied, "not a sign; not a
  vestige. It's a most mysterious affair. The things seemed to be coming up
  quite regularly until that hatpin was found. Then everything came to an end.
  Not a trace of anything for nigh upon a month. And what, in the name of
  Fortune, can have become of the body? That's what I can't make out. If this
  goes on much longer, there won't be any body: and then we shall be done. The
  case will have to be dropped."</p>

  <p>He took off his hat (he was in plain clothes as usual) and wiped his
  forehead, looking blankly first at me and then at Bundy. The latter also took
  off his hat and whisked out his handkerchief, bringing with it a little
  telescope which fell to the ground and was immediately picked up by the
  sergeant. "Neat little glass, this," he remarked, dusting it with his
  handkerchief. "It's lucky it fell on the turf." He took off the cap, and
  pulling out the tubes, peered vaguely through it up and down the river.
  Presently he handed it to me. "Look at those craft down below the dockyard,"
  said he.</p>

  <p>I took the little instrument from him and pointed it at the group of
  small, cutter-rigged vessels that he had indicated, of which the telescope,
  small as it was, gave a brilliantly sharp picture.</p>

  <p>"What are they?" I asked. "Oyster dredgers?"</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "They are bawleys with their shrimp-trawls down. But
  there are plenty of oyster dredgers in the lower river and out in the
  estuary, and what beats me is why none of them ever brings up anything in the
  trawls or dredges&mdash;anything in our line, I mean."</p>

  <p>"What did you expect them to bring up?" Bundy asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, there are the things that have washed ashore, and there are the
  other things that haven't washed ashore yet. And then there is the body."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Noah would have something to say if they brought that up," said
  Bundy. "By the way, what had he got to say when you called on him?"</p>

  <p>"Old Bangs? Why he is getting a bit shirty. Wants me to pay him for all
  the time he has lost on creeping and searching. Of course, I can't do that, I
  didn't employ him."</p>

  <p>"Did he find the hat-pin that you spoke of?" Bundy asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes; and he has been grubbing round the place where he found it ever
  since, as if he thought hat-pins grew there."</p>

  <p>"Still," said Bundy, "it is not so unreasonable. A hatpin couldn't have
  floated ashore. If the hat came off, the two hat-pins must have fallen out at
  pretty much the same time and place."</p>

  <p>"Yes," the sergeant agreed, reflectively, "that seems to be common sense;
  and, if it is, the other hat-pin ought to be lying somewhere close by. I must
  go and have a look there myself." He again reflected for a few moments and
  then asked: "Would you like to see the place where Israel found the pin?"</p>

  <p>As I had seen the place already and had shown it to Thorndyke, I left
  Bundy to answer.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he assented, rather, I suspected, to humour the sergeant than
  because he felt any particular interest in the place. Thereupon Cobbledick,
  whose enthusiasm appeared to have been revived by Bundy's remark, led the way
  briskly towards the wilderness by the coal-wharves, through that desolate
  region and along a cart-track that skirted the marshes until we came out into
  a sort of lesser wilderness to the west of Gas-House Road. Here the sergeant
  slipped through a large hole in a corrugated iron fence which gave access to
  a wharf littered with the unpresentable debris resulting from the activities
  of a firm of ship-knackers. Advancing to the edge of the wharf, Cobbledick
  stood for a while looking down wistfully at the expanse of unspeakable mud
  that the receding tide had uncovered.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is too dirty to go down," he said in a regretful tone.</p>

  <p>Bundy's assent to this proposition was most emphatic and unqualified, and
  the sergeant had to content himself with a bird's-eye view. But he made a
  very thorough inspection, walking along the edge of the wharf, scrutinizing
  its base, pile by pile, and giving separate attention to each pot, tin, or
  scrap of driftwood on the slimy surface. He even borrowed Bundy's telescope
  to enable him to examine the more distant parts of the mud, until the owner
  of the instrument was reduced to the necessity of standing behind him, for
  politeness' sake, to get a comfortable yawn.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cobbledick, at long last, handing back the telescope, "I
  suppose we must give it up. But it's disappointing."</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see why," said Bundy. "You have found enough to prove that
  the body is in the river, and no number of further relics would prove any
  more."</p>

  <p>"No, there's some truth in that," Cobbledick agreed. "But I don't like the
  way that everything seems to have come to a stop." He crawled dejectedly
  through the hole in the fence and walked on for a minute or two without
  speaking. Presently he halted and looked about him. "I suppose Black Boy-lane
  will be our best way," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Which is Black Boy-lane?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"It is the lane we came down after we left Japp and Willard that day,"
  Bundy explained.</p>

  <p>"I remember," said I, "but I didn't know it had a name."</p>

  <p>"It was named after a little inn that used to stand somewhere near the
  top; but it was pulled down years ago. Here's the lane."</p>

  <p>We entered the little, tortuous alley that wound between the high, tarred
  fences, and as it was too narrow for us to walk abreast, Bundy dropped
  behind. A little way up the lane I noticed an old hat lying on the high grass
  at the foot of the fence. Bundy apparently noticed it, too, for just after we
  had passed it I heard the sound of a kick, and the hat flew over my shoulder.
  At the same moment, and impelled by the same kick, a small object, which I at
  first thought to be a pebble, hopped swiftly along the ground in front of us,
  then rolled a little way, and finally came to rest, when I saw that it was a
  button. I should probably have passed it without further notice, having no
  use for stray buttons. But the more thrifty sergeant stooped and picked it
  up; and the instant that he looked at it he stopped dead.</p>

  <p>"My God! Doctor," he exclaimed, holding it out towards me. "Look at
  this!"</p>

  <p>I took it from him, though I had recognized it at a glance. It was a small
  bronze button with a Tudor Rose embossed on it.</p>

  <p>"This is a most amazing thing," said Cobbledick.</p>

  <p>"There can't be any doubt as to what it is."</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest," I agreed. "It is certainly one of the buttons from
  Mrs. Frood's coat. The question is, how on earth did it get here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the sergeant, "that is the question; and a very difficult
  question, too."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you taking rather a lot for granted?" suggested Bundy, to whom I
  had passed the little object for inspection. "It doesn't do to jump at
  conclusions too much. Mrs. Frood isn't likely to have had her buttons made to
  order. She must have bought them somewhere. She might even have bought them
  in Rochester. In any case, there must be thousands of others like them."</p>

  <p>"I suppose there must be," I admitted, "though I have never seen any
  buttons like them."</p>

  <p>"Neither have I," said Cobbledick, "and I am going to stick to the obvious
  probabilities. The missing woman wore buttons like this, and I shall assume
  that this is one of her buttons unless someone can prove that it isn't."</p>

  <p>"But how do you account for one of her buttons being here?" Bundy
  objected.</p>

  <p>"I don't account for it," retorted Cobbledick. "It's a regular puzzle. Of
  course, someone&mdash;a child, for instance&mdash;might have picked it up on
  the shore and dropped it here. But that is a mere guess, and not a very
  likely one. The obvious thing to do is to search this lane thoroughly and see
  if there are any other traces; and that is what I am going to do now. But
  don't let me detain you two gentlemen if you had rather not stay."</p>

  <p>"I shall certainly stay and help you, Sergeant," said I; and Bundy,
  assuming the virtue of enthusiasm, if he had it not, elected also to stay and
  join in the search.</p>

  <p>"We had better go back to the bottom of the lane," said Cobbledick, "and
  go through the grass at the foot of the fence from end to end. I will take
  the right hand side and you take the left."</p>

  <p>We retraced our steps to the bottom of the lane and began a systematic
  search, turning over the grass and weeds and exposing the earth inch by inch.
  It was a slow process and would have appeared a singular proceeding had any
  wayfarer passed through and observed us, but fortunately it was an
  unfrequented place, and no one came to spy upon us. We had traversed nearly
  half the lane when Bundy stood up and stretched himself. "I don't know what
  your back is made of, John," said he. "Mine feels as if it was made of broken
  bottles. How much more have we got to do?"</p>

  <p>"We haven't done half yet," I replied, also standing up and rubbing my
  lumbar region; and at this moment the sergeant, who was a few yards ahead,
  hailed us with a triumphant shout. We both turned quickly and beheld him
  standing with one arm raised aloft and the hand grasping a silver-topped
  hat-pin.</p>

  <p>"What do you say to that, Mr. Bundy?" he demanded as we hurried forward to
  examine the new "find." 'Shall we be jumping at conclusions if we say that
  this hat-pin is Mrs. Frood's?"</p>

  <p>"No," Bundy admitted after a glance at the silver poppy-head. "This seems
  quite distinctive, and, of course, it confirms the button. But I don't
  understand it in the least. How can they have come here?"</p>

  <p>"We won't go into that," said the sergeant, in a tone of suppressed
  excitement that showed me pretty clearly that he had already gone into it.
  "They are here. And now the question arises, what became of the hat? It
  couldn't have dropped off down at the wharf, or this hat-pin wouldn't be
  here; but it must have fallen off when both hat-pins were gone. Now what can
  have become of it?"</p>

  <p>"It might have been picked up and taken possession of by some woman," I
  suggested. "It was a good hat, and if the body was brought here soon after
  the crime, as it must have been, it wouldn't have been much damaged. But why
  trouble about the hat? Appearances suggest that the body was either brought
  up or taken down this lane. That is the new and astonishing fact that needs
  explaining."</p>

  <p>"We don't want to do any explaining now," said Cobbledick. "We are here to
  collect facts. If we can find out what became of the hat, that may help us
  when we come to consider the explanations."</p>

  <p>"Well, it obviously isn't here," said I.</p>

  <p>"No," he agreed, "and it wouldn't have been left here. A murderer mightn't
  have noticed the button, or even the hat-pin, on a dark, foggy night. But
  he'd have noticed the hat; and he wouldn't have left it where it must have
  been seen, and probably led to inquiries. He might have taken it with him, or
  he might have got rid of it. I should say he would have got rid of it. What
  is on the other side of these fences?"</p>

  <p>We all hitched ourselves up the respective fences far enough to look over.
  On the one side was a space of bare, gravelly ground with thin patches of
  grass and numerous heaps of cinder; on the other was an area of old waste
  land thickly covered with thistles, ragwort, and other weeds. The sergeant
  elected to begin with the latter, as the less frequented and therefore more
  probably undisturbed. Setting his foot on the buttress of a post, he went
  over the fence with surprising agility, considering his figure, and was lost
  to view; but we could hear him raking about among the herbage close to the
  fence, and from time to time I stood on the buttress and was able to witness
  his proceedings. First he went to the bottom of the lane and from that point
  returned by the fence, searching eagerly among the high weeds. I saw him thus
  proceed, apparently to the top of the lane in the neighbourhood of the
  remains of the city wall. Thence he came back, but now at a greater distance
  from the fence, and as he was still eagerly peering and probing amongst the
  weeds, it was evident that he had had no success. Suddenly, when he was but a
  few yards away, he uttered an exclamation and ran forward. Then I saw him
  stoop, and the next moment he fairly ran towards me holding the unmistakable
  brown straw hat with the dull green ribbon.</p>

  <p>"That tells us what we wanted to know," he said breathlessly, handing the
  hat to me as he climbed over the fence; "at least, I think it does. I'll tell
  you what I mean&mdash;but not now," he added in a lower tone, though not
  unheard by Bundy, as I inferred later.</p>

  <p>"I suppose we need hardly go on with the search any further?" I suggested,
  having had enough of groping amongst the grass.</p>

  <p>"Well, no," he replied. "I shall go over it again later on, but we've got
  enough to think about for the present. By the way, Mr. Bundy, I've found
  something belonging to you. Isn't this your property?"</p>

  <p>He produced from his pocket a largish key, to which was attached a wooden
  label legibly inscribed "Japp and Bundy, High-street, Rochester."</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" exclaimed Bundy, "it is Japp's precious key! Where on earth did
  you find it, Sergeant?"</p>

  <p>"Right up at the top," was the reply. "Close to the old wall."</p>

  <p>"Now, I wonder how the deuce it got there," said Bundy. "Some fool must
  have thrown it over the fence from pure mischief. However, here it is. You
  know there was a reward of ten shillings for finding it, Sergeant. I had
  better settle up at once. You needn't make any difficulties about it," he
  added, as the sergeant seemed disposed to decline the payment. "It won't come
  out of my pocket. It is the firm's business."</p>

  <p>On this understanding Cobbledick pocketed the proffered note and we walked
  on up the lane, the sergeant slightly embarrassed, as we approached the town,
  by the palpably unconcealable hat. Very little was said by any of us, for
  these new discoveries, with the amazing inferences that they suggested, gave
  us all abundant material for thought. The sergeant walked with eyes bent on
  the ground, evidently cogitating profoundly; my mind surged with new
  speculations and hypotheses, while Bundy, if not similarly preoccupied,
  refrained from breaking in on our meditations.</p>

  <p>When, at length, by devious ways, we reached the Highstreet in the
  neighbourhood of the Corn Exchange, we halted, and the sergeant looked at me
  as if framing a question. Bundy glanced up at the quaint old clock, and
  remarked:</p>

  <p>"It is about time I got back to the office. Mustn't leave poor old Japp to
  do all the work, though he never grumbles. So I will leave you here."</p>

  <p>I realized that this was only a polite excuse to enable the sergeant to
  have a few words with me alone, and I accepted it as such.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, then," said I, "if you must be off, and in case I don't see you
  before, I shall expect you to dinner on Saturday if you've got the evening
  free. Dr. Thorndyke is coming down for the week-end, and I know you enjoy
  ragging him."</p>

  <p>"He is pretty difficult to get a rise out of, all the same," said Bundy,
  brightening up perceptibly at the invitation. "But I shall turn up with very
  great pleasure." He bestowed a mock ceremonious salute on me and the
  sergeant, and, turning away, bustled off in the direction of the office. As
  soon as he was out of earshot Cobbledick opened the subject of the new
  discoveries.</p>

  <p>"This is an extraordinary development of our case, Doctor," said he. "I
  didn't want to discuss it before Mr. Bundy, though he is really quite a
  discreet gentleman, and pretty much on the spot, too. But he isn't a party to
  the case, and it is better not to talk too freely. You see the points that
  these fresh finds raise?"</p>

  <p>"I see that they put a new complexion on the affair, but to me they only
  make the mystery deeper and more incomprehensible."</p>

  <p>"In a way they do," Cobbledick agreed, "but, on the other hand, they put
  the case on a more satisfactory footing. For instance, we understand now why
  the body has never come to light. It was never in the river at all. Then as
  to the perpetrator; he was a local man&mdash;or, at least, there was a local
  man in it; a man who knew the town and the waterside neighbourhood
  thoroughly. No stranger would have found Black Boy-lane. Very few Rochester
  people know it."</p>

  <p>"But," I asked, "what does the finding of these things suggest to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Well," he replied, "it suggests several questions. Let me just put these
  things away in my office, and then we can talk the matter over." He went into
  his office, and shortly returned relieved&mdash;very much relieved&mdash;of
  the conspicuous hat. We turned towards the bridge, and he resumed: "The first
  question and the most important one is, which way was the body travelling? It
  is obvious that it was carried through Black Boy-lane. But in which
  direction? Towards the town or towards the river? When you think of the
  circumstances; when you recall that it was a foggy night when she
  disappeared; it seems at first more probable that the crime might have been
  committed in, or near, the lane, and the body carried down to the river. But
  when you consider all the facts, that doesn't seem possible. There is that
  box of tablets, picked up dry and clean on Chatham Hard. That seems to fix
  the locality where the crime occurred."</p>

  <p>"And there is the brooch," said I.</p>

  <p>"I don't attach much importance to that," he replied. "It might have been
  picked up anywhere. But the box of tablets couldn't have got from Black
  Boy-lane to Chatham except by the river, and it hadn't been in the river. But
  the hat seems to me to settle the question. You see, one hat-pin was found on
  the shore and the other in the lane near the hat. Now, one hat-pin might have
  dropped out and left the hat still fixed on the head. But when the hat came
  off, the pins must have come off with it. The hat came off near the top of
  the lane. If both the pins had been in it they would both have come out
  there.</p>

  <p>"But one pin was found on the shore; therefore when the body was at the
  shore the hat must have been still on the head, though it had probably got
  loosened by all the dragging about in the boat and in landing the body. You
  agree to that, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, it seems undeniable," I answered.</p>

  <p>"Very well," said he. "Then the body was being carried up the lane. The
  next question is: was it being carried by one person or by more than one?
  Well, I think you will agree with me, Doctor, that it could hardly have been
  done by one man. It is quite a considerable distance from the shore to the
  top of the lane. She was a goodsized woman, and a dead body is a mighty
  awkward thing to carry at the best of times. I should say there must have
  been at least two men."</p>

  <p>"It certainly does seem probable," I admitted.</p>

  <p>"I think so," said he. "Then we come to another question. Was it really a
  dead body? Or might the woman have been merely insensible?"</p>

  <p>"Good God, Sergeant!" I exclaimed. "You don't think it possible that it
  could have been a case of forcible abduction, and that Mrs. Frood is still
  alive?"</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say it was impossible," he replied, "but I certainly don't
  think it is the case. You see, nearly three months have passed and there is
  no sign of her. But in modern England you can't hide a full-grown,
  able-bodied woman who has got all her wits about her. No, Doctor, I am afraid
  we must take the view that the woman who was carried up Black Boy-lane was a
  dead woman. All I want to point out is that the other view is a bare
  possibility, and that we mustn't forget it."</p>

  <p>"But," I urged, "don't you think that the fact that she was being carried
  towards the town strongly suggests that she was alive? Why on earth should a
  murderer bring a body, at great risk of discovery, from the river, where it
  could easily have been disposed of, up into the town? It seems
  incredible."</p>

  <p>"It does," he agreed. "It's a regular facer. But, on the other hand,
  suppose she was alive. What could they have done with her? How could they
  have kept her out of sight all this time? And why should they have done
  it?"</p>

  <p>"As to the motive," said I, "that is incomprehensible in any case. But
  what do you suppose actually happened?"</p>

  <p>"My theory of it is," he replied, "that two men, at least, did the job.
  Both may have been local waterside men, or there may have been a stranger
  with a water-rat in his pay. I imagine the crime was committed at Chatham,
  somewhere near the Sun Pier, and that the body was put in a boat and brought
  up here. It was a densely foggy night, you remember, so there would have been
  no great difficulty; and there wouldn't be many people about. The part of it
  that beats me is what they meant to do with the body. They seem to have
  brought it deliberately from Chatham right up into Rochester Town; and they
  have got rid of it somehow. They must have had some place ready to stow it
  in, but what that place can have been, I can't form the ghost of a guess.
  It's a fair knock-out."</p>

  <p>"You don't suppose old Israel Bangs knows anything about it?" I
  suggested.</p>

  <p>The sergeant shook his head. "I've no reason to suppose he does," he
  replied. "And it is a bad plan to make guesses and name names."</p>

  <p>We walked up and down the Esplanade for nearly an hour, discussing various
  possibilities; but we could make nothing of the incredible thing that seemed
  to have happened in spite of its incredibility. At last we gave it up and
  returned to the Guildhall, where, as we parted, he said a little
  hesitatingly: "I heard you tell Mr. Bundy that Dr. Thorndyke was coming down
  for the week-end. It wouldn't be amiss if you were to put the facts of the
  case before him. It's quite in his line, and I think he would be interested
  to hear about it; and he might see something that I have missed. But, of
  course, it must be in strict confidence."</p>

  <p>I promised to try to find an opportunity to get Thorndyke's opinion on the
  case, and with this we separated, the sergeant retiring to his office and I
  making my way homeward to prepare a report for dispatch by the last post.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;SERGEANT COBBLEDICK IS ENLIGHTENED</h3>

  <p>The custom which had grown upon my part of meeting Thorndyke at the
  station on the occasion of his visits was duly honoured on the present
  occasion, for the surprising discoveries in Black Boy-lane, which I had
  described in my report to him, made me eager to hear his comments.
  Unfortunately, on this occasion, he had come down by an unusually late train,
  and the opportunity for discussion was limited to the time occupied by the
  short walk from Rochester Station to my house. For it was close upon dinner
  time, and I rather expected to find Bundy awaiting us.</p>

  <p>"Your report was quite a thrilling document," he remarked, as we came out
  of the station approach. "These new discoveries seem to launch us on a fresh
  phase of the investigation."</p>

  <p>"Do they seem to you to offer any intelligible suggestions?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"There is no lack of suggestions," he replied. "To a person of ordinary
  powers of imagination, a number of hypotheses must present themselves. But,
  of course, the first thing to consider is not what might have happened, but
  what did happen, and what we can safely infer from those happenings. We can
  apparently take it as proved that the body was carried through the lane; and
  everything goes to show that it was carried from the river towards the town.
  The first clear inference is that we can completely exclude accident, pure
  and simple. The body&mdash;living or dead&mdash;may be assumed to have been
  carried by some person or persons. We can dismiss the idea that the woman
  walked up the lane. But if someone carried the body, someone is definitely
  implicated. The affair comes unquestionably into the category of crime."</p>

  <p>"That doesn't carry us very far," I said, with a sense of
  disappointment.</p>

  <p>"It carries us a stage farther than our previous data did, for it excludes
  accident, which they did not. Then it suggests not only premeditation, but
  arrangement. If the body was brought up from the river, there must have been
  some place known to, and probably prepared by, those who brought it, in which
  it could be deposited; and that place must have been more secure than the
  river from which it was brought. But the river, itself, was a very secure
  hiding-place, especially if the body had been sunk with weights. Now, this is
  all very remarkable. If you consider the extraordinary procedure; the seizure
  of the victim at Chatham; the conveyance of the body from thence to this
  considerable distance; the landing of it at the wharf; the conveyance of it
  by an apparently selected route&mdash;at enormous risk of discovery, in spite
  of the fog to an appointed destination: I say, Strangeways, that if you
  consider this astounding procedure, you cannot fail to be convinced that
  there was some definite purpose behind it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "that seems to be so. But what could the purpose be? It
  appears perfectly incomprehensible. It only makes the mystery more unsolvable
  than ever."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he rejoined. "There is nothing so hopeless to investigate as
  the perfectly obvious and commonplace. As soon as an apparently
  incomprehensible motive appears, we are within sight of a solution. There may
  be innumerable explanations of a common-place action; but an outrageously
  unreasonable action; pursued with definite and considered purpose, can admit
  of but one or two. The action, with its underlying purpose, must be adjusted
  to some unusual conditions. We have only to consider to what conditions it
  could be adjusted, and which, if any, of those conditions actually exist, and
  the explanation of the apparently incomprehensible action comes into view.
  But here we are at our destination, and there is our friend, Bundy, standing
  on the doorstep. By the way, I have brought one or two photographs of Mrs.
  Frood for you to look at."</p>

  <p>We arrived in time to intervene and put an end to a preliminary skirmish
  between the irrepressible Bundy and Mrs. Dunk, and when greetings had been
  exchanged, Thorndyke went up to his room to wash and deposit his luggage.</p>

  <p>"Well, John," said Bundy, when he had hung up his hat, "it is very
  pleasant to see my old friend after this long separation. Very good of him,
  too, to invite an insignificant outsider like me to meet his distinguished
  colleague. You are a benefactor to me, John."</p>

  <p>"Don't talk nonsense, Peterkin," said I. "You know we are always glad to
  see you. I invite you for my own pleasure and Thorndyke's, not for
  yours."</p>

  <p>Bundy gave my arm a grateful squeeze. "Good old John," said he. "Nothing
  like doing it handsomely. But here is the great man himself," he added, as
  Thorndyke entered the dining-room, carrying a cardboard box, "with
  instruments of magic. He's going to do a conjuring trick."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke opened the box and delicately picked out four photographs, all
  mounted and all of cabinet size, which he stood up in a row on the
  mantelpiece. Two of them were from the same negative, one being printed in
  red carbon, the other in sepia. The remaining two were ordinary silver prints
  of the conventional trade type.</p>

  <p>Bundy looked at the collection with not unnatural surprise.</p>

  <p>"Where did these, things come from?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"They came from London," replied Thorndyke, "where things of this kind
  grow. Strangeways asked me to get him some samples. How do you like them? My
  own preference is for the carbons, and of the two I think I like the red
  chalk print the better."</p>

  <p>I ran my eye along the row and found myself in strong agreement with
  Thorndyke. It was not only that the carbon prints had the advantage of the
  finer medium. The treatment was altogether more artistic, and the likeness
  seemed better, in spite of a rather over-strong top-lighting.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "the carbons are infinitely superior to the silver prints,
  and of the two I think the red is the better because it emphasises the
  shadows less."</p>

  <p>"Is the likeness as good as in the silver prints?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Better, I think. The expression is more natural and spontaneous. What do
  you say, Peter?"</p>

  <p>As I spoke I looked at him, not for the first time, for I had already been
  struck by the intense concentration with which he had been examining the two
  carbons. And it was not only concentration. There was a curious expression of
  surprise, as if something in the appearance of the portraits puzzled him.</p>

  <p>He looked up with a perplexed frown. "As to the likeness," said he, "I
  don't know that I am a particularly good judge. I only saw her once or twice.
  But, as far as I remember, it seems to be quite a good likeness, and there
  can be no question as to the superiority, in an artistic sense, of the
  carbons. And I agree with you that the shadows are less harsh in the red than
  in the sepia. Who is the photographer?"</p>

  <p>He picked up the red print and, turning it over, looked at the back. Then,
  finding that the back of the card was blank, he picked up the sepia print and
  inspected it in the same way, but with the same result. There was no
  photographer's name either on the back or front.</p>

  <p>"I have an impression," said Thorndyke, "that the carbons were done a City
  photographer. But my man will know. He got them for me."</p>

  <p>Bundy set the two photographs back in their places, still, as it seemed to
  me, with the air of a man who is trying vainly to remember something. But, at
  this moment, Mrs. Dunk entered with the soup tureen, and we forthwith took
  our places at the table.</p>

  <p>We had finished our soup, and I was proceeding to effect the dismemberment
  of an enormous sole, when Bundy, having fortified himself with a sip of
  Chablis, cast a malignant glance at Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I have got some bad news for you, Doctor," said he.</p>

  <p>"Which doctor are you addressing?" Thorndyke asked. "There's only one
  now," replied Bundy. "T'other one has been degraded to the rank of John."</p>

  <p>"That happens to be my rank, too," observed Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Oh, but I couldn't think of taking such a liberty," Bundy protested,
  "though it is very gracious and condescending of you to suggest it. No, your
  rank and tine will continue to be that of doctor."</p>

  <p>"And what is your bad news??'</p>

  <p>"It is a case of a lost opportunity," said Bundy. "'Of all the sad words
  of tongue or pen,' and so on. It might have been ten shillings. But it never
  will now. Cobbledick has got your ten bob."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that Cobbledick has found the missing key?"</p>

  <p>"Even so, alackaday! The chance is gone for ever."</p>

  <p>"Where did he find it?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" exclaimed Bundy. "There it is again. The tragedy of it! He wasn't
  looking for it at all. He just fell over it in a field where he was searching
  for relics of Mrs. Frood."</p>

  <p>"Your description," said Thorndyke "is deficient in geographical
  exactitude. Could you bring your ideas of locality to a somewhat sharper
  focus? There are probably several fields in the neighbourhood of
  Rochester."</p>

  <p>"So there are," said Bundy. "Quite a lot. But this particular field lies
  on the right, or starboard, side of a small thoroughfare called Black
  Boy-lane."</p>

  <p>"Let me see," said Thorndyke. "Isn't that the lane that we went down after
  leaving our friends on the day of the Great Perambulation?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Bundy, looking at him in astonishment, "but how did you
  know its name?" (He was, of course, not aware of my report to Thorndyke
  describing the discoveries and the place.)</p>

  <p>"That," said Thorndyke "is an irrelevant question. Now when you say 'the
  right-hand side'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I mean the right-hand side looking towards the town, of course. As a
  matter of fact, Cobbledick found the key among the thistles near to the
  fence, and quite close to the outside of the city wall."</p>

  <p>"How do you suppose it got there?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"I've no idea. Someone must have taken it out of the gate and thrown it
  over the fence. That is obvious. But who could have done it I can't imagine.
  Of course, you suspect Cobbledick, but that is only jealousy."</p>

  <p>The exchange of schoolboy repartee continued without a sensible pause on
  either side. But yet I seemed to detect in Thorndyke's manner a certain
  reflectiveness underlying the levity of his verbal conflict with Bundy; a
  reflectiveness that seemed to have had its origin in the "news" that the
  latter had communicated. Of course, I had said nothing, in my report, about
  the finding of the key. Why <i>should</i> I? Those reports referred
  exclusively to matters connected with the disappearance of poor Angelina. The
  loss and the recovery of the key were items of mere local gossip with which
  Thorndyke could have no concern excepting in connexion with Bundy's facetious
  fiction. And yet it had seemed to me that Thorndyke showed quite a serious
  interest in the announcement. However, he made no further reference to the
  matter, and the conversation drifted to other topics.</p>

  <p>It was almost inevitable that, sooner or later, some reference should be
  made to the discoveries in the lane. It was Bundy, of course, who introduced
  the subject; and I was amazed by the adroit way in which Thorndyke conveyed
  the impression of complete ignorance, without making any statement, and the
  patient manner in which he listened to the account of the adventure, and even
  elicited amplified details by judicious questions. But he eluded all Bundy's
  efforts to extract an opinion on the significance of the discoveries.</p>

  <p>"But," the latter protested, "you said that if I would give you the facts,
  you would give me the explanation."</p>

  <p>"The explanation is obvious," said Thorndyke. "If you found these objects
  in the lane, they must have been dropped there."</p>

  <p>"Well, of course they must," said Bundy. "That is quite obvious."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," agreed Thorndyke. "That is what I am pointing out."</p>

  <p>"But why was the body being carried up the lane? And where was it being
  carried to?"</p>

  <p>"Ah," protested Thorndyke, "but now you are going beyond your facts. You
  haven't proved that there was any body there at all."</p>

  <p>"But there must have been, or the things couldn't have dropped off
  it."</p>

  <p>"But you haven't proved that they did drop off it. They may have, or they
  may not. That is a question of fact; and as I impressed on you on a previous
  occasion, evidence as to fact is the function of the common witness. The
  expert witness explains the significance of facts furnished by others. I have
  explained the facts that you have produced, and now you ask me to explain
  something that isn't a fact at all. But that is not my function. I am an
  expert."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Bundy; "and now I understand why judges are so down on
  expert witnesses. It is my belief that they are a parcel of impostors. Wasn't
  Captain Bunsby an expert witness? Or was he only an oracle?"</p>

  <p>"It is a distinction without a difference," replied Thorndyke. "Captain
  Bunsby is the classical instance of oracular safety. It was impossible to
  dispute the correctness of his pronouncements."</p>

  <p>"Principally," said I, "because no one could make head or tail of
  them."</p>

  <p>"But that was the subtlety of the method," said Thorndyke. "A statement
  cannot be contested until it is understood. From which it follows that if you
  would deliver a judgment that cannot be disputed, you must take proper
  precautions against the risk of being understood."</p>

  <p>Bundy adjusted his eye-glass and fixed on Thorndyke a glare of counterfeit
  defiance. "I am going to take an early opportunity of seeing you in the
  witness-box," said he. "It will be the treat of my life."</p>

  <p>"I must try to give you that treat," replied Thorndyke. "I am sure you
  will be highly entertained, but I don't think you will be able to dispute my
  evidence."</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose I shall," Bundy retorted with a grin, "if it is of the
  same brand as the sample that I have heard."</p>

  <p>Here the arrival of Mrs. Dunk with the coffee ushered in a truce between
  the disputants, and when I had filled the cups Thorndyke changed the subject
  by recalling the incidents of our perambulation with Japp and Mr. Willard;
  and Bundy, apparently considering that enough chaff had been cut for one
  evening, entered into a discussion on the conditions of life in mediaeval
  Rochester with a zest and earnestness that came as a refreshing change, after
  so much frivolity. So the evening passed pleasantly away until ten o'clock,
  when Bundy rose to depart.</p>

  <p>"Shall we see him home, Thorndyke?" said I. "We can do with a walk after
  our pow-wow."</p>

  <p>"Somebody ought to see him home," said Thorndyke. "He looks comparatively
  sober now, but wait till he gets out into the air." (Bundy's almost ascetic
  abstemiousness in respect of wine, I should explain, had become a mild joke
  between us.) "But I think I won't join the bacchanalian procession. I have a
  letter to write, and I can get it done and posted by the time you come
  back."</p>

  <p>As we walked towards the office arm-in-arm&mdash;Bundy keeping up the
  fiction of a slight unsteadiness of gait&mdash;my guest once more expressed
  enjoyment of our little festivals.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said he, "Dr. Thorndyke is really quite a big bug in his
  way."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied; "he is in the very front rank; in fact, I should say
  that he is the greatest living authority on his subject."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Bundy, thoughtfully, "one feels that he is a great man,
  although he is so friendly and so perfectly free from side. I hope I don't
  cheek him too much."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't seem to resent it," I answered, "and he certainly doesn't
  object to your society. He expressly said, when he wrote last, that he hoped
  to see something of you."</p>

  <p>"That was awfully nice of him," Bundy said with very evident
  gratification; and he added, after a pause: "Lord! John, what a windfall it
  was for me when you came down with that letter from old Turcival. It has made
  life a different thing for me."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear it, Peter," said I; "but you haven't got all the
  benefit. It was a bit of luck for me to strike a live bishop in my new
  habitat, and a Rumtifoozlish one at that. But here we are at the episcopal
  palace. Shall I assist your lordship up the steps?"</p>

  <p>We carried out the farce to its foolish end, staggering together up the
  steps, at the top of which I propped him securely against the door and rang
  the bell, with the comfortable certainty that there was no one in the house
  to disturb.</p>

  <p>"Good night, John, old chap," he said cordially, as I retired.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Peter, my child," I responded; and so took my way homeward to
  my other guest.</p>

  <p>I arrived at my house in time to meet Thorndyke returning from the
  adjacent pillar-box, and we went in together.</p>

  <p>"Well," said he, "I suppose we had better turn in, according to what is, I
  believe, the custom of this household, and turn out betimes in the morning,
  for a visit, perhaps, to Black Boy-lane."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied, "we may as well turn in now. You are not going to leave
  these photographs there, are you?"</p>

  <p>"They are your photographs," he replied; "that is, if you care to have
  them. I brought them down for you."</p>

  <p>I thanked him very warmly for the gift, and gathered up the portraits
  carefully, replacing them, for the present, in their box. Then we turned out
  the lights and made our way up to our respective bedrooms.</p>

  <p>At breakfast on the following morning Thorndyke opened the subject of our
  investigation by cross-examining me on the matter of my report, and the more
  detailed account that Bundy had given.</p>

  <p>"What does Sergeant Cobbledick think of the new developments?" he asked,
  when I had given him all the detail that I could.</p>

  <p>"In a way he is encouraged. He is glad to get something more definite to
  work on. But for the present he seems to be high and dry. He gave me quite a
  learned exposition of the possibilities of the case, but he had to admit when
  he had finished that he was still in the dark so far as any final conclusion
  was concerned. He even suggested that I should put the facts before
  you&mdash;he recognized you when we met him on the road near Blue Boar
  Pier&mdash;and ask if you could make any suggestion."</p>

  <p>"Can you recall the sergeant's exposition of the case?"</p>

  <p>"I think so. It made rather an impression on me at the time," and here I
  repeated, as well as I could remember them, the various inferences that
  Cobbledick had drawn from the presence in the lane of the things that we had
  found. Thorndyke listened with deep attention, nodding his head approvingly
  as each point was made.</p>

  <p>"A very admirable analysis, Strangeways," he said when I had finished. "It
  does the sergeant great credit. So far as it goes, it is an excellent
  interpretation of the facts that are in his possession. There are, perhaps,
  one or two points that he has overlooked."</p>

  <p>"If there are," said I, "it would be a great kindness to draw his
  attention to them. He is naturally anxious to get on with the case, and he
  has taken endless trouble over it."</p>

  <p>"I shall be very glad to give him a hint or two," said Thorndyke. "After
  breakfast I should like to go over the ground with you, and then we might go
  along to the station and see if he is in his office."</p>

  <p>I agreed to this program, and as soon as we had finished our breakfast we
  went forth, making our way by Free School-lane and The Common to the marshes
  west of Gas House-road. From there we entered Black Boy-lane at the lower
  end, and slowly followed its windings, Thorndyke looking about him
  attentively, and occasionally peering over the fences, which his stature
  enabled him to do without climbing. At the top of the lane, where it opened
  into a paved thoroughfare, we observed no less a personage than Sergeant
  Cobbledick, standing on the pavement and looking at the few adjacent houses
  with an expression of profound speculation. His speculative attitude changed
  suddenly to one of eager interest when he saw us; and on my presenting him to
  Thorndyke, he stood stiffly at "attention" and raised his hat with an air
  that I can only describe as reverent.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Strangeways was telling me, just now," said Thorndyke, "of your very
  interesting observations on these new developments. He also said that you
  would like to talk the matter over with me."</p>

  <p>"I should, indeed, sir," the sergeant said, earnestly; "and if I might
  suggest it, my office will be very quiet, being Sunday, and I could show you
  the things that have been found, if you would like to see them."</p>

  <p>"As to the things that have been found," said Thorndyke, "I am prepared to
  take them as read. They have been properly identified. But we could certainly
  talk more conveniently in your office."</p>

  <p>In a few minutes we turned into a narrow street which brought us to the
  side of the Guildhall, and the sergeant, having shown us into his office and
  given some instructions to a constable, entered and locked the door.</p>

  <p>"Now, Sergeant," said Thorndyke, "tell us what your difficulty is."</p>

  <p>"I've got several difficulties, Sir," replied Cobbledick. "In the first
  place, here is a body being carried up the lane. You agree with me, Sir, that
  it was going up and not down?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; your reasons seem quite conclusive."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, Sir, the next question is, was this a dead body, or was the
  woman drugged or insensible? The fact that she was being taken from the river
  towards the town suggests that she was alive and being taken to some house
  where she could be hidden; but, of course, a dead body might be taken to a
  house to be destroyed by burning or to be dismembered or even buried, say
  under the cellar. I must say my own feeling is that it was a dead body."</p>

  <p>"The reasons you gave Dr. Strangeways for thinking so seem to be quite
  sound. Let us proceed on the assumption that it was a dead body."</p>

  <p>"Well, Sir," said Cobble dick, gloomily, "there you are. That's all. We
  have got a body brought up from the river. We can trace it up to near the top
  of the lane. But there we lose it. It seems to have vanished into smoke. It
  was being taken up into the town; but where? There's nothing to show. We come
  out into the paved streets, and, of course, there isn't a trace. We seem to
  have come to the end of our clues; and I am very much afraid that we shan't
  get any more."</p>

  <p>"There," said Thorndyke, "I am inclined to agree with you, Sergeant. You
  won't get any more clues for the simple reason that you have got them
  all."</p>

  <p>"Got them all!" exclaimed Cobbledick, staring in amazement at
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the calm reply; "at least, that is how it appears to me. Your
  business now is not to search for more clues but to extract the meaning from
  the facts that you possess. Come, now, Sergeant," he continued, "let us take
  a bird's-eye view of the case, as it were, reconstructing the investigation
  in a sort of synopsis. I will read the entries from my note-book."</p>

  <p>"On Saturday, the 26th of April, Mrs. Frood disappeared. On the 1st of May
  the brooch was found at the pawn-brokers. On the 7th of May the box of
  tablets and the bag were found on the shore at Chatham, apparently fixing the
  place of the crime. On the 9th of May the scarf was found at Blue Boar Head.
  On the 15th of May a shoe was found in the creek between Blue Boar Head and
  Gas House Point. On the 25th of May the second shoe was found on the gridiron
  near Gas House Point. On the 20th of June a hat-pin was found on the shore a
  little west of the last spot; always creeping steadily up the river, you
  notice."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Cobbledick, "I noticed that, and I'm hanged if I can account
  for it in any way,"</p>

  <p>"Never mind," said Thorndyke. "Just note the fact. Then on the 14th of
  July four articles were found; near the bottom of the lane a button; near the
  middle of the lane a hat-pin, and, abreast of it in the field, the hat,
  itself. Finally, at the top of the lane, in the field, you found the missing
  key."</p>

  <p>"I don't see what the key has got to do with it," said the sergeant. "It
  don't seem to me to be in the picture."</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it?" said Thorndyke. "Just consider a moment, Sergeant. But
  perhaps you have forgotten the date on which the key disappeared?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I ever noticed when it was lost."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't lost," said Thorndyke. "It was taken away&mdash;probably out of
  the gate&mdash;and afterwards thrown over the fence. But I daresay Dr.
  Strangeways can give you the date."</p>

  <p>I reflected for a few moments. "Let me see," said I. "It was a good while
  ago, and I remember that it was a Saturday, because the men who were filling
  the holes in the city wall had knocked off at noon for a week-end. Now when
  was it? I went to the wine merchant's that day, and&mdash;". I paused with a
  sudden shock of recollection. "Why!" I exclaimed. "It was <i>the</i>
  Saturday; the day Mrs. Frood disappeared!"</p>

  <p>Cobbledick seemed to stiffen in his chair as he suddenly turned a startled
  look at Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed the latter; "the key disappeared during the morning of the
  26th of April and Mrs. Frood disappeared on the evening of the same day. That
  is a coincidence in time. And if you consider what gate it was that this key
  unlocked; that it gave entrance&mdash;and also excluded entrance&mdash;to an
  isolated, enclosed area of waste land in which excavations and fillings-in
  are actually taking place; I think you will agree that there is matter for
  investigation."</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke was speaking Cobbledick's eyes opened wider and wider, and
  his mouth exhibited a like change.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, Sir!" he exclaimed at length, "you mean to say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," Thorndyke interrupted with a smile. "I am merely drawing
  your attention to certain facts which seem to have escaped it. You said that
  there was no hint of a place to which the body could have been conveyed. I
  point out a hint which you have overlooked. That is all."</p>

  <p>"It is a pretty broad hint, too," said Cobbledick, "and I am going to lose
  no time in acting on it. Do you happen to know, Doctor, who employed the
  workmen?"</p>

  <p>"I gathered that Japp and Bundy had the contract to repair the wall. At
  any rate, they were supervising the work, and they will be able to tell you
  where to find the foreman. Probably they have a complete record of the
  progress of the work. You know Mr. Japp's address on Boley Hill, I suppose,
  and Mr. Bundy lives over the office."</p>

  <p>"I'll call on him at once," said Cobbledick, "and see if he can give me
  the particulars, and I'll get him to lend me the key. I suppose you two
  gentlemen wouldn't care to come and have a look at the place with me?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see why not," said Thorndyke. "But I particularly wish not to
  appear in connexion with the case, so I will ask you to say nothing to anyone
  of your having spoken to me about it, and, of course, we go to the place
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," the sergeant agreed emphatically. "We don't want any
  outsiders with us. Then if you will wait for me here I will get back as
  quickly as I can. I hope Mr. Bundy is at home."</p>

  <p>He snatched up his hat and darted out of the office, full of hope and high
  spirits. Thorndyke's suggestion had rejuvenated him.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," I said, when he had gone, "a rather remarkable thing
  that you should have remembered all the circumstances of the loss of this
  key."</p>

  <p>"It isn't really remarkable at all," he replied. "I heard of it after the
  woman had disappeared. But as soon as she had disappeared, the loss of this
  particular key at this particular time became a fact of possible evidential
  importance. It was a fact that had to be noted and remembered. The connexion
  of the tragedy with the river seemed to exclude it for a time; but the
  discoveries in the lane at once revived its importance. The fundamental rule,
  Strangeways, of all criminal investigation is to note everything, relevant or
  irrelevant, and forget nothing."</p>

  <p>"It is an excellent rule," said I, "but it must be a mighty difficult one
  to carry out"; and for a while we sat, each immersed in his own
  reflections.</p>

  <p>The sergeant returned in an incredibly short space of time, and he burst
  into the office with a beaming face, flourishing the key. "I found him at
  home," said he, "and I've got all the necessary particulars, so we can take a
  preliminary look round." He held the door open, and when we had passed out,
  he led the way down the little street at a pace that would have done credit
  to a sporting lamp-lighter. A. very few minutes brought us to the gate, and
  when he had opened it and locked it behind us, he stood looking round the
  weed-grown enclosure as if doubtful where to begin.</p>

  <p>"Which patch in the wall is the one they were working at when the key
  disappeared?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"The last but one to the left," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Then we had better have a look at that, first," said Thorndyke. "It was a
  ready-made excavation."</p>

  <p>We advanced towards the ragged patch in the wall, and as we drew near I
  looked at it with a tumult of emotions that swamped mere anxiety and
  expectation. I could see what Thorndyke thought, and that perception amounted
  almost to conviction. Meanwhile, my colleague and the sergeant stepped close
  up to the patch and minutely examined the rough and slovenly joints of the
  stonework.</p>

  <p>"There is no trace of its having been opened," said Thorndyke. "But there
  wouldn't be. I think we had better scrape up the earth at the foot of the
  wall. Something might easily have been dropped and trodden in in the
  darkness." He looked towards the shed, in which a couple of empty lime
  barrels still remained, and, perceiving there a decrepit shovel, he went and
  fetched it. Returning with it, he proceeded to turn up the surface of the
  ground at the foot of the wall, depositing each shovelful of earth on a bare
  spot, and spreading it out carefully. For some time there was no result, but
  he continued methodically, working from one end of the patch towards the
  other. Suddenly Cobbledick uttered an exclamation and stooped over a freshly
  deposited shovelful.</p>

  <p>"By the Lord!" he ejaculated, "it is a true bill! You were quite right,
  sir." He stood up, holding out between his finger and thumb a small bronze
  button bearing an embossed Tudor Rose. Thorndyke glanced at me as I took the
  button from the sergeant and examined it.</p>

  <p>"Yes," I said, "it is unquestionably one of her buttons."</p>

  <p>"Then," said he, "we have got our answer. The solution of the mystery is
  contained in that patch of new rubble."</p>

  <p>The sergeant's delight and gratitude were quite pathetic. Again and again
  he reiterated his thanks, regardless of Thorndyke's disclaimers and
  commendations of the officer's own skilful and patient investigation.</p>

  <p>"All the same," said Cobbledick, as he locked the gate and pocketed the
  key, "we haven't solved the whole problem. We may say that we have found the
  body; but the problem of the crime and the criminal remains. I suppose, sir,
  you don't see any glimmer of light in that direction?"</p>

  <p>"A glimmer, perhaps," replied Thorndyke, "but it may turn out to be but a
  mirage. Let us see the body. It may have a clearer message for us than we
  expect."</p>

  <p>Beyond this rather cryptic suggestion he refused to commit himself; nor,
  when we had parted from the sergeant, could I get anything more definite out
  of him.</p>

  <p>"It is useless to speculate," he said, by way of closing the subject. "We
  think that we know what is inside that wall. We may be right, but we may
  possibly be wrong. A few hours will settle our doubts. If the body is there,
  it may tell us all that we want to know."</p>

  <p>This last observation left me more puzzled than ever.</p>

  <p>The condition of the body might, and probably would, reveal the cause of
  death and the nature of the crime; but it was difficult to see how it could
  point out the identity of the murderer. However, the subject was closed for
  the time being, and Thorndyke resolutely refused to reopen it until the fresh
  data were available.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XV&mdash;THE END OF THE TRAIL</h3>

  <p>Shortly after breakfast on the following morning Sergeant Cobbledick made
  his appearance at my house. I found him in the consulting-room, walking about
  on tip-toe with his hat balanced in his hands, and evidently in a state of
  extreme nervous tension.</p>

  <p>"I have got everything in train, Doctor," said he, declining a seat. "I
  dug up the foreman yesterday evening and he dug up one of his mates to give
  him a hand, if necessary; and I have the authority to open the wall. So we
  are all ready to begin. The two men have gone down to the place with their
  tools, and Mr. Bundy has gone with them to let them in. He didn't much want
  to go, but I thought it best that either he or Mr. Japp should be present. It
  is their wall, so to speak. I suppose you are coming to see the job
  done."</p>

  <p>"Is there any need for me to be there?" I asked. Cobbledick looked at me
  in surprise. He had evidently assumed that I should be eager to see what
  happened. "Well," he replied, "you are the principal witness to the identity
  of the remains. You saw her last, you know. What is your objection,
  Doctor?"</p>

  <p>I was not in a position to answer this question. I could not tell him what
  this last and most horrible search meant to me; and apart from my personal
  feelings in regard to poor Angelina, there was no objection at all, but, on
  the contrary, every reason why I should be present.</p>

  <p>"It isn't a very pleasant affair," I replied, "seeing that I knew the lady
  rather well. However, if you think I had better be there, I will come down
  with you."</p>

  <p>"I certainly think your presence would be a help," said he. "We don't know
  what may turn up, and you know more about her than anybody else."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, I walked down with him, and when he had admitted me with his
  key&mdash;Bundy had presumably used the duplicate&mdash;he closed the gate
  and locked it from within. The actual operations had not yet commenced, but
  the foreman and his mate were standing by the wall, conversing affably with
  Bundy, who looked nervous and uncomfortable, evidently relishing his position
  no more than I did mine.</p>

  <p>"This is a gruesome affair, John, isn't it?" he said in a low voice. "I
  don't see why old Cobbledick wanted to drag us into it. It will be an awful
  moment when they uncover her, if she is really there. I'm frightfully sorry
  for you, old chap."</p>

  <p>"I should have had to see the body in any case," said I; "and this is less
  horrible than the river."</p>

  <p>Here my attention was attracted by the foreman, who had just drawn a
  long-, horizontal chalk line across the patch of new rubble, a little below
  the middle.</p>

  <p>"That's about the place where we left off that Saturday, so far as I
  remember," he said. "We had built up the outer case, and we filled in the
  hollow with loose bricks and stones, but we didn't put any mortar to them
  until Monday morning. Then we mixed up a lot of mortar, quite thin, so that
  it would run, and poured it on top of the loose stuff."</p>

  <p>"Rum way of building a wall isn't it?" observed Cobbledick.</p>

  <p>The foreman grinned. "It ain't what you'd call the highest class of
  masonry," he admitted. "But what can you expect to do with a gang of
  corner-boys who've never done a job of real work in their lives?"</p>

  <p>"No, that's true," said the Sergeant. "But you made a soft job for the
  grave-diggers, didn't you? Why they'd only got to pick out the loose stuff
  and then dump it back on top when they'd put the body in. Then you came along
  on Monday morning and finished the job for them with one or two bucketsful of
  liquid mortar. How long would it have taken to pick out that loose
  stuff?"</p>

  <p>"Lord bless yer," was the answer, "one man who meant business could have
  picked the whole lot out by hand in an hour; and he could have chucked it
  back in less. As you say, Sergeant, it was a soft job."</p>

  <p>While they had been talking, the foreman's familiar demon had been making
  a tentative attack on the outer casing with a great, chisel-ended steel bar
  and a mason's hammer. The foreman now came to his aid with a sledge hammer,
  the first stroke of which caused the shoddy masonry to crack in all
  directions like pie-crust. Then the fractured pieces of the outer shell were
  prised off, revealing the "loose stuff" within. And uncommonly loose it was;
  so loose that the unjoined bricks and stones, with their adherent gouts of
  mortar, came away at the lightest touch of the great crow-bar.</p>

  <p>As soon as a breach had been made at the top of the patch, the labourer
  climbed up and began flinging out the separated bricks and stones. Then he
  attacked a fresh course of the outer shell with a pick, and so exposed a
  fresh layer of the loose filling.</p>

  <p>"There'll be a fresh job for the unemployed to build this up again," the
  sergeant observed with a sardonic smile.</p>

  <p>"Ah," replied the foreman, "there generally is a fresh job when you take
  on a crowd of casuals. Wonderful provident men are casuals. Don't they take
  no thought for the morrow! What O!"</p>

  <p>At this moment the labourer stood upright on his perch and laid down his
  pick. "Well, I'm blowed!" he exclaimed. "This is a rum go, this is."</p>

  <p>"What's a rum go?" demanded the foreman.</p>

  <p>"Why, here's a whole bed of dry quick-lime," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"Ha !" exclaimed the sergeant, knitting his brows anxiously.</p>

  <p>The foreman scrambled up, and after a brief inspection confirmed the man's
  statement. "Quick-lime it is, sure enough. Just hand me up that shovel,
  Sergeant."</p>

  <p>"Be careful," Cobbledick admonished, as he passed the shovel up. "Don't
  forget what there probably is underneath."</p>

  <p>The foreman took the shovel and began very cautiously to scrape away the
  surface, flinging the scrapings of lime out on to the ground, where they were
  eagerly scrutinized by the sergeant, while the labourer picked out the larger
  lumps and cast them down. Thus the work went on for about a quarter of an
  hour, without any result beyond the accumulation on the ground below of a
  small heap of lime. At length I noticed the foreman pause and look
  attentively at the lime that he had just scraped up in his shovel.</p>

  <p>"Here's something that I don't fancy any of our men put in," he said,
  picking the object out and handing it down to the Sergeant. The latter took
  it from him and held it out for me to see. It was another of Angelina's coat
  buttons.</p>

  <p>In the course of the next few minutes two more buttons came to light, and
  almost immediately afterwards I saw the labourer stoop suddenly and stare
  down at the lime with an expression that made my flesh creep, as he pointed
  something out to the foreman.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" the latter exclaimed. "Here she is! But, my word! There ain't much
  left of her. Look at this, Sergeant."</p>

  <p>Very gingerly, and with an air of shuddering distaste, he picked something
  out of the lime and held it up; and even at that distance I could see that it
  was a human ulna. Cobbledick took it from him with the same distasteful and
  almost fearful manner, and held it towards me for inspection. I glanced at it
  and looked away. "Yes," I said. "It is a human arm bone."</p>

  <p>On this, Cobbledick beckoned for the labourer to come down, and, taking
  out his official note-book, wrote something in pencil and tore out the
  leaf.</p>

  <p>"Take this down to the station and give it to Sergeant Brown. He will tell
  you what else to do." He gave the paper to the man, and having let him out of
  the gate, came back and climbed up to the exposed surface of the excavation,
  where I saw him draw on a pair of gloves and then stoop and begin to pick
  over the lime.</p>

  <p>"This is a horrid business, isn't it?" said Bundy. "Why the deuce couldn't
  Cobbledick carry on by himself? I don't see that it is our affair. Do you
  think we need stay?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you need. You have finished your part of the business.
  You have seen the wall opened. I am afraid I must stay a little longer, as
  Cobbledick may want me to identify some of the other objects that may be
  found. But I shan't stay very long. There is really no question of the
  identity of the body, and there is no doubt now that the body is there.
  Detailed identification is a matter for the coroner."</p>

  <p>As we were speaking, we walked slowly away from the wall among the mounds
  of rubbish, now beginning to be hidden under a dense growth of nettles,
  ragwort and thistles. It was a desolate, neglected place, sordid of aspect
  and contrasting unpleasantly in its modern squalor with the dignified decay
  of the ancient wall. We had reached the further fence and were just turning
  about, when the sergeant hailed me with a note of excitement in his voice. I
  hurried across and found him standing up with his eyes fixed on something
  that lay in the palm of his gloved hand.</p>

  <p>"This seems to be the ring that you described to me, Doctor," said he.
  "Will you just take a look at it?"</p>

  <p>He reached down and I received in my hand the little trinket of
  deep-toned, yellow gold that I remembered so well. I turned it over in my
  palm, and as I looked on its mystical signs, its crude, barbaric workmanship
  and the initials "A. C." scratched inside, the scene in that dimly lighted
  room&mdash;years ago, it seemed to me now&mdash;rose before me like a vision.
  I saw the gracious figure in the red glow of the lamp and heard the voice
  that was never again to sound in my ears, telling the story of the little
  bauble, and for a few moments, the dreadful present faded into the
  irredeemable past.</p>

  <p>"There isn't any doubt about it, is there, Doctor?" the sergeant asked
  anxiously.</p>

  <p>"None, whatever," I replied. "It is unquestionably Mrs. Frood's ring."</p>

  <p>"That's a mercy," said Cobbledick; "because we shall want every atom of
  identification that we can get. The body isn't going to help us much. This
  lime has done its work to a finish. There's nothing left, so far as I can
  see, but the skeleton and the bits of metal belonging to the clothing. Would
  you like to come up and have a look, Doctor? There isn't much to see yet, but
  I have uncovered some of the bones."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I will come up, Sergeant, thank you," said I. "When you
  have finished, I shall have to look over what has been found, as I shall have
  to give evidence at the inquest. And I think I need hardly stay any longer.
  There is no doubt now about the identity, so far as we are concerned, at any
  rate."</p>

  <p>"No," he agreed. "There is no doubt in my mind, so I need not keep you any
  longer if you want to be off. But, before you go, there is one little matter
  that I should like to speak to you about." He climbed down to the ground,
  and, walking away with me a little distance, continued:</p>

  <p>"You see, Doctor, some medical man will have to examine the remains, so as
  to give evidence before the coroner. If it is impossible to identify them as
  the remains of Mrs. Frood, it will have to be given in evidence that they are
  the remains of a person who might have been Mrs. Frood; that they are the
  remains of a woman of about her size and age, I mean. Of course, the choice
  of the medical witness doesn't rest with the police, but if you would care to
  take on the job, our recommendation would have weight with the coroner. You
  see, you are the most suitable person to make the examination, as you
  actually knew her."</p>

  <p>I shook my head emphatically. "For that very reason, Sergeant, I couldn't
  possibly undertake the duty. Even doctors have feelings, you know. Just
  imagine how you would feel, yourself, pawing over the bones of a woman who
  had once been your friend."</p>

  <p>Cobbledick looked disappointed. "Yes," he admitted, "I suppose there is
  something in what you say. But I didn't think doctors troubled about such
  things very much; and you have got such an eye for detail&mdash;and such a
  memory. However, if you'd rather not, there is an end of the matter."</p>

  <p>He climbed back regretfully to the opening in the wall, and I rejoined
  Bundy. "I have finished here now," said I. "That was a ring of hers that
  Cobbledick had found. Are you staying any longer?"</p>

  <p>"Not if you are going away," he replied. "I am not wanted now, and I can't
  stick this charnel-house atmosphere; it is getting on my nerves. Let us clear
  out."</p>

  <p>We walked towards the entrance with a feeling of relief at escaping from
  the gruesome place, and had arrived within a few yards of it when there came
  a loud knocking at the gate, at which Bundy started visibly.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he exclaimed, "it's like Macbeth. Here, take my key and let
  the beggars in, whoever they are."</p>

  <p>I unlocked the gate and threw it open, when I saw, standing in the lane,
  two men, bearing on their shoulders a rough, unpainted coffin, and
  accompanied by the labourer, who carried a large sieve. I stood aside to let
  them pass in, and when they had entered, Bundy and I walked out, shutting and
  locking the gate after us. We made our way up the lane in silence, for there
  was little to say but much to think about; indeed, I would sooner have been
  alone, but the gruesome atmosphere of the place we had come from seemed to
  have affected Bundy's spirits so much that I thought it only kind to ask him
  to come back to lunch with me; an invitation that he accepted with
  avidity.</p>

  <p>During lunch we discussed the tragic discovery, and Bundy, now that he had
  escaped from physical contact with the relics of mortality, showed his usual
  shrewd common sense.</p>

  <p>"Well;" he said, "the mystery of poor Angelina Frood is solved at
  last&mdash;at least, so far as it is ever likely to be."</p>

  <p>"I hope not," I replied, "for the essential point of the mystery is not
  solved at all. It has only just been completely propounded. We now know
  beyond a doubt that she was murdered, and that the murder was a deliberate
  crime, planned in advance. What we want to know&mdash;at least, what I want
  to know, and shall never rest until I do know&mdash;is, who committed this
  diabolical crime?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid you never will know, John," said he. "There doesn't seem to
  be the faintest clue."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" I demanded. "You seem to have forgotten Nicholas
  Frood."</p>

  <p>Bundy shook his head. "You are deluding yourself, John. Nicholas seems,
  from your account of him, to be quite capable of having murdered his wife.
  But is there anything to connect him with the crime? If there is, you have
  never told me of it. And the law demands positive evidence. You can't charge
  a man with murder because he seems a likely person and you don't know of
  anybody else. What have you got against him in connexion with this present
  affair?"</p>

  <p>"Well, for instance, I know that he was prowling about this town, and that
  he was trying to find out where she lived."</p>

  <p>"But why not?" demanded Bundy. "She was a runaway wife, and he was her
  husband."</p>

  <p>"Then I happen to have noticed that he carried a sheath-knife."</p>

  <p>"But do you know that she was killed with a sheath-knife?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't," I answered savagely. "But I say again that I shall never
  rest until the price of her death has been paid. There must be some clue. The
  murder could not have been committed without a motive, and it must be
  possible to discover what that motive was. Somebody must have stood to
  benefit in some way by her death; and I am going to find that person, or
  those persons, if I give up the rest of my life to the search."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear you say that, John," he said as he rose to depart. "It
  sounds as if you were prepared to spend the rest of your life chasing a
  will-o'-the-wisp. But we are premature. The inquest may bring to light some
  new evidence that will put the police on the murderer's track. You must
  remember that they have been engaged in tracing the body up to now. When the
  inquest has been held and the facts are known they will be able to begin the
  search for the murderers. And I wish them and you good luck."</p>

  <p>I was rather glad when he was gone, for his dispassionate estimate of the
  difficulties of the case only served to confirm my own secret hopelessness.
  For I could not deny that these wretches seemed to have covered up their
  tracks completely. In the three months that had passed no whisper of any
  suspicious circumstance had been heard.</p>

  <p>From the moment when poor Angelina had faded from my sight into the fog to
  that of her dreadful reappearance in the old wall, no human eye seemed to
  have seen her. And now that she had come back, what had she to tell us of the
  events of that awful night? The very body, on which Thorndyke had relied for
  evidence, at least, of the manner of the crime, had dwindled to a mere
  skeleton such as might have been exhumed from some ancient tomb. The cunning
  of the murderer had outwitted even Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>The thought of my friend reminded me that I had to report to him the
  results of the opening of the wall; results very different from what he had
  anticipated when he had given the sergeant the too-fruitful hint. I
  accordingly wrote out a detailed report, so far as my information went; but I
  held it back until the last post in case anything further should come to my
  knowledge. And it was just as well that I did; for about eight o'clock,
  Cobbledick called to give me the latest tidings.</p>

  <p>"Well, Doctor," he said, with a smile of concentrated benevolence, "I have
  got everything in going order. I have seen the coroner and made out a list of
  witnesses. You are one of them, of course; in fact, you are the star witness.
  You were the last person to see her alive, and you were present at the
  exhumation. Dr. Baines&mdash;he's rather a scientific gentleman&mdash;is to
  make the post-mortem examination, and tell us the cause of death, if he can.
  He won't have much to go on. The lime has eaten up everything&mdash;it would,
  naturally, after three months&mdash;but the bones look quite uninjured, so
  far as I could judge."</p>

  <p>"When does the inquest open?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"The day after to-morrow. I've got your summons with me, and I may as well
  give it to you now."</p>

  <p>I looked at the little blue paper and put it in my pocketbook. "Do you
  think the coroner will get through the case in one day?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I am sure he won't," replied Cobbledick. "It is an important case,
  and there will be a lot of witnesses. There will be the evidence as to the
  building of the wall; then the opening of it and the description of what we
  found in it; then the identification of the remains&mdash;that is you,
  principally; and then there will be all the other evidence, the pawnbroker,
  Israel Bangs, Hooper, and the others. And then, of course, there will be the
  question as to the guilty parties. That is the most important of all."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know you had any evidence on that subject," said I.</p>

  <p>"I haven't much," he replied. "From the time when she disappeared nobody
  saw her alive or dead, and, of course, nothing has ever been heard of any
  occurrence that might indicate a crime. All we have to go on&mdash;and it is
  mighty little&mdash;is the fact that she was hiding from her husband, and
  that he was trying to find her. Also that he had made one attempt on her
  life. That is where your evidence will come in, and that of the matron at the
  'Poor Travellers.' I've had a talk with her."</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything of Frood's movements about the time of the
  disappearance?"</p>

  <p>"Practically nothing, excepting that he went away from his lodgings the
  day before. You see, we were not in a position to start tracing possible
  criminals. We had no real evidence of any crime. We knew that the woman had
  disappeared, and she appeared to have got into the river. But there was
  nothing to show how. It looked suspicious, but it wasn't a case. So long as
  no body was forthcoming there was no evidence of death, and nobody could have
  been charged. Even if we had found the body in the river, unless there had
  been distinct traces of violence, it would have been merely a case of 'found
  dead,' or 'found drowned.' But now the affair is on a different footing
  entirely. The body has been discovered under conditions which furnish prima
  facie evidence of murder, whatever the cause of death may turn out to have
  been. There is sure to be a verdict of wilful murder&mdash;not that the
  police are dependent on the coroner's verdict. So now we can get a move on
  and look for the murderer."</p>

  <p>"What chance do you think there is of finding him?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Cobbledick with a benevolent smile, "we mustn't be too
  cock-sure. But, leaving the husband out of the question and taking the broad
  facts, it doesn't look so unpromising. This wasn't a casual
  crime&mdash;fortunately. There's nothing so hopeless as a casual crime, done
  for mere petty robbery. But this crime was thought out. The place of burial
  was selected in advance. The key of the place was obtained, so that the
  murderer could not only get in but could lock himself&mdash;or more probably
  themselves&mdash;in and work secure from chance disturbance. And the time
  seems to have been selected; a week-end, with two whole nights to do the job
  in. All this points to very definite premeditation; and that points to a very
  definite motive. The person who planned this crime had something considerable
  to gain by Mrs. Frood's death; it may have been profit or it may have been
  the satisfaction of revenge.</p>

  <p>"Well, that is a pretty good start. When we know what property she had,
  who comes into it at her death, if any of it is missing, and if so, what has
  become of it; we can judge concerning the first case. And if we find that she
  had any enemies besides her husband; anyone whom she had injured or who owed
  her a grudge; then we can judge of the second case.</p>

  <p>"Then there is another set of facts. This murderer couldn't have been a
  complete stranger to the place. He knew about the wall and what was going on
  there. He knew the river and he possessed, or had command of, a boat. He knew
  the waterside premises and he knew his way&mdash;or had someone to show him
  the way&mdash;across the marshes and up Black Boy-lane. One, at least, of the
  persons concerned in this affair was a local man who knew the place well. So
  you see, Doctor, we have got something to go on, after all."</p>

  <p>I listened to the sergeant's exposition with deep interest and no little
  revival of my drooping hopes. It was a most able summary of the case, and I
  felt that I should have liked Thorndyke to hear it; in fact, I determined to
  embody it in the amplification of my report. With the facts thus fully and
  lucidly collated, it did really seem as though the perpetrator of this foul
  crime must inevitably fall into our hands. Having refreshed the sergeant with
  a couple of glasses of port, I shook his hand warmly and wished him the best
  of success in the investigation that he was conducting with so much
  ability.</p>

  <p>When he had gone I wrote a full account of our interview to add to my
  previous report, and expressed the hope that Thorndyke would be able to be
  present at the inquest, when I myself should "be and appear" at the appointed
  place to give evidence on the day after the morrow.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;THE INQUIRY AND A SURPRISE</h3>

  <p>On the morning of the inquest I started from my house well in advance of
  time, and in a distinctly uncomfortable frame of mind. Perhaps it was that
  the formal inquiry brought home to me with extra vividness the certainty that
  my beloved friend was gone from me for ever, and that she had died in
  circumstances of tragedy and horror. Not that I had ever had any doubt, but
  now the realization was more intense. Again, I should have to give evidence.
  I should have to reconstitute for the information of strangers scenes and
  events that had for me a certain sacred intimacy. And then, above all, I
  should have to view&mdash;and that not cursorily&mdash;the decayed remains of
  the woman who had been so much to me. That would be naturally expected from a
  medical man and no one would guess at what it would cost me to bring myself
  to this last dreadful meeting.</p>

  <p>Walking down the High-street thus wrapped in gloomy reflections, it was
  with mixed feelings that I observed Bundy advancing slowly towards me, having
  evidently awaited my arrival. In some respects I would sooner have been
  alone, and yet his kindly, sympathetic companionship was not altogether
  unwelcome.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, John," said he. "I hope I am not <i>de trop</i>. It is a
  melancholy errand for you, poor old chap, and I can't do much to make it less
  so, but I thought we might walk down together. You know how sorry I am for
  you, John."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know and appreciate, and I am always glad to see you, Peter. But
  why are you going there! Have you had a summons?"</p>

  <p>"No, I have no information to give. But I am interested in the case, of
  course, so I am going to attend as a spectator. So is Japp, though he is
  really a legitimately interested party. In fact, I am rather surprised they
  didn't summon him as a witness."</p>

  <p>"So am I. He really knows more about the poor girl than I do. But, of
  course, he knows nothing of the circumstances of her death."</p>

  <p>By this time we had arrived at the Guildhall, and here we encountered
  Sergeant Cobbledick, who was evidently on the look-out for me.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you came early, Doctor," said he. "I want you just to pop round
  to the mortuary. You know the way. There's a tray by the side of the coffin
  with all her belongings on it. I'll get you to take a careful look at them,
  so that you can tell the jury that they are really her things. And you had
  better run your eye over the remains. You might be able to spot something of
  importance. At any rate, they will expect you to have viewed the body, as you
  are the principal witness to its identity. I've told the constable on duty to
  let you in. And, of course, you can go in, too, Mr. Bundy, if you want
  to."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I do, thank you," replied Bundy. But he walked round with
  me to the mortuary, where the constable unlocked the door as he saw us
  approaching. I mentioned my name to the officer, but he knew me by sight, and
  now held the door open and followed me in, while Bundy halted at the
  threshold, and stood, rather pale and awe-stricken, looking in at the long
  table and its gruesome burden.</p>

  <p>The tray of which Cobbledick had spoken was covered with a white
  table-cloth, and on this the various objects were arranged symmetrically like
  the exhibits in a museum. At the top was the hat, flanked on either side by a
  silver-headed hat-pin. The carefully smoothed scarf was spread across
  horizontally, the six coat-buttons were arranged in a straight vertical line,
  and the two shoes were placed at the bottom centre. At one side was the
  hand-bag, and at the other, to balance it, the handkerchief with its neatly
  embroidered initials; and on this were placed the Zodiac ring, the wedding
  ring, the box of tablets, and the brooch. On the lateral spaces the various
  other objects were arranged with the same meticulous care for symmetrical
  effect: a neat row of hair pins, a row of hooks and eyes, one or two rows of
  buttons from the dress and under garments, the little metal jaws of the
  purse, two rows of coins, silver and bronze, a pair of glove-fasteners with
  scorched fragments of leather adhering, a little pearl handled knife, a
  number of metal clasps and fastenings and other small metallic objects
  derived from the various garments, and a few fragments of textiles, scorched
  as if by fire; a couple of brown shreds, apparently from the stockings, a
  cindery fragment of the brown coat, and a few charred and brittle tatters of
  linen.</p>

  <p>I looked over the pitiful collection while the constable stood near the
  door and probably watched me. There was something unspeakably pathetic in the
  spectacle of these poor fragments of wreckage, thus laid out, and seeming, in
  the almost grotesque symmetry of their disposal, to make a mute appeal for
  remembrance and justice. This was all that was left of her; this and what was
  in the coffin.</p>

  <p>So moved was I by the fight of these relics, thus assembled and presented
  in a sort of tragic synopsis, that it was some time before I could summon the
  resolution to look upon her very self, or at least upon such vestiges of her
  as had survived the touch of "decay's effacing fingers." But the time was
  passing, and it had to be. At last I turned to the coffin, and, lifting the
  unfastened lid, looked in.</p>

  <p>It could have been no different from what I had expected; but yet the
  shock of its appearance seemed to strike me a palpable blow. Someone had
  arranged the bones in their anatomical order; and there the skeleton lay on
  the bottom of the coffin, dry, dusty, whitened with the powder of lime, such
  a relic as might have been brought to light by the spade of some excavator in
  an ancient barrow or prehistoric tomb. And yet this thing was
  she&mdash;Angelina! That grisly skull had once been clothed by her rich,
  abundant hair! That grinning range of long white teeth had once sustained the
  sweet, pensive mouth that I remembered so well. It was incredible. It was
  horrible. And yet it was true.</p>

  <p>For some moments I stood as if petrified, holding up the coffin lid and
  gazing at the fearful shape in a trance of horror. And then suddenly I felt,
  as it were, a clutching at my throat and the vision faded into a blur as my
  eyes filled. Hastily I clapped down the coffin lid and strode towards the
  door with the tears streaming down my face.</p>

  <p>Vaguely I was aware of Bundy taking my arm and pressing it to his side, of
  his voice as he murmured shakily, "Poor old John!" Passively I allowed him to
  lead me to a quiet corner above a flight of steps leading down to the river,
  where I halted to wipe my eyes, faintly surprised to note that he was wiping
  his eyes too; and that his face was pale and troubled. But if I was
  surprised, I was grateful, too; and never had my heart inclined more
  affectionately towards him than in this moment of trial that had been
  lightened by his unobtrusive sympathy and perfect understanding.</p>

  <p>We stayed for a few minutes, looking down on the river and talking of the
  dead woman and the sad and troubled life from which this hideous crime had
  snatched her; then, as the appointed time approached, we made our way to the
  room in which the inquiry was to be held. As we entered, a pleasant-looking,
  shrewd-faced man, who looked like a barrister and who had been standing by a
  constable, approached and accosted me.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Strangeways? My name is Anstey. I do most of the court work in
  connexion with Thorndyke's cases, and I am representing him here to-day. He
  had hoped to come down, himself, but he had to go into the country on some
  important business, so I have to come to keep the nest warm&mdash;to watch
  the proceedings and make a summary of the evidence. You mentioned to him that
  the case would take more than one day."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I answered, "that is what I understand. Will Dr. Thorndyke be here
  to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; he has arranged definitely to attend to-morrow. And I think he
  expects by then to have some information of importance to communicate."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" I said eagerly. "Do you happen to know the nature of it?"</p>

  <p>Anstey laughed. "My dear Doctor," said he, "you have met Thorndyke, and
  you must know by now that he is about as communicative as a Whitstable
  native. No one ever knows what cards he holds."</p>

  <p>"Yes," I agreed, "he is extraordinarily secretive. Unnecessarily so, it
  has seemed to me."</p>

  <p>Anstey shook his head. "He is perfectly right, Doctor. He knows his own
  peculiar job to a finish. He is, in a way, like some highly-specialized
  animal, such as the three-toed sloth, for instance, which seems an abnormal
  sort of beast until you see it doing, with unapproachable perfection, the
  thing that nature intended it to do. Thorndyke is a case of perfect
  adaptation to a special environment."</p>

  <p>"Still," I objected, "I don't see the use of such extreme secrecy."</p>

  <p>"You would if you followed his cases. A secret move is a move against
  which the other player&mdash;if there is one&mdash;can make no provision or
  defence or counter-move. Thorndyke plays with a wooden face and without
  speaking. No one knows what his next move will be. But when it comes, he puts
  down his piece and says 'check'; and you'll find it is mate."</p>

  <p>"But," I still objected, "you are talking of an adversary and of
  counter-moves. Is there any adversary in this case?"</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't there?" said he. "There has been a crime committed. Someone
  has committed it; and that someone is not advertising his identity. But you
  can take it that he has been keeping a watchful eye on his pursuers, ready,
  if necessary, to give them a lead in the wrong direction. But it is time for
  us to take our places. I see the jury have come back from viewing the
  body."</p>

  <p>We took our places at the long table, one side of which was allocated to
  the jury and the other to witnesses in waiting, the police officers, the
  press-men, and other persons interested in the case. A few minutes later, the
  coroner opened the proceedings by giving a very brief statement of the
  circumstances which had occasioned the inquiry, and then proceeded to call
  the witnesses.</p>

  <p>The first witness was Sergeant Cobbledick, whose evidence took the form of
  a statement covering the whole history of the case, beginning with Mr. Japp's
  notification of the disappearance of Mrs. Frood and ending with the opening
  of the wall and the discovery of the remains. The latter part of the evidence
  was given in minute detail and included a complete list of the objects found
  with the remains.</p>

  <p>"Does any juryman wish to ask the witness any questions?" the Coroner
  inquired when the lengthy statement was concluded. He looked from one to the
  other, and when nobody answered he called the next witness. This was Dr.
  Baines, a somewhat dry-looking gentleman, who gave his evidence clearly,
  concisely, and with due scientific caution.</p>

  <p>"You have examined the remains which form the subject of this inquiry?"
  the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have examined the skeleton which is now lying in the mortuary. It
  is that of a rather strongly-built woman, five feet seven inches in height,
  and about thirty years of age."</p>

  <p>"Were you able to form any opinion as to the cause of death?"</p>

  <p>"No; there were no signs of any injury nor of disease."</p>

  <p>"Are we to understand," asked one of the jurymen, "that you consider
  deceased to have died a natural death?"</p>

  <p>"I have no means of forming any opinion on the subject."</p>

  <p>"But if she died from violence, wouldn't there be some signs of it?"</p>

  <p>"That would depend on the nature of the violence."</p>

  <p>"Supposing she had been shot with a revolver."</p>

  <p>"In that case there might be a fracture of one or more bones, but there
  might be no fracture at all. Of course, there would be a bullet."</p>

  <p>"Did you find a bullet?"</p>

  <p>"No. I did not see the bones until they had been brought to the
  mortuary."</p>

  <p>"There has been no mention of a bullet having been found," the coroner
  interposed, "and you heard Sergeant Cobbledick say that the lime had all been
  sifted through a fine sieve. We must take it that there was no bullet. But,"
  he continued, addressing the witness, "the conditions that you found would
  not exclude violence, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. Only violence that would cause injury to the bones."</p>

  <p>"What kinds of violence would be unaccompanied by injury to the
  bones?"</p>

  <p>"Drowning, hanging, strangling, suffocation, stabbing; and, of course,
  poisoning usually leaves no traces on the bones."</p>

  <p>"Can you give us no suggestion as to the cause of death?"</p>

  <p>"None whatever," was the firm reply.</p>

  <p>"You have heard the description of the missing woman, Mrs. Frood. Do these
  remains correspond with that description?"</p>

  <p>"They are the remains of a woman of similar stature and age to Mrs. Frood,
  so far as I can judge. I can't say more than that. The description of Mrs.
  Frood was only approximate; and the estimate of the stature, and especially
  the age, of a skeleton can only be approximate."</p>

  <p>This being all that could be got out of the witness, who was concerned
  only with the skeleton, and naturally refused to budge from that position,
  the coroner glanced at his list and then called my name. I rose and took my
  place at the top corner of the table, when I was duly sworn, and gave my name
  and description.</p>

  <p>"You heard Sergeant Cobbledick's description of the articles which have
  been found, and which are now lying in the mortuary?" the coroner began.</p>

  <p>I replied "Yes," and he continued: "Have you examined those articles, and,
  if so, can you tell us anything about them?"</p>

  <p>"I have examined the articles in the mortuary, and I recognized them as
  things I know to have been the property of Mrs. Angelina Frood."</p>

  <p>Here I described the articles in detail, and stated when and where I had
  seen them in her possession.</p>

  <p>"You have inspected the remains of deceased in the mortuary. Can you
  identify them as the remains of any particular person?"</p>

  <p>"No. They are quite unrecognizable."</p>

  <p>"Have you any doubt as to whose remains they are?" asked the juryman who
  had spoken before.</p>

  <p>"That question, Mr. Pilley," said the coroner "is not quite in order. The
  witness has said that he was not able to identify the remains. Inferences as
  to the identity of deceased, drawn from the evidence, are for the jury. We
  must not ask witnesses to interpret the evidence. When did you last see Mrs.
  Frood alive, Doctor?"</p>

  <p>"On the 26th of April," I replied; and here I described that last
  interview, recalling our conversation almost verbatim. When I came to her
  expressions of uneasiness and foreboding, the attention of the listeners
  became more and more intense, and it was evident that they were deeply
  impressed. Particularly attentive was the foreman of the jury, a keen-faced,
  alert-looking man, who kept his eyes riveted on me, and, when I had finished
  this part of my evidence, asked: "So far as you know, Doctor, had Mrs. Frood
  any enemies? Was there anyone whom she had reason to be afraid of?"</p>

  <p>This was a rather awkward question. It is one thing to entertain a
  suspicion privately, but quite another thing to give public expression to it.
  Besides, I was giving sworn evidence as to facts actually within my
  knowledge.</p>

  <p>"I can't say, positively," I replied after some hesitation, "that I know
  of any enemy or anyone whom she had reason to fear."</p>

  <p>The coroner saw the difficulty, and interposed with a discreet
  question.</p>

  <p>"What do you know of her domestic affairs, of her relations with her
  husband, for instance?"</p>

  <p>This put the matter on the basis of fact, and I was able to state what I
  knew of her unhappy married life in Rochester and previously in London; and
  further questions elicited my personal observations as to the character and
  personality of her husband. My meeting with him at Dartford Station, the
  incidents in the Poor Travellers' rest-house, the meeting with him on the
  bridge; all were given in full detail and devoured eagerly by the jury. And
  from their questions and their demeanour it became clear to me that they were
  in full cry after Nicholas Frood.</p>

  <p>The conclusion of my evidence brought us to the luncheon hour. I had, of
  course, to take Mr. Anstey back to lunch with me, and a certain wistfulness
  in Bundy's face made me feel that I ought to ask him, too. I accordingly
  presented them to one another and issued the invitation.</p>

  <p>"I am delighted to meet you, Mr. Bundy," Anstey said heartily. "I have
  heard of you from my friend Thorndyke, who regards you with respectful
  admiration."</p>

  <p>"Does he?" said Bundy, blushing with pleasure, but looking somewhat
  surprised. "I can't imagine why. But are you an expert, too?"</p>

  <p>"Bless you, no," laughed Anstey. "I am a mere lawyer, and, on this
  occasion, what is known technically as a devil&mdash;technically, you
  understand. I am watching this case for Thorndyke."</p>

  <p>"But I didn't know that Dr. Thorndyke was interested in the case," said
  Bundy, in evident perplexity.</p>

  <p>"He is interested in everything of a criminal and horrid nature," replied
  Anstey. "He never lets a really juicy crime mystery pass without getting all
  the details, if possible. You see, they are his stock in trade."</p>

  <p>"But he never would discuss this case&mdash;not seriously," objected
  Bundy.</p>

  <p>"Probably not," said Anstey. "Perhaps there wasn't much to discuss. But
  wait till the case is finished. Then he will tell you all about it."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Bundy. "He is one of those prophets who predict after the
  event."</p>

  <p>"And the proper time, too," retorted Anstey. "It is no use being
  premature."</p>

  <p>The conversation proceeded on this plane of playful repartee until we
  arrived at my house, where Mrs. Dunk, having bestowed a wooden glance of
  curiosity at Anstey and a glare of defiance at Bundy, handed me a telegram
  addressed to R. Anstey, K.C., care of Dr. Strangeways. I passed it to Anstey,
  who opened it and glanced through it.</p>

  <p>"What shall I say in answer?" he asked, placing it in my hand.</p>

  <p>I read the message and was not a little puzzled by it.</p>

  <p>"Ask Strangeways come back with you to-night. Very urgent. Reply time and
  place."</p>

  <p>"What do you suppose he wants me for?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"I never suppose in regard to Thorndyke," he replied.</p>

  <p>"But if he says it is urgent, it is urgent. Can you come up with me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, if it is necessary."</p>

  <p>"It is. Then I'll say yes. And you had better arrange to stay the
  night&mdash;there is a spare bedroom at his chambers&mdash;and come down with
  him in the morning. Can you manage that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," I replied; "and you can say that we shall be at Charing Cross by
  seven-fifteen."</p>

  <p>I could see that this transaction was as surprising to Bundy as it was to
  me. But, of course, he asked no questions, nor could I have answered them if
  he had. Moreover, there was not much time for discussion as we had to be back
  in the court room by two o'clock, and what talk there was consisted mainly of
  humorous comments by Anstey on the witnesses and the jury.</p>

  <p>Having sent off the telegram on our way down, we took our places once
  more, and the proceedings were resumed punctually by the calling of the
  foreman of the repairing gang; who deposed to the date on which the
  particular patch of rubble was commenced and finished and its condition when
  the men knocked off work on Saturday, the 26th of April. He also mentioned
  the loss of the key, but could give no particulars. The cross-examination
  elicited the facts that he had communicated to Cobbledick and me as to the
  state of the loose filling.</p>

  <p>"How many men," the coroner asked, "would it have taken to bury the body
  in the way in which it was buried; and how long?"</p>

  <p>"One man could have done it easily in one night, if he could have got the
  body there. The stuff in the wall was all loose, and it was small stuff, easy
  to handle. No building had to be done. It was just a matter of shovelling the
  lime in and then chucking the loose stuff in on top. And the lime was handy
  to get at in the shed, and one of the barrels was open."</p>

  <p>"Can you say certainly when the body was buried?"</p>

  <p>"It must have been buried on the night of the 26th of April or on the
  27th, because on Monday morning, the 28th, we ran the mortar in, and by that
  evening we had got the patch finished."</p>

  <p>The next witness was the labourer, Thomas Evans, who had lost the key. His
  account of the affair was as follows:</p>

  <p>"On the morning of Saturday, the 26th of April, the foreman gave me the
  key, because he had to go to the office. I took the key and opened the gate,
  and I left the key in the lock for him to take when he came. Then I forgot
  all about it, and I suppose he did, too, because he didn't say anything about
  it until we had knocked off work and were going out. Then he asks me where
  the key was, and I said it was in the gate. Then he went and looked but it
  wasn't there. So we searched about a bit in the grounds and out in the lane;
  but we couldn't see nothing of it nowhere."</p>

  <p>"When you let yourself in, did you leave the gate open or shut it?"</p>

  <p>"I shut the gate, but, of course, it was unlocked. The key was
  outside."</p>

  <p>"So that anyone passing up the lane could have taken it out without your
  noticing?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. We was working the other side of the grounds, so we shouldn't have
  heard anything if anybody had took it."</p>

  <p>That completed the evidence as to the key, and when Evans was dismissed
  the matron of the Poor Travellers was called. As she took her place, a
  general straightening of backs and air of expectancy on the part of the jury
  suggested that her evidence was looked forward to with more than common
  interest. And so it turned out to be. Her admirably clear and vivid
  presentment of the man, Nicholas Frood; his quarrelsome, emotional
  temperament, his shabby condition, his abnormal appearance, the evidences of
  his addiction to drink and drugs, his apparently destitute state, and, above
  all, the formidable sheath-knife that he wore under his coat; were listened
  to with breathless attention, and followed by a fusilade of eager, and often
  highly improper, questions. But the coroner was a wise and tactful man, and
  he unobtrusively intervened to prevent any irregularities; as, for instance,
  "It is not permissible," he observed, blandly, "to ask a witness if a certain
  individual seemed to be a likely person to commit a crime. And a coroner's
  court is not a criminal court. It is not our function to establish any
  person's guilt, but to ascertain how deceased met with her death. If the
  evidence shows that she was murdered, we shall say so in our verdict. If the
  evidence points clearly to a particular person as the murderer, we shall name
  that person in the verdict. But we are not primarily investigating a crime;
  we are investigating a death. The criminal investigation is for the
  police."</p>

  <p>This reminder cooled the ardour of the criminal investigators somewhat,
  but there were signs of a fresh outbreak when Mrs. Gillow gave her evidence,
  for that lady having a somewhat more lively imagination than the matron,
  tended to lure enterprising jurymen on to fresh indiscretions. She certainly
  enjoyed herself amazingly, and occupied a most unnecessary amount of time
  before she at length retired, dejected but triumphant, to the manifest relief
  of the coroner.</p>

  <p>This brought the day's proceedings to a close. There were a few more
  witnesses on the list, and the coroner hoped to take their evidence and
  complete the inquiry on the following day. As soon as the court rose, Anstey
  and I with Bundy proceeded to a tea-shop hard by and, having refreshed
  ourselves with a light tea, set forth to catch our train at Strood Station.
  Thither Bundy accompanied us at my invitation, but though I suspected that he
  was bursting with curiosity as to the object of my mysterious journey, he
  made no reference to it, nor did I or Anstey.</p>

  <p>At the barrier at Charing Cross we found Thorndyke awaiting us, and
  Anstey, having delivered me into his custody and seen us into a taxi-cab that
  had already been chartered, wished us success and took his leave. Then the
  driver, who apparently had his instructions, started and moved out of the
  station.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said I, "whether I may now ask what I am wanted for."</p>

  <p>"I should rather not go into particulars," he replied. "I want your
  opinion on something that I am going to show you, and I especially want it to
  be an impromptu opinion. Previous consideration might create a bias which
  would detract from the conclusiveness of your decision. However, you have
  only a few minutes to wait."</p>

  <p>In those few minutes I could not refrain from cudgelling my brains, even
  at the risk of creating a bias, and was still doing so&mdash;quite
  unproductively&mdash;when the cab approached the hospital of St. Barnabas and
  gave me a hint. But it swept past the main, entrance, and, turning up a side
  street, slowed down and stopped opposite the entrance of the medical school.
  Here we got out, and, leaving the cab waiting, entered the hall, where
  Thorndyke inquired for a person of the name of Farrow. In a minute or two
  this individual made his appearance in the form of a somewhat frowsy, elderly
  man, whom, from the multitude of warts on his hands, I inferred to be the
  post-mortem porter or dissecting-room attendant. He appeared to be a taciturn
  man, and he, too, evidently had his instructions, for he merely looked at us
  and then walked away slowly, leaving us to follow. Thus silently he conducted
  us down a long corridor, across a quadrangle beyond which rose the conical
  roof of a theatre, along a curved passage which followed the wall of the
  circular building and down a flight of stone steps which let into a dim,
  cement-floored basement, lighted by sparse electric bulbs and pervaded by a
  faint, distinctive odour that memory associated with the science of anatomy.
  From the main basement room Farrow turned into a short passage, where he
  stopped at a door, and, having unlocked it, threw it open and switched on the
  light, when we entered and I looked around. It was a large, cellar-like room,
  lighted by a single powerful electric bulb fitted with a basin-like metal
  reflector and attached to a long, movable arm. The activities usually carried
  on in it were evident from the great tins of red lead on the shelves, from a
  large brass syringe fitted with a stop-cock and smeared with red paint, and
  from a range of oblong slate tanks or coffers furnished with massive wooden
  lids.</p>

  <p>Still without uttering a word, the taciturn Farrow swung the powerful lamp
  over one of the coffers, and then drew off the lid. I stepped forward and
  looked in. The coffer was occupied by the body of a man, evidently&mdash;from
  the shaven head and the traces of red paint&mdash;prepared as an anatomical
  "subject." I looked at it curiously, thinking how unhuman, how artificial it
  seemed; how like to a somewhat dingy waxwork figure. But as I looked I was
  dimly conscious of some sense of familiarity stealing into my mind. Some
  chord of memory seemed to be touched. I stooped and looked more closely; and
  then, suddenly, I started up.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" I exclaimed. "It is Nicholas Frood!"</p>

  <p>"Are you sure?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes, quite," I answered. "It was the shaved head that put me off: the
  absence of that mop of hair. I have no doubt at all. Still&mdash;let us have
  a look at the hands."</p>

  <p>Farrow lifted up the hands one after the other; and then, if there could
  have been any doubt, it was set at rest. The mahogany-coloured stain was
  still visible; but much more conclusive were the bulbous finger-tips and the
  misshapen, nutshell-like nails. There could be no possible doubt.</p>

  <p>"This is certainly the man I saw at Rochester," said I. "I am fully
  prepared to swear to that. But oughtn't he to have been identified by
  somebody who knew him better?"</p>

  <p>"The body has been identified this afternoon by his late landlady,"
  replied Thorndyke, "but I wanted your confirmation, and I wanted you as a
  witness at the inquest. The identification is important in relation to the
  inquiry and the possible verdict."</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Jove!" I agreed, with a vivid recollection of the questions put
  to Mrs. Gillow. "This will come as a thunder-bolt to the jury. But how, in
  the name of Fortune, did he come here?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you about that presently," replied Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>He tendered a fee to the exhibitor, and when the latter had replaced the
  lid of the coffer, he conducted us back to our starting-point, and saw us
  into the waiting cab.</p>

  <p>"5A, King's Bench Walk," Thorndyke instructed the driver, and as the cab
  started, he began his explanation.</p>

  <p>"This has been a long and weary search, with a stroke of unexpected good
  luck at the end. We have had to go through endless records of hospitals,
  police-courts, poorhouses, infirmaries, and inquests. It was the records of
  an inquest that put us at last on the track; an inquest on an unknown man,
  supposed to be a tramp. Roughly, the history of the affair is this:</p>

  <p>"Frood seems to have started for Brighton on the 25th of April, but for
  some unexplained reason, he broke his journey and got out at Horwell. What
  happened to him there is not clear. He may have over-dosed himself with
  cocaine; but at any rate, he was found dead in a meadow, close to a hedge, on
  the morning of the 26th. He was therefore dead before his wife disappeared.
  The body was taken to the mortuary and there carefully examined. But there
  was not the faintest clue to his identity. His pockets were searched, but
  there was not a vestige of property of any kind about him, not even the knife
  of which you have spoken. The probability is that he had been robbed by some
  tramp of everything that he had about him, either while he was insensible or
  after he was dead. In any case he appeared to be completely destitute, and
  this fact, together with his decidedly dirty and neglected condition, led
  naturally to the conclusion that he was a tramp. An inquest was held, but of
  course, no expensive and troublesome measures were taken to trace his
  identity. Examinations showed that he had not died from the effects of
  violence, so it was assumed that he had died from exposure, and a verdict to
  that effect was returned. He was about to be given a pauper's funeral when
  Providence intervened on our behalf. It happened that the Demonstrator of
  Anatomy at St. Barnabas resides at Horwell; and it happened that the presence
  of an unclaimed body in the mortuary came to his knowledge. Thereupon he
  applied to the authorities, on behalf of his school, for the use of it as an
  anatomical subject. His application was granted and the body was conveyed to
  St. Barnabas, where it was at once embalmed and prepared and then put aside
  for use during the next winter session."</p>

  <p>"Was that quite in order&mdash;legally, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"That is not for us to ask," he replied. "It was not in any way contrary
  to public policy, and it has been our salvation in respect of our particular
  inquiry."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it has," I said, not, however, quite seeing it in that light.
  "Of course, it disposes of the question of his guilt."</p>

  <p>"It does a good deal more than that as matters have turned out," said he.
  "However, here we are in the precincts of the Temple. Let us dismiss Nicholas
  Frood from our minds for the time being, and turn our attention to the more
  attractive subject of dinner."</p>

  <p>The cab stopped opposite a tall house with a fine carved-brick portico,
  and, when Thorndyke had paid the driver, we ascended the steps and made our
  way up a couple of flights of oaken stairs to the first floor. Here, at the
  door of my friend's chambers, we encountered a small, clerical-looking
  gentleman with an extremely wrinkly, smiling face, who reminded me somewhat
  of Mr. Japp. "This is Mr. Polton, Strangeways," said Thorndyke, presenting
  him to me, "who relieves me of all the physical labour of laboratory work. He
  is a specialist in everything, including cookery, and if my nose does not
  mislead me&mdash;ha! Does it, Polton?"</p>

  <p>"That depends, sir, on which way you follow it," replied Polton, with a
  smile of labyrinthine wrinkliness. "But you will want to wash, and Dr.
  Strangeways's room is ready for him."</p>

  <p>On this hint, Thorndyke conducted me to an upper floor, and to a pleasant
  bedroom with an outlook on plane trees and ancient, red-tiled roofs, where I
  washed and brushed up, and from whence I presently descended to the
  sitting-room, whither Thorndyke's nose had already led him&mdash;and to good
  purpose, too.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Polton has missed his vocation," I remarked, as I attacked his
  productions with appreciative gusto. "He ought to have been the manager of a
  West End club or a high-class restaurant."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke regarded me severely. "I am shocked at you, Strangeways," he
  said. "Do you suggest that a man who can make anything from an astronomical
  clock to a microscope objective, who is an expert in every branch of
  photographic technique, a fair analytical chemist, a microscopist, and
  general handicraftsman, should be degraded to the office of a mere
  superintendent cook? It is a dreadful thought!"</p>

  <p>"I didn't understand that he was a man of so many talents and
  accomplishments," I said apologetically.</p>

  <p>"He is a most remarkable man," said Thorndyke, "and I take it as a great
  condescension that he is willing to prepare my meals. It is his own
  choice&mdash;an expression of personal devotion. He doesn't like me to take
  my food at restaurants or clubs. And, of course, he does it well because he
  is incapable of doing anything otherwise than well. You must come up and see
  the laboratories and workshop after dinner."</p>

  <p>We went up when we had finished our meal and discovered Polton in the act
  of cutting transverse sections of hairs and mounting them to add to the great
  collection of microscopic objects that Thorndyke had accumulated. He left
  this occupation to show me the great standing camera for copying, enlarging,
  reducing and microphotography, to demonstrate the capabilities of a fine
  back-geared lathe and to exhibit the elaborate outfit for analysis and assay
  work.</p>

  <p>"I had no idea," said I, as we returned to the sitting room, "that
  medico-legal practice involved the use of all these complicated
  appliances."</p>

  <p>"The truth is," Thorndyke replied, "that Medical Jurisprudence is not a
  single subject, concerned with one order of knowledge. It represents the
  application of every kind of knowledge to the solution of an infinite variety
  of legal problems. And that reminds me that I haven't yet looked through
  Anstey's abstract of the evidence at the inquest, which I saw that he had
  left for me. Shall we go through it now? It won't take us very long. Then we
  can have a stroll round the Temple or on the Embankment before we turn
  in."</p>

  <p>"You are coming down to Rochester to-morrow?" I asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "The facts concerning Nicholas Frood will have to be
  communicated to the coroner; and it is possible that some other points may
  arise."</p>

  <p>"Now that Frood is definitely out of the picture," said I, "do you see any
  possibility of solving the mystery of this crime? I mean as to the identity
  of the guilty parties?"</p>

  <p>He reflected awhile. "I am inclined to think," he replied, at length,
  "that I may be able to offer a suggestion. But, of course, I have not yet
  seen the remains."</p>

  <p>"There isn't much to be gleaned from them, I am afraid," said I.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," he answered. "But we shall be able to judge better when we
  have read the evidence of the medical witness."</p>

  <p>"He wasn't able to offer any opinion as to the cause of death," I
  said.</p>

  <p>"Then," he replied, "we may take it that there are no obvious signs.
  However, it is useless to speculate. We must suspend our judgment until
  to-morrow"; and with this he opened Anstey's summary, and read through it
  rapidly, asking me a question now and again to amplify some point. When he
  had finished the abstract&mdash;which appeared to be very brief and
  condensed&mdash;he put it in his pocket and suggested that we should start
  for our proposed walk; and, though I made one or two attempts to reopen the
  subject of the inquiry, he was not to be drawn into any further statements.
  Apparently there was some point that he hoped to clear up by personal
  observation, and meanwhile he held his judgment in suspense.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;THORNDYKE PUTS DOWN HIS PIECE</h3>

  <p>The journey down to Rochester would have been more agreeable and
  interesting under different circumstances. Thorndyke kept up a flow of lively
  conversation to which I should ordinarily have listened with the keenest
  pleasure. But he persistently avoided any reference to the object of our
  journey; and as this was the subject that engrossed my thoughts and from
  which I was unable to detach them, his conversational efforts were expended
  on somewhat inattentive ears. In common politeness I tried to make a show of
  listening and even of some sort of response; but the instant a pause
  occurred, my thoughts flew back to the engrossing subject and the round of
  fruitless speculation begun again.</p>

  <p>What was it that Thorndyke had in his mind? He was not making this journey
  to inform the coroner of Frood's death. That could have been done by letter;
  and, moreover, I was the actual witness to the dead man's identity. There was
  some point that he expected to be able to elucidate; some evidence that had
  been overlooked. And that evidence seemed to be connected with that dreadful,
  pitiful thing that lay in the coffin&mdash;crying out, indeed, to Heaven for
  retribution, but crying in a voice all inarticulate. But would it be
  inarticulate to him? He had seemed to imply an expectation of being able to
  infer from the appearance of those mouldering bones the cause and manner of
  death, and even&mdash;so it had appeared to me&mdash;the very identity of the
  murderer. But how could this be possible? Dr. Baines had said that the bones
  showed no signs of injury. The soft structures of the body had disappeared
  utterly. What suggestion as to the cause of death could the bones offer?
  Chronic mineral poisoning might be ascertainable from examination of the
  skeleton, but not from a mere ocular inspection; and the question of chronic
  poisoning did not arise. Angelina was alive on the Saturday evening; before
  the Monday morning her body was in the wall. Again and again I dismissed the
  problem as an impenetrable mystery; and still it presented itself afresh for
  consideration.</p>

  <p>A few words of explanation to the constable on duty at the mortuary
  secured our admission, or, rather Thorndyke's; for I did not go in, but stood
  in the doorway, watching him inquisitively. He looked over the objects set
  out on the tray and seemed to be mentally checking them. Then he put on a
  pair of pince-nez and examined some of them more closely. From the tray he
  presently turned to the coffin, and, lifting off the lid, stood for a while,
  with his pince-nez in his hand, looking intently at the awful relics of the
  dead woman. From his face I could gather nothing. It was at all times a
  rather immobile face, in accordance with his calm, even temperament. Now it
  expressed nothing but interest and close attention. He inspected the whole
  skeleton methodically, as I could see by the way his eyes travelled slowly
  from the head to the foot of the coffin. Then, once more, he put on his
  reading-glasses, and stooped to examine more I closely something in the upper
  part of the coffin&mdash;I judged it to be the skull. At length he stood up,
  put away his I glasses, replaced the coffin-lid, and rejoined me.</p>

  <p>"Has the sitting of the Court begun yet?" he asked the constable.</p>

  <p>"They began about five minutes ago, sir," was the reply; on which we made
  our way to the court-room, where Thorndyke, having secured a place at the
  table, beckoned to the coroner's officer.</p>

  <p>"Will you hand that to the coroner, please?" said he, producing from his
  pocket a note in an official-looking blue envelope. The officer took the note
  and laid it down before the coroner, who glanced at it and nodded and then
  looked with sudden interest at Thorndyke. The witness who was being examined
  at the moment was the pawnbroker's daughter, and her account of the
  mysterious man with the mole on his nose was engaging the attention of the
  jury. While the examination was proceeding, the coroner glanced from time to
  time at the note. Presently he took it up and opened the envelope, and in a
  pause in the evidence, took out the note and turned it over to look at the
  signature. Then he ran his eyes over the contents, and I saw his eyebrows go
  up. But at that moment one of the jurymen asked a question and the note was
  laid down while the answer was entered in the depositions. At length the
  evidence of this witness was completed, and the witness dismissed, when the
  coroner took up the note and read it through carefully.</p>

  <p>"Before we take the evidence of Israel Bangs, gentlemen," said he, "we had
  better consider some new facts which I think you will regard as highly
  important. I have just received a communication from Dr. John Thorndyke, who
  is a very eminent authority on medico-legal evidence. He informs me that the
  husband of the deceased, Nicholas Frood, is dead. It appears that he died
  about three months ago, but his body was not identified until yesterday, when
  it was seen by Frood's landlady and by Dr. Strangeways, who is here and can
  give evidence as to the identity. I propose that we first recall Dr.
  Strangeways and then ask Dr. Thorndyke, who is also present, to give us the
  further particulars."</p>

  <p>The jury agreed warmly to the suggestion, and I was at once recalled, and
  as I took my place at the coroner's left hand I felt that I was fully
  justifying Cobbledick's description of me as the "star witness," for not only
  was I the object of eager interest on the part of the jury and the sergeant
  himself, but also of Bundy, whose eyes were riveted on me with devouring
  curiosity.</p>

  <p>There is no need for me to repeat my evidence. It was quite short. I just
  briefly described the body and its situation. As to how it came to the
  hospital, I had no personal knowledge, but I affirmed that it was undoubtedly
  the body of Nicholas Frood. Of that I was quite certain.</p>

  <p>No questions were asked. There was a good deal of whispered comment, and
  one indiscreet juryman remarked audibly that "this fellow seemed to have
  cheated the hangman." Then the coroner deferentially requested Thorndyke to
  give the Court any information that was available, and my friend advanced to
  the head of the table, where the coroner's officer placed a chair for him,
  and took the oath.</p>

  <p>"What a perfectly awful thing this is about poor old Nicholas!" whispered
  Bundy, who had crept into the chair that Thorndyke had just vacated. "It
  makes one's flesh creep to think of it."</p>

  <p>"It <i>was</i> rather horrible," I agreed, noting that my description of
  the scene had evidently made <i>his</i> flesh creep, for he was as pale as a
  ghost. But there was no time to discuss the matter further, for Thorndyke,
  having been sworn, and started by a general question from the coroner, now
  began to give his evidence, in the form of a narrative similar to that which
  I had heard from him, and accompanied by the production of documents relating
  to the inquest and the transfer of the body of the unknown deceased to the
  medical school.</p>

  <p>"There is no doubt, I suppose, as to the date of this man's death?" the
  coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"Practically none. He was seen alive on the 25th of April, and he was
  found dead on the morning of the 26th. I have put in a copy of the
  depositions at the inquest, which give the date and time of the finding of
  the body."</p>

  <p>"Then, as his death occurred before the disappearance of his wife, this
  inquiry is not concerned with him any further."</p>

  <p>Here the foreman of the jury interposed with a question. "It seems that
  Dr. Thorndyke took a great deal of trouble to trace this man, Frood. Was he
  acting for the police?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that that is strictly our concern," said the coroner,
  looking at Thorndyke, nevertheless, with a somewhat inquiring expression.</p>

  <p>"I was acting," said Thorndyke, "in pursuance of instructions from a
  private client to investigate the circumstances of Mrs. Frood's
  disappearance, to ascertain whether a crime had been committed and, if so, to
  endeavour to find the guilty party or parties."</p>

  <p>"He never told us that," murmured Bundy; "at least&mdash;did you know,
  John?"</p>

  <p>"I did, as a matter of fact, but I was sworn to secrecy." Bundy looked at
  me a little reproachfully, I thought, and I caught a queer glance from
  Cobbledick. But just then the coroner spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen the evidence that was given yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have a summary of it, which I have read."</p>

  <p>"Can you, from your investigations, tell us anything that was not
  disclosed by that evidence?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I have just examined the remains of the deceased and the articles
  which have been found from time to time. I think I can give some additional
  information concerning them."</p>

  <p>"From your examination of the remains," the coroner said somewhat eagerly,
  "can you give any opinion as to the cause of death?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "My examination had reference chiefly to the
  identity of the remains."</p>

  <p>The coroner looked disappointed. "The identity of the remains," said he,
  "is not in question. They have been clearly identified as those of Angelina
  Frood."</p>

  <p>"Then," said Thorndyke, "they have been wrongly identified. I can swear
  positively that they are not the remains of Angelina Frood."</p>

  <p>At this statement a sudden hush fell on the Court, broken incongruously by
  an audible whistle from Sergeant Cobbledick. On me the declaration fell like
  a thunderbolt, and, on looking round at Bundy, I could see that he was
  petrified with astonishment. There was a silence of some seconds' duration.
  Then the coroner said, with a distinctly puzzled air: "This is a very
  remarkable statement, Dr. Thorndyke. It seems to be quite at variance with
  all the facts: and it appears almost incredible that you should be able to
  speak with such certainty, having regard to the condition of the remains and
  in spite of the extraordinary effect of the lime."</p>

  <p>"It is on account of the effect of the lime that I am able to speak with
  so much certainty and confidence," Thorndyke replied.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow that," said the coroner. "Would you kindly tell us
  how you were able to determine that these remains are not those of Angelina
  Frood?"</p>

  <p>"It is a matter of simple inference," replied Thorndyke. "On the 26th of
  April last Mrs. Frood is known to have been alive. It has been assumed that
  on that night or the next her body was built up in the wall. If that had
  really happened, when the wall was opened on the 20th of July, the body would
  have been found intact and perfectly recognizable!"</p>

  <p>"You are not overlooking the circumstance that it was buried in a bed of
  quick-lime?" said the coroner.</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke; "in fact that is the circumstance that makes it
  quite certain that these remains are not those of Angelina Frood. There is,"
  he continued, "a widely prevalent belief that quick-lime has the property of
  completely consuming and destroying organic substances such as a dead human
  body. But that belief is quite erroneous. Quick-lime has no such properties.
  On the contrary, it has a strongly preservative effect on organic matter.
  Putrefaction is a change in organic matter which occurs only when that matter
  is more or less moist. If such matter is completely dried, putrefaction is
  prevented or arrested, and such dried, or mummified, matter will remain
  undecomposed almost indefinitely, as we see in the case of Egyptian mummies.
  But quick-lime has the property of abstracting the water from organic
  substances with which it is in contact; of rendering them completely dry. It
  thus acts as a very efficient preservative. If Mrs. Frood's body had been
  buried, when recently dead, three months ago in fresh quick-lime, it would by
  now have been reduced more or less to the condition of a mummy. It would not
  have been even partially destroyed, and it would have been easily
  recognizable."</p>

  <p>To this statement everyone present listened with profound attention and
  equally profound surprise; and a glance at the faces of the jurymen was
  sufficient to show that it had failed utterly to produce conviction. Even the
  coroner was evidently not satisfied, and, after a few moments' reflection
  with knitted brows, he stated his objection.</p>

  <p>"The belief in the destructive properties of lime," he said, "can hardly
  be accepted as a mere popular error. In the Crippen trial, you may remember
  that the question was raised, and one of the expert witnesses&mdash;no less
  an authority than Professor Pepper&mdash;gave it as his considered opinion
  that quick-lime has these destructive properties, and that if a body were
  buried in a sufficient quantity of quick-lime, that body would be entirely
  destroyed. You will agree, I think, that great weight attaches to the opinion
  of a man of Professor Pepper's great reputation."</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," Thorndyke agreed. "He was one of our greatest medico-legal
  authorities, though, on this subject, I think, his views differed from those
  generally held by medical jurists. But the point is that this was an opinion,
  and that no undeniable facts were then available. But since that time, the
  matter has been put to the test of actual experiment, and the results of
  those experiments are definite facts. It is no longer a matter of opinion but
  one of incontestable fact."</p>

  <p>"What are the experiments that you refer to'"</p>

  <p>"The first practical investigation was carried out by Mr. A. Lucas, the
  Director of the Government Analytical Laboratory and Assay Office at Cairo.
  He felt that the question was one of great medico-legal importance, and that
  it ought to be settled definitely. He accordingly carried out a number of
  experiments, of which he published the particulars in his treatise on
  'Forensic Chemistry.' I produce a copy of this book, with your
  permission."</p>

  <p>"Is this evidence admissible?" the foreman asked. "The witness can't swear
  to another man's experiments."</p>

  <p>"It is admissible in a coroner's court," was the reply.</p>

  <p>"We are not bound as rigidly by the rules of evidence as a criminal court,
  for instance. It is relevant to the inquiry, and I think we had better hear
  it."</p>

  <p>"I may say," said Thorndyke, "that I have repeated and confirmed these
  experiments; but I suggest that, as the published cases are the recognized
  authority, I be allowed to quote them before describing my confirmatory
  experiments."</p>

  <p>The coroner having agreed to this course, he continued: "The tests were
  made with the fresh bodies of young pigeons, which were plucked but not
  opened, and which were buried in boxes with loosely-fitted covers, filled
  respectively with dry earth, slaked lime, chlorinated lime, quick-lime, and
  quick-lime suddenly slaked with water. These bodies were left thus buried for
  six months, the boxes being placed on the laboratory roof at Cairo. At the
  end of that period the bodies were disinterred and examined with the
  following results: The body which had been buried in dry earth was found to
  be in a very bad condition. There was a considerable smell of putrefaction
  and a large part of the flesh had disappeared. The body which had been buried
  in quick-lime was found to be in good condition; it was dry and hard, the
  skin was unbroken, but the body was naturally shrunken. The other three
  bodies do not concern us, but I may say that none of them was as completely
  preserved as the one that was buried in quick-lime.</p>

  <p>"On reading the account of these experiments I decided to repeat them,
  partly for confirmation and partly to enable me to give direct evidence as to
  the effect of lime on dead bodies. I used freshly-killed rabbits from which
  the fur was removed by shaving, and buried them in roomy boxes in the same
  materials as were used in the published experiments. They were left
  undisturbed during the six summer months, and were then exhumed and examined.
  The rabbit which had been buried in dry earth was in an advanced stage of
  putrefaction; the one which had been buried in quick-lime was free from any
  odour of decomposition, the skin was intact, and the body unaltered excepting
  that it was dry and rather shrivelled&mdash;mummified, in fact. It was more
  completely preserved than any of the others."</p>

  <p>The conclusion of this statement was followed by a slightly uncomfortable
  silence. The coroner stroked his chin reflectively, and the jurymen looked at
  one another with obvious doubt and distrust. At length Mr. Pilley gave voice
  to the collective sentiments.</p>

  <p>"It's all very well, sir, for this learned gentleman to explain to us that
  the lime couldn't have eaten up the body of the deceased. But it has. We've
  seen the bare bones with our own eyes. What's the use of saying a thing is
  impossible when it has happened?"</p>

  <p>Here Thorndyke produced from his pocket a sheet of notepaper and a
  fountain pen, and began to write rapidly, noting down, as I supposed, the
  jurymen's objections; which, however, the coroner proceeded to answer.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Thorndyke's statement was that these bones are not the bones of
  Angelina Frood. That the body was not her body."</p>

  <p>"Still," said the foreman, "it was somebody's body, you know. And the lime
  seems to have eaten it up pretty clean, possible or impossible."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said the coroner. "The destruction of this particular body
  appears to be an undeniable fact; and we may assume that one body is very
  much like another&mdash;in a chemical sense, at least. What do you say,
  doctor?"</p>

  <p>"My statement," replied Thorndyke, "had reference to Angelina Frood, who
  is known to have been alive on a certain date. Of the condition of the
  unknown body that was buried in the wall, I can give no opinion."</p>

  <p>Again there was an uncomfortable silence, during which Thorndyke, having
  finished writing, folded the sheet of notepaper, tucked the end in securely,
  and wrote an address on the back. Then he handed it to his neighbour, who
  passed it on until it reached me. I was on the point of opening it when I
  observed with astonishment that it was addressed to Peter Bundy, Esq., to
  whom I immediately handed it. But my astonishment was nothing to Bundy's. He
  seemed positively thunderstruck. Indeed, his aspect was so extraordinary as
  he sat gazing wildly at the opened note, that I forgot my manners and frankly
  stared at him. First he turned scarlet; then he grew deathly pale; and then
  he turned scarlet again. And, for the first and only time in my life, I saw
  him look really angry. But this was only a passing manifestation. For a few
  moments his eyes flashed and his mouth set hard. Then, quite suddenly, the
  wrath faded from his face and gave place to a whimsical smile. He tore off
  the fly-leaf of the note, and, scribbling a few words on it, folded it up
  small, addressed it to Dr. Thorndyke, and handed it to me for transmission by
  the return route.</p>

  <p>When it reached Thorndyke, he opened it, and, having read the brief
  message, nodded gravely to Bundy, and once more turned his attention to the
  foreman, who was addressing the coroner at greater length.</p>

  <p>"The jury wish to say, sir, that this evidence is not satisfactory. It
  can't be reconciled with the other evidence. The facts before the jury are
  these: On the 26th of April Angelina Frood disappeared, and was never
  afterwards seen alive. On the night that she disappeared, or on the next
  night, a dead body was buried in the wall. Three months later that body was
  found in the wall, packed in quick-lime, and eaten away to a skeleton. That
  skeleton has been examined by an expert, and found to be that of a woman of
  similar size and age to Angelina Frood. With that skeleton were found
  articles of clothing, jewellery, and ornaments which have been proved to have
  been the clothing and property of Angelina Frood. Other articles of clothing
  have been recovered from the river; and those articles were missing from the
  body when it was found in the wall. On these facts, the jury feel that it is
  impossible to doubt that the remains found in the wall are the remains of
  Angelina Frood."</p>

  <p>As the foreman concluded the coroner turned to Thorndyke with a slightly
  puzzled smile. "Of course, Doctor," said he, "you have considered those facts
  that the foreman has summarized so admirably. What do you say to his
  conclusion?"</p>

  <p>"I must still contest it," replied Thorndyke. "The foreman's summary of
  the evidence, masterly as it was, furnishes no answer to the
  objection&mdash;based on established chemical facts&mdash;that the condition
  of the remains when found is irreconcilable with the alleged circumstances of
  the burial."</p>

  <p>The coroner raised his eyebrows and pursed up his lips.</p>

  <p>"I appreciate your point, Doctor," said he. "But we are on the horns of a
  dilemma. We are between the Devil of observed fact and the Deep Sea of
  scientific demonstration. Can you suggest any way out of the difficulty?"</p>

  <p>"I think," said Thorndyke, "that if you were to call Mr. Bundy, he might
  be able to help you out of your dilemma."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bundy!" exclaimed the coroner. "I didn't know he was concerned in the
  case. Can you give us any information, Mr. Bundy?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Bundy, looking somewhat shy and nervous. "I think I could
  throw a little light on the case."</p>

  <p>"I wish to goodness you had said so before. However, better late than
  never. We will take your evidence at once."</p>

  <p>On this Thorndyke returned to his seat at the table and Bundy took his
  place, standing by the chair which Thorndyke had resigned.</p>

  <p>"Let me see, Mr. Bundy," said the coroner, "your Christian name
  is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The witness has not been sworn," interrupted Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>The coroner smiled. "We are in the hands of the regular practitioners," he
  chuckled. "We must mind our p's and q's. Still you are quite right, Doctor.
  The name is part of the evidence."</p>

  <p>The witness was accordingly sworn, and the coroner then proceeded,
  smilingly: "Now, Mr. Bundy, be very careful. You are making a sworn
  statement, remember. What is your Christian name?"</p>

  <p>"Angelina," was the astounding reply.</p>

  <p>"Angelina!" bawled Pilley. "It can't be. Why, it's a woman's name."</p>

  <p>"We must presume that the witness knows his own name," said the coroner,
  writing it down. "Angelina Bundy."</p>

  <p>"No, Sir," said the witness. "Angelina Frood."</p>

  <p>The coroner suddenly stiffened with the upraised pen poised in the air;
  and so everyone in the room, including myself, underwent an instantaneous
  arrest of movement as if we had been turned into stone; and I noticed that
  the process of petrifaction had caught us all with our mouths open. But
  whereas the fixed faces on which I looked, expressed amazement qualified by
  incredulity, my own astonishment was coupled with conviction. Astounding as
  the statement was, the moment that it was made I knew that it was true. In
  spite of the discrepancies of appearance, I realized in a flash of
  enlightenment, the nature of that subtle influence that had drawn me to Bundy
  with a tenderness hardly congruous with mere male friendship. Outwardly I had
  been deceived, but my sub-conscious self had recognized Angelina all the
  time.</p>

  <p>The interval of breathless silence, during which the witness calmly
  surveyed the court through his&mdash;or rather her&mdash;eyeglass, was at
  length broken by the coroner, who asked gravely: "This is not a joke? You
  affirm seriously that you are Angelina Frood?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I am Angelina Frood," was the reply.</p>

  <p>Here Mr. Pilley recovered himself and demanded excitedly: "Do we
  understand this gentleman to say that he is the deceased?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied the coroner, "he is obviously not deceased, and he states
  that he is not a gentleman. He has declared that he is a lady."</p>

  <p>"But," protested Pilley, "he says that she&mdash;at least she says that
  he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are getting mixed, Pilley," interrupted the foreman. "This appears to
  be a woman masquerading as a man and playing practical jokes on a coroner's
  jury. I suggest, sir, that we ought to have evidence of identity."</p>

  <p>"I agree with you, emphatically," said the coroner.</p>

  <p>"The identification is indispensable. Is there anyone present who can
  swear to the identity of this-er-person! Mr. Japp, for instance?"</p>

  <p>"I'd rather you didn't bring Mr. Japp into it," said Angelina, hastily.
  "It isn't really necessary. If you will allow me to run home and change my
  clothes, Mrs. Gillow and Dr. Strangeways will be able to identify me. And I
  can bring some photographs to show the jury."</p>

  <p>"That seems quite a good suggestion," said the coroner.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think so, gentlemen?"</p>

  <p>"It is a very proper suggestion," said the foreman, severely. "Let her go
  away and clothe herself decently. How long will she be gone?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be back in less than half an hour,'" said Angelina; and on this
  understanding she was given permission to retire. I watched her with a tumult
  of mixed emotions as she took up her hat, gloves, and stick, and strolled
  jauntily towards the door. There she paused for an instant and shot at me a
  single, swift, whimsical glance through her monocle. Then she went out; and
  with her disappeared for ever the familiar figure of Peter Bundy.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;THE UNCONTRITE PENITENT</h3>

  <p>As the door closed on Angelina, a buzz of excited talk broke out. The
  astonished jurymen put their heads together and eagerly discussed the new
  turn of events, while the coroner sat with a deeply cogitative expression,
  evidently thinking hard and casting an occasional speculative glance in
  Thorndyke's direction. Meanwhile Cobbledick edged up to my side and presented
  his views in a soft undertone.</p>

  <p>"This is a facer, Doctor, isn't it? Regular do. My word! Just think of the
  artfulness of that young woman, toting us round and helping us to find the
  things that she had just popped down for us to find. I call it a
  masterpiece." He chuckled admiringly, and added in a lower tone, "I hope she
  hasn't got herself into any kind of mess."</p>

  <p>I looked at Cobbledick with renewed appreciation. I had always liked the
  sergeant. He was a capable man and a kindly one; and now he was showing a
  largeness of soul that won my respect and my gratitude, too. A small man
  would have been furious with Angelina, but Cobbledick took her performances
  in a proper sporting spirit. He was only amused and admiring. Not for nothing
  had Nature imprinted on his face that benevolent smile.</p>

  <p>Presently Mr. Pilley, who seemed to have a special gift for the expression
  of erroneous opinions, addressed himself to the coroner.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Chairman," he said cheerfully, "I suppose we can consider the
  inquest practically over."</p>

  <p>"Over!" exclaimed the astonished coroner.</p>

  <p>"Yes. We were inquiring into the death of Angelina Frood. But if Mrs.
  Frood is alive after all, why, there's an end to the matter."</p>

  <p>"What about the body in the mortuary?" demanded the foreman.</p>

  <p>"Oh, ah," said Pilley. "I had forgotten about that." He looked owlishly at
  the coroner and then exclaimed:</p>

  <p>"But that is the body of Mrs. Frood!"</p>

  <p>"It can't be if Mrs. Frood is alive," the coroner reminded him.</p>

  <p>"But it must be," persisted Pilley. "It has been identified as her, and it
  had her clothes and ring on. Mr. Bundy must have been pulling our legs."</p>

  <p>"There is certainly something very mysterious about that body," said the
  coroner. "It was dressed in Mrs. Frood's clothes, as Mr. Pilley points out,
  and it appears that Mrs. Frood must be in some way connected with it."</p>

  <p>"There's no doubt about that," agreed the foreman.</p>

  <p>"She must know who that dead person is and how the body came to be in the
  place where it was found, and she will have to give an account of it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coroner. "But it is a mysterious affair. I wonder if Dr.
  Thorndyke could enlighten us. He seems to know more about the matter than
  anybody else."</p>

  <p>But Thorndyke was not to be drawn into any statement.</p>

  <p>"It would be merely a conjecture on my part," he said. "Presumably Mrs.
  Frood knows how the remains got into the wall, and I must leave her to give
  the necessary explanations."</p>

  <p>"I don't see what explanations she can give," said the foreman. "It looks
  like a clear case of wilful murder. And it is against her."</p>

  <p>To this view the coroner gave a guarded assent; and indeed it was the
  obvious view. There was the body, in Angelina's clothing, and everything
  pointed clearly to Angelina's complicity in the crime, if there had really
  been a crime committed. And what other explanation was possible?</p>

  <p>As I reflected on the foreman's ominous words, I was sensible of a growing
  alarm. What if Angelina had been, as it were, snatched from the grave only to
  be placed in the dock on a charge of murder? That she could possibly be
  guilty of a crime did not enter my mind. But there was evidently some sort of
  criminal entanglement from which she might find it hard to escape. The
  appearances were sinister in the extreme; her simulated disappearance, her
  disguise, her suspicious silence during the inquiry; to any eye but mine they
  were conclusive evidence of her guilt. And the more I thought about it, the
  more deadly did the sum of that evidence appear, until, as the time ran on, I
  became positively sick with terror.</p>

  <p>The opening of a door and a sudden murmur of surprise caused me to turn;
  and there was Angelina herself. But not quite the Angelina that I remembered.
  Gone were the pallid complexion, the weary, dark-circled eyes, the down-cast
  mouth, the sad and pensive countenance, the dark, strong eye-brows.
  Rosy-cheeked, smiling, confident, and looking strangely tall and imposing,
  she stepped composedly over to the head of the table, and stood there gazing
  with calm self-possession, and the trace of a smile at the stupefied
  jurymen.</p>

  <p>"Your name is&mdash;?" said the coroner, gazing at her in
  astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Angelina Frood," was the quiet reply; and the voice was Bundy's
  voice.</p>

  <p>Here Pilley rose, bubbling with excitement. "This isn't the same person!"
  he exclaimed. "Why, he was a little man, and she's a tall woman. And his hair
  was short, and just look at hers! You .can't grow a head of hair like that in
  twenty minutes."</p>

  <p>"No," Angelina agreed, suavely. "I wish you could."</p>

  <p>"The objection is not relevant, Mr. Pilley," said the coroner, suppressing
  a smile. "We are not concerned with the identity of Mr. Bundy but with that
  of Angelina Frood. Can anyone identify this lady?"</p>

  <p>"I can," said I. "I swear that she is .Angelina Frood."</p>

  <p>"And Mrs. Gillow?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gillow could and did identify her late lodger, and furthermore, burst
  into tears and filled the court-room with "yoops" of hysterical joy. When she
  had been pacified and gently restrained by the coroner's officer from an
  attempt to embrace the witness, the coroner proceeded:</p>

  <p>"Now, Mrs. Frood, the jury require certain explanations from you, in
  regard to the body of a woman which is at present lying in the mortuary and
  which was found buried in the city wall with certain articles of clothing and
  jewellery which have been identified as your property. Did you know that that
  body had been buried in the wall?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Angelina.</p>

  <p>"Do you know how it came to be in the wall?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I put it there."</p>

  <p>"You put it there!" roared Pilley, amidst a chorus of exclamations from
  the jurymen. The coroner held up his hand to enjoin silence and asked, as he
  gazed in astonishment at Angelina.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell us who this deceased person was?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't," Angelina replied, apologetically. "I don't think her
  name was known."</p>

  <p>"But-er-" the astounded coroner inquired, "how did she come by her
  death?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I can't tell you that either," replied Angelina. "The fact is,
  I never asked."</p>

  <p>"You never asked!" the coroner repeated, in a tone of bewilderment.
  "But-er-are we to understand that in short, did you or did you not cause the
  death of this person by your own act? Of course," he added hastily, "you are
  not bound to answer that question."</p>

  <p>Angelina smiled at him engagingly. "I will answer with pleasure. I did not
  cause the death of this person."</p>

  <p>"Then are we to understand that she was already dead when you found
  her'"</p>

  <p>"I didn't find her. I bought her; at a shop in Great St. Andrew-street. I
  gave four pounds, fourteen and three-pence for her, including two and
  three-pence to Carter Paterson's. I've brought the bill with me."</p>

  <p>She produced the bill from her pocket and handed it to the coroner, who
  read it with a portentous frown and a perceptible twitching at the corners of
  his mouth.</p>

  <p>"I will read this document to you, gentlemen," he said in a slightly
  unsteady voice. "It is dated the 19th of April, and reads: 'Bought of Oscar
  Hammerstein, Dealer in Human and Comparative Osteology, Great St.
  Andrew-street, London, W. C., one complete set superfine human osteology,
  disarticulated and unbleached (female), as selected by purchaser, four pounds
  eight shillings and sixpence. Replacing and cementing missing teeth, one
  shilling and sixpence. Packing case, two shillings. Carriage, two and three
  pence. Total, four pounds, fourteen and three-pence. Received with thanks, O.
  Hammerstein.' Perhaps you would like to see the bill, yourselves,
  gentlemen."</p>

  <p>He passed it to the foreman, taking a quick glance out of the corners of
  his eyes at the bland and impassive Angelina, and the jury studied it in a
  deep silence, which was broken only by a soft, gurgling sound, from somewhere
  behind me, which, I discovered, on looking round, to proceed from Sergeant
  Cobbledick, whose crimsoned face was partly hidden by a large handkerchief
  and whose shoulders moved convulsively.</p>

  <p>Presently the coroner addressed Thorndyke. "In continuation of your
  evidence, Doctor, does Mrs. Frood's explanation agree with any conclusions
  that you had arrived at from your inspection of the remains?"</p>

  <p>"It agrees with them completely," Thorndyke replied with a grim smile.</p>

  <p>The coroner entered the answer in the depositions, and then turned once
  more to Angelina.</p>

  <p>"With regard to the objects that were found with the skeleton; did you put
  them there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I put in the metal things and a few pieces of scorched rag to give a
  realistic effect&mdash;on account of the lime, you know."</p>

  <p>"And the articles that were recovered from the river, too, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I put them down&mdash;with proper precautions, of course."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by proper precautions?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I couldn't afford to waste any of the things, so I used to keep a
  lookout with a telescope, and then, when I saw a likely person coming along,
  I put one of the things down where it could be seen."</p>

  <p>"And were they always seen?"</p>

  <p>"No. Some people are very unobservant. In that case I picked it up when
  the coast was clear and saved it for another time."</p>

  <p>The coroner chuckled. "It was all very ingenious and complete. But now,
  Mrs. Frood, we have to ask you what was the object of these extraordinary
  proceedings. It was not a joke, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not at all," replied Angelina. "It was a perfectly serious affair.
  You have heard what sort of husband I had. I couldn't possibly live with him.
  I made several attempts to get away and live by myself, but he always
  followed me and found me out. So I determined to disappear altogether."</p>

  <p>"You could have applied for a separation," said the coroner.</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have got it," replied Angelina, "and even if I had, of what
  use would it have been? I should have been bound to him for life. I couldn't
  have married anyone else. My whole life would have been spoilt. So I decided
  to disappear completely and for good, and start life afresh in a new place
  and under a new name. And in order that there should be no mistake about it,
  I thought I would leave the-er-the material for a coroner's inquest and a
  will directing that a suitable monument should be put up over my grave. Then,
  if I had ever married again, there would have been no danger of a charge of
  bigamy. If anyone had made any such suggestion, I could have referred them to
  the registrar of deaths and to the tombstone of Angelina Frood in Rochester
  churchyard."</p>

  <p>"And as to a birth certificate under your new name?" the coroner asked
  with a twinkle of his eye.</p>

  <p>Angelina smiled a prim little smile. "I think that could have been
  managed," she said.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the coroner, "it was an ingenious scheme. But apparently Dr.
  Thorndyke knew who Mr. Bundy was. How do you suppose he discovered your
  identity?"</p>

  <p>"That is just what I should like to know," she replied.</p>

  <p>"So should I," said the coroner, with a broad smile; "but, of course, it
  isn't my affair or that of the jury. We are concerned with this skeleton that
  you have planted on us. I suppose you can give us no idea as to where it came
  from originally?"</p>

  <p>"The dealer said it had been found in a barrow-not a wheel-barrow, you
  know; an ancient burial-place. Of course, I don't know whether he was
  speaking the truth."</p>

  <p>"What do you think, Dr. Thorndyke?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"I think it is an ancient skeleton, though very well preserved. Some of
  the teeth&mdash;the original ones&mdash;show more wear than one expects to
  find in a modern skull. But I only made a cursory inspection."</p>

  <p>"I think the evidence is sufficient for our purpose," said the coroner;
  "and that really concludes the case, so we need not detain you any longer,
  Mrs. Frood. I don't know exactly what your legal position is; whether you
  have committed any legal offence. If you have, it is not our business; and I
  think I am expressing the sentiments of the jury if I say that I hope that
  the authorities will not make it their business. No one has been injured, and
  no action seems to be called for."</p>

  <p>With these sentiments the jury concurred warmly, as also did Sergeant
  Cobbledick, who was heard, very audibly and regardless of the proprieties, to
  murmur "Hear, hear." We waited to learn the nature of the verdict, and when
  this had been pronounced (to the effect that the skeleton was that of an
  unknown woman, concerning the circumstances of whose death no evidence was
  available), the court rose and we prepared to depart.</p>

  <p>"You are coming back to lunch with us, Angelina?" said I.</p>

  <p>"I should love to," she replied, "but there is Mr. Japp. Do you think you
  could ask him, too?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," I replied, with a sudden perception of the advantage of even
  numbers. "We shouldn't be complete without him."</p>

  <p>Japp accepted with enthusiasm, and, after a hasty farewell to Cobbledick,
  we went forth into the High Street, by no means unobserved of the populace.
  As we approached the neighbourhood of the office Angelina said:</p>

  <p>"I must run into my rooms for a few moments just to tidy myself up a
  little. It was such a very hurried toilette. I won't be more than a few
  minutes. You needn't wait for me."</p>

  <p>"I suggest," said Thorndyke, "that Mr. Japp and I go on and break the news
  to Mrs. Dunk that there is a lady guest, and that Strangeways remains behind
  to escort the prisoner."</p>

  <p>I fell in readily with this admirable suggestion, and as the two men
  walked on, I followed Angelina up the steps and waited while she plied her
  latch-key. We entered the hall together and then went into the sitting-room,
  where she stood for a moment, looking round with deep satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"It's nice to be home again," she said, "and to feel that all that fuss is
  over."</p>

  <p>"I daresay it is," said I. "But now that you are home, what have you got
  to say for yourself? You are a nice little baggage, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I am a little beast, John," she replied. "I've been a perfect pig to you.
  But I didn't mean to be, and I really couldn't help it. You'll try to forgive
  me, won't you?"</p>

  <p>"The fact is, Angelina," I said, "I am afraid I am in love with you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I hope to goodness you are, John," she exclaimed. "If I thought you
  weren't I should wish myself a skeleton again. Do you think you really
  are?"</p>

  <p>She crept closer to me with such a sweet, wheedlesome air that I suddenly
  caught her in my arms and kissed her.</p>

  <p>"It does seem as if you were," she admitted with a roguish smile; and
  then&mdash;such unaccountable creatures are women&mdash;she laid her head on
  my shoulder and began to sob. But this was only a passing shower. Another
  kiss brought back the sunshine and then she tripped away to spread fresh
  entanglements for the masculine heart.</p>

  <p>In a few minutes she returned, further adorned and looking to my eyes the
  very picture of womanly sweetness and grace. When I had given confirmatory
  evidence of my sentiments towards her, we went out, just in time to encounter
  Mrs. Gillow and acquaint her with the program.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Angelina, glancing furtively at a little party of women
  who were glancing, not at all furtively, at her, "one should be gratified at
  the interest shown by one's fellow towns-people; but don't you think the back
  streets would be preferable to the High-street?"</p>

  <p>"It is no use, my dear," I replied. "We've got to face it. Take no notice.
  Regard these bipeds that infest the footways as mere samples of the local
  fauna. Let them stare and ignore them. For my part, I rather like them. They
  impress on me the admirable bargain that I have made in swapping Peter Bundy
  for a beautiful lady."</p>

  <p>"Poor Peter," she said, pensively. "He was a sad boy sometimes when he
  looked at his big, handsome John and thought that mere friendship was all
  that he could hope for when his poor little heart was starving for love. Your
  deal isn't the only successful one, John, so you needn't be so conceited. But
  here we are home&mdash;really home, this time, for this has been my real
  home, John, dear. And there&mdash;Oh! Moses I&mdash;there is Mrs. Dunk,
  waiting to receive us!"</p>

  <p>"What used you to do to Mrs. Dunk," I asked, "to make her so furious?"</p>

  <p>"I only used to inquire after her health," Angelina replied plaintively.
  "But mum's the word. She'll spot my voice as soon as I speak."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Dunk held the door open ceremoniously and curtsied as we entered. She
  was a gruff old woman, but she had a deep respect for "gentlefolk," as is apt
  to be the way with old servants. Angelina acknowledged her salutation with a
  gracious smile and followed her meekly up the stairs to the room that Mrs.
  Dunk had allotted to her.</p>

  <p>I found Thorndyke and Japp established in the library&mdash;Dr. Partridge
  had dispensed with a drawing-room and I followed his excellent
  example&mdash;and here presently Angelina joined us, sailing majestically
  into the room and marching up to Thorndyke with an air at once hostile and
  defiant.</p>

  <p>"Serpent," said Angelina.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Thorndyke dissented with a smile. "You should be grateful to
  me for having rescued you from your own barbed-wire entanglements."</p>

  <p>"Serpent, I repeat," persisted Angelina. "To let me sit in that court-room
  watching all the innocents walking into my trap one after another, and then,
  just as I thought they were all inside, to hand me a thing like that!" and
  she produced, dramatically, a small sheet of paper, which I recognized as the
  remainder of Thorndyke's note. I took it from her, and read: "You see whither
  the evidence is leading. The deception cannot be maintained, nor is there any
  need, now that your husband is dead. Explanations must be given either by you
  or by me. For your own sake I urge you to explain everything and clear
  yourself. Let me know what you will do."</p>

  <p>"This is an extraordinary document," I said, passing it to Japp. "How in
  the name of Fortune did you know that Bundy was Angelina?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, how did you?" the latter demanded. "It is for you to give an
  explanation now."</p>

  <p>"We will have the explanations after lunch," said he; "mutual
  explanations. I want to hear how far I was correct in details."</p>

  <p>"Very well," agreed Angelina, "we will both explain. But you will have the
  first innings. You are not going to listen to my explanation and then say you
  knew all about it. And that reminds me, John, that you had better tell Mrs.
  Dunk. She is sure to recognize my voice."</p>

  <p>I quite agreed with Angelina and hurried away to intercept Mrs. Dunk and
  let her know the position. She was at first decidedly shocked, but a vivid
  and detailed description of the late Mr. Frood produced a complete revulsion;
  so complete, in fact, as to lead me to speculate on the personal
  characteristics of the late Mr. Dunk. But her curiosity was aroused to such
  an extent that, while waiting at table, she hardly removed her eyes from
  Angelina, until the latter, finding the scrutiny unbearable, suddenly
  produced the hated eye-glass, and, sticking it in her eye, directed a stern
  glance at the old woman, who instantly backed towards the door with a growl
  of alarm, and then sniggered hoarsely.</p>

  <p>It was a festive occasion, for we were all in exuberant spirits, including
  Mr. Japp, who, if he said little, made up the deficiency in smiles of
  forty-wrinkle power, which, together with his upstanding tuft of white hair,
  made him look like a convivial cockatoo.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember our last meeting at this table'" said Angelina, "when I
  jeered at the famous expert and pulled his reverend leg, thinking what a
  smart young fellow I was, and how beautifully I was bamboozling him? And all
  the while he knew! He knew! And 'Not a word said the hard-boiled egg.' Oh,
  serpent! serpent!"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled. "You didn't leave the hardboiled egg much to say," he
  observed.</p>

  <p>"No. But why were you so secret? Why didn't you let on, just a little, to
  give poor Bundy a hint as to where he was plunging?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Mrs. Frood&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, call me Angelina," she interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said he. "Well, my dear Angelina, you are forgetting that I
  didn't know what was in the wall."</p>

  <p>"My goodness!" she exclaimed. "I had overlooked that. Of course, it might
  have been&mdash;Good gracious! How awful!" She paused with her eyes fixed on
  Thorndyke, and then asked: "Supposing it had been?"</p>

  <p>"I refuse to suppose anything of the kind," he replied. "My explanations
  will deal with the actual, not with the hypothetical."</p>

  <p>There was silence for a minute or two. Like Angelina, I was speculating on
  what Thorndyke would have done if the remains had been real remains&mdash;and
  those of a man. He had evidently sympathized warmly with the hunted wife; but
  if her defence had taken the form of a crime, would he have exposed her? It
  was useless to ask him. I have often thought about it since, but have never
  reached a conclusion.</p>

  <p>"You will have to answer questions better than that presently," said
  Angelina; "but I won't ask you any more now. You shall finish your lunch in
  peace, and then&mdash;into the witness-box you go. I am going to have
  satisfaction for that note."</p>

  <p>The little festival went on, unhurried, with an abundance of cheerful and
  rather frivolous talk. But at last, like all fugitive things, it came to an
  end. The table was cleared, and garnished with the port decanter and the
  coffee service, and Mrs. Dunk, with a final glower, half-defiant and
  half-admiring, at Angelina, took her departure.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Angelina, as I poured out the coffee, "the time has come to
  talk of many things, but especially of expert investigations into the
  identity of Peter Bundy. Your lead, Sir."</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XIX&mdash;EXPLANATIONS</h3>

  <p>"The investigation of this case," Thorndyke began, "falls naturally into
  two separate inquiries: that relating to the crime and that which is
  concerned with what we may conveniently call the personation. They make
  certain contacts, but they are best considered separately. Let us begin with
  the crime.</p>

  <p>"Now, to a person having experience of real crime, there was, in this
  case, from the very beginning, something rather abnormal. A woman of good
  social position had disappeared. There was a suggestion that she had been
  murdered; and the murder had apparently been committed in some public place,
  that is to say, not in a house. But in such cases, normally, the first
  evidence of the crime is furnished by the discovery of the body. It is true
  that, in this case, there was a suggestion that the body had been flung into
  the river, and this, at first, masked the abnormality to some extent. But
  even then there was the discrepancy that the brooch, which was attached to
  the person, appeared to have been found on land, while the bag, which was not
  attached to the person, was picked up at the water's edge. The bag itself,
  and the box which had been in it, presented several inconsistencies.</p>

  <p>"They had apparently been lying unnoticed for eleven days on a piece of
  shore that was crowded with small craft and frequently by numbers of seamen
  and labourers, and that formed a play-ground for the waterside children. The
  clean state of the box when found showed that it had neither been handled nor
  immersed, and as the wrapping-paper was intact, the person who had taken it
  out of the bag must have thrown it away without opening it to see what it
  contained. The bag was found under some light rubbish. That rubbish had not
  been thrown on it by the water, or the bag would have been soaked; and no one
  could have thrown the rubbish on it without seeing the bag, which was an
  article of some value. Again, the bag had not been carried to this place by
  the water, as was proved by its condition.</p>

  <p>"Therefore, either this was the place where the crime had been committed,
  or someone had brought the bag to this place and thrown it away. But neither
  supposition was reasonably probable. It was inconceivable that a person like
  Mrs. Frood should have been in this remote, inaccessible, disreputable place
  at such an hour. The bag could not have been brought here by an innocent
  person, for no such person would have thrown it away. It was quite a valuable
  bag. And a guilty person would have thrown it in the river, and probably put
  a stone in it to sink it. So you see that these first clues were strikingly
  abnormal. They prepared one to consider the possibility of false tracks. Even
  the brooch incident had a faint suggestion of the same kind when considered
  with the other clues. The man who pawned the brooch had a mole on his nose.
  Such an adornment can be easily produced artificially. It is highly
  distinctive of the person who possesses it, and it is equally
  distinctive&mdash;negatively&mdash;of the person who does not possess it.
  Then there was the character of the person who had disappeared. She was a
  woman who was seeking to escape from her husband; and hitherto she had not
  succeeded because she had not hidden herself securely enough. She was a
  person of a somewhat disappearing tendency. She had an understandable motive
  for disappearing.</p>

  <p>"From the very beginning, therefore, the possibility of voluntary
  disappearance had to be borne in mind. And when it was, each new clue seemed
  to support it. There was the scarf, for instance. It was found under a
  fish-trunk; an unlikely place for it to have got by chance, but an excellent
  one for a 'plant.' The scarf was not baldly exposed, but someone was sure to
  turn the trunk over and find it. And at this point another peculiarity began
  to develop. There was a noticeable tendency for the successive 'finds' to
  creep up the river from Chatham towards Rochester Bridge. It was not yet very
  remarkable, but I noticed it, as I entered each find on my map. The brooch
  was associated with Chatham, the bag and box with the Chatham shore a little
  farther up, the scarf with the Rochester shore at Blue Boar Head. As I say,
  it attracted my attention; and when the first shoe was found above Blue Boar
  Head, the second shoe farther up still, and the hat-pin yet farther up
  towards the bridge, it became impossible to ignore it. There was no natural
  explanation. Whether the body were floating or stationary, the constancy of
  direction was inexplicable; for the tide sweeps up and down twice daily, and
  objects detached from the body would be carried up or down stream, according
  to the direction of the tide when they became detached. This regular order
  was a most suspicious circumstance. Later, when the objects were found in
  Black Boy-lane, it became absurd. It was a mere paper-chase. Just look at my
  map."</p>

  <p>He exhibited the large-scale map, on which each "find" was marked by a
  small circle. The series of circles, joined by a connecting line, proceeded
  directly from near Sun Pier, Chatham, along the shore, and up Black Boy-lane
  to the gate of the waste ground, and across it to the wall.</p>

  <p>Angelina giggled. "You can't say I didn't make it as easy as I could for
  poor old Cobbledick," she said. "Of course, I never reckoned on anyone
  bringing up the heavy guns. By the way, I wonder who your private client was.
  Do you know, John'" she added, with a sudden glance of suspicion; and, as I
  grinned sheepishly, she exclaimed: "Well! I wouldn't have believed it. It was
  a regular conspiracy. But I am interrupting the expert. Proceed, my
  lord."</p>

  <p>"Well," Thorndyke resumed, "we have considered the aspect of the crime
  problem taken by itself, as it appeared to an experienced investigator. From
  the first there was a suspicion that the clues were counterfeit, and with
  each new clue this suspicion deepened. And you will notice an important
  corollary. If the case was a fraud, that fraud was being worked by someone on
  the spot. Keep that point in mind, for it has a most significant bearing on
  the other problem, that of the personation, to which we will now turn our
  attention. But before we go into details, there are certain general
  considerations that we ought to note, in order that we may understand more
  clearly how the deception became possible.</p>

  <p>"The subject of personation and disguise is often misunderstood. It is apt
  to be supposed that a disguise effects a complete transformation resulting in
  a complete resemblance to the individual personated&mdash;or, as in this
  case, a complete disappearance of the identity of the disguised person. But
  no such transformation is possible. All disguise is a form of bluff. It acts
  by suggestion. And the suggestion is effected by a set of misleading
  circumstances which produce in the dupe a state of mind in which a very
  imperfect disguise serves to produce conviction. That is the psychology of
  personation, and I can only express my admiration of the way in which
  Angelina had grasped it. Her conduct of this delicate deception was really
  masterly. Let us consider it in more detail.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bundy was ostensibly a man. But if he had been put in a room with a
  dozen moderately intelligent persons, and those persons had been asked, 'Is
  this individual a man? or is he a woman with short hair and dressed in man's
  clothing?' they would probably have decided unanimously that he was a woman.
  But the question never was asked. The issue was never raised. He was Mr.
  Bundy. One doesn't look at young men to see if they are women in
  disguise.</p>

  <p>"Then consider the position of Strangeways&mdash;the chosen victim. He
  comes to a strange town to transact business with a firm of land agents. He
  goes into the office, and finds the partners&mdash;whose names are on the
  plate outside, and to whom he has been sent by his London agent-engaged in
  their normal avocations. He transacts his business with them in a normal way,
  and Mr. Bundy seems to be an ordinary, capable young man. He goes back later
  and interviews Mr. Bundy, who is just on the point of taking him to introduce
  him to Mrs. Frood, when he is called away. Then, within a few minutes, he is
  taken to Mrs. Frood's house, where he finds that lady calmly engaged in
  needlework. Supposing Mrs. Frood had been extremely like Bundy, could it
  possibly have entered Strangeways's head that they might be one and the same
  person? Remember that he had left Bundy in another place only a few minutes
  before; and here was Mrs. Frood in her own apartments, with the appearance of
  having been there for hours. Obviously no such thought could have occurred to
  any man. There was nothing to suggest it.</p>

  <p>"But, in fact, Angelina was not perceptibly like Bundy on cursory
  inspection. They were markedly different in size. A woman always looks bigger
  than a man of the same height. Bundy was a little man and looked smaller than
  he was by reason of his very low heels; Angelina was a biggish woman and
  looked taller than she was by reason of her high heels and her hair.
  Disregarding her hair, she was fully two inches taller than Bundy.</p>

  <p>"Then the facial resemblance must have been slight. Angelina had a mass of
  hair and wore it low down on her brows and temples; Bundy's hair was short
  and was brushed back from his forehead. Angelina had strong, black eyebrows;
  Bundy's eyebrows were thin, or rather, cut off short. Angelina was pale,
  careworn, dark under the eyes, with drooping mouth, melancholy expression and
  depressed in manner; Bundy was fresh-coloured, smiling, gay and sprightly in
  manner and he wore an eye-glass&mdash;which has a surprising effect on facial
  expression. Their voices and intonation were strikingly different. Finally,
  Strangeways never saw Angelina excepting in a very subdued light in which any
  small resemblances in features would be unnoticeable.</p>

  <p>"And now observe another effect of suggestion. Strangeways had made the
  acquaintance of Mr. Bundy. Then he had made the acquaintance of Mrs. Frood.
  They were two separate persons; they were practically strangers to one
  another; they belonged to different sets of surroundings. He would never
  think of them in connexion with one another. They were two of his friends,
  mutually unacquainted. In this condition of separateness they would become
  established in his mind, and the conception of them as different persons
  would become confirmed by habit. It would be a permanent suggestion that
  would offer an obstacle to any future suggestion that they were the same.
  That was the advantage of introducing Bundy first, for if he had appeared
  only after Angelina had disappeared, there would have been no such opposing
  suggestion. The resemblances might have been noticed, and he might have been
  detected.</p>

  <p>"In passing I may remark upon the tact and judgment that were shown in the
  disguise. The troublesome makeup, the wig, the false eyebrows, the
  grease-paint, the false voice, all were concentrated on the temporary Mrs.
  Frood, who was to disappear. Bundy was not disguised at all, excepting for
  the eye-glass. He was simply Angelina with her hair cut short and dressed as
  a man. He hadn't even an assumed voice; for as Angelina is a contralto, and
  habitually speaks in the lower register, her voice would pass quite well as a
  light tenor, so long as she kept off the 'head notes.'</p>

  <p>"So much for the general aspects of the case. And now as to my own
  position. As I had never seen Angelina, I naturally should not perceive any
  resemblance to her in Bundy; but, equally with Strangeways, I was subject to
  the suggestion that Bundy was a man. The personal equation, however, was
  different. It is my professional habit to reject all mental suggestion so far
  as is possible; to sift out the facts and consider them with an open mind
  regardless of what they appear to suggest. And then you are to remember that
  when I first met Mr. Bundy, there was already in my mind a faint suspicion
  that this was not a genuine crime; that things were not quite what they
  appeared; and that if this were the case, the clues were being manipulated by
  somebody on the spot.</p>

  <p>"When I met Mr. Bundy, I looked him over as I look over every person whom
  I meet for the first time; and that inspection yielded one or two rather
  remarkable facts. I noticed that he wore exceptionally low heels and that he
  had several physical characteristics that were distinctively feminine. The
  very low heels puzzled me somewhat. If they had been exceptionally high there
  would have been nothing in it. But why should a noticeably short man wear
  almost abnormally low heels? I could think of no reason, unless he wore them
  for greater comfort, but I noted the fact and reserved it for further
  consideration.</p>

  <p>"Of his physical peculiarities, the first that attracted my attention was
  the shape of his hands. They were quite of the feminine type. Of course,
  hands vary, but still it was a fact to be noted, and the observation caused
  me to look him over a little more critically; and then I discovered a number
  of other feminine characteristics.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it may be useful to consider briefly the less obvious differences
  between the sexes&mdash;the more obvious ones would, of course, be provided
  for by the disguise. There are two principal groups of such differences; the
  one has reference to the distribution of bulk, the other to the direction of
  certain lines. Let us take the distribution of bulk. This exhibits opposite
  tendencies in the two sexes. In the female, the great mass is
  central&mdash;the hip region; and from this the form diminishes in both
  directions. The whole figure, including the arms, is contained in an
  elongated ellipse. And the tendency affects the individual members. The limbs
  are bulky where they join the trunk, they taper pretty regularly towards the
  extremities, and they terminate in relatively small hands and feet. The hands
  themselves taper as a whole, and the individual fingers taper markedly from a
  comparatively thick base to a pointed tip.</p>

  <p>"In the male figure the opposite condition prevails; it tends to be
  acromegalous. The central mass is relatively small, the peripheral masses is
  relatively large. The hip region is narrow, and there is a great widening
  towards the shoulders. The limbs taper much less towards the extremities, and
  they terminate in relatively large hands and feet. So, too, with the hands;
  they tend to be square in shape, and the individual fingers&mdash;excepting
  the index finger&mdash;are nearly as broad at the tips as at the base.</p>

  <p>"Of the second group of differences we need consider only one or two
  instances. The general rule is that certain contour lines tend in the male to
  be vertical or horizontal in direction and in the female to be oblique. A
  man's neck, at the back, is nearly straight and vertical; a woman's shows a
  sweeping oblique curve. The angle of a man's lower jaw is nearly a right
  angle; there is a vertical and a horizontal ramus. A woman's lower jaw has an
  open angle and its contour forms an oblique line from the ear to the chin.
  But the most distinctive difference is in the ear itself. A man's ear has its
  long diameter vertical; a woman's has the long diameter oblique; and the
  obliquity is usually very marked.</p>

  <p>"Bearing these differences in mind, and remembering that they are subject
  to variation in individual cases, let us now return to Mr. Bundy. His hands,
  as I have said, had the feminine character. His feet were small even for a
  small man; his ears were set obliquely and the line of his jaw was oblique
  with an open angle. His shoulders had evidently been made up by the tailor,
  and he seemed rather wide across the hips for a man. In short, all those
  bodily characteristics which were not concealed or disguised by the clothing
  were feminine. It was a rather remarkable fact; so much so that I began to
  ask myself if it were possible that he might actually be a woman in
  disguise.</p>

  <p>"I watched him narrowly. There was nothing distinctive in his walk, but
  there was in the movements of the arms. He flourished his stick jauntily
  enough, but he had not that 'nice conduct of a clouded cane' that is as much
  a social cachet in our day as it was in the days of good Queen Anne. It needs
  a skill born of years of practice to manage a stick properly, as one realizes
  when one sees the working man taking his Malacca for its Sunday morning walk.
  Mr. Bundy had not that skill. His stick was a thing consciously carried; it
  was not a part of himself. Then the movement of the free arm was feminine.
  When a woman swings her arm she swings it through a large arc, especially in
  the backward direction&mdash;probably to avoid her hip&mdash;and the palm of
  the hand tends to be turned backward. A man's free arm either hangs
  motionless or swings slightly, unless he is walking very fast; it swings
  principally forward, and the palm of his hand inclines inwards. These are
  small matters, but their cumulative significance is great.</p>

  <p>"Further, there was the mental habit. Bundy was jocose and playfully
  ironic. But a gentleman of twenty-five doesn't 'pull the leg' of a gentleman
  of fifty whom he knows but slightly; whereas a lady of twenty-five does. And
  very properly," he added, seeing that Angelina had turned rather pink. "That
  is a compliment in a young lady which would be an impertinence in a young
  man. No doubt, when the equality of the sexes is an accomplished fact, things
  will be different."</p>

  <p>"It will never be an accomplished fact;" said Angelina. "The equality of
  the sexes is like the equality of the classes. The people who roar for social
  equality are the under-dogs; and the women who shout for sex equality are the
  under-cats. Normal women are satisfied with things as they are."</p>

  <p>"Hearken unto the wisdom of Angelina," said Thorndyke, with a smile. "But
  perhaps she is right. It may be that the women who are so eager to compete
  with men are those who can't compete with women. I can't say. I have never
  been a woman: whereas Angelina has the advantage of being able to view the
  question from both sides.</p>

  <p>"The <i>prima facie</i> evidence, then, suggested that Mr. Bundy was a
  woman. But as this was a <i>prima facie</i> improbability, the matter had to
  be gone into further. On Mr. Bundy's cheeks and chin was a faint blue
  colouration, suggestive of such a growth of whiskers and beard as would be
  appropriate to his age. Now if those whiskers and that beard were genuine,
  the other signs were fallacious. Mr. Bundy must be a man. But his cheeks
  looked perfectly smooth and clean; and it was about seven o'clock in the
  evening. My own cheeks and Strangeways' were by this time visibly prickly;
  and as he had been with us all day, Mr. Bundy could not have shaved since the
  morning. I tried vainly to get a closer view, and was considering how it
  could be managed when Providence intervened."</p>

  <p>"I know," said Angelina; "It was that beastly mosquito."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Thorndyke. "But even then I could not get a chance to look
  at the skin closely. But when we got Mr. Bundy into the surgery, and examined
  the bite through a lens, the murder was out."</p>

  <p>"You could see there were no whiskers?" said Angelina.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't that," replied Thorndyke. "It was something much more
  conclusive. You may know that the whole of the human body excepting the palms
  of the hands, the soles of the feet, and the eyelids, is covered with a fine
  down, technically called the lanugo. It consists of minute, nearly colourless
  hairs set quite closely together, and may be seen as a sort of halo on the
  face of a woman or child when the edge of the contour is against the light.
  On the face of a clean-shaved man it is, of course, absent, as it is shaved
  off with the whiskers. Now on Mr. Bundy's face the lanugo was intact all over
  the blue area. It followed that he had never been shaved. It further followed
  that the blue colouration was an artificial stain. But this made it
  practically a certainty that Mr. Bundy was a woman.</p>

  <p>"The question now was: If Mr. Bundy was a woman, what woman was he? The
  obvious answer seemed to be, Angelina Frood. She was missing; but if the
  disappearance was an imposture, someone on the spot was planting the clues.
  That someone would most probably be Mrs. Frood, herself. But if she were
  lurking in the neighbourhood, she must be disguised; and here was a disguised
  woman. Nevertheless, obvious as the suggestion was, the thing suggested
  seemed to be impossible. Strangeways knew both Angelina and Bundy and he had
  not recognized the latter; and I had a vague impression that he had seen them
  together, which, of course, would absolutely exclude their identity. A little
  judicious conversation with him, however, showed that neither objection had
  any weight. He had never seen them both at one time; and his description of
  Mrs. Frood made it clear that she had appeared to him totally unlike
  Bundy.</p>

  <p>"The next thing was to ascertain definitely if this woman really was Mrs.
  Frood, and fortunately I had the means of making a very simple test.
  Strangeways had given me a photograph of Angelina bearing the address of a
  theatrical photographer, and from him I obtained seven different photographs
  in various poses. Then I received from Strangeways the group-photograph that
  was taken of us by the city wall, which contained an excellent portrait of
  Mr. Bundy. Out of this photograph I cut a small square containing Bundy's
  head, soaked it in oil of bergamot, and mounted it in Canada balsam on a
  glass plate. This made the paper quite transparent, so I now had a
  transparent positive. I selected from the photographs of Angelina one that
  was in a pose exactly similar to the portrait, of Bundy&mdash;practically
  full face&mdash;and treated it in the same way. Then I handed the two
  transparencies to my assistant, and he, by means of our big copying camera,
  produced two life-sized negatives, exactly alike in dimensions. With prints
  from these negatives we were able to perform some experiments. From
  Angelina's portrait I carefully cut out the face, leaving the hair and neck,
  and slipped Bundy's portrait behind it, so that his face appeared through the
  hole. We could now see how Bundy looked with Angelina's hair, and, on putting
  it beside an untouched portrait of Angelina, it was obvious, in spite of the
  eye-glass, that it was the same face. For you must remember that the Angelina
  that we had was the real person, not the made-up Angelina whom Strangeways
  had seen.</p>

  <p>"This success encouraged us to take a little more trouble. My man, Polton,
  made some black paper masks, with the aid of which he produced two composite
  photographs, one of which had Bundy's face and Angelina's hair, neck, and
  bust, while the other had Angelina's face and Bundy's hair, forehead, neck,
  and bust. The eye-glass was the disturbing factor, though it showed very
  little, and Bundy managed it so skilfully that it hardly affected the shape
  of the eye and the set of the brow. Still, it was necessary to eliminate it,
  and as painting was out of our province, we invoked the aid of Mrs. Anstey,
  who is a very talented portrait painter and miniaturist. She touched out the
  joins in the composites, painted out the eye-glass in the one and painted an
  eye-glass into the other. And now the identity was complete. The
  Bundy-Angelina portrait was identical with the photographer's portrait, and
  the Angelina-Bundy photograph was Mr. Bundy to the life.</p>

  <p>"However, we made a final test. Polton reduced the Bundy-Angelina portrait
  to cabinet size, and made a couple of carbon prints, which I brought down
  here and exhibited; and as Strangeways accepted them as portraits of
  Angelina, I considered the proof complete."</p>

  <p>Here Angelina interrupted: "But what about that brooch? I never had a
  brooch like that."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled a grim smile. "I asked Mrs. Anstey to paint in a brooch
  of a characteristic design."</p>

  <p>"What for?" asked Angelina.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Thorndyke, "thereby hangs a tale."</p>

  <p>"Oh! a serpent's tail, I suppose," said Angelina.</p>

  <p>"You will be able to judge presently," he replied. "The brooch had its
  uses. Well, to continue: The identity of Mr. Bundy was now established as a
  moral certainty. But it was not certain enough for legal purposes. I wanted
  conclusive evidence; and I wanted to ascertain exactly how the transformation
  effects were worked. I had noted that Bundy and Angelina occupied adjoining
  houses which were virtually the two moieties of a double house with a common
  covered passageway. I assumed that the two houses communicated, but it was
  necessary to ascertain if they really did. The only way to establish the
  facts was to inspect the house in which Angelina had lived, and this I
  determined to do, in the very faint hope that I might be able, at the same
  time, to get one or more of Angelina's finger-prints. I made a pretext for
  visiting the house with Strangeways, and we had the extraordinary good luck
  to find Mrs. Gillow just going out, so we had the house to ourselves. But
  this was not the only piece of luck, for we found that Angelina had taken a
  drink from the bedroom tumbler and water-bottle before going out, and had
  left on them a complete set of beautiful fingerprints, of which I secured a
  number of admirable photographs.</p>

  <p>"Examination of the basement showed that I was right as to the
  communication. Both houses had a side door opening into the passage-way, and
  both doors were fitted with Yale latches which looked as if they were opened
  with the same key. The passage was little used, but the gravel between the
  two doors was a good deal trodden, and there were numerous finger-prints on
  Angelina's side-door. In the kitchen was a large cupboard fitted with a Yale
  lock on the door and pegs inside. I assumed that when Angelina was at home
  that cupboard contained a suit of Mr. Bundy's clothes, and that when Mr.
  Bundy was in the office it contained a wig and a dress and a pair of lady's
  shoes.</p>

  <p>"Well, that made the evidence fairly complete with one exception. We had
  to get a set of Bundy's finger-prints to compare with Angelina's. That was
  where the brooch came in. I knew that when Mr. Bundy saw a portrait of his
  former self with a brooch that he had never possessed, his curiosity would be
  aroused, and he would examine that portrait closely. And so he did. And on my
  asking him to compare the two prints, he took the opportunity to pick them
  both up, one in each hand, to scrutinize them more minutely, and find out who
  the photographer was. When he put them down, they bore a complete, though
  invisible, set of his finger-prints. Later, Mr. Bundy went home, escorted by
  Strangeways. As soon as they were gone, I took the photographs up to my room,
  developed up the finger-prints with powder, and compared them minutely, line
  by line, with the photographs of those on the tumbler and bottle. They were
  identical. The finger-prints of Bundy were the finger-prints of Angelina
  Frood.</p>

  <p>"That completed the case; and if I had known what Angelina's intentions
  were I should have notified Bundy that 'the game was up.' But I was in the
  dark. I could do nothing until I knew whether she was going to produce a
  body, and if so, whose body it would be. The City wall was in my mind as a
  possibility, since I had noted the curious disappearance of the gate-key on
  that significant date and I had heard of the story of Bill the bargee and
  knew that Bundy had heard it, and apparently taken it seriously. But one
  can't act on conjecture. I could only watch Angelina play her game and try to
  follow the moves. When the paper-chase turned up Black Boy-lane, I knew that
  the wall-burial was intended to be discovered. But I didn't know what was in
  the wall, and I may say that I was rather alarmed. For if Angelina had taken
  the story of Bill as a reliable precedent and had buried a real body in
  quicklime, there was going to be a catastrophe. It was an immense relief to
  me when I got Strangeways' report that only a skeleton had been found; for I
  knew then that only a skeleton had been buried and that no crime had been
  committed. That is all I have to tell; and now it is Angelina's turn to enter
  the confessional."</p>

  <p>"You haven't left me much to tell," said Angelina. "I feel as if I had
  been doing the thimble and pea trick with glass thimbles. However, I will
  fill in a few details. This scheme first occurred to me when I came down here
  to take over the property that had been left to me. I put it confidentially
  to Uncle Japp, but he was so shocked that he has never been able to get his
  hair to lie down since. He wouldn't hear of it. So I asked him to lunch with
  poor Nicholas; and after that he was ready to agree to anything. Accordingly
  I made my preparations. I got a theatrical wig-maker to cut off my hair and
  make it into a wig (I told him I had a man's part and it was expected to be a
  long run), got a suit made by a theatrical costumier, and down I came as Mr.
  Bundy. Uncle J. had already had the new plate put up. The next door offices
  and basement were empty, so we got them furnished for Angelina, and as soon
  as the wig was ready, down she came and took possession.</p>

  <p>"Up to this time the third act was a bit sketchy. I had arranged the
  disappearance, and the recovery of the clues from the river, and I had a plan
  of buying a mummy, dressing it in my clothes, and burying it in the marshes
  close to the shore, where I could discover it when it had matured
  sufficiently. But I didn't much like the plan. I didn't know enough about
  mummies, and some other people might know too much. It looked as if I should
  have to do without a body, and leave my death to mere rumour; which would be
  unsatisfactory. I did want a tombstone.</p>

  <p>"About this time an angel of the name of Turcival&mdash;he lives in Adam
  and Eve-street, Adelphi, bless him!&mdash;sent a Dr. Strangeways down here.
  He was a regular windfall&mdash;a new doctor&mdash;and I gave him my entire
  attention. I took him to his own proposed premises, and kept him in
  conversation, to let my personality soak well in. That evening I interviewed
  him in the office, and let him suppose that I was going to take him to Mrs.
  Frood's house and introduce him to her. Then, when I suddenly remembered an
  engagement elsewhere, I went out, and as soon as the office door was shut,
  down I darted into our basement, out at the side door, in at the other side
  door, and into Mrs. Frood's kitchen. There I did a lightning change; slipped
  on my dress and wig, stuck on my eyebrows, and made up my complexion; flew up
  the stairs, lighted the lamp in the sitting-room, and spread myself out with
  my needle-work. But I hadn't been settled more than two or three minutes when
  Uncle Japp arrived, leading the lamb to the slaughter.</p>

  <p>"Then it turned out that I had struck a bit of luck that I hadn't
  bargained for. John had attended me in London and knew something of my
  affairs; so I appointed him my physician in ordinary on the spot. It was rare
  sport. The concern poor old John showed for my grease-paint was quite
  touching. I sat there squeaking complaints to him and receiving his sympathy
  until I was ready to screech with laughter. But I felt rather a pig all the
  same, for John was so sweet, and he was such a man and such a gentleman.
  However, I had to go on when once I had begun.</p>

  <p>"But it was a troublesome business, worse than any stage job I ever had,
  to keep these two people going. I had to rush through from the office into
  the kitchen and cook things that I didn't want, just to make a noise and a
  smell of cooking, and listen to Mrs. Gillow so that I could pop up the stairs
  at the psychological moment and remind her that I lived there; and then to
  fly down and change and dart through into the office, so that people could
  see that I was occupied there. It was frightfully hard work, and anxious,
  too. I can tell you, it was a relief when I heard from Miss Cumbers that
  Nicholas was starting for Brighton, and that I could disappear without
  implicating him. However, there is no need for me to go into any more
  details. Your imaginations can fill those in."</p>

  <p>"The man with the mole, I take it," said Thorndyke, "was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I got a suit of slops in the Minories. The mole, of course, was
  built up, with toupee-paste."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said Thorndyke, "was there any necessity for Bundy at
  all?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I had to be somebody, you know, and I had to stay on the spot to
  work the clues and keep an eye on the developments. I couldn't be a woman
  because that would have required a heavy make-up that would almost certainly
  have been spotted, and would have been an intolerable bore; whereas Bundy, as
  you have pointed out, was not a disguise at all. When once I had got my hair
  cut and had provided myself with the clothes and eye-glass, there was no
  further trouble. I could have lived comfortably as Bundy for the rest of my
  life.</p>

  <p>"So that is my story," Angelina concluded; "and," she added, with a sudden
  change of manner, "I am your grateful debtor for ever. You have done far more
  for me even than you know. Only this morning, poor Peter Bundy was a forlorn
  little wretch, miserably anxious about the present and looking to a future
  that had nothing but empty freedom to offer. And now I am the happiest of
  women&mdash;for I should be a hypocrite if I pretended to have any regrets
  for poor Nicholas. I will say good-bye to him in his coffin and give him a
  decent funeral, and try to think of him as he was before he sank into the
  depths. But I am frankly glad that he is gone out of his own miserable life
  and out of mine. And his going, which would never have been known but for the
  wisdom of the benevolent serpent, has left me free, With a promise of a
  happiness that even he does not guess."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure of that," said Thorndyke, with a sly smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, neither am I, now you come to mention it," said she, smiling at him
  in return. "He is an inquiring and observant serpent, with a way of nosing
  out all sorts of things that he is not supposed to be aware of. And. after
  all, perhaps he has a right to know. It is proper that the giver should have
  the satisfaction of realizing the preciousness of that which he has
  given."</p>

  <p>Here endeth the Mystery of Angelina Frood. And yet it is not quite the
  end. Indeed, the end is not yet; for the blessed consequences still continue
  to develop like the growth of a fair tree. The story has dwindled to a
  legend, whose harmless whispers call but a mischievous smile to that face
  that, like the dial in our garden, acknowledges only the sunshine. Mrs. Dunk,
  it is true, still wages public war, but it is tempered by private adoration;
  and almost daily baskets of flowers, and even tomatoes and summer cabbages,
  arrive at our house accompanied by the beaming smile and portly person of
  Inspector Cobbledick.</p>

    <h2><a name="ch-05"
     id="ch-05"></a>V. &mdash; 5A KING'S BENCH WALK</h2>

  <p class="cp">by Percival M Stone</p>

<p>Amid the vast Literature which surrounds the Sherlock Holmes cycle one
finds innumerable, carefully documented references to the Baker Street
mnage which has been invested with an atmosphere of romance surpassing
that of any domicile presented in the pages of modern fiction.

<p>Through the exhaustive studies of such experts as Vincent Starrett,
Ronald Knox, H. W. Bell, C. S. Roberts, and Thomas Blakeney, the famous
lodgings, where the great detective was so faithfully ministered to
by Watson and Mrs. Hudson, have long since passed from the realm of
fancy to one of vivid reality and every incident pertaining to Holmes'
existence within those magic portals is now accepted as belonging to an
actual chronology of crime investigation.

<p>With no purpose in mind to strip these hallowed regions of their
glamour, for that way lies sacrilege, let us now consider, in a quarter
of London far removed from Baker Street, another familiar residence
which is closely associated with the private life and investigations of
a distinguished Holmes contemporary.

<p>For it is undeniably a fact that only six years after Holmes stages
his astounding "Return" in <i>The Adventure of the Empty House,</i> one
finds John Evelyn Thorndyke completing his course of hospital training
and about to engage lodgings in King's Bench Walk. There, accompanied
and supported by the twin satellites, Polton and Jervis, the eminent
medico-jurist is drawn into a remarkable series of investigations, the
engaging chronology of which, presented with such convincing skill
by Dr. R. Austin Freeman stands,&mdash;in the judgment of discriminating
students of the genre,&mdash;as the most notable contribution to modern
detective fiction.

<p>Since one or two discrepancies appear in the author's narrative
pertaining to that quarter of The Temple where Thorndyke lodges, it
appears advisable to subject that fascinating area, and Dr. Freeman's
allusions, to careful survey. The Temple, comprising two famous Inns of
Court (The Middle and Inner Temple), extends from Fleet Street to the
Thames Embankment, and as one enters its peaceful, entrancing precincts
by way of Wren's noble Gate-house at the upper end of Middle Temple
Lane, "Time stands still," for the fortunate visitor is transported at
each stage of his wandering to the mellowed atmosphere of an age long
since gone.

<p>Ben Jonson referred to the Inns of Court as "the noblest nurseries of
humanity and liberty in the kingdom," and amid the diadems crowning
the brow of legal London the area immediately adjoining Thorndyke's
lodgings has been judged a gem of unsurpassed charm and radiance. Here
within short walking distance, one is confronted with that ancient
round basilica, The Temple Church, to the north of which, in a spot
never actually determined, lies Oliver Goldsmith; Middle Temple Hall,
dating back to Elizabeth; Crown Office Row with Brick Court, abundantly
remindful of Lamb, Dr. Johnson and Blackstone;&mdash;not o'erlooking Fountain
Court, indissolubly associated with Ruth Pinch.

<p>But our study lies not in contemplation of these ancient landmarks
which only serve as a brilliant back-drop to one particular residence
in the thoroughfare known as "King's Bench Walk." "There," Loftie
states in his admirable work on The Temple, "beauty of architectural
design reaches its highest level," and the rich setting is further
enhanced as one gazes down past the arched doorways, approached by
broad stone steps, to the Thames visible across the Embankment roadway.

<p>We have stated that Thorndyke's creator has made confusing references
to the exact location of the doctor's lodgings. Let us see, however, if
we can determine with some degree of exactitude just where along the
"Walk" one finds his familiar name inscribed as occupant of the "1st
Pair."

<p>In that first chronicle of Dr. Christopher Jervis, <i>The Red Thumb Mark</i>
(1907) which, by the way, introduces us to the most distinguished
recorder among Thorndyke's several Boswells, we are informed, "my
chambers are some doors further down,&mdash;6A," whereas in the author's own
account of the medico-jurist's origin (Refer to <i>Meet the Detective</i>),
one reads, "when he (Thorndyke) first made his bow to the reading
public from the doorway to #4 King's Bench Walk."

<p>Nevertheless, despite these confused references, the first of which
was made before Thorndyke's eventful career gains its stride, we have,
by common assent, long looked upon 5A as the correct postal address.
In <i>The D'Arblay Mystery</i>, Chapter II, we find the following very
significant passage, "Thorndyke's number was 5A which I presently
discovered inscribed on the keystone of a fine dignified brick portico
of the <i>seventeenth</i> century, on the jamb whereof was painted his name as
occupant of the '1st Pair.'"

<p>Now Muirhead in his very excellent <i>London Guide Book</i> ascribes only
two houses in King's Bench Walk, numbers 4 and 5, to Christopher Wren
(seventeenth century); consequently we must conclude that Jervis' very
first reference to the lodgings as # 6, is erroneous and that number
does not appear elsewhere in the chronicles.

<p>At the opening of Chapter VII, <i>Shadow of the Wolf</i>, we find another
reference to Wren as Supt. Miller of Scotland Yard wanders down the
"Walk" in search of Thorndyke's residence.

<p>We may assume, then, that the precise location of the famous chambers,
to which we shall presently be admitted, has now been closely
determined (the author's one reference to 4A was manifestly a slip
of the pen), and our next step is to consider and admire at closer
range the entrance to Thorndyke's inner sanctum where have been staged
for our delight, and oft-times to our bewilderment, those absorbing
problems in deduction in the solution of which #5A stands as a
veritable dynamo room of research.

<p>If one crosses the Terrace eastward from the direction of Crown Office
Row an admirable view is gained of "the dignified brick porticos" along
King's Bench Walk; and as we draw closer one observes, also, the rich
architectural design of the graceful supporting pillars on either side
of the entrances. Light iron railings border the five broad stone steps
and directly over the centre of the arch a lamp of ancient pattern
sheds welcome light into the fastnesses of the inner corridors.

<p>Presently, as we reach the paved "Walk" to turn our steps eagerly
towards the portal of #5, one recalls that here formerly resided
William Murray, later Earl of Mansfield. The story persists that his
chambers were once visited by the Duchess of Marlborough. "She would
not tell me her name," the servant reported later to Murray, "but she
swore so dreadfully I'm sure she must be a lady of quality."

<p>We have now reached the most difficult stage of our task, that of
depicting accurately and comprehensively, the inner details of
arrangement which pertain to Thorndyke's lodgings. It is, in fact, at
this point that one leaves the world of reality, and pieces together
from Dr. Freeman's innumerable careful references the floor plan and
domestic facilities on the "first floor" at 5A King's Bench Walk.

<p>To American readers it should be clearly pointed out that in England
the "first floor" is synonymous with our own "second story," and never
refers to the ground level area. Thus, "1st Pair" signifies a flight of
stairs (probably divided midway by a landing) which brings one speedily
to "The Oak," that outer formidable barricade to Thorndyke's chambers.
An electric bell button is visible and on the inner door which admits
to the living room we observe that familiar brass knocker which Mr.
Brodribb usually manipulated "with a flourish."

<p>"You will find my chambers an odd mixture," Thorndyke observes to
Jervis in <i>The Red Thumb Mark</i>, "for they combine the attractions of an
office, a museum, a laboratory and a workshop."

<p>The living room, where so many important conferences are held in
the course of the chronicles, is,&mdash;one finds stated in <i>The Eye of
Osiris</i>,&mdash;"fine, spacious and panelled." It is, indeed in this large
chamber o'erlooking the broad Terrace by means of two wide windows
that we meet many of the dominant characters in the Thorndyke cycle of
crime solution, and it would be well, perhaps, if we elaborate somewhat
upon its detailed arrangements and atmosphere.

<p>Opposite the entrance one observes with keen interest the deep
fireplace, flanked by two capacious arm chairs and a smoking stand,
before which Thorndyke and Jervis frequently enjoyed a final pipe
before retirement. Over the hearth stretches a broad mantel-piece
upon which are visible, one presumes, a clock, several tobacco jars,
a book or two, and possibly the famous box of Trichinopoly cheroots
which Thorndyke invariably resorts to upon reaching the solution to
a puzzling case. Anstey, a medical confrre, once remarked that "I'd
sooner smoke my own wig;" and we find no reference to an occasion
when these East Indian delicacies were distributed lavishly among the
fireside gatherings.

<p>No reference appears to Thorndyke's private chamber which is probably
reached through a doorway at one side of the fireplace. Such a room
undoubtedly exists in close proximity to the living room, and we find
also brief comment as to an "office" in <i>31 New Inn</i>. More extended
sleeping quarters are described when we arrive later at consideration
of the upper floor facilities.

<p>Along at least one wall surface there extends, we know, a well-stocked
bookcase ample space being devoted to those extremely useful reference
works, recourse to which has in more than one instance led to rapid
advancement in the particular inquiry at hand. Included among these
appear innumerable standard medical works, treatises on toxicology,
directories,&mdash;these covering a vast field,&mdash;atlases, ordnance maps,
and a selected group of studies in criminology based upon on the
observations of English, French and German experts.

<p>In Chapter XII, <i>Pontifex, Son &amp; Thorndyke</i>, Jervis remarks, "The Post
Office directory was one of Thorndyke's most potent instruments of
research&mdash;it was capable of throwing the most surprising amount and
kind of illumination on obscure cases."

<p>Other reference files of even more intimate nature are, we learn from
the chronicles, stored upon shelves or in locked cupboards about the
large living room; old newspapers, portfolios containing clippings
devoted to odd cases, and a voluminous compilation based upon a study
of strange wills which play such an important role during the career of
a medico-jurist.

<p>Jervis states in <i>The Eye of Osiris</i>, "To him (Thorndyke) a perfectly
unintelligible will is a thing of beauty and a joy forever."

<p>Of rugs, pictures and other decorations within this principal chamber
of the Thorndyke establishment we receive but meagre description
from the author, but it may be safely inferred that they exemplify
an excellence of taste and arrangement wholly compatible with their
owner's character.

<p>At one corner, at a position which draws good light from the window,
stands the doctor's flat-topped writing table upon a corner of which
rests a metal cabinet containing his card reference files, and in the
deep alcove between the windows a smaller dining table is visible with
two oaken high-backed chairs set in position for the next meal.

<p>We now propose to ascend to the second floor which is devoted to
Polton's quarters, the laboratories and two small chambers. It requires
careful research, indeed, to gain a clear comprehension of these
august regions where so many vital matters associated with Thorndyke's
investigations are concluded. The main laboratory is reached by means
of a narrow, winding stairway leading from the living room, but we are
also informed in <i>The Eye of Osiris</i> that another doorway opens upon the
main, outer staircase of the building.

<p>One smaller room has been set apart for bacteriological and microscopic
research; the two other adjoining chambers being reserved for Jervis,
at such times when he is "in residence" and for occasional overnight
guests. Moreover, there exists at least one room on the third floor,
reference being found to it in Chapter X of A <i>Thief in the Night</i>.
From the windows of these upper quarters one looks out upon "plane
trees and ancient red-tiled roofs" beyond which one can, no doubt, gaze
with wonder and delight at the great dome of St. Paul's "floating" over
London. It is, however, with the main laboratory that we are chiefly
concerned and one finds elaborate description of its complicated,
fascinating equipment throughout Dr. Freeman's several works. "One
side of the spacious chamber," we learn from <i>A Thief in the Night</i>,
"is occupied by a huge copying camera, the other by a joiner's bench.
A powerful back-geared lathe stands against one window, a jeweller's
bench against the other, and the walls are covered with shelves and
tool racks filled with all sorts of strange implements."

<p>It is not surprising that the author of these absorbingly interesting
chronicles has overlooked once or twice confusing discrepancies
which have crept into the stream of his narrative; one finds these
particularly with reference to these upper floor regions of the King's
Bench Walk domicile, but they do not in any sense detract from the
record's superlative merits.

<p>Space does not permit an extended account of the several astounding
revelations which come to pass within these chambers of intensive
scientific research. It is there that Thorndyke and Polton unmask
Varney's vain efforts to improvise a fraudulent post mark on the letter
dropped into Penfield's mail box (<i>Shadow of the Wolf</i>); there we
witness the ingenious method of opening an infernal machine (<i>A Thief
in the Night</i>); on another momentous occasion we find a coffin placed
upon two trestles in the upper chamber where a unique identification
test is staged <i>(The D'Arblay Mystery),</i> and in <i>The Silent Witness</i>,
which by the way, offers one of the most extended descriptions of the
laboratory, we are present when a remarkable yet utterly convincing
analysis is presented of ash and bone fragments resulting from
cremation.

<p>It is, indeed, this complicated, fascinating machinery of the
scientist, together with sound deductive reasoning, which raise Dr.
Freeman's detective novels far above the average level of contemporary
achievement. E. A. Seaborne in <i>The Detective in Fiction</i> refers to
"Thorndyke, the greatest of fictional scientific detectives;" "Thomson
in <i>Masters of Mystery</i> calls the author "a great master of the genre,"
and E. M. Wrong in that admirable introduction to <i>Stories of Crime
and Detection</i> states: "Holmes dabbled in science, but his knowledge
therein bears the same relation to Thorndyke's as his pocket magnifying
glass to the latter's research case. In Thorndyke we have complete use
of all the resources of the laboratory, coupled with a logic that is
safer than that of Holmes, because it is less cock-sure."

<p>And now what manner of men are they; these immortal, engaging figures
projected for us, against a background of baffling enigma at times, in
the Thorndyke gallery of living portraits?

<p>John Evelyn Thorndyke's antecedents are, strangely enough, veiled in
obscurity for we know practically nothing of his progenitors, his
boyhood training or the location of the family homestead. The author,
Dr. R. Austin Freeman, created him more than a quarter of a century ago
at a time when an illustrious confrre, A. Conan Doyle, was engaged
in presenting a fresh series of exploits around the famed lodgings
of another private investigator in Baker Street. But Dr. Freeman's
skilfully fashioned chronicles are based upon a profound knowledge,
and respect, for the new science of medical jurisprudence of which he
states: "by the sacrifice of a certain amount of dramatic effect one
could keep entirely within the facts of real life."

<p>The author proceeds to state: "As Thorndyke was a man of acute
intellect and sound judgment I decided to keep him free from
eccentricities, and endow him with the dignity of presence, appearance
and manner appropriate to a high professional and social standing."
A more extended revealing portrait of the great detective will be found
in <i>Meet the Detective,</i> an entertaining work published in 1935
by George Allen &amp; Unwin, London. As to age, we find, "I need not saddle
him with the infirmities of age, and I can (in his case) put the
brakes on the passing years. Probably he is not more than fifty after
all!"

<p>Through the eyes of Thorndyke's closest associates we secure,
however, a more varied series of appraisements relating intimately to
his personal character. Polton, who knows him better than any other
individual and who idolizes his very foot steps, makes the statement in
<i>The Silent Witness,</i> "He doesn't think like any other man. Ordinary
men's brains are turned out pretty much alike from a single mould like
a batch of pottery. But the doctor's brain was a special order, and if
there was a mould at all it was broken up when the job was finished."
And again, "he reasons from facts which his imagination tells him
exist, but which nobody else can see."

<p>Robert Anstey, K.C., a professional confrre, observes during the
progress of events in <i>The Mystery of Angelina Frood:</i> "You must know
that he is about as communicative as a Whitstable native. No one ever
knows what cards he holds." And at the opening of Chapter XIII, in
<i>Mystery of 31 New</i> Inn Jervis notes that "Thorndyke's brain was not of
ordinary type. Facts of which his mind instantly perceived the relation
remained to other people unconnected and without meaning."

<p>To gain a firm comprehension of Thorndyke's abnormal reasoning powers
and his insistence upon neglecting no thread of evidence, even though
it be of trivial scope, one would do well to read Chapter VIII, <i>Shadow
of the Wolf,</i> wherein the entire fabric of Varney's duplicity is laid
bare. The story presents a remarkable portrayal of sound deduction and
lays emphasis upon the medico-jurist's cardinal injunction: "In the
estimation of evidence there is no such thing as a commonplace fact or
object."

<p>Of Thorndyke's associations outside the immediate realm of his
profession, and of his social contacts beyond the confines of The
Temple, we hold but extremely meagre reports. Some of his time is
devoted to lectures on Medical Jurisprudence at St. Margaret's Hospital
and he has long been attached to the staff of the South London Hospital
where he conducts classes in the Science of Toxicology. Occasionally,
too, we find brief references to his affiliations as a Director with
the Griffin Life Company of which concern Stalker was once the managing
head.

<p>Again, we find mention in <i>31 New Inn</i> of a Club to which Thorndyke
belongs, but far more often on the occasion of his dining out does he
prefer the less formal atmosphere of "The Cheshire Cheese" or "The
Bell" in Holborn.

<p>Meals at 5A King's Bench Walk are sometimes served in a small chamber
on the second floor but more often, and always when guests are present,
in the living room alcove where Polton superintends the arrangements.
Which brings us at last to a closer observance of one of the most
lovable, finely etched, and utterly convincing figures within the
Thorndyke circle.

<p>Nathaniel Polton, confidential servant and laboratory assistant, is
a small, elderly man, "like a rural dean or a chancery judge." Dr.
Freeman writes of his "collateral relatives" in <i>Meet the Detective</i>:
"They were Mr. Pollard, associated with the hospital museum, and
a watch and clock maker named Parsons who was a man of boundless
ingenuity and technical resource. His crinkly countenance," Freeman
concludes, "is strictly his own copyright."

<p>Dr. John Thorndyke first met Polton as "in-patient at a hospital,&mdash;ill
and broken, a victim of poverty." The doctor gave him one or two jobs
and then engaged him permanently. The relationship between master and
servant is one of mutual admiration and respect, for Thorndyke says
of Polton in <i>The Cat's Eye</i>: "He is a shining example of the social
virtues; industry,&mdash;loyalty,&mdash;integrity, and contentment; moreover, as
an artificer, he is a positive genius."

<p>As there is no mention in the narratives of a "char" or a "Mrs. Hudson"
the various household duties devolve, one presumes, upon Polton who is,
in fact, a very model of versatility and shows an infinite capacity
for providing the doctor, at a moment's notice, with such equipment
of highly technical order as may be required for a fresh stage of
investigation in the particular case at hand.

<p>Of his qualities as cook and general provider of domestic comforts we
find abundant commendation, but it is within the realm of technical
assistant that we are impressed most forcibly with Polton's unique
capacity for lending material aid at a crucial moment. Innumerable
references may be found concerning his skill as an inventor, as witness
the periscope cane in <i>Mr. Pottermack's Oversight</i>; the all-seeing
magic spectacle lenses in <i>The Cat's Eye</i>, and the complicated device
for keyhole photography in <i>Dr. Thorndyke's Discovery</i>.

<p>Polton is acutely aware of the peculiar qualities appertaining to
all of the doctor's visitors, and should one of them arrive during
Thorndyke's absence he is well assured of a courteous, genial welcome
by this "crinkly" visaged guardian of the premises. Brodribb, a
legal associate, is a frequent caller at 5A King's Bench Walk,&mdash;his
particular fancy there is a bottle of port which his host never fails
to bring forth as the two men settle themselves by the fireside,
"Brodribb," exclaims Polton on occasion of the lawyer's arrival during
the <i>Cat's Eye</i> investigations, "let me see, it's the sixty-three that
he likes. Yes, and Lord, he does love it. It's a pleasure to see him
drink."

<p>We now turn to Doctor Christopher Jervis who serves so faithfully as
the all-observing Boswell in several of the Thorndyke chronicles. He
is, to use his own phrase in <i>The Silent Witness,</i> "second violin in
the Thorndyke orchestra," and during the progress of stirring events in
<i>31 New Inn</i> he takes up permanent residence at 5A, from that time on
participating intimately in the solution of those problems in deduction
which his distinguished associate has been instructed to unravel. Dr.
Freeman, writing of Jervis in <i>Meet the Detective,</i> states: "He is the
expert misunderstander. His job is to observe and record all the facts
and to fail completely to perceive their significance."

<p>Nevertheless, Jervis is an ingratiating, convincing figure in our
select group about the fireside at 5A and as Thorndyke's growing fame
brings to them problems of deeper complexity this self-styled "second
violin" assumes a more mellow resonance wholly in tune with the major
symphony upon which both men are so earnestly engaged.

<p>Jervis follows a curious custom of disappearing wholly from the scene
of action in some of the investigations presented; in others, he plays
an extremely minor role as a mere lay figure, but we have long accepted
him as Thorndyke's closest confidant and look eagerly for further
extracts from his voluminous records which are in due course, one
fervently trusts, to reveal more details of the doctor's astonishing
career.

<p>We must pass lightly over the group of professional confrres and
other visitors who arrive from time to time before "The Oak" and are
courteously ushered by the discreet Polton into the doctor's presence.
Superintendent Miller (curiously remindful, at times, of our old
friend, Lestrade) is a welcome guest for almost invariably he casts
into Thorndyke's lap a tangled skein involving some capital crime which
has already bewildered the high command at "The Yard." Of the legal
fraternity, the most familiar figures are, of course, good old Brodribb
(at whose entrance Polton coughs discreetly and casts a knowing
wink at his master); Penfield, who was introduced to us in <i>Shadow
of the Wolf</i>; Marchmont and Stalker, the latter now associated with
The Griffin Company. Anstey, who directs so ably the doctor's Court
cases, must also drop in frequently during the evening to draw a chair
before the blazing hearth, for he occupies chambers at #8 close by, and
Mayfield too has quarters in Fig Tree Court across the Terrace.

<p>Inspector Badger, alas, will not again announce his arrival by a
characteristic rattle of the door knocker for he met an untimely
demise in the course of <i>Dr. Thorndyke's Discovery</i>, one of the rare
instances when the author removes from the stage a familiar and highly
respected figure. Badger, it will be recalled, was first introduced to
us in <i>The Red Thumb Mark</i> and it is the same Walter Hornby who so
callously disposes of the Inspector in a much later chronicle.

<p>Among the occasional visitors may be mentioned Doctor Humphrey
Jardine; Doctor Paul Berkeley; Mr. Elmhurst, the eminent
archaeologist&mdash;Professor D'Arcy of the Royal College of Surgeons,
whose advice is earnestly sought in the development of certain
baffling cases; Mr. Burston the geological expert; Holman, who acts
as Thorndyke's shorthand reporter, and Juliet Gibson who holds, we
understand, for Dr. Jervis slightly more than a fleeting attachment.

<p>Thus we leave them all amid the engaging environments of The Temple,
than which there exists no more fascinating, historic quarter
throughout the enormous expanse of London. The shades are drawn;
Polton, whose crinkly countenance resembles nothing more than a ripe,
benevolent walnut, steps to the fireside with a tray bearing decanter
and glasses; Brodribb casts swift inquiring glances at the cupboard
where the "63" is stored; Jervis rises from the desk where he has
been engaged in writing up the day's developments, and as "the gentle
undertones of the Treasury Clock" announce the half hour, Dr. John
Thorndyke swiftly descends the stairs from the laboratory ready to
join the friendly, familiar associates who have eagerly awaited his
inspiring companionship by the blazing hearth.

<p>One cannot do better than close this brief sketch of 5A King's Bench
Walk, one of the most famous domiciles found in fiction, by quoting
a short passage found in the extremely interesting booklet recently
issued by the author's American publishers: "Perhaps R. Austin
Freeman's greatest achievement is not his original concept of a
medical legal sleuth, or his careful science, or his charm of style
and pleasantness of manner. His greatest triumph lies in the one great
essential without which no detective story can endure,&mdash;the creation of
a dominant living character."

  <h2><a name="ch-06"
     id="ch-06"></a>VI. &mdash; MR. POTTERMACK'S OVERSIGHT</h2>

  <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>

  <p>The afternoon of a sultry day near the end of July was beginning to merge
  into evening. The crimson eye of the declining sun peered out through chinks
  in a bank of slaty cloud as if taking a last look at the great level of land
  and water before retiring for the night; while already, in the soft, greenish
  grey of the eastern sky, the new-risen moon hung like a globe of pearl.</p>

  <p>It was a solitary scene; desolate, if you will, or peaceful. On the one
  hand the quiet waters of a broad estuary; on the other a great stretch of
  marshes; and between them the sea wall, following faithfully the curves and
  indentations of the shore and fading away at either end into
  invisibility.</p>

  <p>A great stillness brooded over the place. On the calm water, far out
  beyond the shallows, one or two coasting craft lay at anchor, and yet farther
  out a schooner and a couple of barges crept up on the flood tide. On the land
  side in the marshy meadows a few sheep grazed sedately, and in the ditch that
  bordered the sea wall the water-voles swam to and fro or sat on the banks and
  combed their hair. Sound there was none save the half-audible wash of the
  little waves upon the shore and now and again the querulous call of a
  sea-gull.</p>

  <p>In strange contrast to the peaceful stillness that prevailed around was
  the aspect of the one human creature that was visible. Tragedy was written in
  every line of his figure; tragedy and fear and breathless haste. He was
  running&mdash;so far as it was possible to run among the rough stones and the
  high grass&mdash;at the foot of the sea wall on the seaward side; stumbling
  onward desperately, breathing hard, and constantly brushing away with his
  hand the sweat that streamed down his forehead into his eyes. At intervals he
  paused to scramble up the slope of the wall among the thistles and ragwort,
  and with infinite caution, to avoid even showing his head on the skyline,
  peered over the top backwards and forwards, but especially backwards where,
  in the far distance, the grey mass of a town loomed beyond the marshes.</p>

  <p>There was no mystery about the man's movements. A glance at his clothing
  explained everything. For he was dressed in prison grey, branded with the
  broad arrow and still bearing the cell number. Obviously, he was an escaped
  convict.</p>

  <p>Criminologists of certain Continental schools are able to give us with
  remarkable exactness the facial and other characteristics by which the
  criminal may be infallibly recognized. Possibly these convenient "stigmata"
  may actually occur in the criminals of those favoured regions. But in this
  backward country it is otherwise; and we have to admit the regrettable fact
  that the British criminal inconsiderately persists in being a good deal like
  other people. Not that the criminal class is, even here, distinguished by
  personal beauty or fine physique. The criminal is a low-grade man; but he is
  not markedly different from other low-grade men.</p>

  <p>But the fugitive whose flight in the shelter of the sea wall we are
  watching did not conform even to the more generalized type. On the contrary,
  he was a definitely good-looking young man rather small and slight yet
  athletic and well-knit, with a face not only intelligent and refined but,
  despite his anxious and even terrified expression, suggestive of a
  courageous, resolute personality. Whatever had brought him to a convict
  prison, he was not of the rank and file of its inmates.</p>

  <p>Presently, as he approached a bluff which concealed a stretch of the sea
  wall ahead, he slowed down into a quick walk, stooping slightly and peering
  forward cautiously to get a view of the shore beyond the promontory, until,
  as he reached the most projecting point of the wall, he paused for a moment
  and then crept stealthily forward, alert and watchful for any unexpected
  thing that might be lurking round the promontory.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stopped dead and then drew back a pace, craning up to peer
  over the high, rushy grass, and casting a glance of intense scrutiny along
  the stretch of shore that had come into view. After a few moments he again
  crept forward slowly and silently, still gazing intently along the shore and
  the face of the sea wall that was now visible for nearly a mile ahead. And
  still he could see nothing but that which had met his eyes as he crept round
  the bluff. He drew himself up and looked down at it with eager interest.</p>

  <p>A little heap of clothes; evidently the shed raiment of a bather, as the
  completeness of the outfit testified. And in confirmation, just across the
  narrow strip of "saltings," on the smooth expanse of muddy sand the prints of
  a pair of naked feet extended in a line towards the water. But where was the
  bather? There was only a single set of footprints, so that he must be still
  in the water or have come ashore farther down. Yet neither on the calm water
  nor on the open, solitary shore was any sign of him to be seen.</p>

  <p>It was very strange. On that smooth water a man swimming would be a
  conspicuous object, and a naked man on that low, open shore would be still
  more conspicuous. The fugitive looked around with growing agitation. From the
  shore and the water his glance came back to the line of footprints; and now,
  for the first time, he noticed something very remarkable about them. They did
  not extend to the water. Starting from the edge of the saltings, they took a
  straight line across the sand, every footprint deep and distinct, to within
  twenty yards of the water's edge; and there they ended abruptly. Between the
  last footprint and the little waves that broke on the shore was a space of
  sand perfectly smooth and untouched.</p>

  <p>What could be the meaning of this? The fugitive gazed with knitted brows
  at that space of smooth sand; and even as he gazed, the explanation flashed
  upon him. The tide was now coming in, as he could see by the anchored
  vessels. But when these footprints were made, the tide was going out. The
  spot where the footprints ended was the spot where the bather had entered the
  water. Then&mdash;since the tide had gone out to the low-water mark and had
  risen again to nearly half-tide&mdash;some five hours must have passed since
  that man had walked down into the water.</p>

  <p>All this flashed through the fugitive's brain in a matter of seconds. In
  those seconds he realized that the priceless heap of clothing was derelict.
  As to what had become of the owner, he gave no thought but that in some
  mysterious way he had apparently vanished for good. Scrambling up the slope
  of the sea wall, he once more scanned the path on its summit in both
  directions; and still there was not a living soul in sight. Then he slid
  down, and breathlessly and with trembling hands stripped off the hated livery
  of dishonour and, not without a certain incongruous distaste, struggled into
  the derelict garments.</p>

  <p>A good deal has been said&mdash;with somewhat obvious truth&mdash;about
  the influence of clothes upon the self-respect of the wearer. But surely
  there could be no more extreme instance than the present one, which, in less
  than one brief minute, transformed a manifest convict into a respectable
  artisan. The change took effect immediately. As the fugitive resumed his
  flight he still kept off the skyline; but he no longer hugged the base of the
  wall, he no longer crouched nor did he run. He walked upright out on the more
  or less level saltings, swinging along at a good pace but without excessive
  haste. And as he went he explored the pockets of the strange clothes to
  ascertain what bequests the late owner had made to him, and brought up at the
  first cast a pipe, a tobacco-pouch, and a box of matches. At the first he
  looked a little dubiously, but could not resist the temptation; and when he
  had dipped the mouthpiece in a little salt pool and scrubbed it with a
  handful of grass, he charged the bowl from the well-filled pouch, lighted it
  and smoked with an ecstasy of pleasure born of long deprivation.</p>

  <p>Next, his eye began to travel over the abundant jetsam that the last
  spring-tide had strewn upon the saltings. He found a short length of old
  rope, and then he picked up from time to time a scrap of driftwood. Not that
  he wanted the fuel, but that a bundle of driftwood seemed a convincing
  addition to his make-up and would explain his presence on the shore if he
  should be seen. When he had made up a small bundle with the aid of the rope,
  he swung it over his shoulder and collected no more.</p>

  <p>He still climbed up the wall now and again to keep a look-out for possible
  pursuers, and at length, in the course of one of these observations, he
  espied a stout plank set across the ditch and connected with a footpath that
  meandered away across the marshes. In an instant he decided to follow that
  path, whithersoever it might lead. With a last glance towards the town, he
  boldly stepped up to the top of the wall, crossed the path at its summit,
  descended the landward side, walked across the little bridge and strode away
  swiftly along the footpath across the marshes.</p>

  <p>He was none too soon. At the moment when he stepped off the bridge, three
  men emerged from the waterside alley that led to the sea wall and began to
  move rapidly along the rough path. Two of them were prison warders, and the
  third, who trundled a bicycle, was a police patrol.</p>

  <p>"Pity we didn't get the tip a bit sooner," grumbled one of the warders.
  "The daylight's going fast, and he's got a devil of a start."</p>

  <p>"Still," said the constable cheerfully, "it isn't much of a place to hide
  in. The wall's a regular trap; sea one side and a deep ditch the other. We
  shall get him all right, or else the patrol from Clifton will. I expect he
  has started by now."</p>

  <p>"What did you tell the sergeant when you spoke to him on the 'phone?"</p>

  <p>"I told him there was a runaway coming along the wall. He said he would
  send a cyclist patrol along to meet us."</p>

  <p>The warder grunted. "A cyclist might easily miss him if he was hiding in
  the grass or in the rushes by the ditch. But we must see that we don't miss
  him. Two of us had better take the two sides of the wall so as to get a clear
  view."</p>

  <p>His suggestion was adopted at once. One warder climbed down and marched
  along the saltings, the other followed a sort of sheep-track by the side of
  the ditch, while the constable wheeled his bicycle along the top of the wall.
  In this way they advanced as quickly as was possible to the two men stumbling
  over the rough ground at the base of the wall, searching the steep sides,
  with their rank vegetation, for any trace of the lost sheep, and making as
  little noise as they could. So for over a mile they toiled on, scanning every
  foot of the rough ground as they passed but uttering no word. Each of the
  warders could see the constable on the path above, and thus the party was
  enabled to keep together.</p>

  <p>Suddenly the warder on the saltings stopped dead and emitted a shout of
  triumph. Instantly the constable laid his bicycle on the path and slithered
  down the bank, while the other warder came scrambling over the wall,
  twittering with excitement. Then the three men gathered together and looked
  down at the little heap of clothes, from which the discoverer had already
  detached the jacket and was inspecting it.</p>

  <p>"They're his duds all right," said he. "Of course, they couldn't be
  anybody else's. But here's his number. So that's that."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed the other, "they're his clothes right enough. But the
  question is, Where's my nabs himself?"</p>

  <p>They stepped over to the edge of the saltings and gazed at the line of
  footprints. By this time the rising tide had covered up the strip of smooth,
  unmarked sand and was already eating away the footprints, which now led
  directly to the water's edge.</p>

  <p>"Rum go," commented the constable, looking steadily over the waste of
  smooth water. "He isn't out there. If he was, you'd see him easily, even in
  this light. The water's as smooth as oil."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he's landed farther down," suggested the younger warder.</p>

  <p>"What for?" demanded the constable.</p>

  <p>"Might mean to cross the ditch and get away over the marshes."</p>

  <p>The constable laughed scornfully. "What, in his birthday suit? I don't
  think. No, I reckon he had his reasons for taking to the water, and those
  reasons would probably be a barge sailing fairly close inshore. They'd have
  to take him on board, you know; and from my experience of bargees, I should
  say they'd probably give him a suit of togs and keep their mouths shut."</p>

  <p>The elder warder looked meditatively across the water.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you are right," said he, "but barges don't usually come in here
  very close. The fairway is right out the other side. And, for my part, I
  should be mighty sorry to start on a swim out to a sailing vessel."</p>

  <p>"You might think differently if you'd just hopped out of the jug," the
  constable remarked as he lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose I should be ready to take a bit of a risk. Well," he
  concluded, "if that was his lay, I hope he got picked up. I shouldn't like to
  think of the poor beggar drifting about the bottom of the river. He was a
  decent, civil little chap."</p>

  <p>There was silence for a minute or two as the three men smoked
  reflectively. Then the constable proposed, as a matter of form, to cycle
  along the wall and make sure that the fugitive was not lurking farther down.
  But before he had time to start, a figure appeared in the distance,
  apparently mounted on a bicycle and advancing rapidly towards them. In a few
  minutes he arrived and dismounted on the path above them glancing down
  curiously at the jacket which the warder still held.</p>

  <p>"Those his togs?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied the constable. "I suppose you haven't seen a gent bathing
  anywhere along here?"</p>

  <p>The newcomer shook his head. "No," said he. "I have patrolled the whole
  wall from Clifton to here and I haven't seen a soul excepting old Barnett,
  the shepherd."</p>

  <p>The elder warder gathered up the rest of the clothes and handed them to
  his junior. "Well," he said, "we must take it that he's gone to sea. All that
  we can do is to get the Customs people to give us a passage on their launch
  to make the round of all the vessels anchored about here. And if we don't
  find him on any of them, we shall have to hand the case over to the
  police."</p>

  <p>The three men climbed to the top of the wall and turned their faces
  towards the town; and the Clifton patrol, having turned his bicycle about,
  mounted expertly and pedalled away at a smart pace to get back to his station
  before the twilight merged into night.</p>

  <p>At that very moment, the fugitive was stepping over a stile that gave
  access from the marshes to a narrow, tree-shaded lane. Here he paused for a
  few moments to fling away the bundle of driftwood into the hedge and refill
  and light his pipe. Then, with a springy step, he strode away into the
  gathering moonlit dusk.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER I&mdash;MR. POTTERMACK MAKES A DISCOVERY</h3>

  <p>A conscientious desire on the part of the present historian to tell his
  story in a complete and workmanlike fashion from the very beginning raises
  the inevitable question. What was the beginning? Not always an easy question
  to answer offhand; for if we reflect upon certain episodes in our lives and
  try to track them to their beginnings, we are apt, on further cogitation, to
  discover behind those beginnings antecedents yet more remote which have
  played an indispensable part in the evolution of events.</p>

  <p>As to this present history the whole train of cause and consequence might
  fairly be supposed to have been started by Mr. Pottermack's singular
  discovery in his garden. Yet, when we consider the matter more closely, we
  may doubt if that discovery would ever have been made if it had not been for
  the sun-dial. Certainly it would not have been made at that critical point in
  Mr. Pottermack's life; and if it had not&mdash;but we will not waste our
  energies on vain speculations. We will take the safe and simple course. We
  will begin with the sun-dial.</p>

  <p>It stood, when Mr. Pottermack's eyes first beheld it, in a mason's yard at
  the outskirts of the town. It was obviously of some age, and therefore could
  not have been the production of Mr. Gallett, the owner of the yard; and
  standing amidst the almost garishly new monuments and blocks of freshly hewn
  stone, it had in its aspect something rather downfallen and forlorn. Now Mr.
  Pottermack had often had secret hankerings for a sun-dial. His big walled
  garden seemed to cry out for some central feature: and what more charming
  ornament could there be than a dial which like the flowers and trees amidst
  which it would stand lived and had its being solely by virtue of the golden
  sunshine?</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack halted at the wide-open gate and looked at the dial (I use
  the word, for convenience to include the stone support). It was a graceful
  structure with a twisted shaft like that of a Norman column, a broad base and
  a square capital. It was nicely lichened and weathered, and yet in quite good
  condition. Mr. Pottermack found something very prepossessing in its comely
  antiquity. It had a motto, too, incised on the sides of the capital; and when
  he had strolled into the yard, and, circumnavigating the sun-dial, had read
  it, he was more than ever pleased. He liked the motto. It struck a
  sympathetic chord. Sole orto: spes: decedente pax. It might have been his own
  personal motto. At the rising of the sun; hope: at the going down thereof,
  peace. On his life the sun had risen in hope: and peace at eventide was his
  chief desire. And the motto was discreetly reticent about the intervening
  period. So, too, were there passages in the past which he was very willing to
  forget so that the hope of the morning might be crowned by peace when the
  shadows of life were lengthening.</p>

  <p>"Having a look at the old dial, Mr. Pottermack?" said the mason, crossing
  the yard and disposing himself for conversation. "Nice bit of carving, that,
  and wonderful well preserved. He's counted out a good many hours in his time,
  he has. Seventeen thirty-four. And ready to count out as many again. No
  wheels to go rusty. All done with a shadder. No wear and tear about a
  shadder. And never runs down and never wants winding up. There's points about
  a sun-dial."</p>

  <p>"Where did it come from?"</p>

  <p>"I took it from the garden of Apsley Manor House, what's being rebuilt and
  brought up to date. New owner told me to take it away. Hadn't any use for
  sun-dials in these days, he said. More hasn't anybody else. So I've got him
  on my hands. Wouldn't like him for your garden, I suppose? He's going
  cheap."</p>

  <p>It appeared, on enquiry, that he was going ridiculously cheap. So cheap
  that Mr. Pottermack closed with the offer there and then,</p>

  <p>"You will bring it along and fix it for me?" said he.</p>

  <p>"I will, sir. Don't want much fixing. If you will settle where he is to
  stand, I'll bring him and set him up. But you'd better prepare the site. Dig
  well down into the subsoil and make a level surface. Then I can put a brick
  foundation and there will be no fear of his settling out of the upright."</p>

  <p>That was how it began. And on the knife-edge of such trivial chances is
  human destiny balanced. From the mason's yard Mr. Pottermack sped homeward
  with springy step, visualizing the ground-plan of his garden as he went; and
  by the time that he let himself into his house by the front door within the
  rose-embowered porch he was ready to make a bee-line for the site of his
  proposed excavation.</p>

  <p>He did not, however; for, as he opened the door, he became aware of voices
  in the adjacent room and his housekeeper came forth to inform him that Mrs.
  Bellard had called to see him, and was waiting within. Apparently the
  announcement was not unwelcome, for Mr. Pottermack's cheerfulness was in
  nowise clouded thereby. We might even go far as to say that his countenance
  brightened.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bellard was obviously a widow. That is not to say that she was
  arrayed in the hideous "weeds" with which, a generation ago, women used to
  make their persons revolting and insult the memory of the deceased. But she
  was obviously a widow. More obviously than is usual in these latter days.
  Nevertheless her sombre raiment was well-considered, tasteful and becoming;
  indeed the severity of her dress seemed rather to enhance her quiet,
  dignified comeliness. She greeted Mr. Pottermack with a frank smile, and as
  they shook hands she said in a singularly pleasant, musical voice:</p>

  <p>"It is too bad of me to come worrying you like this. But you said I was
  to."</p>

  <p>"Of course I did," was the hearty response; and as the lady produced from
  her basket a small tin box, he enquired: "Snails?"</p>

  <p>"Snails," she replied; and they both laughed.</p>

  <p>"I know," she continued, "it is very silly of me. I quite believe that, as
  you say, they die instantaneously when you drop them into boiling water. But
  I really can't bring myself to do it."</p>

  <p>"Very natural, too," said Pottermack. "Why should you, when you have a
  fellow conchologist to do it for you? I will slaughter them this evening and
  extract them from their shells, and you shall have their empty residences
  to-morrow. Shall I leave them at your house?"</p>

  <p>"You needn't trouble to do that. Give them to your housekeeper and I will
  call for them on my way home from the shops. But I really do impose on you
  most shamefully. You kill the poor little beasts, you clean out the shells,
  you find out their names and you leave me nothing to do but stick them on
  card, write their names under them, and put them in the cabinet. I feel a
  most horrid impostor when I show them at the Naturalists' Club as my own
  specimens."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Mrs. Bellard," protested Pottermack, "you are forgetting
  that you collect them, that you discover them in their secret haunts and drag
  them out to the light of day. That is the really scientific part of
  conchology. The preparation of the shells and their identification are mere
  journeyman's work. The real naturalist's job is the field work; and you are a
  positive genius in finding these minute shells&mdash;the pupas and
  cochlicopas and such like."</p>

  <p>The lady rewarded him with a grateful and gratified smile, and, opening
  the little box, exhibited her "catch" and recounted some of the thrilling
  incidents of the chase, to which Pottermack listened with eager interest. And
  as they chatted, but half seriously, an observer would have noted that they
  were obviously the best of friends, and might have suspected that the natural
  history researches were, perhaps, somewhat in the nature of a plausible and
  convenient pretext for their enjoying a good deal of each other's society.
  These little precautions are sometimes necessary in a country district where
  people take an exaggerated interest in one another and tongues are apt to wag
  rather freely.</p>

  <p>But a close observer would have noted certain other facts. For instance,
  these two persons were curiously alike in one respect: they both looked older
  to the casual stranger than they appeared on closer inspection. At a first
  glance, Mr. Pottermack, spectacled, bearded, and grave, seemed not far short
  of fifty. But a more critical examination showed that first impression to be
  erroneous. The quick, easy movements and the supple strength that they
  implied in the rather small figure, as well as the brightness of the alert,
  attentive eyes behind the spectacles, suggested that the lines upon the face
  and the white powdering of the hair owed their existence to something other
  than the mere effluxion of time. So, too, with Mrs. Bollard. On a chance
  meeting she would have passed for a well-preserved middle-aged woman. But
  now, as she chatted smilingly with her friend, the years dropped from her
  until, despite the white hairs that gleamed among the brown and a faint hint
  of crow's-feet, she seemed almost girlish.</p>

  <p>But there was something else; something really rather odd. Each of the two
  cronies seemed to have a way of furtively examining the other. There was
  nothing unfriendly or suspicious in these regards. Quite the contrary,
  indeed. But they conveyed a queer impression of curiosity and doubt,
  differently manifested, however, in each. In Mr. Pottermack's expression
  there was something expectant. He had the air of waiting for some anticipated
  word or action; but the expression vanished instantly when his companion
  looked in his direction. The widow's manner was different, but it had the
  same curious furtive quality. When Pottermack's attention was occupied, she
  would cast a steady glance at him; and then the lines would come back upon
  her forehead, her lips would set, and there would steal across her face a
  look at once sad, anxious, and puzzled. Especially puzzled. And if the
  direction of her glance had been followed, it would have been traced more
  particularly to his profile and his right ear. It is true that both these
  features were a little unusual. The profile was almost the conventional
  profile of the Greek sculptors&mdash;the nose continuing the line of the
  forehead with no appreciable notch&mdash;a character very seldom seen in real
  persons. As to the ear, it was a perfectly well-shaped, proportionate ear. It
  would have been of no interest to Lombroso. But it had one remarkable
  peculiarity: on its lobule was what doctors call a "diffuse naevus" and
  common folk describe as a "port-wine mark." It was quite small, but very
  distinct; as if the lobule had been dipped into damson juice. Still, it
  hardly seemed to justify such anxious and puzzled consideration.</p>

  <p>"What a dreadful pair of gossips we are!" Mrs. Bellard exclaimed, taking
  her basket up from the table. "I've been here half an hour by the clock, and
  I know I have been hindering you from some important work. You looked full of
  business as you came up the garden path."</p>

  <p>"I have been full of business ever since&mdash;land and fresh-water
  mollusca. We have had a most instructive talk."</p>

  <p>"So we have," she agreed, with a smile. "We are always instructive;
  especially you. But I must really take myself off now and leave you to your
  other business."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack held the door open for her and followed her down the hall
  to the garden path, delaying her for a few moments to fill her basket with
  roses from the porch. When he had let her out at the gate, he lingered to
  watch her as she walked away towards the village; noting how the dignified,
  matronly bearing seemed to contrast with the springy tread and youthful
  lissomness of movement.</p>

  <p>As he turned away to re-enter the house he saw the postman approaching;
  but as he was not expecting any letters, and his mind was still occupied with
  his late visitor, he did not wait. Nor when, a minute later, he heard the
  characteristic knock, did he return to inspect the letter-box; which was,
  just as well in the circumstances. Instead, he made his way out by the back
  door into the large kitchen garden and orchard and followed the long, central
  path which brought him at length to a high red brick wall, in which was a
  door furnished with a knocker and flanked by an electric bell. This he opened
  with a latchkey of the Yale pattern, and, having passed through, carefully
  shut it behind him.</p>

  <p>He was now in what had probably been originally the orchard and kitchen
  garden of the old house in which he lived, but which had since been converted
  into a flower garden, though many of the old fruit trees still remained. It
  was a large oblong space, more than a quarter of an acre in extent, and
  enclosed on all sides by a massive old wall nearly seven feet high, in which
  were only two openings: the door by which he had just entered and another
  door at one side, also fitted with a Yale lock and guarded, in addition, by
  two bolts.</p>

  <p>It was a pleasant place if quiet and seclusion were the chief desire of
  the occupant&mdash;as they apparently were, to judge by Mr. Pottermack's
  arrangements. The central space was occupied by a large, smooth grass plot,
  surrounded by well-made paths, between which and the wall were wide flower
  borders. In one corner was a brick-built summer-house; quite a commodious
  affair, with a good tiled roof, a boarded floor, and space enough inside for
  a couple of armchairs and a fair-sized table. Against the wall opposite to
  the summer-house was a long shed or outhouse with glass lights in the roof,
  evidently a recently built structure and just a little unsightly&mdash;but
  that would be remedied when the yew hedge that had been planted before it
  grew high enough to screen it from view. This was the workshop, or rather a
  range of workshops; for Mr. Pottermack was a man of many occupations, and,
  being also a tidy, methodical man, he liked to keep the premises appertaining
  to those occupations separate.</p>

  <p>On the present occasion he made his way to the end compartment, in which
  were kept the gardening tools and appliances, and having provided himself
  with a spade, a mallet, a long length of cord, and a half-dozen pointed
  stakes, walked out to the grass plot and looked about him. He was quite clear
  in his mind as to where the sun-dial was to stand, but it was necessary to
  fix the spot with precision. Hence the stakes and the measuring-line, which
  came into use when he had paced out the distances approximately and enabled
  him, at length, to drive a stake into the ground and thereby mark the exact
  spot which would be occupied by the centre of the dial.</p>

  <p>From this centre, with the aid of the cord, he drew a circle some four
  yards in diameter and began at once to take up the turf, rolling it up tidily
  and setting it apart ready for relaying. And now he came to the real job. He
  had to dig right down to the subsoil. Well, how far down was that? He took
  off his coat, and, grasping the spade with a resolute air, gave a vigorous
  drive into the soil at the edge of the circle. That carried him through the
  garden mould down into a fine, yellowish, sandy loam, a small quantity of
  which came up on the spade. He noted its appearance with some interest but
  went on digging, opening up a shallow trench round the circumference of the
  circle.</p>

  <p>By the time that he had made a second complete circuit and carried his
  trench to a depth of some eight inches, the circle was surrounded by a ring
  of the yellow loam, surprisingly bulky in proportion to the shallow cavity
  from which it had been derived. And once more his attention was attracted by
  its appearance. For Mr. Pottermack amongst his various occupations included
  occasionally that of sand-casting. Hitherto he had been in the habit of
  buying his casting-sand by the bag. But this loam, judging by the sharp
  impressions of his feet where he had trodden in it, was a perfect
  casting-sand, and to be had for the taking at his very door. By way of
  testing its cohesiveness, he took up a large handful and squeezed it tightly.
  When he opened his hand the mass remained hard and firm and showed the
  impressions of his fingers perfectly to the very creases of the skin.</p>

  <p>Very pleased with his discovery, and resolving to secure a supply of the
  loam for his workshop, he resumed his digging, and presently came down to a
  stratum where the loam was quite dense and solid and came up on the spade in
  definite coherent lumps like pieces of a soft rock. This, he decided, was the
  true subsoil and was as deep as he need go; and having decided this, he
  proceeded to dig out the rest of the circle to the same depth.</p>

  <p>The work was hard and, after a time, extremely monotonous. Still Mr.
  Pottermack laboured steadily with no tendency to slacking. But the monotony
  exhausted his attention, and while he worked on mechanically with unabated
  vigour his thoughts wandered away from his task; now in the direction of the
  sun-dial, and now&mdash;at, perhaps, rather more length&mdash;in that of his
  pretty neighbour and her spoils, which were still awaiting his attentions in
  the tin box.</p>

  <p>He was getting near the centre of the circle when his spade cut through
  and brought up a piece of spongy, fungus-eaten wood. He glanced at it
  absently, and having flung it outside the circle, entered his spade at the
  same spot and gave a vigorous drive. As the spade met with more than usual
  resistance, he threw a little extra weight on it. And then, suddenly, the
  resistance gave way; the spade drove through, apparently into vacant space.
  Mr. Pottermack uttered a startled cry, and after an instant's precarious
  balancing saved himself by a hair's breadth from going through after it.</p>

  <p>For a moment he was quite shaken&mdash;and no wonder. He had staggered
  back a pace or two and now stood, still grasping the spade, and gazing with
  horror at the black, yawning hole that had so nearly swallowed him up. But
  as, after all, it had not, he presently pulled himself together and began
  cautiously to investigate. A very little tentative probing with the spade
  made everything clear. The hole which he had uncovered was the mouth of an
  old well: one of those pernicious wells which have no protective coping but
  of which the opening, flush with the surface of the ground, is ordinarily
  closed by a hinged flap. The rotten timber that he had struck was part of
  this flap, and he could now see the rusty remains of the hinges. When the
  well had gone out of use, some one, with incredible folly, had simply covered
  it up by heaping earth on the closed flap.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack, having made these observations, proceeded methodically to
  clear away the soil until the entire mouth of the well was exposed. Then,
  going down on hands and knees, he approached, and cautiously advancing his
  head over the edge, peered down into the dark cavity. It was not quite dark,
  however, for though the slimy brick cylinder faded after a few feet into
  profound gloom, Mr. Pottermack could see, far down, as it seemed in the very
  bowels of the earth, a little circular spot of light on which was the dark
  silhouette of a tiny head. He picked up a pebble, and, holding it at the
  centre of the opening, let it drop. After a brief interval the bright spot
  grew suddenly dim and the little head vanished: and after another brief
  interval there came up to his ear a hollow "plop" followed by a faint,
  sepulchral splash.</p>

  <p>There was, then, water in the well; not that it mattered to him, as he was
  going to cover it up again. But he was a man with a healthy curiosity and he
  felt that he would like to know all about this well before he once more
  consigned it to oblivion. Walking across to the workshop, he entered the
  metalwork section and cast his eye around for a suitable sinker. Presently,
  in the "oddments" drawer, he found a big iron clock-weight. It was heavier
  than was necessary, but he took it in default of anything more suitable, and
  going back to the well, he tied it to one end of the measuring-cord. The
  latter, being already marked in fathoms by means of a series of knots,
  required no further preparation. Lying full-length by the brink of the well,
  Mr. Pottermack dropped the weight over and let the cord slip through his
  hands, counting the knots as it ran out and moving it up and down as the
  weight neared the water.</p>

  <p>The hollow splash for which he was listening came to his ear when the hand
  that grasped the cord was between the fourth and fifth knots. The depth,
  therefore, of the well to the surface of the water was about twenty-seven
  feet. He made a mental note of the number and then let the cord slip more
  rapidly through his hands. It was just after the seventh knot had passed that
  the tension of the cord suddenly relaxed, telling him that the weight now
  rested on the bottom. This gave a depth of sixteen feet of water and a total
  depth of about forty-three feet. And to think that, but for the merest
  chance, he would now have been down there where the clock-weight was
  resting!</p>

  <p>With a slight shudder he rose, and, hauling up the cord, coiled it neatly
  and laid it down, with the weight still attached, a few feet away on the
  cleared ground. The question that he now had to settle was how far the
  existence of the well would interfere with the placing of the sun-dial. It
  did not seem to him that it interfered at all. On the contrary; the well had
  to be securely covered up in any case, and the sun-dial on top of the
  covering would make it safe for ever. For it happened that the position of
  the well coincided within a foot with the chosen site of the dial; which
  seemed quite an odd coincidence until one remembered that the position of
  both had probably been determined by identical sets of measurements, based on
  the ground-plan of the garden.</p>

  <p>One thing, however, was obvious. Mr. Gallett would have to be informed of
  the discovery without delay, for something different from the proposed
  brickwork foundation would be required. Accordingly, Mr. Pottermack slipped
  on his coat, and, having sought out a hurdle and laid it over the
  well&mdash;for you can't be too careful in such a case&mdash;set off without
  delay for the mason's yard. As he opened the front door, he observed the
  letter still lying in the wire basket under the letter-slit. But he did not
  take it out. It could wait until he came back.</p>

  <p>Mr. Gallett was deeply interested, but he was also a little regretful. The
  altered arrangements would cause delay and increase the cost of the job. He
  would want two biggish slabs of stone, which would take some time to
  prepare.</p>

  <p>"But why cover the well at all?" said he. "A good well with sixteen feet
  of water in it is not to be sneezed at if you gets a hard frost and all the
  pipes is bunged up and busted."</p>

  <p>But Mr. Pottermack shook his head. Like most town-bred men, he had rather
  a dislike to wells, and his own recent narrow escape had done nothing to
  diminish his prejudice. He would have no open well in his garden.</p>

  <p>"The only question is," he concluded, "whether the sun-dial will be safe
  right over the well. Will a stone slab bear the weight?"</p>

  <p>"Lor' bless you," replied Gallett, "a good thick slab of flagstone would
  bear St. Paul's Cathedral. And we are going to put two, one on top of the
  other to form a step; and the base of the dial itself a good two foot wide.
  It will be as strong as a house."</p>

  <p>"And when do you think you'll be able to fix it?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Gallett reflected. "Let's see. To-day's Toos-day. It will take a full
  day to get them two slabs sawn off the block and trimmed to shape. Shall we
  say Friday?"</p>

  <p>"Friday will do perfectly. There is really no hurry, though I shall be
  glad to get the well covered and made safe. But don't put yourself out."</p>

  <p>Mr. Gallett promised that he would not, and Pottermack then departed
  homeward to resume his labours.</p>

  <p>As he re-entered his house, he picked the letter out of the letter-cage,
  and, holding it unopened in his hand, walked through to the garden. Emerging
  into the open air, he turned the letter over and glanced at the address; and
  in an instant a most remarkable change came over him. The quiet gaiety faded
  from his face and he stopped dead, gazing at the superscription with a frown
  of angry apprehension. Tearing open the envelope, he drew out the letter,
  unfolded it and glanced quickly through the contents. Apparently it was quite
  short, for, almost immediately, he refolded it, returned it to its envelope
  and slipped the latter into his pocket.</p>

  <p>Passing through into the walled garden, he took off his coat, laid it down
  in the summer-house and fell to work on the excavation, extending the circle
  into a square and levelling the space around the well to make a bed for the
  stone slab. But all his enthusiasm had evaporated. He worked steadily and
  with care; but his usually cheerful face was gloomy and stern, and a certain
  faraway look in his eyes hinted that his thoughts were not on what he was
  doing but on something suggested by the ill-omened missive.</p>

  <p>When the light failed, he replaced the hurdle, cleaned and put away the
  spade, and then went indoors with his coat on his arm to wash and take his
  solitary supper; of which he made short work, eating and drinking
  mechanically and gazing before him with gloomy preoccupation. Supper being
  finished and cleared away, he called for a kettle of boiling water and a
  basin, and, taking from a cupboard a handled needle, a pair of fine forceps,
  and a sheet of blotting-paper, laid them on the table with Mrs. Bellard's tin
  box. The latter he opened and very carefully transferred the imprisoned
  snails to the basin, which he then filled with boiling water; whereupon the
  unfortunate molluscs each emitted a stream of bubbles and shrank instantly
  into the recesses of its shell.</p>

  <p>Having deposited the kettle in the fireplace, Mr. Pottermack drew a chair
  up to the table and seated himself with the basin before him and the
  blotting-paper at his right hand. But before beginning his work he drew forth
  the letter, straightened it out and, laying it on the table, read it through
  slowly. It bore no address and no signature; and though the envelope was
  addressed to Marcus Pottermack, Esq., it began, oddly enough, "Dear
  Jeff."</p>
  <br>

  <p class="letter">"I send you this little billy doo," it ran on, "with deep regret, which I
  know you will share. But it can't be helped. I had hoped that the last one
  would be in fact, the last one, whereas it turns out to have been the last
  but one. This is positively my final effort, so keep up your pecker. And it
  is only a small affair this time. A hundred&mdash;in notes, of course. Fivers
  are safest. I shall call at the usual place on Wednesday at 8 p.m. ('in the
  gloaming, O! my darling!') This will give you time to hop up to town in the
  morning to collect the rhino. And mind I've got to have it. No need to dwell
  on unpleasant alternatives. Necessity knows no law. I am in a devil of a
  tight corner and you have got to help me out. So adieu until Wednesday
  evening."</p>
<br>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack turned from the letter, and, taking up the mounted needle,
  with the other hand picked out of the basin a snail with a delicate yellow
  shell (Helix hortensis, var. arenicola) and, regarding it reflectively,
  proceeded with expert care to extract the shrivelled body of the mollusc. But
  though his attention seemed to be concentrated on his task, his thoughts were
  far away, and his eyes strayed now and again to the letter at his side.</p>

  <p>"I am in a devil of a tight corner." Of course he was. The incurable
  plunger is always getting into tight corners. "And you have got to help me
  out." Exactly. In effect, the money that you have earned by unstinted labour
  and saved by self-denial has got to be handed to me that I may drop it into
  the bottomless pit that swallows up the gambler's losings. "This is
  positively my final effort." Yes. So was the last one, and the one before
  that; and so would be the next, and the one that would follow it, and so on
  without end. Mr. Pottermack saw it all clearly; realized, as so many other
  sufferers have realized, that there is about a blackmailer something
  hopelessly elusive. No transaction with him has any finality. He has
  something to sell, and he sells it; but behold! even as the money passes the
  thing sold is back in the hand of the vendor, to be sold again and yet again.
  No covenant with him is binding; no agreement can be enforced. There can be
  no question of cutting a loss, for, no matter how drastic the sacrifice, it
  is no sooner made than the status quo ante reappears.</p>

  <p>On these truths Mr. Pottermack cogitated gloomily and asked himself, as
  such victims often do, whether it would not have been better in the first
  place to tell this ruffian to go to the devil and do his worst. Yet that had
  hardly seemed practicable. For the fellow would probably have done his
  worst:-and his worst was so extremely bad. On the other hand, it was
  impossible that this state of affairs should be allowed to go on
  indefinitely. He was not by any means a rich man, though this parasite
  persisted in assuming that he was. At the present rate he would soon be
  sucked dry&mdash;reduced to stark poverty. And even then he would be no
  safer.</p>

  <p>The intensity of his revolt against his intolerable position was
  emphasized by his very occupation. The woman for whom he was preparing these
  specimens was very dear to him. In any pictures that his fancy painted of the
  hoped-for future, hers was the principal figure. His fondest wish was to ask
  her to be his wife, and he felt a modest confidence that she would not say
  him nay. But how could he ask any woman to marry him while this vampire clung
  to his body? Marriage was not for him&mdash;a slave to-day, a pauper
  to-morrow, at the best; and at the worst&mdash;</p>

  <p>The evening had lapsed into night by the time that all the specimens had
  been made presentable for the cabinet. It remained to write a little
  name-ticket for each with the aid, when necessary, of a handbook of the
  British Mollusca, and then to wrap each separate shell, with its ticket, in
  tissue paper and pack it tenderly in the small tin box. Thus was he occupied
  when his housekeeper, Mrs. Gadby, "reported off duty" and retired; and the
  clock in the hall was striking eleven when, having packed the last of the
  shells, he made the tin box into a neat little parcel with the consignee's
  name legibly written on the cover.</p>

  <p>The house was profoundly quiet. Usually Mr. Pottermack was deeply
  appreciative of the restful silence that settles down upon the haunts of men
  when darkness has fallen upon field and hedgerow and the village has gone to
  sleep. Very pleasant it was then to reach down from the bookshelves some
  trusty companion and draw the big easy-chair up to the fireplace, even
  though, as to-night, the night was warm and the grate empty. The force of
  habit did, indeed, even now, lead him to the bookshelves. But no book was
  taken down. He had no inclination for reading to-night. Neither had he any
  inclination for sleep. Instead, he lit a pipe and walked softly up and down
  the room, stem and gloomy of face, yet with a look of concentration as if he
  were considering a difficult problem.</p>

  <p>Up and down, up and down he paced, hardly making a sound. And as the time
  passed, the expression of his face underwent a subtle change. It lost none of
  its sternness, but yet it seemed to clear, as if a solution of the problem
  were coming into sight.</p>

  <p>The striking of the clock in the hall, proclaiming the end of the day,
  brought him to a halt. He glanced at his watch, knocked out his empty pipe,
  lit a candle and blew out the lamp. As he turned to pass out to the stairs,
  something in his expression seemed to hint at a conclusion reached. All the
  anxiety and bewilderment had passed out of his face. Stern it was still; but
  there had come into it a certain resolute calm; the calm of a man who has
  made up his mind.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE SECRET VISITOR</h3>

  <p>The following morning found Mr. Pottermack in an undeniably restless mood.
  For a time he could settle down to no occupation, but strayed about the house
  and garden with an air of such gravity and abstraction that Mrs. Gadby looked
  at him askance and inwardly wondered what had come over her usually buoyant
  and cheerful employer.</p>

  <p>One thing, however, was clear. He was not going to "hop up to town." Of
  the previous expeditions of that kind he had a vivid and unpleasant
  recollection; the big "bearer" cheque sheepishly pushed across the counter,
  the cashier's astonished glance at it, the careful examination of books, and
  then the great bundle of five-pound notes, which he counted, at the cashier's
  request, with burning cheeks; and his ignominious departure with the notes
  buttoned into an inside pocket and an uncomfortable suspicion in his mind
  that the ostentatiously unobservant cashier had guessed at once the nature of
  the transaction. Well, that experience was not going to be repeated on this
  occasion. There was going to be a change of procedure.</p>

  <p>As he could fix his mind at nothing more definite, he decided to devote
  the day to a thorough clear-up of his workshops: a useful and necessary work,
  which had the added advantage of refreshing his memory as to the
  abiding-places of rarely used appliances and materials. And an excellent
  distraction he found it; so much so that several times, in the interest of
  rediscovering some long-forgotten tool or stock of material, he was able to
  forget for a while the critical interview that loomed before him.</p>

  <p>So the day passed. The mid-day meal was consumed mechanically&mdash;under
  the furtive and disapproving observation of Mrs. Gadby&mdash;and dispatched
  with indecent haste. He was conscious of an inclination to lurk about the
  house on the chance of a brief gossip with his fair friend; but he resisted
  it, and, when he came in to tea, the housekeeper reported that the little
  package had been duly collected.</p>

  <p>He lingered over his tea as if he were purposely consuming time, and when
  at last he rose from the table, he informed Mrs. Gadby that he had some
  important work to do and was under no circumstances to be disturbed. Then
  once more he retired to the walled garden, and having shut himself in,
  dropped the key into his pocket. He did not, however, resume his labours in
  the workshop. He merely called in there for an eight-inch steel bolt and a
  small electric lamp, both of which he bestowed in his pockets. Then he came
  out and walked slowly up and down the grass plot with his hands behind him
  and his chin on his breast as if immersed in thought, but glancing from time
  to time at his watch. At a quarter to eight he took off his spectacles and
  put them in his pocket, stepped across to the well, and picking up the hurdle
  that still lay over the dark cavity, carried it away and stood it against the
  wall. Then he softly unbolted the side gate, turned the handle of the latch,
  drew the gate open a bare inch, and, leaving it thus ajar, walked to the
  summer-house, and, entering it, sat down in one of the chairs.</p>

  <p>His visitor, if deficient in some of the virtues, had at least that of
  punctuality; for the clock of the village church had barely finished striking
  the hour when the gate opened noiselessly and the watcher in the summer-house
  saw, through the gathering gloom, a large, portly man enter with stealthy
  step, close the gate silently behind him and softly shoot the upper bolt.</p>

  <p>Pottermack rose as his visitor approached, and the two men met just
  outside the summer-house. There was a striking contrast between them in every
  respect, in build, in countenance, and in manner. The newcomer was a big,
  powerful man, heavy and distinctly over-fat, whose sly, shifty face&mdash;at
  present exhibiting an uneasy smile&mdash;showed evident traces of what is
  commonly miscalled "good living," especially as to the liquid element
  thereof; whereas his host, smallish, light, spare, with clean-cut features
  expressive of lively intelligence, preserved a stony calm as he looked
  steadily into his visitor's evasive eyes.</p>

  <p>"Well, Jeff," the latter began in a deprecating tone, "you don't seem
  overjoyed to see me. Not an effusive welcome. Aren't you going to shake hands
  with an old pal?"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem necessary," Pottermack replied coldly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," the other retorted. "Perhaps you'd like to kiss me
  instead." He sniggered foolishly, and, entering the summer-house, dropped
  into one of the armchairs and continued: "What about a mild refresher while
  we discuss our little business? Looks like being a dry job, to judge by your
  mug."</p>

  <p>Without replying, Pottermack opened a small cupboard, and taking out a
  decanter, a siphon, and a tumbler, placed them on the table by his guest. It
  was not difficult to see that the latter had already fortified himself with
  one or two refreshers, mild or otherwise, but that was not Pottermack's
  affair. He was going to keep his own brain clear. The other might do as he
  pleased.</p>

  <p>"Not going to join me, Jeff?" the visitor protested. "Oh, buck up, old
  chap! It's no use getting peevish about parting with a few pounds. You won't
  miss a little donation to help a pal out of a difficulty."</p>

  <p>As Pottermack made no reply but sat down and gazed stonily before him, the
  other poured out half a tumblerful of whisky, filled up with soda, and took a
  substantial gulp. Then he, too, sat silent for a time, gazing out into the
  darkening garden. And gradually the smile faded from his face, leaving it
  sullen and a little anxious.</p>

  <p>"So you've been digging up your lawn," he remarked presently. What's the
  game? Going to set up a flagstaff?"</p>

  <p>"No. I am going to have a sun-dial there."</p>

  <p>"A sun-dial, hey? Going to get your time on the cheap? Good. I like
  sun-dials. Do their job without ticking. Suppose you'll have a motto on it.
  Tempus fugit is the usual thing. Always appropriate, but especially so in the
  case of a man who has 'done time' and fugitted. It will help to remind you of
  olden days, 'the days that are no more.'" He finished with a mirthless cackle
  and cast a malignant glance at the silent and wooden-faced Pottermack. There
  was another interval of strained, uncomfortable silence, during which the
  visitor took periodic gulps from his tumbler and eyed his companion with
  sullen perplexity. At length, having finished his liquor, he set down the
  empty tumbler and turned towards Pottermack. "You got my letter, I suppose,
  as you left the gate ajar?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the laconic reply.</p>

  <p>"Been up to town to-day?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose you have got the money?"</p>

  <p>"No, I have not."</p>

  <p>The big man sat up stiffly and stared at his companion in dismay.</p>

  <p>"But, damn it, man!" he exclaimed, "didn't I tell you it was urgent? I'm
  in a devil of a fix. I've got to pay that hundred to-morrow. Must pay it, you
  understand. I'm going up to town in the morning to pay. As I hadn't got the
  money myself, I've had to borrow it from&mdash;you know where; and I was
  looking to you to enable me to put it back at once. I must have that money
  to-morrow at the latest. You'd better run up to town in the morning and I'll
  meet you outside your bank."</p>

  <p>Pottermack shook his head. "It can't be done, Lewson. You'll have to make
  some other arrangements."</p>

  <p>Lewson stared at him in mingled amazement and fury. For a moment he was
  too astonished for speech. At length he burst out:</p>

  <p>"Can't be done! What the devil do you mean? You've got the money in your
  bank and you are going to hand it over, or I'll know the reason why. What do
  you imagine you are going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I am going," said Pottermack, "to hold you to your agreement, or at least
  to part of it. You demanded a sum of money&mdash;a large sum&mdash;as the
  price of your silence. It was to be a single payment, once for all, and I
  paid it. You promised solemnly to make no further demands; yet, within a
  couple of months, you did make further demands, and I paid again. Since then
  you have made demands at intervals, regardless of your solemn undertaking.
  Now this has got to stop. There must be an end to it, and this has got to be
  the end."</p>

  <p>As he spoke, quietly but firmly, Lewson gazed at him as if he could not
  trust the evidence of his senses. This was quite a new Pottermack. At length,
  suppressing his anger, he replied in a conciliatory tone:</p>

  <p>"Very well, Jeff. It shall be the end. Help me out just this time and you
  shall hear no more from me. I promise you that on my word of honour."</p>

  <p>At this last word Pottermack smiled grimly. But he answered in the same
  quiet, resolute manner:</p>

  <p>"It is no use, Lewson. You said that last time and the time before that,
  and, in fact, time after time. You have always sworn that each demand should
  be positively the last. And so you will go on, if I let you, until you have
  squeezed me dry."</p>

  <p>On this Lewson threw off all disguise. Thrusting out his chin at
  Pottermack, he exclaimed furiously: "If you let me! And how do you think you
  are going to prevent me? You are quite right. I've got you, and I'm going to
  squeeze you, so now you know. And look here, young fellow, if that money
  isn't handed out to me to-morrow morning, something is going to happen. A
  very surprised gentleman at Scotland Yard will get a letter informing him
  that the late Jeffrey Brandon, runaway convict, is not the late J.B. but is
  alive and kicking, and that his present name and address is Marcus
  Pottermack, Esquire, of 'The Chestnuts,' Borley, Bucks. How will that suit
  you?"</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't suit me at all," Mr. Pottermack replied, with unruffled calm;
  "but before you do it, let me remind you of one or two facts. First, the
  run-away convict, once your closest friend, was to your knowledge an innocent
  man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's no affair of mine," Lewson interrupted. "He was a convict, and is
  one still. Besides, how do I know he was innocent? A jury of his
  fellow-countrymen found him guilty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk rubbish, Lewson," Pottermack broke in impatiently. "There is
  no one here but ourselves. We both know that I didn't do those forgeries and
  we both know who did."</p>

  <p>Lewson grinned as he reached out for the decanter and poured out another
  half-tumblerful of whisky. "If you knew who did it," he chuckled, "you must
  have been a blooming mug not to say."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know then," Pottermack rejoined bitterly. "I thought you were a
  decent, honest fellow, fool that I was."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Lewson agreed, with a low, cackling laugh, "you were a blooming mug
  and that's a fact. Well, well; we live and learn."</p>

  <p>Still sniggering foolishly, he took a long pull at the tumbler, leering
  into the flushed, angry face that confronted him across the table. Suddenly
  Pottermack rose from his chair, and, striding out into the garden, halted
  some dozen paces away and stood with his back to the summer-house, looking
  steadily across the lawn. It was now quite dark, though the moon showed dimly
  from time to time through a thinning of the overcast sky; but still, through
  the gloom, he could make out faintly the glimmer of lighter-coloured soil
  where it had been turned up to level the ground for the sun-dial. The well
  was invisible, but he knew exactly where the black cavity yawned, and his
  eye, locating the spot, rested on it with gloomy fixity.</p>

  <p>His reverie was interrupted by Lewson's voice, now pitched in a more
  ingratiating key.</p>

  <p>"Well, Jeff; thinking it over? That's right, old chap. No use getting
  pippy."</p>

  <p>He paused, and as there was no reply he continued:</p>

  <p>"Come now, dear boy, let's settle the business amicably as old pals
  should. Pity for you to go back to the jug when there's no need. You just
  help me out of this hole, and I will give you my solemn word of honour that
  it shall be the very last time. Won't that satisfy you?"</p>

  <p>Pottermack turned his head slightly, and speaking over his shoulder,
  replied; "Your word of honour! The honour of a blackmailer, a thief and a
  liar. It isn't exactly what you would call a gilt-edged security."</p>

  <p>"Well," the other retorted thickly, "gilt-edged or not, you had better
  take it and shell out. Now, what do you say?"</p>

  <p>"I say," Pottermack replied with quiet decision, "that I am not going to
  give you another farthing on any condition whatever."</p>

  <p>For several seconds Lewson gazed in silent dismay at the shadowy figure on
  the lawn. This final, definite refusal was a contingency that he had never
  dreamed of, and was utterly unprovided for, and it filled him, for the
  moment, with consternation. Then, suddenly, his dismay changed to fury.
  Starting up from his chair, he shouted huskily:</p>

  <p>"Oh, you won't, won't you? We'll see about that! You'll either pay up or
  I'll give you the finest hammering that you've ever had in your life. When
  I've done with you, they'll want your finger-prints to find out who you
  are."</p>

  <p>He paused to watch the effect of this terrifying proposal and to listen
  for a reply. Then, as the dim figure remained unmoved and no answer came, he
  bellowed: "D' you hear? Are you going to pay up or take a hammering?"</p>

  <p>Pottermack turned his head slightly and replied in a quiet, almost a
  gentle tone: "I don't think I'm going to do either."</p>

  <p>The reply and the quiet, unalarmed tone were not quite what Lewson had
  expected. Trusting to the moral effect of his greatly superior size and
  weight, he had bluffed confidently. Now it seemed that he had got to make
  good his threat, and the truth is that he was not eager for the fray.
  However, it had to be done, and done as impressively as possible. After
  pausing for another couple of seconds, he proceeded, with a formidable air
  (but unobserved by Pottermack, whose back was still turned to him), to take
  off his coat and fling it on the table, whence it slipped down on to the
  floor. Then, stepping outside the summer-house, he bent forward, and, with an
  intimidating roar, charged like an angry rhinoceros.</p>

  <p>At the sound of his stamping feet Pottermack spun round and faced him, but
  then stood motionless until his assailant was within a yard of him, when he
  sprang lightly aside, and as the big, unwieldy bully lumbered past him, he
  followed him closely. As soon as Lewson could overcome the momentum of his
  charge, he halted and turned; and instantly a smart left-hander alighted on
  his cheek and a heavy right-hander impinged on his ribs just below the
  armpit. Furious with the pain, and utterly taken aback, he cursed and
  grunted, hitting out wildly with all the viciousness of mingled rage and fear
  for now he realized with amazement that he was hopelessly outclassed by his
  intended victim. Not one of his sledge-hammer blows took effect on that agile
  adversary, whereas his own person seemed to be but an unprotected target on
  which the stinging blows fell in endless and intolerable succession. Slowly
  at first, and then more quickly, he backed away from that terrific
  bombardment, followed inexorably by the calm and scientific Pottermack, who
  seemed to guide and direct his backward course as a skilful drover directs
  the movements of a refractory bullock.</p>

  <p>Gradually the pair moved away from the vicinity of the summer-house across
  the dark lawn, the demoralized bully, breathing hard and sweating profusely,
  reduced to mere defence and evasion while his light-footed antagonist plied
  him unceasingly with feint or blow. Presently Lewson stumbled backwards as
  his foot sank into the loose, heaped earth at the margin of the cleared
  space; but Pottermack did not press his advantage, renewing his attack only
  when Lewson had recovered his balance. Then the movement began again, growing
  faster as the big man became more and more terrified and his evasion passed
  into undissembled retreat; deviously and with many a zig-zag but always
  tending towards the centre of the cleared area. Suddenly Pottermack's tactics
  changed. The rapid succession of light blows ceased for an instant and he
  seemed to gather himself up as if for a decisive effort. There was a quick
  feint with the left; then his right fist shot out like lightning and drove
  straight on to the point of the other man's jaw, and as his teeth clicked
  together with an audible snap, Lewson dropped like a pole-axed ox, falling
  with his body from the waist upwards across the mouth of the well and his
  head on the brick edge, on which it struck with a sickening thud.</p>

  <p>So he lay for a second or two until the limp trunk began to sag and the
  chin came forward on to the breast. Suddenly the head slipped off the brick
  edge and dropped into the cavity, shedding its cap and carrying the trunk
  with it. The heavy jerk started the rest of the body sliding forward, slowly
  at first, then with increasing swiftness until the feet rose for an instant,
  kicked at the farther edge and were gone. From the black pit issued vague,
  echoing murmurs, followed presently by a hollow, reverberating splash; and
  after that, silence.</p>

  <p>It had been but a matter of seconds. Even as those cavernous echoes were
  muttering in the unseen depths, Pottermack's knuckles were still tingling
  from the final blow. From the moment when that blow had been struck he had
  made no move. He had seen his enemy fall, had heard the impact of the head on
  the brick edge, and had stood looking down with grim composure on the body as
  it sagged, slid forward, and at last made its dreadful dive down into the
  depths of its sepulchre. But he had moved not a muscle. It was a horrible
  affair. But it had to be. Not he, but Lewson had made the decision.</p>

  <p>As the last reverberations died away he approached the forbidding circle
  of blackness, and kneeling down at its edge, peered into the void. Of course,
  he could see nothing; and when he listened intently, not a sound came to his
  ear. From his pocket he brought out his little electric lamp and threw a beam
  of light down into the dark cavity. The effect was very strange and uncanny.
  He found himself looking down a tube of seemingly interminable length while
  from somewhere far away, down in the very bowels of the earth, a tiny spark
  of light glowed steadily. So even the last ripples had died away and all was
  still down in that underworld.</p>

  <p>He replaced the lamp in his pocket, but nevertheless he remained kneeling
  by the well-mouth, resting on one hand, gazing down into the black void and
  unconsciously listening for some sound from below. Despite his outward
  composure, he was severely shaken. His heart still raced, his forehead was
  damp with sweat, his body and limbs were pervaded by a fine, nervous
  tremor.</p>

  <p>Yet he was sensible of a feeling of relief. The dreadful thing that he had
  nerved himself to do, that he had looked forward to with shuddering horror,
  was done. And the doing of it might have been so much worse. He was relieved
  to feel the screw-bolt in his pocket&mdash;unused; to think that the body had
  slipped down into its grave without the need of any hideous dragging or
  thrusting. Almost, he began to persuade himself that it had been more or less
  of an accident. At any rate, it was over and done with. His merciless enemy
  was gone. The menace to his liberty, the constant fear that had haunted him
  were no more. At last&mdash;at long last&mdash;he was free.</p>

  <p>Fear of discovery he had none; for Lewson, in his own interests, had
  insisted on strict secrecy as to their acquaintance with each other. In his
  own words, "he preferred to sit on his own nest-egg." Hence to all the world
  they were strangers, not necessarily even aware of each other's existence.
  And the blackmailer's stealthy arrival and his care in silently shutting the
  gate gave a guarantee that no one had seen him enter.</p>

  <p>While these thoughts passed somewhat confusedly through his mind, he
  remained in the same posture; still unconsciously listening and still gazing,
  as if with a certain expectancy, into the black hole before him, or letting
  his eyes travel, now and again, round the dark garden. Presently an opening
  in the dense pall of cloud that obscured the sky uncovered the moon and
  flooded the garden with light. The transition from darkness to brilliant
  light&mdash;for it was full moon&mdash;was so sudden that Pottermack looked
  up with a nervous start, as though to see who had thrown the light on him;
  and in his overwrought state he even found something disquieting in the pale,
  bright disc with its queer, dim, impassive face that seemed to be looking
  down on him through the rent in the cloud like some secret watcher peeping
  from behind a curtain. He rose to his feet, and, drawing a deep breath,
  looked around him; and then his glance fell on something more real and more
  justly disquieting. From the edge of the grass to the brink of the well was a
  double track of footprints, meandering to and fro, zig-zagging hither and
  thither, but undeniably ending at the well.</p>

  <p>Their appearance was sinister in the extreme. In the bright moonlight they
  stared up from the pale buff soil, and they shouted of tragedy. To the police
  eye they would have been the typical "signs of a struggle"; the tracks of two
  men facing one another and moving towards the well with, presently, a single
  track coming away from it. No one could mistake the meaning of those tracks;
  nothing could explain them away&mdash;especially in view of what was at the
  bottom of the well.</p>

  <p>The first glance at those tracks gave Pottermack a severe shock. But he
  recovered from it in a moment. For they were mere transitory marks that could
  be obliterated in a minute or two by a few strokes of a rake and a few sweeps
  of a besom; and meanwhile he stooped over them, examining them with a curious
  interest not unmixed with a certain vague uneasiness. They were very
  remarkable impressions. He had already noted the peculiar quality of this
  loamy soil; its extraordinary suitability for making casting-moulds. And here
  was a most striking illustration of this property. The prints of his own feet
  were so perfect that the very brads in his soles were quite clear and
  distinct, while as to Lewson's, they were positively ridiculous. Every detail
  of the rubber soles and the circular rubber heels came out as sharply as if
  the impressions had been taken in moulding-wax. There was the prancing horse
  of Kent&mdash;the soles were of the Invicta brand and practically
  new&mdash;with the appropriate legend and the manufacturers' name, and in the
  central star-shaped space of the heels was the perfect impression of the
  screw. No doubt the singular sharpness of the prints was due to the fact that
  a heavy shower in the previous night had brought the loam to that particular
  state of dampness that the professional moulder seeks to produce with his
  watering-pot.</p>

  <p>However, interesting as the prints were to the mechanic's eye, the sooner
  they were got rid of the better. Thus reflecting, Pottermack strode away
  towards the workshop in quest of a rake and a besom; and he was, in fact,
  reaching out to grasp the handle of the door when he stopped dead and stood
  for some seconds rigid and still with outstretched arm and dropped jaw. For
  in that moment a thought which had, no doubt, been stirring in his
  subconscious mind had come to the surface, and for the first time the chill
  of real terror came over him. Suddenly he realized that he had no monopoly of
  this remarkable loam. It was the soil of the neighbourhood&mdash;and
  incidentally of the little lane that led from the town and passed along
  beside his wall. In that lane there must be a single track of
  footprints&mdash;big, staring footprints, and every one of them as good as a
  signature of James Lewson&mdash;leading from the town and stopping at his
  gate!</p>

  <p>After a few moments of horror-stricken reflection he darted into the
  tool-house and brought out a short ladder. His first impulse had been to open
  the gate and peer out, but an instant's reflection had shown him the folly of
  exposing himself to the risk of being seen&mdash;especially at the very gate
  to which the tracks led. He now carried the ladder across to an old pear tree
  which thrust its branches over the wall, and, planting it silently where the
  foliage was densest, crept softly up and listened awhile. As no sound of
  footsteps was audible, and as the moon had for the moment retired behind the
  bank of cloud, he cautiously advanced his head over the wall and looked down
  into the lane. It was too dark to see far in either direction, but apparently
  there was no one about; and as the country quiet was unbroken by any sound,
  he ventured to crane farther forward to inspect the path below.</p>

  <p>The light was very dim; but even so he could make out faintly a single
  track of footprints&mdash;large footprints, widely spaced, the footprints of
  a tall man. But even as he was peering down at them through the darkness,
  trying to distinguish in the vaguely seen shapes some recognizable features,
  the moon burst forth again and the light became almost as that of broad day.
  Instantly the half-seen shapes started up with a horrid distinctness that
  made him catch his breath. There was the preposterous prancing horse with the
  legend "Invicta," there was the makers' name, actually legible from the
  height of the wall, and there were the circular heels with their raised
  central stars and the very screws clearly visible even to their slots!</p>

  <p>Pottermack was profoundly alarmed. But he was not a panicky man. There, in
  those footprints, was evidence enough to hang him. But he was not hanged yet;
  and he did not mean to be, if the unpleasantness could be avoided. Perched on
  the ladder, with his eyes riveted on the tracks of the man who had come to
  "squeeze" him, he reviewed the situation with cool concentration, and
  considered the best way to deal with it.</p>

  <p>The obvious thing was to go out and trample on those footprints until they
  were quite obliterated. But to this plan there were several objections. In
  the first place, those enormous impressions would take a deal of trampling
  out. Walking over them once would be quite useless, for his own feet were
  comparatively small, and even a fragment of one of Lewson's footprints would
  be easily recognizable. Moreover, the trampling process would involve the
  leaving of his own footprints in evidence; which might be disastrous if it
  should happen&mdash;as it easily might&mdash;that Lewson had been seen
  starting along the footpath. For this path, unfrequented as it was, turned
  off from the main road at the outskirts of the town where wayfarers were
  numerous enough. The reason that it was unfrequented was that it led only to
  a wood and a stretch of heath which were more easily approached by a by-road.
  Finally, he himself might quite possibly be seen performing the trampling
  operations, and that would never do. In short, the trampling scheme was not
  practicable at all.</p>

  <p>But what alternative was there? Something must be done. Very soon the man
  would be missed and there would be a search for him; and as things stood
  there was a set of tracks ready to guide the searchers from the town to
  his&mdash;Pottermack's&mdash;very gate. And inside the gate was the open
  well. Clearly, something must be done, and done at once. But what?</p>

  <p>As he asked himself this question again and again he was half-consciously
  noting the conditions. Hitherto, no one had seen Lewson's footprints at this
  part of the path. That was evident from the fact that there were no other
  fresh footprints&mdash;none that trod on Lewson's. Then, in half an hour at
  the most, the shadow of the wall would be thrown over the path and the tracks
  would then be quite inconspicuous. And, again, it was now past nine o'clock
  and his neighbours were early folk. It was extremely unlikely that any one
  would pass along that path until the morning. So there was still time. But
  time for what?</p>

  <p>One excellent plan occurred to him, but, alas! he had not the means to
  carry it out. If only he had possession of Lewson's shoes he could put them
  on, slip out at the gate and continue the tracks to some distant spot well
  out of his neighbourhood. That would be a perfect solution of the problem.
  But Lewson's shoes had vanished for ever from human ken&mdash;at least, he
  hoped they had. So that plan was impracticable.</p>

  <p>And yet, was it? As he put the question to himself his whole demeanour
  changed. He stood up on his perch with a new eagerness in his face; the
  eagerness of a man who has struck a brilliant idea. For that was what he had
  done. This excellent plan, which yielded the perfect solution, was
  practicable after all. Lewson's shoes were indeed beyond his reach. But he
  had a fine assortment of Lewson's footprints. Now footprints are made by the
  soles of shoes. That is the normal process. But by the exercise of a little
  ingenuity the process could be reversed; shoe-soles could be made from
  footprints.</p>

  <p>He descended the ladder, thinking hard; and as the cloud once more closed
  over the moon, he fetched the hurdle and placed it carefully over the mouth
  of the well. Then he walked slowly towards the workshop&mdash;avoiding the
  now invaluable footprints&mdash;shaping his plan as he went.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER III&mdash;MR. POTTERMACK GOES A-SUGARING</h3>

  <p>The efficient workman saves a vast amount of time by so planning out his
  job in advance that intervals of waiting are eliminated. Now Mr. Pottermack
  was an eminently methodical man and he was very sensible that, in the
  existing circumstances, time was precious. Accordingly, although his plan was
  but roughly sketched out in his mind, he proceeded forthwith to execute that
  part of it which could be clearly visualized, filling in the further details
  mentally as he worked.</p>

  <p>The first thing to be done was, obviously, to convert the perishable,
  ephemeral footprints, which a light shower would destroy, into solid, durable
  models. To this end, he fetched from the workshop the tin of fine plaster of
  Paris which he kept for making small or delicate moulds. By the aid of his
  little lamp he selected a specially deep and perfect impression of Lewson's
  right foot, and into this he lightly dusted the fine powder, continuing the
  process until the surface was covered with an even layer of about half an
  inch thick. This he pressed down very gently with the flat end of the lamp,
  and then went in search of a suitable impression of the left foot, which he
  treated in like manner. He next selected a second pair of prints, but instead
  of dusting the dry plaster into them he merely dropped into each a pinch to
  serve as a mark for identifying it. His reason for thus varying the method
  was that he was doubtful whether it was possible to pour liquid plaster into
  a loam mould (for that was what the footprint actually was) without
  disturbing the surface and injuring the pattern.</p>

  <p>Returning to the workshop, he mixed a good-sized bowl of plaster, stirring
  and beating the creamy liquid with a large spoon. Still stirring, he carried
  it out, and, going first to the prints which contained the dry plaster, he
  carefully ladled into them with the spoon small quantities of the liquid
  plaster until they were well filled. By this time the liquid was growing
  appreciably thicker and more suitable for the unprotected prints, to which he
  accordingly hastened, and proceeded quickly, but with extreme care, to fill
  them until the now rapidly thickening plaster was well heaped up above the
  surface.</p>

  <p>He had now at least, a quarter of an hour to wait while the plaster was
  setting, but this he occupied in cleaning out the bowl and spoon ready for
  the next mixing, placing the brush and plaster tools in readiness and pouring
  out a saucerful of soap-size. When he had made these preparations, he filled
  a small jug with water, and making his way to the first two impressions,
  poured the water on to them to make up for that which would have been
  absorbed by the dry plaster underneath. In the second pair of impressions,
  which he ventured to test by a light touch of the finger, the plaster was
  already quite solid, and he was strongly tempted to raise them and see what
  luck he had had; but he resisted the temptation and went back to the
  workshop, leaving them to harden completely.</p>

  <p>All this time, although he had given the closest attention to what he was
  doing, his mind had been working actively, and already the sketch-plan was
  beginning to shape into a complete and detailed scheme; for he had suddenly
  remembered a supply of sheet gutta-percha which he had unearthed when he
  turned out the workshop, and this discovery disposed of what had been his
  chief difficulty. Now, in readiness for a later stage of his work, he lighted
  his Primus stove, and having filled a good-sized saucepan with water, placed
  it on the stove to heat. This consumed the rest of the time that he had
  allotted for the hardening of the plaster, and he now went forth with no
  little anxiety to see what the casts were like. For they were the really
  essential element of his plan on which success or failure depended. If he
  could get a perfect reproduction of the footprints, the rest of his task,
  troublesome as it promised to be, would be plain sailing.</p>

  <p>Very gingerly he insinuated his finger under one of the casts of the
  second pair and gently turned it over. And then, as he threw the light of his
  lamp on it, all his misgivings vanished in respect of that foot&mdash;the
  right. The aspect of the cast was positively ridiculous. It was just the sole
  of a shoe; snow-white, but otherwise completely realistic, and perfect in
  every detail and marking, even to the makers' name. And the second cast was
  equally good; so his special precautions had been unnecessary. Nevertheless,
  he went on to the first pair, and they proved to be, if anything, sharper and
  cleaner, more free from adherent particles of earth than the others. With a
  sigh of relief he picked up the four casts and bore them tenderly to the
  workshop, where he deposited them on the bench. There, under the bright
  electric light, their appearance was even more striking. But he did not stop
  to gloat. He could do that while he was working.</p>

  <p>The first proceeding was to trim off the ragged edges with a scraper, and
  then came the process of "sizing"&mdash;painting with a boiled solution of
  soft soap&mdash;which also cleaned away the adherent particles of loam. When
  the soap had soaked in and "stopped" the surface, the surplus was washed away
  under the tap, and then, with a soft brush, an infinitesimal coating of olive
  oil was applied. The casts were now ready for the next stage&mdash;the making
  of the moulds. First, Pottermack filled a shallow tray with loam from the
  garden, striking the surface level with a straight-edge. On this surface the
  two best casts were laid, sole upwards, and pressed down until they were
  slightly embedded. Then came the mixing of another bowl of plaster, and this
  was "gauged" extra stiff in order that it should set quickly and set hard. By
  the time this had been poured on&mdash;rapidly, but with infinite care to
  avoid bubbles, which would have marred the perfection of the moulds&mdash;the
  water in the saucepan was boiling. Having cleaned out the bowl and spoon,
  Pottermack fetched the pieces of gutta-percha from their drawer and dropped
  them into the saucepan, replacing the lid. Then he put on his spectacles,
  extinguished the lamp, switched off the light, and, passing out of the
  workshop, walked quickly towards the house.</p>

  <p>As he let himself out of the walled garden and closed the door behind him,
  he had a strange feeling as of one awakening from a dream. The familiar
  orchard and kitchen garden through which he was now passing, and the lighted
  windows of the house which twinkled through the trees, brought him back to
  the realities of his quiet, usually uneventful life and made the tragic
  interlude of the past hour seem incredible and unreal. He pondered on it with
  a sort of dull surprise as he walked up the long path; on all that had
  happened since he had last walked along it a few hours ago. How changed since
  then was his world&mdash;and himself! Then, he was an innocent man over whom
  yet hung the menace of the convict prison. Now, that menace was lifted, but
  he was an innocent man no more. Legally&mdash;technically, he put it to
  himself&mdash;he was a murderer; and the menace of the prison was exchanged
  for that of the rope. But there was this difference: the one had been an
  abiding menace that had been with him for the term of his life; the other was
  a temporary peril from which, when he had once freed himself, he would be
  free for ever.</p>

  <p>His appearance in the house was hailed by Mrs. Gadby with a sigh of
  relief. It seemed that she had made a special effort in the matter of supper
  and had feared lest her trouble should be wasted after all. Very complacently
  she inducted him into the dining-room and awaited, with confidence born of
  much experience, his appreciative comments.</p>

  <p>"Why, bless my soul, Mrs. Gadby!" he exclaimed, gazing at the display on
  the table, "it's a regular banquet! Roses, too! And do I see a bottle under
  that shawl?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gadby smilingly raised the shawl, revealing a small wooden tub in
  which a bottle of white wine stood embedded in ice. "I thought," she
  explained, "that a glass of Chablis would go rather well with the
  lobster."</p>

  <p>"Rather well!" exclaimed Pottermack. "I should think it will. But why
  these extraordinary festivities?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said Mrs. Gadby, "you haven't seemed to be quite yourself the
  last day or two. Not in your usual spirits. So I thought a nice little supper
  and a glass of wine might pick you up a bit."</p>

  <p>"And so it will, I am sure," affirmed Pottermack. "To-morrow you will find
  me as lively as a cricket and as gay as a lark. And, by the way, Mrs. Gadby,
  don't clear the table to-night. I am going out sugaring presently, and as I
  may be late getting back I shall probably be ready for another little meal
  before turning in. And of course you won't bolt the door&mdash;but I expect
  you will have gone to bed before I start."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Gadby acknowledged these instructions and retired in sedate triumph.
  Particularly gratified was she at the evident satisfaction with which her
  employer had regarded the Chablis. A happy thought of hers, that had been. In
  which she was right in general though mistaken in one particular. For it was
  not the wine that had brought that look of satisfaction to Pottermack's face.
  It was the ice. Mrs. Gadby's kindly forethought had disposed of the last of
  his difficulties.</p>

  <p>Before sitting down to supper, he ran up to his bedroom, ostensibly for
  the necessary wash and brush up; but first he visited a spacious cupboard
  from the ground floor of which he presently took a pair of over-shoes that he
  was accustomed to wear in very rainy or snowy weather. Their upper parts were
  of strong waterproof cloth and their soles of balata,[also batata] cemented
  on to leather inner soles. He had, in fact, cemented them on himself when the
  original soles had worn through, and he still had, in the workshop, a large
  tin nearly full of the cement. He now inspected the soles critically, and
  when, after having washed and made himself tidy, he went down to the
  dining-room, he carried the over-shoes down with him and slipped them out of
  sight under the table.</p>

  <p>Although he was pretty sharp-set after his strenuous and laborious
  evening, he made but a hasty meal; for time was precious and he could dispose
  of the balance of the feast when he had finished his task. Rising from the
  table, he picked up the over-shoes, and, stealing softly out into the garden,
  laid them down beside the path. Then he stole back to the dining-room, whence
  he walked briskly to the kitchen and tapped at the door.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Mrs. Gadby," he called out cheerfully. "I shall be starting
  when I've got my traps together. Leave everything as it is in the dining-room
  so that I can have a snack when I come in. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>"Good-night, sir," the housekeeper responded cordially, presenting a
  smiling countenance at the door, "and good luck with the moths, though I must
  admit, sir, that they don't seem to me worth all the trouble of catching
  them."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mrs. Gadby," said Pottermack, "but you see you are not a naturalist.
  You would think better of the moths, I expect, if they were good to eat."
  With this and a chuckle, in which the housekeeper joined, he turned away and
  went forth into the garden, where, having picked up the over-shoes, he made
  his way up the long path to the door of the walled garden. As he unlocked the
  door and let himself into the enclosure, he was again sensible of a change of
  atmosphere. The vision of that fatal combat rose before him with horrid
  vividness and once more he felt the menace of the rope hanging over him. He
  went to the ladder and looked over the wall to see if any new tracks had
  appeared on the path to tell of some wayfarer who might hereafter become a
  witness. But the path was shrouded in darkness so profound that he could not
  even see the tracks that he knew were there; so he descended, and, crossing
  the lawn by the well&mdash;where some unaccountable impulse led him to stop
  for a while and listen&mdash;re-entered the workshop, switched on the light
  and laid the over-shoes on the bench.</p>

  <p>First, he assured himself by a touch that the saucepan was still hot. Then
  he turned his attention to the moulds. They were as hard as stone, and, as he
  had made them thick and solid, he ventured to use some little force in trying
  to separate them from the casts; but all his efforts failed. Then, since he
  could not prise them open with a knife for fear of marking them, he filled a
  bucket with water and in this immersed each of the moulds with its adherent
  cast, when, after a few seconds' soaking, they came apart quite easily.</p>

  <p>He stood for a few moments with the cast of the right foot in one hand and
  its mould in the other, looking at them with a sort of amused surprise. They
  were so absurdly realistic in spite of their staring whiteness. The cast was
  simply a white shoe-sole; the mould an exact reproduction of the original
  footprint; and both were preposterously complete, not only in respect of the
  actual pattern and lettering but even of the little trivial accidental
  characters such as a clean cut&mdash;probably made by a sharp
  stone&mdash;across the neck of the prancing horse and a tiny angular fragment
  of gravel which had become embedded in the rubber heel. However, this was no
  time for contemplation. The important fact was that both the moulds appeared
  to be quite perfect. If the rest of the operations should be as successful,
  he would be in a fair way of winning through this present danger to find a
  permanent security.</p>

  <p>He began with the right mould. Having first poured into it a little of the
  hot water from the saucepan, to take the chill off the surface, he laid it on
  a carefully folded towel, spread on the bench. Then with a pair of tongs he
  picked out of the saucepan one of the pieces of gutta-percha&mdash;now quite
  soft and plastic&mdash;and laid it in the mould, which it filled completely,
  with some overlap. As it was, at the moment, too hot to work comfortably with
  the fingers, he pressed it into the mould with a wet file-handle, replacing
  this as soon as possible with the infinitely more efficient thumb. It was a
  somewhat tedious process, for every part of the surface had to be pressed
  into the mould so that no detail should be missed; but it was not until the
  hardening of the gutta-percha as it cooled rendered further manipulation
  useless that Pottermack laid it aside as finished and proceeded to operate in
  like manner on the other mould.</p>

  <p>When both moulds were filled, he immersed them in the cold water in the
  bucket in order to cool and harden the gutta-percha more quickly, and leaving
  them there, he turned his attention to the over-shoes. The important question
  was as to their size. How did they compare with Lewson's shoes? He had
  assumed that they were as nearly as possible alike in size, but now, when he
  placed one of the over-shoes, sole upwards, beside the corresponding cast, he
  felt some misgivings. However, a few careful measurements with a tape-measure
  reassured him. The over-shoes were a trifle larger&mdash;an eighth of an inch
  wider and nearly a quarter of an inch longer than the casts, so that there
  would be a sixteenth overlap at the sides and an eighth at the toe and heel.
  That would be of no importance; or if it were, he could pare off the
  overlap.</p>

  <p>Much encouraged, he fell to work on the over-shoes. He knew all about
  batata soles. The present ones&mdash;which were of one piece with the flat
  heels&mdash;he had stuck on with a powerful fusible cement. All that he had
  to do now was to warm them cautiously over the Primus stove until the cement
  was softened and then peel them off; and when he had done this, there were
  the flat leather soles, covered with the sticky cement, all ready for the
  attachment of the gutta-percha "squeezes."</p>

  <p>There was still one possible snag ahead. The squeezes might have stuck to
  the moulds; for gutta-percha is a sticky material when hot. However, the
  moulds had been saturated with water and usually gutta-percha will not stick
  to a wet surface, so he hoped for the best. Nevertheless it was with some
  anxiety that he fished one of the moulds out of the bucket, and, grasping an
  overlapping edge of the squeeze with a pair of flat-nosed pliers, gave a
  cautious and tentative pull. As it showed no sign of yielding, he shifted to
  another part of the overlap and made gentle traction on that, with no better
  result. He then tried the piece of overlap that projected beyond the toe, and
  here he had better luck; for, as he gave a firm, steady pull, the squeeze
  separated visibly from the mould, and, with a little coaxing, came out
  bodily.</p>

  <p>Pottermack turned it over eagerly to see what result his labours had
  yielded, and as his glance fell on the smooth, brown surface he breathed a
  sigh of deep satisfaction. He could have asked for no better result. The
  squeeze had not failed at a single point. There was the horse with the little
  gash in its neck, the inscription and the makers' mark; the circular heel
  with its sunk, five-pointed star, the little marks of wear, and the central
  screw showing its slot quite distinctly. Even the little grain of embedded
  gravel was there. The impression was perfect. He had never seen the soles of
  Lewson's shoes, but he knew now exactly what they looked like. For here
  before him was an absolutely faithful facsimile.</p>

  <p>Handling it with infinite tenderness&mdash;for gutta-percha, when once
  softened, is slow to harden completely&mdash;he replaced it in the bucket,
  and taking out the other mould, repeated the extracting operation with the
  same patient care and with a similar happy result. It remained now only to
  pare off the overlap round the edges, shave off with a sharp knife one or two
  slight projections on the upper surface and wipe the latter perfectly dry.
  When this was done, the soles were ready for fixing on the over-shoes.</p>

  <p>Placing the invaluable tin of cement on the bench near the Primus,
  Pottermack proceeded to warm the sole of one of the over-shoes over the
  flame. Then, scooping out a lump of tough cement, he transferred it to the
  warmed sole and spread it out evenly with a hot spatula. The next operation
  was more delicate and rather risky; for the upper surface of the gutta-percha
  sole had to be coated with cement without warming the mass of the sole enough
  to endanger the impression on its under surface. However, by loading the
  spatula with melted cement and wiping it swiftly over the surface, the
  perilous operation was completed without mishap. And now came the final
  stage. Fixing the over-shoe in the bench-vice, and once more passing the hot
  spatula over its cemented sole, Pottermack picked up the gutta-percha sole
  and carefully placed it in position on the over-shoe, adjusting it so that
  the overlaps at the sides and the toe were practically equal, the larger
  overlap at the heel being&mdash;by reason of the thickness of the
  latter&mdash;of no consequence.</p>

  <p>When the second shoe had been dealt with in a similar manner and with a
  like success, and the pair placed on the bench, soles upward, to cool and
  harden, Pottermack emptied the bucket, and, carrying it in his hand, stole
  out of the workshop and made his way out of the walled garden into the
  orchard, where he advanced cautiously along the path. Presently the house
  came into view and he saw with satisfaction that the lower part was in
  darkness whereas lights were visible at two of the upper windows&mdash;those
  of the respective bedrooms of Mrs. Gadby and the maid. Thereupon he walked
  forward boldly, let himself silently into the house and tiptoed to the
  dining-room, where, having closed the door, he proceeded at once to transfer
  the ice and the ice-cold water from the tub to the bucket. Then, in the same
  silent manner, he went out into the garden, softly closing the door after
  him, and took his way back to the workshop.</p>

  <p>Here his first proceeding was to take down from a shelf a large, deep
  porcelain dish, such as photographers use. This he placed on the bench and
  poured into it the iced water from the bucket. Then, taking up the shoes, one
  at a time, he lowered them slowly and carefully, soles downward, into the
  iced water and finished by packing the ice round them. And there he left them
  to cool and harden completely while he attended to one or two other important
  matters.</p>

  <p>The first of these was the line of tell-tale footprints leading to the
  well. They had served their invaluable purpose and now it was time to get rid
  of them; which he did forthwith with the aid of a rake and a hard broom. Then
  there must be one or two footprints outside the gate that would need to be
  obliterated. He took the broom and rake, and, crossing to the gate, listened
  awhile, then softly opened it, listened again and peered out. Having
  satisfied himself that there was no one in sight, he stooped to scrutinize
  the ground and finally went down on his hands and knees. Sure enough, there
  were four footprints that told the story much too plainly for safety: two
  diverging from the main track towards the gate and two more pointing directly
  towards it. Their existence was a little disquieting at the first glance, for
  they might already have been seen; but a close scrutiny of the ground for
  signs of any more recent footprints reassured him. Evidently Lewson was the
  last person who had trodden that path. Having established this encouraging
  fact, Pottermack, still keeping inside his gate, passed the rake lightly over
  the four footprints and then smoothed the surface with the broom.</p>

  <p>His preparations were now nearly complete. Re-closing the gate, he went
  back to the workshop to prepare his outfit. For though the "sugaring"
  expedition was but a pretext, he intended to carry it through with completely
  convincing realism. On that realism it was quite conceivable that his future
  safety might depend. Accordingly he proceeded to pack the large rucksack that
  he usually carried on these expeditions with the necessary appliances: a
  store of collecting-boxes, the killing-jar, a supply of pins, the
  folding-net, an air-tight metal pot which he filled with pieces of rag
  previously dipped into the sugaring mixture and reeking of beer and rum, and
  an electric inspection-lamp. When he had packed it, he laid the net-stick by
  its side and then turned his attention to the shoes.</p>

  <p>The gutta-percha soles were now quite cold and hard. He dried them
  carefully with a soft rag, and as he did so, the little surrounding overlap
  caught his eye. It seemed to be of no consequence. It was very unlikely that
  it would leave any mark on the ground, unless he should meet with an
  exceptionally soft patch. Still, there had been no overlap on Lewson's shoes,
  and it was better to be on the safe side. Thus reflecting, he took from the
  tool-rack a shoemaker's knife, and having given it a rub or two on the emery
  board, neatly shaved away the overlap on each sole to a steep bevel. Now the
  impression would be perfect no matter what kind of ground he met with.</p>

  <p>This was the finishing touch, and he was now ready to go forth. Slipping
  his arms through the straps of the rucksack, he picked up the net-stick, took
  down from a peg his working apron, tucked the shoes under his arm, switched
  off the light and went out, crossing the lawn direct to the side gate. Here
  he spread the apron on the ground, and, stepping on to it, listened for a few
  moments and then softly opened the gate. Having taken a cautious peep out to
  assure himself that there was no one in sight, he slipped on and fastened the
  over-shoes, and, taking the inspection-lamp from the rucksack, dropped the
  battery into his coat pocket and hooked the bull's-eye into a button-hole.
  Then, throwing the light for an instant on the path and marking the correct
  spot by his eye, he stepped out sideways, planting his right foot on the
  smoothly swept ground a pace in front of the last impression of Lewson's left
  foot.</p>

  <p>Steadying himself with the net-stick, he pulled the gate to until the
  latch clicked; then he put down his left foot a good pace in advance and set
  forth on his pilgrimage, carefully adapting the length of his stride to
  match, as well as he could judge, that of his long-legged predecessor.</p>

  <p>The country was profoundly quiet, and, though the moon peeped out now and
  again, the night was for the most part so dark that he had occasionally to
  switch on his lamp to make sure that he was keeping to the path. The state of
  affairs, however, that these occasional flashes revealed was highly
  encouraging, for though the beaten surface of the path showed numerous traces
  of human feet, these were mostly faint and ill-defined, and none of them
  looked very recent. They suggested that few wayfarers used this path, and
  that the very striking tracks that he was laying down might remain
  undisturbed and plainly visible for many days unless a heavy rain should fall
  and wash them away.</p>

  <p>So Pottermack trudged on, stepping out with conscious effort and keeping
  his attention fixed on the regulation of his stride. About half a mile from
  home the path entered a small wood, and here the aid of the lamp was needed
  continuously. Here, too, the sodden state of the path caused Pottermack to
  congratulate himself on his wise caution in shaving off the overlaps. For in
  this soft earth they would have shown distinctly and might have attracted
  undesirable notice&mdash;that is, if any one should give the footprints more
  than the passing glance that would suffice for recognition; which was in the
  highest degree unlikely.</p>

  <p>Presently the path emerged from the wood and meandered across a rough
  common, covered with gorse and heather. Eventually, as Pottermack knew, it
  joined, nearly at a right angle, a by-road, which in its turn opened on the
  main London road. Here, he decided, the tracks could plausibly be lost; and
  as he drew near to the neighbourhood of the by-road he kept a sharp look-out
  for some indication of its whereabouts. At length he made out dimly a gate
  which he recognized as marking a little bridge across the roadside ditch. At
  once he stepped off the path into the heather, and, after walking on some
  twenty paces, halted, and unfastening the over-shoes, slipped them off. Then
  he took off the rucksack, turned out its contents, and having stowed the
  shoes at the bottom, repacked it and put it on again.</p>

  <p>Hitherto he had not met or seen a soul since he started, and he was rather
  anxious not to meet any one until he was clear of this neighbourhood. His
  recent activities had perhaps made him a little over-conscious. Still, this
  was the night of the disappearance and here the tracks faded into the
  heather. If he were seen hereabouts, he might hereafter be questioned as to
  whether he had seen the missing man. No great harm in that, perhaps; but he
  had the feeling that it were much better for him not to be associated with
  the affair in any way. There were all sorts of possible snags. For instance,
  how did he get here without leaving any footprints on the path by which he
  would naturally have come? From which it will be seen that, if conscience was
  not making a coward of Mr. Pottermack, it was at least a little unduly
  stimulating his imagination. And yet it was as well to err on the right
  side.</p>

  <p>Turning back, he strode on through the heather until he came once more to
  the path, which he crossed by a long jump that landed him in the heather on
  the farther side. He now struck across the common, making for a detached
  coppice that formed an outlier of the wood. As soon as he reached it he fell
  to work without delay on the completion of his programme, pinning the pieces
  of sugared rag on the trunks of half a dozen trees. Usually he gave the moths
  ample time to find the bait and assemble round it. But to-night, with that
  incriminating pair of shoes in his rucksack, his methods were more summary.
  By the time that he had pinned on the last rag, one or two moths had begun to
  flutter round the first, easily visible in the darkness by the uncanny,
  phosphorescent glow of their eyes. Pottermack unfolded his net, and, screwing
  it on to the stick switched on his lamp and proceeded to make one or two
  captures, transferring the captives from the net to the killing-jar, and,
  after the necessary interval, thence to the collecting-boxes.</p>

  <p>He was not feeling avaricious to-night. He wanted to get home and bring
  his task definitely to an end. He was even disposed to resent the indecent
  way in which the moths began to swarm round the rags. They seemed to be
  inviting him to make a night of it, as they were doing amidst the fumes of
  the rum. But he was not to be tempted. When he had pinned a dozen specimens
  in his collecting-box and put a few more in the lethal jar, he considered
  that he had done enough to account plausibly for his nocturnal expedition.
  Thereupon he packed up, and, leaving the lepidopterous revellers to the joys
  of intoxication, he turned away and strode off briskly in the direction of
  the by-road, carrying the net still screwed to the stick. A few minutes'
  rough walking brought him to the road, down which he turned in the direction
  of the town. In another ten minutes he reached the outskirts of the town and
  the road on which his house fronted. At this late hour it was as deserted as
  the country; indeed in its whole length he encountered but a single
  person&mdash;a jovial constable who greeted him with an indulgent smile as he
  fixed a twinkling eye on the butterfly net, and, having playfully enquired
  what Mr. Pottermack had got in that bag, hoped that he had had good sport,
  and wished him good-night. So Pottermack went on his way, faintly amused at
  the flutter into which the constable's facetious question had put him. For if
  it had chanced that the guardian of the law had been a stranger and had
  insisted on examining the bag, nothing could have been more apparently
  innocent than its contents. But the guilty man finds it hard to avoid
  projecting into the minds of others the secret knowledge that his own mind
  harbours.</p>

  <p>When Pottermack at last let himself in at his front door and secured it
  with bolt and chain, he breathed a sigh of relief. The horrible chapter was
  closed. Tomorrow he could clear away the last souvenirs of that hideous scene
  in the garden and then, in the peace and security of his new life, try to
  forget the price that he had paid for it. So he reflected as he carried the
  tub to the scullery and drew into it enough water to account for the vanished
  ice; as he washed at the sink, as he sat at the table consuming the arrears
  of his supper, and as, at length, he went up to bed, carrying the rucksack
  with him.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IV&mdash;THE PLACING OF THE SUN-DIAL</h3>

  <p>When, after breakfast on the following morning, Mr. Pottermack betook
  himself, rucksack in hand, to the walled garden, he experienced, as he closed
  the door behind him and glanced round the enclosure, curiously mixed
  feelings. He was still shaken by the terrific events of the previous night,
  and, in his disturbed state, disposed to be pessimistic and vaguely
  apprehensive. Not that he regretted what he had done. Lewson had elected to
  make his life insupportable, and a man who does that, does it at his own
  risk. So Pottermack argued, and he reviewed the circumstances without the
  slightest twinge of remorse. Repugnant as the deed had been to him, and
  horrible as it had been in the doing&mdash;for he was by temperament a humane
  and kindly man&mdash;he had no sense of guilt. He had merely the feeling that
  he had been forced to do something extremely unpleasant.</p>

  <p>When, however, he came to review the new circumstances, he was conscious
  of a vague uneasiness. Considered in advance, the making away with Lewson had
  been a dreadful necessity, accepted for the sake of the peace and security
  that it would purchase. But had that security been attained? The blackmailer,
  indeed, had gone for ever with his threats and his exactions. But that thing
  in the well&mdash;It was actually possible that Lewson dead might prove more
  formidable even than Lewson living. It was true that everything seemed to be
  quite safe and secret. He, Pottermack, had taken every possible precaution.
  But supposing that he had forgotten something; that he had overlooked some
  small but vital detail. It was quite conceivable. The thing had frequently
  happened. The annals of crime, and especially of murder, were full of fatal
  oversights.</p>

  <p>So Mr. Pottermack cogitated as, having picked up the apron, he made his
  way to the workshop, where he set to work at once on the tasks that remained
  to be done. First he dealt with the shoes. As it would have been difficult
  and was quite unnecessary to remove the gutta-percha soles, he simply shaved
  off the heels, heated the surface and then stuck on the original soles of
  balata.</p>

  <p>Next he broke up the plaster moulds and casts into small fragments, which
  he carried out in the bucket and shot down the well. Those, he reflected with
  a sense of relief as he replaced the hurdle, were the last visible traces of
  the tragedy; but even as he turned away from the well, he saw that they were
  not. For, glancing at the summer-house, he observed the decanter, the siphon,
  and the tumbler still on the table. Of course, to no eye but his was there
  anything suspicious or unusual in their presence there. But the sight of them
  affected him disagreeably. Not only were they a vivid and unpleasant reminder
  of events which he wished to forget. They revived the doubts that had tended
  to fade away under the exhilarating influence of work. For here was something
  that he had overlooked. A thing of no importance, indeed, but still a detail
  that he had forgotten. Trivial as the oversight was, he felt his confidence
  in his foresight shaken.</p>

  <p>He walked to the summer-house, and, setting down the bucket outside,
  entered and proceeded to clear away these traces. Opening the cupboard, he
  caught up the siphon and the decanter and stepped behind the table to put
  them on the shelves. As he did so, he felt something soft under his foot, and
  when he had closed the cupboard door he looked down to see what it was. And
  then his heart seemed to stand still. For the thing under his foot was a
  coat&mdash;and it was not his coat.</p>

  <p>There is a very curious phenomenon which we may describe as deferred
  visual sensation. We see something which is plainly before our eyes, but yet,
  owing to mental preoccupation, we are unaware of it. The image is duly
  registered on the retina; the retina passes on its record to the brain; but
  there the impression remains latent until some association brings it to the
  surface of consciousness.</p>

  <p>Now, this was what had happened to Pottermack. In the moment in which his
  glance fell on the coat there started up before him the vision of a bulky
  figure flourishing its fists and staggering backwards towards the
  well&mdash;the figure of a man in shirt-sleeves. In spite of the darkness, he
  had seen that figure quite distinctly; he even recalled that the
  shirt-sleeves were of a dark grey. But so intense had been his preoccupation
  with the dreadful business of the moment that the detail, physically seen,
  had passed into his memory without conscious recognition.</p>

  <p>He was literally appalled. Here, already, was a second oversight; and this
  time it was one of vital importance. Had any one who knew Lewson been present
  when the coat was discovered, recognition would have been almost certain; for
  the material was of a strikingly conspicuous and distinctive pattern. Then
  the murder would have been out, and all his ingenious precautions against
  discovery would have risen up to testify to his guilt.</p>

  <p>All his confidence, all of the sense of security that he had felt on his
  return home on the previous night, had evaporated in an instant. Two obvious
  things he had forgotten, and one of them might have been fatal. Indeed, there
  were three; for he had been within an ace of overlooking those incriminating
  footprints that might have led the searchers to his very gate. Was it
  possible that there was yet some other important fact that he had failed to
  take into account? He realized that it was very possible indeed; that it
  might easily be that he should add yet another instance to the abundant
  records of murderers who, covering up their tracks with elaborate ingenuity,
  have yet left damning evidence plain for any investigator to see.</p>

  <p>He picked up the coat, and, rolling it up loosely, considered what he
  should do with it. His first impulse was to drop it in the well. But he
  rejected the idea for several reasons. It would certainly float, and might
  possibly be seen by the mason when the sun-dial was fixed, especially if he
  should throw a light down. And then, if the well should, after all, be
  searched, the presence of a separate coat would be against the suggestion of
  accident. And it would be quite easy to burn it in the rubbish destructor.
  Moreover, in rolling the coat he had become aware of a bulky object in one of
  the pockets which recalled certain statements that Lewson had made. In the
  end, he tucked the coat under his arm and, catching up the bucket, took his
  way back to the workshop.</p>

  <p>It was significant of Pottermack's state of mind that as soon as he was
  inside he locked the door; notwithstanding that he was alone in the walled
  garden and that both the gates were securely fastened. Moreover, before he
  began his inspection he unlocked a large drawer and left it open with the key
  in the lock, ready to thrust the coat out of sight in a moment. Then he
  unrolled the coat on the bench, and, putting his hand into the inside breast
  pocket, drew out a leather wallet. It bulged with papers of various kinds,
  mostly bills and letters, but to these Pottermack gave no attention. The one
  item in the contents that interested him was a compact bundle of banknotes.
  There were twenty of them, all five-pound notes, as he ascertained by going
  through the bundle; a hundred pounds in all&mdash;the exact sum that had been
  demanded of him. In fact, these notes were understudies of his expected
  contribution. They had been "borrowed" by Lewson out of the current cash to
  meet some sudden call, and his, Pottermack's, notes were to have been either
  paid in place of them or to have enabled Lewson to make good his loan in the
  morning.</p>

  <p>It seemed a queer proceeding, and to Mr. Pottermack it was not very
  intelligible. But the motive was no concern of his; what was his concern was
  the train of consequences that would be set going. The obvious fact was that
  the little branch bank of which Lewson had had sole charge was now minus a
  hundred pounds in five-pound notes. That fact must inevitably come to light
  within a day or two; most probably this very day. Then the hue and cry would
  be out for the missing manager.</p>

  <p>Well, that was all to the good. There would certainly be a hot search for
  Lewson. But the searchers would not be seeking the body of a murdered man.
  They would be on the look-out for an exceedingly live gentleman with a bundle
  of stolen notes in his pocket. As he considered the almost inevitable course
  of events, Pottermack's spirits rose appreciably. The borrowing of those
  notes had been most fortunate for him, for it turned what would have been an
  unaccountable disappearance into a perfectly accountable flight. It seemed an
  incredibly stupid proceeding, for if Pottermack had paid up, the borrowing
  would have been unnecessary; if he had not paid up, the "loan" could not have
  been made good. However, stupid or not, it had been done; and in the doing it
  Lewson had, for the first and last time, rendered his victim a real
  service.</p>

  <p>When he had inspected the notes, Pottermack replaced them in the wallet,
  returned the latter to the pocket whence it had come, rolled up the coat and
  bestowed it in the drawer, which he closed and locked. The consumption of it
  in the rubbish destructor could be postponed for a time; and perhaps it might
  not come to that at all. For the finding of the notes had, to a great extent,
  restored Pottermack's confidence; and already there had appeared in his mind
  the germ of an idea&mdash;vague and formless at present&mdash;that the notes,
  and perhaps even the coat, might yet have further useful offices to
  perform.</p>

  <p>As he had now completed his tasks and cleared away&mdash;as he
  hoped&mdash;the last traces of the previous night's doings, he thought it
  time that he should show himself to Mrs. Gadby in his normal, everyday
  aspect. Accordingly he took the rucksack, a setting-board, and a few other
  necessary appliances and made his way to the house, where he established
  himself in the dining-room at a table by the window and occupied the time in
  setting the moths which he had captured on the previous night. They were but
  a poor collection, with an unconscionable proportion of duplicates, but
  Pottermack pinned them all out impartially&mdash;even the damaged
  ones&mdash;on the setting-board. It was their number, not their quality, that
  would produce the necessary moral effect on Mrs. Gadby when she came in to
  lay the table for his mid-day dinner. So he worked away placidly with an
  outward air of complete absorption in his task; but all the while there kept
  recurring in his mind, like some infernal refrain, the disturbing question:
  Was there even now something that he had forgotten: something that his eye
  had missed but that other eyes might detect?</p>

  <p>In the afternoon he strolled round to Mr. Gallett's yard to see if all was
  going well in regard to the preparations for setting up the sun-dial. He was
  anxious that there should be no delay, for though the presence of the dial
  would afford him no added security, he had an unreasonable feeling that the
  fixing of it would close the horrible incident. And he did very much want
  that sinister black hole hidden from sight for ever. Great therefore, was his
  relief when he discovered Mr. Gallett and two of his men in the very act of
  loading a low cart with what was obviously the material for the job.</p>

  <p>The jovial mason greeted him with a smile and a nod. "All ready, you see,
  Mr. Pottermack," said he, indicating the dial-pillar, now swathed in a canvas
  wrapping, and slapping one of the stone slabs that stood on edge by its side.
  "Could almost have done it to-day, but it's getting a bit late and we've got
  one or two other jobs to finish up here. But we'll have him round by nine
  o'clock to-morrow morning, if that will do."</p>

  <p>It would do admirably, Mr. Pottermack assured him, adding: "You will have
  to bring it in at the side gate. Do you know whereabouts that is?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say as I do exactly," replied Gallett. "But I'll bring him to the
  front gate and then you can show me where he is to go."</p>

  <p>To this Pottermack agreed, and they then strolled together to the gate,
  where Mr. Gallett halted, and, having looked up and down the street with a
  precautionary air, said in what he meant to be a low tone:</p>

  <p>"Rummy report going round the town. Have you heard anything of it?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Pottermack, all agog in a moment.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Why, they say that the manager of Perkins's Bank has hopped it. That's
  what they say, and I fancy there must be something in it, because I went
  there this morning to pay in a cheque and I found the place closed. Give me a
  rare turn, because I've got an account there. So I rang the bell and the
  caretaker he come and tells me that Mr. Lewson wasn't able to attend to-day
  but that there would be some one there later to carry on till he came back.
  And so there was, for I went round a couple of hours later and found the
  place open and business going on as usual. There was a youngish fellow at the
  counter, but there was an elderly gent&mdash;rather a foxy-looking
  customer&mdash;who seemed to be smelling round, taking down the books and
  looking into the drawers and cupboards. Looks a bit queer, don't you
  think?"</p>

  <p>"It really does," Pottermack admitted. "The fact of the bank not being
  open at the usual time suggests that Mr. Lewisham&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Lewson is his name," Mr. Gallett corrected.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lewson. It suggests that he had absented himself without giving
  notice, which is really rather a remarkable thing for a manager to do."</p>

  <p>"It is," said Gallett; "particularly as he lived on the premises."</p>

  <p>"Did he, indeed?" exclaimed Pottermack. "That makes it still more
  remarkable. Quite mysterious, in fact."</p>

  <p>"Very mysterious," said Gallett. "Looks as if he had mizzled; and if he
  has, why, he probably didn't go away with his pockets empty."</p>

  <p>Pottermack shook his head gravely. "Still," he urged, "it is early to
  raise suspicions. He may possibly have been detained somewhere. He was at the
  bank yesterday?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes; and seen in the town yesterday evening. Old Keeling, the
  postman, saw him about half-past seven and wished him good-night. Says he saw
  him turn into the footpath that leads through Potter's Wood."</p>

  <p>"Ha," said Pottermack. "Well, he may have lost his way in the wood, or
  been taken ill. Who knows? It is best not to jump at conclusions too
  hastily."</p>

  <p>With this and a friendly nod he turned out of the yard and took his way
  homeward, cogitating profoundly. Events were moving even more quickly than he
  had anticipated, but they were moving in the right direction. Nevertheless,
  he recognized with something like a shudder how near he had been to disaster.
  But for the chance moonbeam that had lighted up the footprints in his garden,
  he would have overlooked those other tell-tale tracks outside. And again he
  asked himself uneasily if there could be something else that he had
  overlooked. He was tempted to take a walk into the country in the direction
  of the wood to see if there were yet any signs of a search; for, by Gallett's
  report, it appeared that the direction in which Lewson had gone, and even his
  route, was already known. But prudence bade him keep aloof and show no more
  than a stranger's interest in the affair. Accordingly he went straight home;
  and since in his restless state he could not settle down to read, he betook
  himself to his workshop and spent the rest of the day in sharpening chisels
  and plane-irons and doing other useful, time-consuming jobs.</p>

  <p>True to his word, Mr. Gallett appeared on the following morning almost on
  the stroke of nine. Pottermack himself opened the door to him and at once
  conducted him through the house out into the orchard and thence to the walled
  garden. It was not without a certain vague apprehensiveness that he unlocked
  the gate and admitted his visitor, for since that fatal night no eye but his
  had looked on that enclosure. It is true that on this very morning he had
  made a careful tour of inspection and had satisfied himself that nothing was
  visible that all the world might not see. Nevertheless, he was conscious of a
  distinct sense of discomfort as he let the mason in, and still more when he
  led him to the well.</p>

  <p>"So this is where you wants him planted?" said Mr. Gallett, stepping up to
  the brink of the well and looking down it reflectively. "It do seem a pity
  for to bung up a good well. And you say there's a tidy depth of water in
  him."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Pottermack; "a fair depth. But it's a long way down to
  it."</p>

  <p>"So 'tis, seemingly," Gallett agreed. "The bucket would take a bit of
  histing up." As he spoke, he felt in his pocket and drew out a folded
  newspaper, and from another pocket he produced a box of matches. In leisurely
  fashion he tore off a sheet of the paper, struck a match, and, lighting a
  corner of the paper, let it fall, craning over to watch its descent.
  Pottermack also craned over, with his heart in his mouth, staring
  breathlessly at the flaming mass as it sank slowly, lighting up the slimy
  walls of the well, growing smaller and fainter as it descended, while a
  smaller, fainter spark rose from the depths to meet it. At length they met
  and were in an instant extinguished; and Pottermack breathed again. What a
  mercy he had not thrown the coat down!</p>

  <p>"We'll have to bank up the earth a bit," said Mr. Gallett, "for the slabs
  to bed on. Don't want 'em to rest on the brickwork of the well or they may
  settle out of the level after a time. And if you've got a spade handy, we may
  as well do it now, 'cause we can't get to the side gate for a few minutes.
  There's a gent out there a-takin' photographs of the ground."</p>

  <p>"Of the ground!" gasped Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"Ay. The path, you know. Seems as there's some footmarks
  there&mdash;pretty plain ones they looked to me without a-photographin' of
  em. Well, it's them footmarks as he's a-takin'."</p>

  <p>"But what for?" demanded Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Mr. Gallett. "There you are. I don't know, but I've got my
  ideas. I see the police inspector a-watchin' of him&mdash;all on the broad
  grin he was too&mdash;and I suspect it's got something to do with that bank
  manager that I was tellin' you about."</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mr. Lewis?"</p>

  <p>"Lewson is his name. There's no news of him and he was seen coming this
  way on Wednesday night. Why, he must have passed this very gate."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Pottermack. "And as to his reasons for going away so
  suddenly. Is anything&mdash;er&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no," replied Gallett. "Nothing is known for certain. Of course, the
  bank people don't let on. But there's some talk in the town about some cash
  that is missing. May be all bunkum, though it's what you'd expect. Now, about
  that spade. Shall I call in my men or can we do it ourselves?"</p>

  <p>Pottermack decided that they could do it themselves, and, having produced
  a couple of spades, he fell to work under Gallett's direction, raising a low
  platform for the stone slabs to rest on. A few minutes' work saw it finished
  to the mason's satisfaction, and all was now ready for the fixing of the
  dial.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if that photographer chap has finished," said Mr. Gallett.
  "Shall we go and have a look?"</p>

  <p>This was what Pottermack had been bursting to do, though he had heroically
  suppressed his curiosity; and even now he strolled indifferently to the gate
  and held it open for the mason to go out first.</p>

  <p>"There he is," said Gallett, "and blow me if he isn't a-takin' of 'em all
  the way along. What can he be doing that for? The cove had only got two
  feet."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack looked out and was no less surprised than the worthy mason.
  But he did not share the latter's purely impersonal interest. On the
  contrary, what he saw occasioned certain uncomfortable stirrings in the
  depths of his consciousness. Some little distance up the path a spectacled
  youth of sage and sober aspect had set up a tripod to which a rather large
  camera of the box type was attached by a goose-neck bracket. The lens was
  directed towards the ground, and when the young man had made his exposure by
  means of a wire release, he opened a portfolio and made a mark or entry of
  some kind on what looked like a folded map. Then he turned a key on the
  camera, and, lifting it with its tripod, walked away briskly for some twenty
  or thirty yards, when he halted, fixed the tripod and repeated the operation.
  It really was a most astonishing performance.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Gallett, "he's finished here, at any rate, so we can get
  on with our business now. I'll just run round and fetch the cart along."</p>

  <p>He sauntered away towards the road, and Pottermack, left alone, resumed
  his observation of the photographer. The proceedings of that mysterious
  individual puzzled him not a little. Apparently he was taking a sample
  footprint about every twenty yards, no doubt selecting specially distinct
  impressions. But to what purpose? One or two photographs would have been
  understandable as permanent records of marks that a heavy shower might wash
  away and that would, in any case, soon disappear. But a series, running to a
  hundred or more, could have no ordinary utility. And, yet it was not possible
  that that solemn young man could be taking all this trouble without some
  definite object. Now, what could that object be?</p>

  <p>Pottermack was profoundly puzzled. Moreover, he was more than a little
  disturbed. Hitherto his chief anxiety had been lest the footprints should
  never be observed. Then he would have had all his trouble for nothing, and
  those invaluable tracks, leading suspicion far away from his own
  neighbourhood to an unascertainable destination, would have been lost. Well,
  there was no fear of that now. The footprints had not only been observed and
  identified, they were going to be submitted to minute scrutiny. He had not
  bargained for that. He had laid down his tracks expecting them to be scanned
  by the police or the members of a search party, to whom they would have been
  perfectly convincing. But how would they look in a photograph? Pottermack
  knew that photographs have an uncanny way of bringing out features that are
  invisible to the eye. Now could there be any such features in those
  counterfeit footprints? He could not imagine any. But then why was this young
  man taking all those photographs? With his secret knowledge of the real
  facts, Pottermack could not shake off an unreasoning fear that his ruse had
  been already discovered, or at least suspected.</p>

  <p>His cogitations were interrupted by the arrival of the cart, which was
  halted and backed up against his gateway. Then there came the laying down of
  planks to enable the larger slab to be trundled on rollers to the edge of the
  platform. Pottermack stood by, anxious and restless, inwardly anathematizing
  the conscientious mason as he tried the surface of the platform again and
  again with his level. At last he was satisfied. Then the big base slab was
  brought on edge to the platform, adjusted with minute care and finally let
  down slowly into its place; and as it dropped the last inch with a gentle
  thud, Pottermack drew a deep breath and felt as if a weight, greater far than
  that of the slab, had been lifted from his heart.</p>

  <p>In the remaining operations he had to feign an interest that he ought to
  have felt but did not. For him, the big base slab was what mattered. It shut
  that dreadful, yawning, black hole from his sight, as he hoped, for ever. The
  rest was mere accessory detail. But, as it would not do for him to let this
  appear, he assumed an earnest and critical attitude, particularly when it
  came to the setting up of the pillar on the centre of the upper slab.</p>

  <p>"Now then," said Mr. Gallett as he spread out a thin bed of mortar on the
  marked centre, "how will you have him? Will you have the plinth parallel to
  the base or diagonal?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, parallel, I think," replied Pottermack; "and I should like to have
  the word 'spes' on the eastern side, which will bring the word 'pax' to the
  western."</p>

  <p>Mr. Gallett looked slightly dubious. "If you was thinking of setting him
  to the right time," said he, "you won't do it that way. You'll have to
  unscrew the dial-plate from the lead bed and have him fixed correct to time.
  But never mind about him now. We're a-dealing with the stone pillar."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Pottermack, "but I was considering the inscription. That is
  the way in which it was meant to be placed, I think"; and here he explained
  the significance of the motto.</p>

  <p>"There now," said Mr. Gallett, "see what it is to be a scholar. And you're
  quite right too, sir: you can see by the way the lichen grew on it that this
  here 'sole orto' was the north side. So we'll put him round to the north
  again, and then I expect the dial will be about right, if you aren't
  partickler to a quarter of an hour or so."</p>

  <p>Accordingly the pillar was set up in its place and centred with elaborate
  care. Then, when the level of the slabs had been tested and a few slight
  adjustments made, the pillar was tried on all sides with the plumb-line and
  corrected to a hair's breadth.</p>

  <p>"There you are, Mr. Pottermack," said Mr. Gallett, as he put the last
  touch to the mortar joint and stepped back to view the general effect of his
  work; "see that he isn't disturbed until the mortar has had time to set and
  he won't want touching again for a century or two. And an uncommon nice
  finish he'll give to the garden when you get a bit of smooth turf round him
  and a few flowers."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Pottermack, "you've made an extremely neat job of it, Mr.
  Gallett, and I'm very much obliged to you. When I get the turf laid and the
  flower borders set out, you must drop in and have a look at it."</p>

  <p>The gratified mason, having suitably acknowledged these commendations of
  his work, gathered up his tools and appliances and departed with his
  myrmidons. Pottermack followed them out into the lane and watched the cart as
  it retired, obliterating the footprints which had given him so much
  occupation. When it had gone, he strolled up the path in the direction in
  which the photographer had gone, unconsciously keeping to the edge and noting
  with a sort of odd self-complacency the striking distinctness of the
  impressions of his gutta-percha soles. The mysterious operator was now out of
  sight, but he, too, had left his traces on the path, and these Pottermack
  studied with mingled curiosity and uneasiness. It was easy to see, by the
  marks of the tripod, which footprints had been photographed, and it was
  evident that care had been taken to select the sharpest and most perfect
  impressions. Pottermack had noticed, when he first looked out of the gate
  with Mr. Gallett, that the tripod had been set up exactly opposite the
  gateway and that the three marks surrounded the particularly fine impression
  that he had made when he stepped out sideways on to the smooth-swept
  path.</p>

  <p>On these facts he reflected as he sauntered back to the gate, and
  entering, closed it behind him. What could be that photographer's object in
  his laborious proceeding? Who could it be that had set him to work? And what
  was it possible for a photograph to show that the eye might fail to see?
  These were the questions that he turned over uncomfortably in his mind and to
  which he could find no answer. Then his glance fell on the dial, resting
  immovable on its massive base, covering up the only visible reminder of the
  past, standing there to guard for ever his secret from the eyes of man. And
  at the sight of it he was comforted. With an effort he shook off his
  apprehensions and summoned his courage afresh. After all, what was there to
  fear? What could these photographs show that was not plainly visible?
  Nothing. There was nothing to show. The footprints were, it is true,
  counterfeits in a sense. But they were not imitations in the sense that a
  forged writing is an imitation. They were mechanical reproductions,
  necessarily true in every particular. In fact, they were actually Lewson's
  own footprints, though it happened that other feet than his were in the
  shoes. No. Nothing could be discovered for the simple reason that there was
  nothing to discover.</p>

  <p>So Mr. Pottermack, with restored tranquillity and confidence, betook
  himself to the summer-house, and sitting down, looked out upon the garden and
  let his thoughts dwell upon what it should be when the little island of stone
  should be girt by a plot of emerald turf. As he sat, two sides of the
  sun-dial were visible to him, and on them he read the words "decedente pax."
  He repeated them to himself, drawing from them a new confidence and
  encouragement. Why should it not be so? The storms that had scattered the
  hopes of his youth had surely blown themselves out. His evil genius, who had
  first betrayed him and then threatened to destroy utterly his hardly earned
  prosperity and security; who had cast him into the depths and had fastened
  upon him when he struggled to the surface; the evil genius, the active cause
  of all his misfortunes, was gone for ever and would certainly trouble him no
  more.</p>

  <p>Then why should the autumn of his life not be an Indian summer of peace
  and tranquil happiness? Why not?</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER V&mdash;DR. THORNDYKE LISTENS TO A STRANGE STORY</h3>

  <p>"And that," said Mr. Stalker, picking up a well-worn attache-case and
  opening it on his knees, "finishes our little business and relieves you of my
  society."</p>

  <p>"Say 'deprives'," Thorndyke corrected. "That is, if you must really
  go."</p>

  <p>"That is very delicate of you, doctor," Stalker replied as he stuffed a
  bundle of documents into the attache-case; "and, by the way, it isn't quite
  the finish. There is another small matter which I had nearly forgotten;
  something that my nephew, Harold, asked me to hand to you. You have heard me
  speak of Harold&mdash;my sister's boy?"</p>

  <p>"The inventive genius? Yes, I remember your telling me about him."</p>

  <p>"Well, he asked me to pass this on to you; thought it might interest
  you."</p>

  <p>He took from his case a flat disc which looked like a closely rolled coil
  of paper tape, secured with a rubber band, and passed it to Thorndyke, who
  took it, and, unrolling a few inches, glanced at it with a slightly puzzled
  smile.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I had better explain," replied Stalker. "You see, Harold has invented a
  recording camera which will take small photographs in a series and mark each
  one with its serial number, so that there can be no mistake about the
  sequence. It is a box camera and it takes quite a big roll of kinematograph
  film with a capacity of something like five hundred exposures. And the
  mechanism not only marks each negative with its number but also shows the
  number which is being exposed on a little dial on the outside of the camera.
  Quite a useful instrument, I should think, for certain purposes, though I
  can't, at the moment, think of a case to which it would be applicable."</p>

  <p>"I can imagine certain cases, however," said Thorndyke, "in which it would
  be quite valuable. But with regard to these particular photographs?"</p>

  <p>"They are, as you see, a series of footprints&mdash;the footprints of a
  man who absconded from a country bank and has not been seen since."</p>

  <p>"But why did Harold take so many? There must be about a couple of hundred
  on this strip."</p>

  <p>Stalker chuckled. "I don't think," said he, "that we need go far for the
  reason. Harold had got a camera that would take a numbered series and he had
  never had a chance to try it. Now here was an undoubted series of footprints
  on a footpath and they were those of an absconding man. It was a chance to
  show what the camera would do, and he took it. He professes to believe that
  these photographs might furnish an important clue to an investigator like
  yourself. But, of course, that is all nonsense. He just wanted to try his new
  camera. Still, he did the job quite thoroughly. He took a twenty-five-inch
  ordnance map with him and marked each exposure on it, showing the exact
  position of that particular footprint. He made an exposure about every twenty
  yards. You will see, if you look at the map. I have the three sheets here. He
  told me to give them to you with the photographs, so that you could examine
  them together if you wanted to&mdash;which I imagine you won't. Of course,
  the information they give is quite valueless. One or two photographs would
  have shown all that there was to show."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that," Thorndyke dissented. "The application of the method
  to the present case is, I must admit, not at all evident. One or two
  photographs would have been enough for simple identification. But I can
  imagine a case in which it might be of the highest importance to be able to
  prove that a man did actually follow a particular route, especially if a time
  factor were also available."</p>

  <p>"Which it is, approximately, in the present instance. But it was already
  known that the man went that way at that time, so all this elaborate detail
  is merely flogging a dead horse. The problem is not which way did he go, but
  where is he now? Not that we care a great deal. He only took a hundred pounds
  with him&mdash;so far as we know at present&mdash;so the bank is not
  particularly interested in him. Nor am I, officially, though I must confess
  to some curiosity about him. There are some rather odd features in the case.
  I am quite sorry that we can't afford to call you in to investigate
  them."</p>

  <p>"I expect you are more competent than I am," said Thorndyke. "Banking
  affairs are rather out of my province."</p>

  <p>"It isn't the banking aspect that I am thinking of," replied Stalker. "Our
  own accountants can deal with that. But there are some other queer features,
  and about one of them I am a little uncomfortable. It seems to suggest a
  miscarriage of justice in another case. But I mustn't take up your time with
  irrelevant gossip."</p>

  <p>"But indeed you must," Thorndyke rejoined. "If you have got a queer case,
  I want to hear it. Remember, I live by queer cases."</p>

  <p>"It is rather a long story," objected Stalker, evidently bursting to tell
  it nevertheless.</p>

  <p>"So much the better," said Thorndyke. "We will have a bottle of wine and
  make an entertainment of it."</p>

  <p>He retired from the room and presently reappeared with a bottle of
  Chambertin and a couple of glasses; and having, filled the latter, he
  provided himself with a writing-pad, resumed his armchair and disposed
  himself to listen at his ease.</p>

  <p>"I had better begin," said Stalker, "with an account of this present
  affair. The man who has absconded is a certain James Lewson, who was the
  manager of a little branch of Perkins's Bank down at Borley. He ran it by
  himself, living on the premises and being looked after by the caretaker's
  wife. It is quite a small affair&mdash;just a nucleus with an eye for the
  future, for Meux's do most of the business at Borley, such as it is&mdash;and
  easily run by one man; and everything has gone on quite smoothly there until
  last Wednesday week. On that day Lewson went out at about a quarter-past
  seven in the evening. The caretaker saw him go out at the back gate and
  thought that he looked as if he had been drinking, and on that account he sat
  up until past twelve o'clock to see him in safely. But he never came home,
  and as he had not returned by the morning, the caretaker telegraphed up to
  headquarters.</p>

  <p>"Now I happened to be there when the telegram arrived&mdash;for I am still
  on the board of directors and do a bit of work there&mdash;and I suggested
  that old Jewsbury should go down to see what had been happening and take a
  young man with him to do the routine work while he was going through the
  books. And as Harold was the only one that could be spared, he was told off
  for the job. Of course, he fell in with it joyfully, for he thought he saw a
  possible chance of giving his camera a trial. Accordingly, down he went, with
  the camera in his trunk, all agog to find a series of some kind that wanted
  photographing. As soon as they arrived, Jewsbury saw at a glance that some of
  the cash was missing&mdash;a hundred pounds in five-pound Bank of England
  notes."</p>

  <p>"And the keys?" asked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"The safe key was missing too. But that had been anticipated, so Jewsbury
  had been provided with a master-key. The other keys were in the safe.</p>

  <p>"Well, as soon as the robbery was discovered, Jewsbury had a talk with the
  caretaker and the police inspector, who had called to see him. From the
  caretaker, a steady old retired police sergeant, Jewsbury gathered that
  Lewson had been going to the bad for some time, taking a good deal more
  whisky than was good for him. But we needn't go into that. The police
  inspector reported that Lewson had been seen at about seven-thirty&mdash;that
  is, within a quarter of an hour of his leaving the bank&mdash;turning into a
  footpath that leads out into the country and eventually to the main London
  road. The inspector had examined the path and found on it a track of very
  distinct and characteristic footprints, which he was able to identify as
  Lewson's, not only by the description given by the caretaker, who usually
  cleaned Lewson's shoes, but by one or two fairly clear footprints in the
  garden near the back gate, by which Lewson went out. Thereupon, he returned
  to the footpath and followed the tracks out into the country, through a wood
  and across a heath until he came to a place where Lewson had left the path
  and gone off through the heather; and there, of course all traces of him were
  lost. The inspector went on and searched a by-road and went on to the London
  road, but not a single trace of him could he discover. At that point where he
  stepped off the footpath into the heather James Lewson vanished into thin
  air."</p>

  <p>"Where is the railway station?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"In the town. There is a little branch station by the London road, but it
  is certain that Lewson did not go there, for there were no passengers at all
  on that evening. He must have gone off along the road on foot.</p>

  <p>"Now, as soon as Harold heard of those footprints, he decided that his
  chance had come. The footprints would soon be trodden out or washed away by
  rain, and they ought to be recorded permanently. That was his view."</p>

  <p>"And a perfectly sound one, too," remarked Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Quite. But there was no need for a couple of hundred repetitions."</p>

  <p>"Apparently not," Thorndyke agreed, "though it is impossible to be certain
  even of that. At any rate, a superabundance of evidence is a good deal better
  than a deficiency."</p>

  <p>"Well, that is what Harold thought, or pretended to think, and in effect,
  he nipped off to the Post Office and got the large-scale ordnance maps that
  contained his field of operations. Then on the following morning he set to
  work, leaving Jewsbury to carry on. He began by photographing a pair of the
  footprints in the garden&mdash;they are numbers 1 and 2&mdash;and marking
  them on the map. Then he went off to the footpath and took a photograph about
  every twenty yards, selecting the most distinct footprints and writing down
  the number of the exposure on the map at the exact spot on which it was made.
  And so he followed the track into the country, through the wood, across the
  heath to what we may call the vanishing point. Number 197 is the last
  footprint that Lewson made before he turned off into the heather.</p>

  <p>"So much for Harold and his doings. Now we come to the queer features of
  the case, and the first of them is the amount taken. A hundred pounds! Can
  you imagine a sane man, with a salary of six hundred a year, absconding with
  such a sum? The equivalent of two months' salary. The thing seems incredible.
  And why a hundred pounds only? Why didn't he take, at least, the whole of the
  available cash? It is incomprehensible. And in a few days his monthly salary
  would have been due. Why didn't he wait to collect that?</p>

  <p>"But there is a partial explanation. Only the explanation is more
  incomprehensible than what it explains. By the evening post on the day on
  which Jewsbury arrived a letter was delivered, addressed to Lewson, and,
  under the circumstances, Jewsbury felt justified in opening it. Its contents
  were to this effect:</p>
<br>

  <p class="letter">"<SPAN CLASS="smcap">Dear Lewson</SPAN>,&mdash;I expected you to come round last night, as you
  promised, to settle up. As you didn't come and have not written, I think it
  necessary to tell you plainly that this can't be allowed to go on. If the
  amount (97 13s 4d.) is not paid within the next forty-eight hours, I shall
  have to take measures that will be unpleasant to both of us.&mdash;Yours
  faithfully,</p>

  <p class="letter">"<SPAN CLASS="smcap">Lewis Bateman</SPAN></p>
<br>

  <p>"Now this letter seemed to explain the small amount taken. It suggested
  that Lewson was being pressed for payment and that, as he had not got the
  wherewith to pay, he had taken the amount out of the cash, trusting to be
  able to replace it before the periodical audit. But if so, why had he not
  paid Bateman? And why had he absconded? The letter only deepens the
  mystery."</p>

  <p>"Is it an ascertained fact that he had not the wherewithal to pay?"</p>

  <p>"I think I may say that it is. His own current account at the bank showed
  a balance of about thirty shillings and he had no deposit account. Looking
  over his account, Jewsbury noticed that he seemed to spend the whole of his
  income and was often overdrawn at the end of the month.</p>

  <p>"But this letter brought into view another queer feature of the case. On
  enquiring of the police inspector, Jewsbury found that the man, Bateman, is a
  member of a firm of outside brokers who have offices in Moorgate Street.
  Bateman lives at Borley, and he and Lewson seemed to have been on more or
  less friendly terms. Accordingly, Jewsbury and the inspector called on him,
  and, under some pressure, he disclosed the nature of Lewson's dealing with
  his firm. It appeared that Lewson was a regular 'operator,' and that he was
  singularly unfortunate in his speculations and that he had a fatal habit of
  carrying over when he ought to have cut his loss and got out. As a result, he
  dropped quite large sums of money from time to time, and had lost heavily
  during the last few months. On the transactions of the last twelve months,
  Bateman reckoned&mdash;he hadn't his books with him, of course, at
  Borley&mdash;that Lewson had dropped over six hundred pounds; and in
  addition, he happened to know that Lewson had been plunging and losing on the
  turf.</p>

  <p>"Now, where did Lewson get all this money? His account shows no income
  beyond his salary, and the debit side shows only his ordinary domestic
  expenditure. There are a good many cash drafts, some of which may have
  represented betting losses, but they couldn't represent the big sums that he
  lost through the bucket shop."</p>

  <p>"He didn't pay the brokers by cheque, then?"</p>

  <p>"No. Always in notes&mdash;five-pound notes; not that there is anything
  abnormal in that. As a bank manager, he would naturally wish to keep these
  transactions secret. It is the amount that creates the mystery. He spent the
  whole of his income in a normal though extravagant fashion, and he dropped
  over six hundred pounds in addition. Now, where did he get that six hundred
  pounds?"</p>

  <p>"Is it certain that he had no outside source of income?" Thorndyke
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Obviously he had. But since there is no sign of it on the credit side of
  his account, he must have received it in cash; which is a mighty queer
  circumstance when you consider the amount. Jewsbury is convinced that he must
  have been carrying on some kind of embezzlement, and I don't see what other
  explanation there can be. But if so, it has been done with extraordinary
  skill. Jewsbury has been through the books with the utmost rigour and with
  this suspicion in his mind, but he can't discover the slightest trace of any
  falsification. And mind you, Jewsbury is a first-class accountant and as
  sharp as a needle. So that is how the matter stands, and I must confess that
  I can make nothing of it."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stalker paused, and, with a profoundly reflective air, took a sip from
  his glass, which Thorndyke had just refilled. The latter waited for some time
  with an expectant eye upon his guest and at length remarked: "You were saying
  something about a miscarriage of justice."</p>

  <p>"So I was," said Stalker. "But that is another story&mdash;unless it is a
  part of this story, which I begin to be afraid it is. However, you shall
  judge. I should like to hear what you think. It carries us back some fifteen
  years; that was before I took up the 'Griffin' company, and I was then
  assistant manager of Perkins', at the Cornhill office. About that time it was
  discovered that quite a long series of forgeries had been committed. They
  were very skilfully done and very cleverly managed, evidently by somebody who
  knew what customers' accounts it would be safe to operate on. It was found
  that a number of forged bearer cheques had been presented and paid over the
  counter; and it was further found that nearly all of them had been presented
  and paid at the counter of one man, a young fellow named Jeffrey Brandon. As
  soon as the discovery was made it was decided&mdash;seeing that the forger
  was almost certainly an employee of the bank&mdash;to muster the staff and
  invite them all to turn out their pockets. And this was done on the following
  morning. When they had all arrived, and before the bank opened, they were
  mustered in the hall and the position of affairs explained to them; whereupon
  all of them, without being invited, expressed the wish to be searched.
  Accordingly, a detective officer who was in attendance searched each of them
  in turn, without any result. Then the detective suggested that the office
  coats, which most of them used and which were hanging in the lobby, should be
  fetched by the detective and the porter and searched in the presence of their
  owners. This also was done. Each man identified his own coat, and the
  detective searched it in his presence. All went well until we came to nearly
  the last coat&mdash;that belonging to Jeffrey Brandon and identified by him
  as his. When the detective put his hand into the inside breast pocket, he
  found in it a letter-case; and on opening this and turning out its contents,
  he discovered in an inner compartment three bearer cheques. They were payable
  to three different&mdash;presumably fictitious&mdash;persons and were
  endorsed in the names of the payees in three apparently different
  handwritings.</p>

  <p>"On the production of those cheques, Brandon showed the utmost
  astonishment. He admitted that the letter-case was his, but denied any
  knowledge of the cheques, declaring that they must have been put into the
  case by someone else&mdash;presumably the forger&mdash;while the coat was
  hanging in the lobby. Of course, this could not be accepted. No one but the
  senior staff knew even of the discovery of the forgery&mdash;at least, that
  was our belief at the time. And the search had been sprung on the staff
  without a moment's warning. Furthermore, there was the fact that nearly all
  the forged cheques had been paid at Brandon's counter. What followed was
  inevitable. Brandon was kept under observation at the bank until the
  ostensible drawers of the cheques had been communicated with by telegram or
  telephone; and when they had all denied having drawn any such cheques, he was
  arrested and charged before a magistrate. Of course, he was committed for
  trial; and when he was put in the dock at the Old Bailey the only defence he
  had to offer was a complete denial of any knowledge of the cheques and a
  repetition of his statement that they must have been put into his pocket by
  some other person for the purpose of incriminating him. It was not a very
  convincing defence, and it is not surprising that the jury would not accept
  it."</p>

  <p>"And yet," Thorndyke remarked, "it was the only defence that was possible
  if he was innocent. And there was nothing inherently improbable in it."</p>

  <p>"No. That was what I felt; and when he was found guilty and sentenced to
  five years' penal servitude, I was decidedly unhappy about the affair. For
  Brandon was a nice, bright, prepossessing youngster, and there was nothing
  whatever against him but this charge. And, later, I was made still more
  uncomfortable when I had reason to believe that the discovery of the
  forgeries had in some way become known, on the day before the search, to some
  members of the junior staff. So that what Brandon had said might easily have
  been true.</p>

  <p>"However, that is the old story. And now as to its connection with the
  present one. Brandon had one specially intimate friend at the bank, and that
  friend's name was James Lewson. Now, we have never had anything against
  Lewson in all these years, or he would never have been a branch manager. But,
  from what we know of him now, he is, at least, an unscrupulous rascal and, if
  Jewsbury is right, he is an embezzler and a thief. I can't rid myself of a
  horrible suspicion that James Lewson put those forged cheques into Brandon's
  pocket."</p>

  <p>"If he did," said Thorndyke, "hanging would be a great deal too good for
  him."</p>

  <p>"I quite agree with you," Stalker declared emphatically. "It would have
  been a dastardly crime. But I can't help suspecting him very gravely. I
  recall the look of absolute amazement on poor Brandon's face when those
  cheques were produced. It impressed me deeply at the time, but the
  recollection of it impresses me still more now. If Brandon was innocent, it
  was a truly shocking affair. It won't bear thinking of."</p>

  <p>"No," Thorndyke agreed. "There is no tragedy more dreadful than the
  conviction of an innocent man. By the way, do you know what became of
  Brandon?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed I do," replied Stalker. "The poor fellow is beyond the reach of
  any possible reparation, even if his innocence could be proved. He died in an
  attempt to escape from prison. I remember the circumstances only too clearly.
  Soon after his conviction he was sent to the convict prison at Colport.
  There, while he was working outside with a gang, he slipped past the civil
  guard and made off along the sea wall. He got quite a good start while they
  were searching for him in the wrong direction, but at last they picked up his
  tracks and set off in pursuit. And presently, on the seaward face of the
  wall, they found his clothes and the marks of his feet where he had walked
  out across the mud to the sea. They assumed that he had swum out to some
  passing vessel, and that is probably what he tried to do. But no tidings of
  him could be obtained from any of the anchored vessels or those that had
  passed up or down. Then, about six weeks later, the mystery was solved; for
  his body was found on the mud in a creek some miles farther down."</p>

  <p>"About six weeks later," Thorndyke repeated. "What time of year was
  it?"</p>

  <p>"He was found about the middle of August. Yes, I know what you are
  thinking. But, really, the question of identity hardly arose, although, no
  doubt, the corpse was examined as far as was possible. Still, the obvious
  facts were enough. A naked man was missing and the body of a nude man was
  found just where it was expected to wash ashore. I think we may take it that
  the body was Brandon's body. I only wish I could think otherwise."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Thorndyke. "It is a melancholy end to what sounds like a very
  tragic story. But I am afraid you are right. The body was almost certainly
  his."</p>

  <p>"I think so," agreed Stalker. "And now, I hope I haven't taken up your
  time for nothing. You will admit that this Lewson case has some rather queer
  features."</p>

  <p>"It certainly has," said Thorndyke. "It is most anomalous and puzzling
  from beginning to end."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," said Stalker, "it would be hardly fair to ask for a few
  comments?"</p>

  <p>"Why not?" demanded Thorndyke. "This is an entertainment, not a
  professional conference. If you want my views on the case, you are welcome to
  them and I may say, in the first place, that I do not find myself quite in
  agreement with Jewsbury in regard to the embezzlement&mdash;of which, you
  notice, he can find no evidence. To me there is a strong suggestion of some
  outside source of income. We note that Lewson paid these large sums of money
  in cash&mdash;in five-pound notes. Now that may have been for secrecy. But
  where did he get all those notes? He paid no cheques into his account. He
  couldn't have stolen the notes from the bank's cash. There is a distinct
  suggestion that he received the money in the same form in which he paid it
  away. And his conduct on this occasion supports that view. He just baldly
  took a hundred pounds out of cash&mdash;in five-pound notes&mdash;to meet a
  sudden urgent call. One feels that he must have expected to be able to
  replace it almost at once. The idea that a man of his experience should have
  committed a simple, crude robbery like this is untenable. And then there is
  the amount: taken, almost certainly, for this specific purpose. The
  irresistible suggestion is that he merely borrowed this money in the
  confident expectation of obtaining the wherewith to put it back before it
  should be missed.</p>

  <p>"Then there is the singular suggestion of a change of purpose. Apparently
  he started out to pay Bateman. Then why did he not pay him? He had the money.
  Instead, he suddenly turns off and walks out into the country. Why this
  change of plan? What had happened in the interval to cause him to change his
  plans in this remarkable manner? Had he discovered that he would not be able
  to replace the money? Even that would not explain his proceedings, for the
  natural thing would have been to return to the bank and put the notes
  back.</p>

  <p>"Again, if he intended to abscond, why go away across the country on foot?
  He could easily have taken the train to town and disappeared there. But the
  idea of his absconding with that small amount of money is difficult to
  accept: and yet he undoubtedly did walk out into the country. And he has
  disappeared in a manner which is rather remarkable when one considers how
  easy a solitary pedestrian is to trace in the country. There is even
  something rather odd in his leaving the footpath and plunging into the
  heather, which must have been very inconvenient walking for a fugitive.
  Taking the case as a whole, I feel that I cannot accept the idea that he
  simply absconded with stolen money. Why he suddenly changed his plans and
  made off I am unable to guess, but I am certain that behind his extraordinary
  proceedings there is something more than meets the eye."</p>

  <p>"That is precisely my feeling,'" said Stalker, and the more so now that I
  have heard your summing-up of the case. I don't believe the man set out from
  home with the idea of absconding. I suspect that something happened after he
  left the house; that he got some sudden scare that sent him off into the
  country in that singular fashion. And now I must really take myself off. It
  has been a great pleasure to talk this case over with you. What about those
  things of Harold's? Shall I relieve you of them, now that you have seen
  them?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "Leave them with me for the present. I should
  like to look them over before I hand them back."</p>

  <p>"You don't imagine that Harold is right, do you? That these footprints may
  yield a clue to the man's disappearance?"</p>

  <p>"No. I was not thinking of them in relation to the present case, but in
  regard to their general evidential bearing. As you know, I have given a great
  deal of attention and study to footprints. They sometimes yield a surprising
  amount of information, and as they can be accurately reproduced in the form
  of plaster casts, or even photographs, they can be produced in court and
  shown to the judge and the jury, who are thus able to observe for themselves
  instead of having to rely on the mere statements of witnesses.</p>

  <p>"But footprints, as one meets with them in practice, have this
  peculiarity: that, although they are made in a series, they have to be
  examined separately as individual things. If we try to examine them on the
  ground as a series, we have to walk from one to another and trust largely to
  memory. But in these photographs of Harold's we can take in a whole series at
  a glance and compare any one specimen with any other. So what I propose to do
  is to look over these photographs and see if, apart from the individual
  characters which identify a footprint, there are any periodic or recurring
  characters which would make it worth while to use a camera of this type in
  practice. I want to ascertain, in fact, whether a consecutive series of
  footprints is anything more than a number of repetitions of a given
  footprint."</p>

  <p>"I see. Of course, this is not a continuous series. There are long
  intervals."</p>

  <p>"Yes. That is a disadvantage. Still, it is a series of a kind."</p>

  <p>"True. And the maps?"</p>

  <p>"I may as well keep them too. They show the distances between the
  successive footprints, which may be relevant, since the intervals are not all
  equal."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Stalker, picking up his attache-case. "I admire your
  enthusiasm and the trouble you take, and I will tell Harold how seriously you
  take his productions. He will be deeply gratified."</p>

  <p>"It was very good of him to send them, and you must thank him for me."</p>

  <p>The two men shook hands, and when Thorndyke had escorted his guest to the
  landing and watched him disappear down the stairs, he returned to his
  chambers, closing the "oak" behind him and thereby secluding himself from the
  outer world.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VI&mdash;DR. THORNDYKE BECOMES INQUISITIVE</h3>

  <p>Temperamentally, Dr. John Thorndyke presented a peculiarity which, at the
  first glance, seemed to involve a contradiction. He was an eminently friendly
  man; courteous, kindly and even genial in his intercourse with his
  fellow-creatures. Nor was his suave, amicable manner in any way artificial or
  consciously assumed. To every man his attitude of mind was instinctively
  friendly, and if he did not suffer fools gladly, he could, on occasion,
  endure them with almost inexhaustible patience.</p>

  <p>And yet, with all his pleasant exterior and his really kindly nature, he
  was at heart a confirmed solitary. Of all company, his own thoughts were to
  him the most acceptable. After all, his case was not singular. To every
  intellectual man, solitude is not only a necessity, it is the condition to
  which his mental qualities are subject; and the man who cannot endure his own
  sole society has usually excellent reasons for his objection to it.</p>

  <p>Hence, when Thorndyke closed the massive outer door and connected the
  bell-push with the laboratory floor above, there might have been detected in
  his manner a certain restfulness. He had enjoyed Stalker's visit.
  Particularly had he enjoyed the "queer case," which was to him what a problem
  is to an ardent chess player. But still, that was only speculation, whereas
  with the aid of Harold's photographs he hoped to settle one or two doubtful
  points relating to the characters of footprints which had from time to time
  arisen in his mind, and thereby to extend his actual knowledge.</p>

  <p>With a leisurely and thoughtful air he moved a few things on the table to
  make a clear space, took out from a cupboard a surveyor's boxwood scale, a
  pair of needle-pointed spring dividers, a set of paper-weights, a note-block,
  and a simple microscope (formed of a watchmaker's doublet mounted on three
  legs) which he used for examining documents. Then he laid the three sheets of
  the ordnance map in their proper sequence on the table, with the roll of
  photographs by their side, drew up a chair and sat down to his task.</p>

  <p>He began by running his eye along the path traversed by the fugitive,
  which was plainly marked by a row of dots, each dot having above it a
  microscopic number. Dots and numbers had originally been marked with a
  sharp-pointed pencil, but they had subsequently been inked in with red ink
  and a fine-pointed pen. From the maps he turned his attention to the
  photographs, unrolling a length of about nine inches and fixing the strip
  with a paper-weight at each end. The strip itself was an inch wide, and each
  photograph was an inch and a half long, and every one of the little oblongs
  contained the image of a footprint which occupied almost its entire length
  and which measured&mdash;as Thorndyke ascertained by taking the dimensions
  with his dividers&mdash;one inch and three-eighths. Small as the photographs
  were, they were microscopically sharp in definition, having evidently been
  taken with a lens of very fine quality; and in the corner of each picture was
  a minute number in white, which stood out clearly against the rather dark
  background.</p>

  <p>Sliding the little microscope over one of the prints, Thorndyke examined
  it with slightly amused interest. For a fugitive's footprint it was a frank
  absurdity, so strikingly conspicuous and characteristic was it. If Mr. Lewson
  had had his name printed large upon the soles of his shoes he could hardly
  have given more assistance to his pursuers. The impression was that of a
  rubber sole on which, near the toe, was a framed label containing the makers'
  name, J. Dell and Co. Behind this was a panel, occupied by a prancing horse,
  and the Kentish motto, "Invicta," beneath the panel, implied that this was
  the prancing horse of Kent. The circular rubber heel was less distinctive,
  though even this was a little unusual, for its central device was a
  five-pointed star, whereas most star-pattern heels present six points. But
  not only were all the details of the pattern distinctly visible; even the
  little accidental markings, due to wear and damage, could be plainly made
  out. For instance, a little ridge could be seen across the horse's neck,
  corresponding to a cut or split in the rubber sole, and a tiny speck on the
  heel, which seemed to represent a particle of gravel embedded in the
  rubber.</p>

  <p>When he had made an exhaustive examination of the one photograph, he went
  back to numbers 1 and 2 which represented the footprints near the back gate
  of the bank, and which were not for his purpose part of the series. After a
  brief inspection of them, he placed one of the paper-weights on them, and, by
  means of another, exposed about eighteen inches of the strip. Next, he drew a
  vertical line down the middle of the note-block, dividing it into two parts,
  which he headed respectively "Right" and "Left." Then he began his
  comparative study with a careful examination of number 3, the first print
  photographed on the footpath.</p>

  <p>Having finished with number 3, which was a right foot, he wrote down the
  number at the top of the "Right" column, in the middle of the space. Then he
  passed to number 5&mdash;the next right foot&mdash;and having examined it,
  wrote down its number. Next, he took, with the dividers, the distance between
  the dots marked 3 and 5 on the map, and, transferring the dividers to the
  boxwood scale, took off the distance in yards&mdash;forty-three
  yards&mdash;and wrote this down on the note-block opposite and at the left
  side of the number 5. From 5 he passed on to 7, 9,11, 13, and so on,
  following the right foot along the strip until he had dealt with a couple of
  yards (the total length of the strip was a little over twenty-four feet),
  occasionally turning back to verify his comparisons, writing down the numbers
  in the middle of the column with the distances opposite to them on the left
  and jotting down in the space at the right a few brief notes embodying his
  observations. Then he returned to the beginning of the strip and dealt with
  the prints of the left foot in the same manner and for the same distance
  along the strip.</p>

  <p>One would not have regarded it as a thrilling occupation. Indeed there was
  rather a suggestion of monotony in the endless recurrence of examination,
  comparison, and measurements of things which appeared to be merely mechanical
  repetitions of one another. Nor did the brief and scanty jottings in the
  "notes" column suggest that this tedious procedure was yielding any great
  wealth of information. Nevertheless, Thorndyke continued to work at his task
  methodically, attentively, and without any symptoms of boredom, until he had
  dealt with nearly half of the strip. But at this point his manner underwent a
  sudden and remarkable change. Hitherto he had carried on his work with the
  placid air of one who is engaged on a mildly interesting piece of routine
  work. Now he sat up stiffly, gazing at the strip of photographs before him
  with a frown of perplexity, even of incredulity. With intense attention, he
  re-examined the last half-dozen prints that he had dealt with; then, taking a
  right foot as a starting-point, he followed the strip rapidly, taking no
  measurements and making no notes, until he reached the end, where he found a
  slip of paper pasted to the strip and bearing the note: "Footprints cease
  here. Track turned off to left into heather. Length of foot, 12 inches.
  Length of stride from heel to heel, 34 inches."</p>

  <p>Having rapidly copied this note on to his block, Thorndyke resumed his
  examination with eager interest. Returning to the starting-point, he again
  examined a print of the left foot and then followed its successive prints to
  the final one at the end of the strip. Again he came back to the
  starting-point; but now, taking this as a centre, he began to move backwards
  and forwards, at first taking a dozen prints in each direction, then, by
  degrees, reducing the distance of his excursions until he came down to a
  single print of the right foot&mdash;a specially clear impression, marked
  with the number 93. This he again examined through the little microscope with
  the most intense scrutiny. Then, with a like concentrated attention, he
  examined first the preceding right-foot print, 91, and then the succeeding
  one, 95. Finally, he turned to the map to locate number 93, which he found
  near the middle of a wall&mdash;apparently the enclosing wall of a large
  garden or plantation&mdash;and exactly opposite a gate in that wall.</p>

  <p>From this moment Thorndyke's interest in his original investigations
  seemed to become extinct. The little microscope, the scale, even the
  photographs themselves, were neglected and unnoticed, while he sat with his
  eyes fixed on the map&mdash;yet seeming to look through it rather than at
  it&mdash;evidently immersed in profound thought. For a long time he sat thus,
  immovable as a seated statue. At length he rose from his chair, and,
  mechanically filling his pipe, began slowly to pace up and down the room, and
  to any observer who knew him, had there been one, the intense gravity of his
  expression, the slight frown, the compressed lips, the downcast eyes, as well
  as the unlighted pipe that he grasped in his hand, would have testified that
  some problem of more than common intricacy was being turned over in his mind
  and its factors sorted out and collated.</p>

  <p>He had been pacing the room for nearly half an hour when a key was softly
  inserted into the latch of the outer door. The door opened and closed
  quietly, and then a gentle tap on the knocker of the inner door heralded the
  entry of a small gentleman of somewhat clerical aspect and uncommon
  crinkliness of countenance, who greeted Thorndyke with a deprecating
  smile.</p>

  <p>"I hope, sir," said he, "that I am not disturbing you, but I thought that
  I had better remind you that you have not had any supper."</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" exclaimed Thorndyke. "What a memory you have, Polton. And to
  think that I, who am really the interested party, should have overlooked the
  fact. Well, what do you propose?"</p>

  <p>Polton glanced at the table with a sympathetic eye. "You won't want your
  things disturbed, I expect, if you have got a job on hand. I had better put
  your supper in the little laboratory. It won't take more than five
  minutes."</p>

  <p>"That will do admirably," said Thorndyke. "And, by the way, I think that
  adjourned inquest at Aylesbury is the day after to-morrow, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, Thursday. I fixed the letter on the appointment board."</p>

  <p>"Well, as there is nothing pressing on Friday, I think I will stay the
  night there and come back on Friday evening if nothing urgent turns up in the
  interval."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Will you want anything special in the research case?"</p>

  <p>"I shall not take the research case," replied Thorndyke; "in fact, I don't
  know that I want anything excepting the one-inch ordnance map, unless I take
  that stick of yours."</p>

  <p>Polton's face brightened. "I wish you would, sir," he said persuasively.
  "You have never tried it since I made it, and I am sure you will find it a
  most useful instrument."</p>

  <p>"I am sure I shall," said Thorndyke; "and perhaps I might as well take the
  little telephoto camera, if you will have it charged."</p>

  <p>"I will charge it to-night, sir, and overhaul the stick. And your supper
  will be ready in five minutes."</p>

  <p>With this Polton disappeared as silently as he had come, leaving his
  principal to his meditations.</p>

  <p>On the following Friday morning, at about half-past ten. Dr. John
  Thorndyke might have been seen&mdash;if there had been any one to see him,
  which there was not&mdash;seated in a first-class smoking-compartment in the
  Aylesbury to London train. But he was evidently not going to London, for, as
  the train slowed down on approaching Borley station, he pocketed the folded
  ordnance map which he had been studying, stood up and took his stick down
  from the rack.</p>

  <p>Now this stick was the only blot on Thorndyke's appearance. Apart from it
  his "turn-out" was entirely satisfactory and appropriate to his country
  surroundings without being either rustic or sporting. But that stick, with a
  tweed suit and a soft hat, struck a note of deepest discord. With a
  frock-coat and a top-hat it might have passed, though even then it would have
  called for a Falstaffian bearer. But as a country stick it really wouldn't do
  at all.</p>

  <p>In the first place it was offensively straight&mdash;as straight as a
  length of metal tube. It was of an uncomely thickness, a full inch in
  diameter. As to the material, it might, by an exceedingly bad judge, have
  been mistaken for ebony. In fact, it was, as to its surface, strongly
  reminiscent of optician's black enamel. And the handle was no better. Of the
  same funereal hue and an unreasonable thickness, it had the stark mechanical
  regularity of an elbow-joint on a gas pipe, and, to make it worse, its end
  was finished by a sort of terminal cap. Moreover, on looking down the shaft
  of the stick, a close observer would have detected, about fifteen inches from
  the handle, a fine transverse crack, suggestive of a concealed joint. A
  sharp-eyed rural constable would have "spotted" it at a glance as a
  walking-stick gun; and he would have been wrong.</p>

  <p>However, despite its aesthetic shortcomings, Thorndyke seemed to set some
  store by it, for he lifted it from the rack with evident care, and with the
  manner of lifting something heavier than an ordinary walking-stick; and when
  he stepped forth from the station, instead of holding it by its unlovely
  handle with its ferrule on the ground, he carried it "at the trail," grasping
  it by its middle.</p>

  <p>On leaving the station precincts, Thorndyke set forth with the confident
  air of one who is on familiar ground, though, as a matter of fact, he had
  never been in the district before; but he had that power, which comes by
  practice, of memorizing a map that makes unvisited regions familiar and is
  apt to cause astonishment to the aboriginal inhabitants. Swinging along at an
  easy but rapid pace, he presently entered a quiet, semi-suburban road which
  he followed for a quarter of a mile, looking about him keenly, and
  identifying the features of the map as he went. At length he came to a
  kissing-gate which gave access to a footpath, and, turning into this, he
  strode away along the path, looking closely at its surface and once stopping
  and retracing his steps for a few yards to examine his own footprints.</p>

  <p>A few hundred yards farther on he crossed another road, more definitely
  rural in character, and noted at the corner a pleasant-looking house of some
  age, standing back behind a well-kept garden, its front entrance sheltered by
  a wooden porch which was now almost hidden by a mass of climbing roses. The
  side wall of the garden abutted on the footpath and extended along it for a
  distance that suggested somewhat extensive grounds. At this point he reduced
  his pace to a slow walk, scrutinizing the ground&mdash;on which he could
  detect, even now, occasional fragmentary traces of the familiar footprints of
  Harold's photographs&mdash;and noting how, since crossing the road, he had
  passed completely out of the last vestiges of the town into the open
  country.</p>

  <p>He had traversed rather more than half the length of the wall when he came
  to a green-painted wooden gate, before which he halted for a few moments.
  There were, however, no features of interest to note beyond the facts that
  its loop handle was unprovided with a latch and that it was secured with a
  Yale lock. But as he stood looking at it with a deeply reflective air, he was
  aware of a sound proceeding from within&mdash;a pleasant sound, though
  curiously out of key with his own thoughts&mdash;the sound of some one
  whistling, very skilfully and melodiously, the old-fashioned air, "Alice,
  where art thou?" He smiled grimly, keenly appreciative of the whimsical
  incongruity of these cheerful, innocent strains with the circumstances that
  had brought him thither; then he turned away and walked slowly to the end of
  the wall where it was joined by another, which enclosed the end of the
  grounds. Here he halted and looked along the path towards a wood which was
  visible in the distance; then, turning, he looked back along the way by which
  he had come. In neither direction was there any one in sight, and Thorndyke
  noted that he had not met a single person since he had passed through the
  kissing-gate. Apparently this path was quite extraordinarily
  unfrequented.</p>

  <p>Having made this observation, Thorndyke stepped off the path and walked a
  few paces along the end wall&mdash;which abutted on a field&mdash;to a spot
  where an apple tree in the grounds rose above the summit. Here he stopped,
  and, having glanced up at the wall&mdash;which was nearly seven feet
  high&mdash;grasped the uncomely stick with both hands, one on either side of
  the concealed joint, and gave a sharp twist. Immediately the stick became
  divided into two parts, the lower of which&mdash;that bearing the
  ferrule&mdash;Thorndyke stood against the wall. It could now be seen that the
  upper part terminated in a blackened brass half-cylinder, the flat face of
  which was occupied by a little circular glass window, and when Thorndyke had
  unscrewed the cap from the end of the handle, the latter was seen to be a
  metal tube, within which was another little glass window&mdash;the eye-piece.
  In effect, Polton's hideous walking-stick was a disguised periscope.</p>

  <p>Taking up a position close to the wall, Thorndyke slowly raised the
  periscope until its end stood an inch or so above the top of the wall, with
  the little window looking into the enclosure. The eye-piece being now at a
  convenient level, he applied his eye to it, and immediately had the sensation
  of looking through a circular hole in the wall. Through this aperture (which
  was, of course, the aperture of the object-glass above him, reflected by a
  pair of prisms) he looked into a large garden, enclosed on all sides by the
  high wall and having apparently only two doors or gates, the one at the side,
  which he had already seen, and another which appeared to open into another
  garden nearer the house, and which, like the side gate, seemed to be fitted
  with a night-latch of the Yale type. On one side, partly concealed by a
  half-grown yew hedge, was a long, low building which, by the windows in its
  roof, appeared to be some kind of workshop; and by rotating the periscope it
  was possible to catch a glimpse of part of what seemed to be a summer-house
  in the corner opposite the workshop. Otherwise, excepting a narrow flower
  border and a few fruit trees ranged along the wall, the whole of the
  enclosure was occupied by a large lawn, the wide expanse of which was broken
  only by a sun-dial beside which, at the moment, a man was standing and on man
  and sun-dial, Thorndyke, after his swift preliminary survey, concentrated his
  attention.</p>

  <p>The stone pillar of the dial was obviously ancient. Equally obviously the
  stone base on which it stood was brand new. Moreover, the part of the lawn
  immediately surrounding the base was yellow and faded as if it had been
  recently raised and relaid. The manifest inference was that the dial had but
  lately been placed in its present position; and this inference was supported
  by the occupation in which the man was engaged. On the stone base stood a
  Windsor chair, the seat of which bore one or two tools and a pair of
  spectacles. Thorndyke noted the spectacles with interest, observing that they
  had "curl sides" and were therefore habitually worn; and since they had been
  discarded while their owner consulted a book that he held, it seemed to
  follow that he must be near-sighted.</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke watched, the man closed the book and laid it on the chair,
  when by its shape and size, its scarlet back and apple-green sides, it was
  easily recognizable as Whitaker's Almanack. Having laid down the book, the
  man drew out his watch, and, holding it in his hand, approached the pillar
  and grasped the gnomon of the dial; and now Thorndyke could see that the
  dial-plate had been unfixed from its bed, for it moved visibly as the gnomon
  was grasped. The nature of the operation was now quite dear. The man was
  re-setting the dial. He had taken out the Equation of Time from Whitaker and
  was now adjusting the dial-plate by means of his watch to show the correct
  Apparent Solar Time.</p>

  <p>At this point&mdash;leaving the man standing beside the pillar, watch in
  hand&mdash;Thorndyke picked up the detached portion of the stick, and
  stepping along the wall, glanced up and down the path. So far as he could
  see&mdash;nearly a quarter of a mile in each direction&mdash;he had the path
  to himself; and, noting with some surprise and no little interest the
  remarkable paucity of wayfarers, he returned to his post and resumed his
  observations.</p>

  <p>The man had now put away his watch and taken up a hammer and bradawl.
  Thorndyke noted the workmanlike character of the former&mdash;a rather heavy
  ball-peen hammer such as engineers use&mdash;and when the bradawl was
  inserted into one of the screw-holes of the dial-plate and driven home into
  the lead bed with a single tap, he observed the deftness with which the
  gentle, calculated blow was delivered with the rather ponderous tool. So,
  too, with the driving of the screw; it was done with the unmistakable ease
  and readiness of the skilled workman.</p>

  <p>Having rapidly made these observations, Thorndyke drew from his hip pocket
  the little camera and opened it, setting the focus by the scale to the
  assumed distance&mdash;about sixty feet&mdash;fixing the wire release and
  setting the shutter to half a second&mdash;the shortest exposure that was
  advisable with a telephoto lens. Another peep through the periscope showed
  the man in the act of again inserting the bradawl, and, incidentally,
  presenting a well-lighted right profile; whereupon Thorndyke raised the
  camera and placed it on the top of the wall with the wire release hanging
  down and the lens pointed, as well as he could judge, at the sun-dial. Then,
  as the man poised the hammer preparatory to striking, he pressed the button
  of the release and immediately took down the camera and changed the film.</p>

  <p>Once more he went to the corner of the wall and looked up and down the
  path. This time a man was visible&mdash;apparently a labourer&mdash;coming
  from the direction of the town. But he was a long distance away and was
  advancing at a pace so leisurely that Thorndyke decided to complete his
  business, if possible, before he should arrive. A glance through the
  periscope showed the man in the garden driving another screw. When he had
  driven it home, he stepped round the pillar to deal with the screws on the
  other side. As he inserted the bradawl and balanced the hammer, presenting
  now his left profile, Thorndyke lifted the camera to the top of the wall,
  made the exposure, took down the camera, and having changed the film, closed
  it and put it in his pocket. Then he joined up the two parts of the stick,
  fixed the cap on the eye-piece and came out on to the path, turning towards
  the town to meet the labourer. But the latter had now disappeared, having
  apparently turned into the road on which the house fronted. Having the path
  once more to himself, Thorndyke walked along it to the gate, where he paused
  and rapped on it smartly with his knuckles.</p>

  <p>After a short interval, during which he repeated the summons, the gate was
  opened a few inches and the man whom he had seen within looked out with an
  air of slightly irritable enquiry.</p>

  <p>"I must apologize for disturbing you," Thorndyke said with disarming
  suavity, "but I heard some one within, and there was no one about from whom I
  could make my enquiry."</p>

  <p>"You are not disturbing me in the least," the other replied, not less
  suavely. "I shall be most happy to give you any information that I can. What
  was the enquiry that you wished to make?"</p>

  <p>As he asked the question, the stranger stepped out on the path, drawing
  the gate to after him, and looked inquisitively at Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to know," the latter replied, "whether this footpath leads to a
  wood&mdash;Potter's Wood, I think it is called. You see, I am a stranger to
  this neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>On this the man seemed to look at him with heightened interest as he
  replied:</p>

  <p>"Yes, it leads through the wood about half a mile farther on."</p>

  <p>"And where does it lead to eventually?"</p>

  <p>"It crosses a patch of heath and joins a by-road that runs from the town
  to the main London road. Was that where you wanted to go?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "It is the path itself that I am concerned with.
  The fact is, I am making a sort of informal inspection in connection with the
  case of a man who disappeared a short time ago&mdash;the manager of a local
  branch of Perkins's Bank. I understand that he was last seen walking along
  this path."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said the other, "I remember the affair. And is he still
  missing?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. He has never been seen or heard of since he started along this path.
  What is the wood like? Is it a place in which a man might lose himself?"</p>

  <p>The other shook his head. "No, it is only a small wood. A sound and sober
  man could not get lost in it. Of course, if a man were taken ill and strayed
  into the wood, he might die and lie hidden for months. Has the wood been
  searched?"</p>

  <p>"I really can't say. It ought to have been."</p>

  <p>"I thought," said the stranger, "that you might, perhaps, be connected
  with the police."</p>

  <p>"No," replied Thorndyke. "I am a lawyer and I look after some of the
  affairs of the bank. One of the directors mentioned this disappearance to me
  a few days ago, and as I happened to be in the neighbourhood to-day, I
  thought I would come and take a look round. Perhaps you could show me where
  we are on my map. It is a little confusing to a stranger."</p>

  <p>He drew out the folded map and handed it to his new acquaintance, who took
  it and pored over it as if he found it difficult to decipher. As he did so,
  Thorndyke took the opportunity to look him over with the most searching
  scrutiny; his face, his hair, his spectacles, his hands and his feet; and
  when he had inspected the left side of the face which was the one presented
  to him&mdash;he crossed as if to took over the man's right shoulder and
  examined the face from that side.</p>

  <p>"This dotted line seems to be the footpath," said the stranger, tracing it
  with the point of a pencil. "This black dot must be my house, and here is the
  wood with the dotted line running through it. I think that is quite
  clear."</p>

  <p>"Perfectly clear, thank you," said Thorndyke, as the other handed him back
  the map. "I am very greatly obliged to you and I must again apologize for
  having disturbed you."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," the stranger returned genially; "and I hope your inspection
  may be successful."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke thanked him again, and with mutual bows they separated, the one
  retiring into his domain, the other setting forth in the direction of the
  wood.</p>

  <p>For some minutes Thorndyke continued to walk at a rapid pace along the
  path. Only when a sharp turn carried him out of sight of the walled garden
  did he halt to jot down in his note-book a brief summary of his observations
  while they were fresh in his mind. Not that the notes were really necessary,
  for, even as he had made those observations, the significance of the facts
  that they supplied became apparent. Now, as he walked, he turned them over
  again and again.</p>

  <p>What had he observed? Nothing very sensational, to be sure. He had seen a
  man who had recently set up in his garden a pillar dial on a broad stone
  base. The dial was old, but the base was new and seemed to have been
  specially constructed for its present purpose. The garden in which it had
  been set up was completely enclosed, was extremely secluded, was remote from
  its own or any other house, and was very thoroughly secured against any
  possible intrusion by two locked gates. The man himself was a skilled
  workman, or at least a very handy man; ingenious and resourceful, too, for he
  could time a sun-dial, a thing that not every handy man could do. Then he
  appeared to have some kind of workshop of a size suggesting good
  accommodation and facilities for work, and this workshop was in a secluded
  situation, very secure from observation. But in these facts there would seem
  to be nothing remarkable; only they were in singular harmony with certain
  other facts&mdash;very remarkable facts indeed&mdash;that Thorndyke had
  gleaned from an examination of Harold's absurd photographs.</p>

  <p>And there was the man himself, and especially his spectacles. When
  Thorndyke had seen those spectacles lying on the chair while their owner
  drove in the screws, looked at his watch, and scrutinized the shadow on the
  dial, he had naturally assumed that the man was near-sighted; that he had
  taken off his "distance" glasses to get the advantage of his near sight for
  the near work. But when the man appeared at the gate, it was immediately
  evident that he was not near-sighted. The spectacles were convex bi-focal
  glasses, with an upper half of nearly plain glass and a lower segment
  distinctly convex, suited for long sight or "old sight." A near-sighted man
  could not have seen through them. But neither did their owner seem to need
  them, since he had taken them off just when they should have been most
  useful&mdash;for near work. Moreover, when Thorndyke had presented the map,
  the man had looked at it, not through the lower "reading" segment, but
  through the weak, upper, "distance" segment. In short, the man did not need
  those spectacles at all. So far from being a convenience, they were a
  positive inconvenience. Then, why did he wear them? Why had he put them on to
  come to the gate? There could be only one answer. People who wear useless and
  inconvenient spectacles do so in order to alter their appearance; as a
  species of disguise, in fact. Then it seemed as if this man had some reason
  for wishing to conceal his identity. But what could that reason be?</p>

  <p>As to his appearance, he was a decidedly good-looking man, with an alert,
  intelligent face that was in harmony with his speech and bearing. His mouth
  and chin were concealed by a moustache and a short beard, but his nose was
  rather handsome and very striking, for it was of that rare type which is seen
  in the classical Greek sculptures. His ears were both well-shaped, but one of
  them&mdash;the right&mdash;was somewhat disfigured by a small "port-wine
  mark," which stained the lobule a deep purple. But it was quite small and
  really inconspicuous.</p>

  <p>This was the sum of Thorndyke's observations, to which may be added that
  the man appeared to be prematurely grey and that his face, despite its
  cheerful geniality, had that indefinable character that may be detected in
  the faces of men who have passed through long periods of stress and mental
  suffering. Only one datum remained unascertained, and Thorndyke added it to
  his collection when, having traversed the wood and the heath, he returned to
  the town by way of the by-road. Encountering a postman on his round, he
  stopped him and enquired:</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you can tell me who is living at 'The Chestnuts' now? You
  know the house I mean. It stands at the corner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know 'The Chestnuts,' sir. Colonel Barnett used to live there. But
  he went away nigh upon two years ago, and, after it had been empty for a
  month or two, it was bought by the gentleman who lives there now, Mr.
  Pottermack."</p>

  <p>"That is a queer name," said Thorndyke. "How does he spell it?"</p>

  <p>"P.o.t.t.e.r.m.a.c.k," the postman replied. "Marcus Pottermack, Esq. It is
  a queer name, sir. I've never met with it before. But he is a very pleasant
  gentleman, all the same."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke thanked the postman for his information, on which he pondered as
  he made his way to the station. It was a very queer name. In fact, there was
  about it something rather artificial; something that was not entirely out of
  character with the unwanted spectacles.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE CRIMINAL RECORDS</h3>

  <p>On each of the two men who parted at the gate the brief interview produced
  its appropriate effects; in each it generated a certain train of thought
  which, later, manifested itself in certain actions. In Mr. Pottermack, as he
  softly reopened the gate to listen to the retreating footsteps, once even
  venturing to peep out at the tall figure that was striding away up the path,
  the encounter was productive of a dim uneasiness, a slight disturbance of the
  sense of security that had been growing on him since the night of the
  tragedy. For the first few days thereafter he had been on wires. All seemed
  to be going well, but he was constantly haunted by that ever-recurring
  question, "Was there anything vital that he had overlooked?"</p>

  <p>The mysterious photographer, too, had been a disturbing element,
  occasioning anxious speculations on the motive or purpose of his inexplicable
  proceedings and on the possibility of something being brought to light by the
  photographs that was beyond the scope of human vision. But as the days had
  passed with no whisper of suspicion, as the local excitement died down and
  the incident faded into oblivion, his fears subsided, and by degrees he
  settled down into a feeling of comfortable security.</p>

  <p>And after all, why not? In the first few days his own secret knowledge had
  prevented him from seeing the affair in its true perspective. But now,
  looking at it calmly with the eyes of those who had not that knowledge, what
  did Lewson's disappearance amount to? It was a matter of no importance at
  all. A disreputable rascal had absconded with a hundred pounds that did not
  belong to him. He had disappeared and no one knew whither he had gone. Nor
  did any one particularly care. Doubtless the police would keep a look-out for
  him; but he was only a minor delinquent, and they would assuredly make no
  extraordinary efforts to trace him.</p>

  <p>So Mr. Pottermack argued, and quite justly; and thus arguing came by
  degrees to the comfortable conclusion that the incident was closed and that
  he might now take up again the thread of his peaceful life, secure alike from
  the menace of the law and the abiding fear of impoverishment and
  treachery.</p>

  <p>It was this new and pleasant feeling of security that had been disturbed
  by his encounter with the strange lawyer. Not that he was seriously alarmed.
  The man seemed harmless enough. He was not, apparently, making any real
  investigations but just a casual inspection of the neighbourhood, prompted,
  as it appeared, by a not very lively curiosity. And as a tracker he seemed to
  be of no account, since he could not even find his position on a one-inch
  map.</p>

  <p>But for all that, the incident was slightly disquieting. Pottermack had
  assumed that the Lewson affair was closed. But now it seemed that it was not
  closed. And it was a curious coincidence that this man should have knocked at
  his gate, should have selected him for these enquiries. No doubt it was but
  chance; but still, there was the coincidence. Again, there was the man
  himself. He had seemed foolish about the map. But he did not look at all like
  a foolish man. On the contrary, his whole aspect and bearing had a suggestion
  of power, of acute intellect and quiet strength of character. As Pottermack
  recalled his appearance and manner he found himself asking again and again:
  Was there anything behind this seemingly chance encounter? Had this lawyer
  seen those photographs, and if so, had he found in them anything more than
  met the eye? Could he have had any special reason for knocking at this
  particular gate? And what on earth could he be doing with that walking-stick
  gun?</p>

  <p>Reflections such as these pervaded Mr. Pottermack's consciousness as he
  went about his various occupations. They did not seriously disturb his peace
  of mind, but still they did create a certain degree of unrest, and this
  presently revived in his mind certain plans which he had considered and
  rejected; plans for further establishing his security by shifting the field
  of possible inquiry yet farther from his own neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>On Thorndyke the effects of the meeting were quite different. He had come
  doubting if a certain surmise that he had formed could possibly be correct.
  He had gone away with his doubts dispelled and his surmise converted into
  definite belief. The only unsolved question that remained in his mind was,
  "Who was Marcus Pottermack?" The answer that suggested itself was improbable
  in the extreme. But it was the only one that he could produce, and if it were
  wrong he was at the end of his unassisted resources.</p>

  <p>The first necessity, therefore, was to eliminate the improbable&mdash;or
  else to confirm it. Then he would know where he stood and could consider what
  action he would take. Accordingly he began by working up the scanty material
  that he had collected. The photographs, when developed and enlarged by
  Polton, yielded two very fair portraits of Mr. Pottermack showing clearly the
  right and left profiles respectively; and while Polton was dealing with
  these, his principal made a systematic, but not very hopeful, inspection of
  the map in search of possible finger-prints. He had made a mental note of the
  way in which Pottermack had held the map, and even of the spots which his
  finger-tips had touched, and on these he now began cautiously to operate with
  two fine powders, a black and a white, applying each to its appropriate
  background.</p>

  <p>The results were poor enough, but yet they were better than he had
  expected. Pottermack had held the map in his left hand, the better to
  manipulate the pencil with which he pointed, and his thumb had been planted
  on a green patch which represented a wood. Here the white powder settled and
  showed a print which, poor as it was, would present no difficulties to the
  experts and which would be more distinct in a photograph, as the background
  would then appear darker. The prints of the finger-tips which the black
  powder brought out on the white background were more imperfect and were
  further confused by the black lettering. Still, Thorndyke had them all
  carefully photographed and enlarged to twice the natural size, and, having
  blocked out on the negative the surrounding lettering (to avoid giving any
  information that might be better withheld), had prints made and mounted on
  card.</p>

  <p>With these in his letter-case and the two portraits in his pocket, he set
  forth one morning for New Scotland Yard, proposing to seek the assistance of
  his old friend, Mr. Superintendent Miller, or, if he should not be available,
  that of the officer in charge of criminal records. However, it happened
  fortunately that the Superintendent was in his office, and thither Thorndyke,
  having sent in his card, was presently conducted.</p>

  <p>"Well, doctor," said Miller, shaking hands heartily, "here you are,
  gravelled as usual. Now what sort of mess do you want us to help you out
  of?"</p>

  <p>Thorndyke produced his letter-case, and, extracting the photographs,
  handed them to the Superintendent.</p>

  <p>"Here," he said, "are three finger-prints; apparently the thumb and first
  two fingers of the left hand."</p>

  <p>"Ha," said Miller, inspecting the three photographs critically. "Why
  'apparently'?"</p>

  <p>"I mean," explained Thorndyke, "that that was what I inferred from their
  position on the original document."</p>

  <p>"Which seems to have been a map," remarked Miller, with a faint grin.
  "Well, I expect you know. Shall I take it that they are the thumb and index
  and middle finger of the left hand?"</p>

  <p>"I think you may," said Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"I think I may," agreed Miller; "and now the question is: What about it? I
  suppose you want us to tell you whose finger-prints they are; and you want to
  gammon us that you don't know already. And I suppose&mdash;as I see you have
  been faking the negative&mdash;that you don't want to give us any
  information?"</p>

  <p>"In effect," replied Thorndyke, "you have, with your usual acuteness,
  diagnosed the position exactly. I don't much want to give any details, but I
  will tell you this much. If my suspicions are correct, these are the
  finger-prints of a man who has been dead some years."</p>

  <p>"Dead!" exclaimed Miller. "Good Lord, doctor, what a vindictive man you
  are! But you don't suppose that we follow the criminal class into the next
  world, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I have been assuming that you don't destroy records. If you do, you are
  unlike any government officials that I have ever met. But I hope I was
  right."</p>

  <p>"In the main, you were. We don't keep the whole set of documents of a dead
  man, but we have a set of skeleton files on which the personal
  documents&mdash;the finger-prints, photographs and description&mdash;are
  preserved. So I expect we shall be able to tell you what you want to
  know."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," said Thorndyke, "that they are such wretchedly poor prints.
  You don't think that they are too imperfect to identify, I hope."</p>

  <p>Miller inspected the photographs afresh. "I don't see much amiss with
  them," said he. "You can't expect a crook to go about with a roller and
  inking-plate in his pocket so as to give you nice sharp prints. These are
  better than a good many that our people have to work from. And besides, there
  are three digits from one hand. That gives you part of the formula straight
  away. No, the experts won't make any trouble about these. But supposing these
  prints are not on the file?"</p>

  <p>"Then we shall take it that I suspected the wrong man."</p>

  <p>"Quite so. But, if I am not mistaken, your concern is to prove whose
  finger-prints they are in order that you can say whose finger-prints they are
  not. Now, supposing that we don't find them on the files of the dead men,
  would it help you if we tried the current files&mdash;the records of the
  crooks who are still in business? Or would you rather not?"</p>

  <p>"If it would not be giving you too much trouble," said Thorndyke, "I
  should be very much obliged if you would."</p>

  <p>"No trouble at all," said Miller, adding with a sly smile: "only it
  occurred to me that it might be embarrassing to you if we found your
  respected client's finger-prints on the live register."</p>

  <p>"That would be a highly interesting development" said Thorndyke, "though I
  don't think it a likely one. But it is just as well to exhaust the
  possibilities."</p>

  <p>"Quite," agreed Miller; and thereupon he wrote the brief particulars on a
  slip of paper which he put into an envelope with the photographs, and, having
  rung a bell, handed the envelope to the messenger who appeared in response to
  the summons.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose we shall have to keep you waiting very long," said the
  Superintendent. "They have an extraordinarily ingenious system of filing. Out
  of all the thousands of finger-prints that they have, they can pounce on the
  one that is wanted in the course of a few minutes. It seems incredible, and
  yet it is essentially simple&mdash;just a matter of classification and
  ringing the changes on different combinations of types."</p>

  <p>"You are speaking of completely legible prints?" suggested Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the sort of prints that we get sent in from local prisons for
  identification of a man who has been arrested under a false name. Of course,
  when we get a single imperfect print found by the police at a place where a
  crime has been committed, a bit more time has to be spent. Then we have not
  only got to place the print, but we've got to make mighty sure that it is the
  right one, because an arrest and a prosecution hangs on it. You don't want to
  arrest a man and then, when you come to take his finger-prints properly, find
  that they are the wrong ones. So, in the case of an imperfect print, you have
  got to do some careful ridge-tracing and counting and systematic checking of
  individual ridge-characters, such as bifurcations and islands. But, even so,
  they don't take so very long over it. The practised eye picks out at a glance
  details that an unpractised eye can hardly recognize even when they are
  pointed out."</p>

  <p>The Superintendent was proceeding to dilate, with professional enthusiasm,
  on the wonders of finger-print technique and the efficiency of the Department
  when his eulogies were confirmed by the entrance of an officer carrying a
  sheaf of papers and Thorndyke's photographs, which he delivered into Miller's
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Well, doctor," said the Superintendent, after a brief glance at the
  documents, "here is your information. Jeffrey Brandon is the name of the late
  lamented. Will that do for you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Thorndyke, "that is the name I expected to hear."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Miller. "I see they have kept the whole of his papers for
  some reason. I will just glance through them while you are doing Thomas
  Didymus with the finger-prints. But it is quite obvious, if you compare your
  photographs with the rolled impressions, that the ridge-patterns are
  identical."</p>

  <p>He handed Thorndyke the finger-print sheet, to which were attached the
  photograph and personal description, and sat down at the table to look over
  the other documents, while Thorndyke walked over to the window to get a
  better light. But he did not concern himself with the finger-prints beyond a
  very brief inspection. It was the photograph that interested him. It showed,
  on the same print, a right profile and a full face; of which he concentrated
  his attention on the former. A rather remarkable profile it was, strikingly
  handsome and curiously classical in outline, rather recalling the head of
  Antinous in the British Museum. Thorndyke examined it minutely, and
  then&mdash;his back being turned to Miller&mdash;he drew from his waistcoat
  pocket the right profile of Mr. Pottermack and placed it beside the prison
  photograph.</p>

  <p>A single glance made it clear that the two photographs represented the
  same face. Though one showed a clean-shaven young man with the full lips and
  strong, rounded chin completely revealed, while the other was a portrait of a
  bearded, spectacled, middle-aged man, yet they were unmistakably the same.
  The remarkable nose and brow and the shapely ear were identical in the two
  photographs; and in both, the lobe of the ear was marked at its tip by a dark
  spot.</p>

  <p>From the photograph he turned to the description. Not that it was
  necessary to seek further proof; and he did, in fact, merely glance through
  the particulars. But that rapid glance gathered fresh confirmation. "Height 5
  feet 6 inches, hair chestnut, eyes darkish grey, small port-wine mark on lobe
  of right ear," etc. All the details of Jeffrey Brandon's personal
  characteristics applied perfectly to Mr. Marcus Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite see," said Miller, as he took the papers from Thorndyke and
  laid them on the others, "why they kept all these documents. The conviction
  doesn't look to me very satisfactory&mdash;I don't like these cases where the
  prosecution has all its eggs in one basket, with the possible chance that
  they may be bad eggs; and it was a devil of a sentence for a first offence.
  But as the poor beggar is dead, and no reconsideration of either the
  conviction or the sentence is possible, there doesn't seem much object in
  preserving the records. Still, there may have been some reason at the
  time."</p>

  <p>In his own mind, Thorndyke was of opinion that there might have been a
  very good reason. But he did not communicate this opinion. He had obtained
  the information that he had sought and was not at all desirous of troubling
  still waters; and his experience having taught him that Mr. Superintendent
  Miller was an exceedingly "noticing" gentleman, he thought it best to avoid
  further discussion and take his departure, after having expressed his
  appreciation of the assistance that he had received.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, for some time after he had gone, the Superintendent remained
  wrapped in profound thought; and that his cogitations were in some way
  concerned with the departed visitor would have been suggested by the
  circumstance that he sauntered to the window and looked down with a
  speculative eye on that visitor as he strode across the courtyard towards the
  Whitehall gate.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Thorndyke's mind was no less busy. As he wended his way
  Templewards he reviewed the situation in all its bearings. The wildly
  improbable had turned out to be true. He had made a prodigiously long shot
  and he had hit the mark: which was gratifying inasmuch as it justified a
  previous rather hypothetical train of reasoning. Marcus Pottermack, Esq., was
  undoubtedly the late Jeffrey Brandon. There was now no question about that.
  The only question that remained was what was to be done in the matter; and
  that question would have been easier to decide if he had been in possession
  of more facts. He had heard Mr. Stalker's opinion of the conviction, based on
  intimate knowledge of the circumstances, and he had heard that of the
  Superintendent, based on an immense experience of prosecutions. He was
  inclined to agree with them both; and the more so inasmuch as he had certain
  knowledge which they had not.</p>

  <p>In the end, he decided to take no action at present, but to keep a
  watchful eye for further developments.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;MR. POTTERMACK SEEKS ADVENTURE</h3>

  <p>In the last chapter it was stated that one of the effects of Thorndyke's
  appearance at the side gate of "The Chestnuts," Borley, was to revive in the
  mind of its tenant certain projects which had been considered and rejected.
  But perhaps the word "rejected" overstates the case. For the continued
  existence in a locked drawer in Mr. Pottermack's workshop of a coat which had
  once been James Lewson's and a bundle of twenty five-pound notes implied a
  purpose which had been abandoned only conditionally and subject to possible
  reconsideration.</p>

  <p>Again and again, as the destructor which stood in the corner beyond the
  tool-shed smoked and flared as he fed it with combustible rubbish, had he
  been on the point of flinging into it the coat and the banknotes and thereby
  reducing to unrecognizable ash the last visible traces of the tragedy. And
  every time his hand had been stayed by the thought that possibly, in some
  circumstances as yet unforeseen, these mementoes of that night of horror
  might yet be made to play a useful part. So, not without many a twinge of
  uneasiness, he had let these incriminating objects lie hidden in the locked
  drawer. And now, as it seemed to him, the circumstances had arisen in which
  some of them, at least, might be turned to account.</p>

  <p>What were those circumstances? Simply the state of mind of the strange
  lawyer. To the people of Borley, including the police, Lewson was a man who
  had absconded and vanished. His tracks had shown him striking out across
  country towards the London road. Those tracks, it is true, broke off short on
  the heath and had not reappeared elsewhere, but no one doubted that he had
  gone clear away from the vicinity of Borley and was now in hiding at a safe
  distance from his old haunts. The natives of the district had never given Mr.
  Pottermack a moment's anxiety. But with this lawyer the case was different.
  The disturbing thing about him was that his curiosity, tepid as it was,
  concerned itself, not with the man who had vanished but with the locality
  from which he disappeared. But curiosity of that kind, Mr. Pottermack felt,
  was a thing that was not to be encouraged. On the contrary, it had better be
  diverted into a more wholesome channel. In short, the time had come when it
  would be desirable that James Lewson should make his appearance, if only by
  proxy, in some district as far removed as possible from the neighbourhood of
  "The Chestnuts," Borley.</p>

  <p>So it came about that Mr. Pottermack prepared to set forth along that
  perilous track beaten smooth by the feet of those who do not know when to let
  well alone.</p>

  <p>For some days after having come to his decision in general terms he was at
  a loss for a detailed plan. Somehow, the stolen notes had got to be put into
  circulation. But not by him. The numbers of those notes were known, and, as
  soon as they began to circulate, some, at least, of them would be identified
  and would be rigorously traced. The problem was how to get rid of them in a
  plausible manner without appearing in the transaction; and for some time he
  could think of no better plan than that of simply dropping them in a quiet
  London street, a plan which he summarily rejected as not meeting the
  necessities of the case. The fruitful suggestion eventually came from a
  newsboy who was roaring "Egbert Bruce's Finals!" outside the station. In an
  instant, Mr. Pottermack realized that here was the perfect plan, and having
  purchased a paper, took it home to extract the details on which he proposed
  to base his strategic scheme.</p>

  <p>The "finals" related to a somewhat unselect race-meeting which was to take
  place in a couple of days' time at Illingham in Surrey, a place conveniently
  accessible from Borley and yet remote enough to render it unlikely that he
  would be seen there by any of his fellow-townsmen. Not that his presence
  there would be in any way suspicious or incriminating, but, still, the less
  people knew about his movements the better.</p>

  <p>On the appointed day he set forth betimes, neatly but I suitably dressed
  and all agog for the adventure, tame though it promised to be if it worked
  according to plan. To Mrs. Gadby he had explained&mdash;quite
  truthfully&mdash;that he was going to London; and if she had wanted
  confirmation of the statement, it could have been supplied by sundry natives
  of the town with whom he exchanged greetings on the platform as he waited for
  the London train.</p>

  <p>But despite his geniality, he made a point of selecting an empty
  first-class compartment and shutting himself in. He had no hankering for
  human companionship. For, beneath the exhilaration engendered by this little
  adventure was an appreciable tinge of nervousness. No foreseeable contingency
  threatened his safety; but it is an undeniable fact that a man who carries,
  buttoned up in his inside breast pocket, twenty stolen banknotes, of which
  the numbers are known to the police, and of his possession of which he could
  give no credible account, is not without some reason for nervousness. And
  that was Mr. Pottermack's position. Just before starting, he had disinterred
  the whole bundle of those fatal notes and stuffed them into a compartment of
  the letter-case which he usually carried in his breast pocket. He had also
  hunted up another letter-case, aged, outworn and shabby, into which he had
  put a half-dozen ten-shilling notes for the day's expenses and stowed it in
  the outside hip pocket of his jacket.</p>

  <p>As soon as the train had fairly started, he proceeded to make certain
  rearrangements related to his plan of campaign. Taking out the two
  letter-wallets&mdash;which we may distinguish as the inner and the
  outer&mdash;he laid them on the seat beside him. From the inner wallet he
  took out five of the stolen notes and placed them loosely in a compartment of
  the other wallet with their ends projecting so that they were plainly visible
  when it was open; and from the outer wallet he transferred four of the
  ten-shilling notes to the inner (he had paid for his ticket in silver). Then
  he returned the two wallets to their respective pockets and buttoned up his
  coat.</p>

  <p>From Marylebone Station he walked to Baker Street, where he took a train
  for Waterloo and arrived to find the great station filled with a seething
  crowd of racegoers. Not, on the whole, a prepossessing crowd, though all
  sorts and conditions of men were represented. But Mr. Pottermack was not
  hypercritical. At the over-smart, horsey persons, the raffish sporting men
  with race-glasses slung over their shoulders, the men of mystery with
  handbags or leather satchels, he glanced with benevolent interest. They had
  their uses in the economy of nature&mdash;in fact, he hoped to make use of
  some of them himself. So tolerant, indeed, was he that he even greeted with a
  kindly smile the notices pasted up urging passengers to beware of
  pickpockets. For in that respect his condition was unique. In spite of the
  wallet in his outside pocket, he enjoyed complete immunity; and as he joined
  the queue at the booking-office window, he reflected with grim amusement
  that, of all that throng, he was probably the only person who had come
  expressly to have his pocket picked.</p>

  <p>As he approached the window he drew the wallet from his outside pocket,
  and, opening it, inspected its interior with an air of indecision, took out
  one of the banknotes, put it back, and, finally dipping into the other
  compartment, fished out a ten-shilling note. Holding this in one hand and the
  open wallet in the other, he at last came opposite the window, where he
  purchased his ticket and moved on to make way for a large, red-faced man who
  seemed to be in a hurry. As he walked on slowly towards the barrier,
  pocketing the wallet as he went, the crowd surged impatiently past him; but
  watching that crowd as it swept on ahead, he could see no sign of the
  red-faced man. That gentleman's hurry seemed suddenly to have evaporated, and
  it was only when Pottermack was entering his carriage and turned to look back
  that he observed his roseate friend immediately behind him. Instantly he
  entered the nearly full compartment, and as he took his seat he was careful
  to leave a vacant place on his right hand; and when the red-faced man,
  closely following him, plumped down into the vacant space and at once began
  to exercise his elbows, he smiled inwardly with the satisfaction of the
  fortunate angler who "sees his quill or cork down sink." In short, he felt a
  comfortable certainty that he had "got a bite."</p>

  <p>It was now a matter of deep regret to him that he had neglected to provide
  himself at the bookstall with something to read. A newspaper would have been
  so helpful to his friend on the right. However, the deficiency was made up to
  a practicable extent by a couple of men who faced each other from the two
  corners to his left, and who, having spread a small rug across their joint
  knees, were good enough to give a demonstration for the benefit of the
  company at large of the immemorial three-card trick. Towards them Pottermack
  craned with an expression of eager interest that aroused in them an
  unjustified optimism. With intense concentration the operator continued over
  and over again to perform dummy turns, and the professional "mug," who sat
  opposite to Pottermack, continued with blatant perversity to spot the
  obviously wrong card every time, and pay up his losses with groans of
  surprise, while the fourth confederate, on Pottermack's left, nudged him from
  time to time and solicited in a whisper his opinion as to which was really
  the right card. It is needless to say that his opinion turned out invariably
  to be correct, but still he resisted the whispered entreaties of his
  neighbour to try his luck "seeing that he was such a dab at spotting 'em."
  Under other circumstances he would have invested the ten-shilling note for
  the sake of publicity. As things were, he did not dare to touch the wallet,
  or even put his hand to the pocket wherein it reposed. Premature discovery
  would have been fatal.</p>

  <p>As the train sped on and consumed the miles of the short journey, the
  operator's invitations to Pottermack to try his luck became more urgent and
  less polite; until at length, as the destination drew near, they degenerated
  into mere objurgation and epithets of contempt. At length the train slowed
  down at the platform. Every one stood up and all together tried to squeeze
  through the narrow doorway, Pottermack himself emerging with unexpected
  velocity, propelled by a vigorous shove. At the same moment his hat was
  lightly flicked off his head and fell among the feet of the crowd. He would
  have stooped to recover it, but the necessity was forestalled by an expert
  kick which sent it soaring aloft; and hardly had it descended when it rose
  again and yet again until, having taken its erratic flight over the fence, it
  came at last to rest in the station-master's garden. By the time it had been
  retrieved with the aid of the sympathetic station-master, the last of the
  passengers had filed through the barrier and Pottermack brought up the
  extreme rear like a belated straggler.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had had time to recover from these agitating experiences his
  thoughts flew to the wallet and he thrust his hand into his outside pocket.
  To his unspeakable surprise, the wallet was still there. As he made the
  discovery he was aware of a pang of disappointment, even of a sense of
  injury. He had put his trust in the red-faced man, and behold! that rubicund
  impostor had betrayed him. It looked as if this plan of his was not so easy
  as it had appeared.</p>

  <p>But when he came to the turnstile of the enclosure and drew out the wallet
  to extract the ten-shilling note&mdash;and incidentally to display its other
  contents&mdash;he realized that he had done the red-faced man an injustice.
  The ten-shilling note, indeed, was there, tucked away at the bottom of its
  compartment, but otherwise the wallet was empty. Pottermack could hardly
  believe his eyes. For a few moments he stood staring at it in astonishment
  until an impatient poke in the back and an imperative command to "pass along,
  please," recalled him to the present proceedings, when he swept up and
  pocketed his change and strolled away into the enclosure, meditating
  respectfully on the skill and tact of his red-faced acquaintance and wishing
  that he had made the discovery sooner. For, now, the wallet would need to be
  recharged for the benefit of the next artist. This he could have done easily
  in the empty station, but in the crowd which surrounded him the matter
  presented difficulties. He could not do it unobserved, and it would appear a
  somewhat odd proceeding&mdash;especially to the eye of a plain-clothes
  policeman. There must be a good number of those useful officials in the
  crowd, and it was of vital importance that he should not attract the
  attention of any of them.</p>

  <p>He looked round in some bewilderment, seeking a secluded spot in which he
  could refill the outer wallet unnoticed. A vain quest! Every part of the
  enclosure, excepting the actual course, was filled with a seething multitude,
  varying in density but all-pervading. Here and there a closely packed mass
  indicated some juggler, mountebank, thimble artist, or card expert, and some
  distance away a Punch and Judy show rose above the heads of the crowd, the
  sound of its drum and Pan's pipes and the unmistakable voice of the hero
  penetrating the general hubbub. Towards this exhibition Pottermack was
  directing his course when shouts of laughter proceeding from the interior of
  a small but dense crowd suggested that something amusing was happening there;
  whereupon Pottermack, renouncing the delights of Punch and Judy, began
  cautiously to elbow his way towards the centre of attraction.</p>

  <p>At this moment a bell rang in the distance, and instantly the whole crowd
  was in motion, surging towards the course. And then began a most singular
  hurly-burly in Pottermack's immediate neighbourhood. An unseen foot trod
  heavily on his toes, and at the same moment he received a violent shove that
  sent him staggering to the right against a seedy-looking person who thumped
  him in the ribs and sent him reeling back to the left. Before he could
  recover his balance some one butted him in the back with such violence that
  he flew forward and impinged heavily on a small man in a straw hat&mdash;very
  much in it, in fact, for it had been banged down right over his
  eyes&mdash;who was beginning to protest angrily when some unseen force from
  behind propelled him towards Pottermack and another violent collision
  occurred. Thereafter Pottermack had but a confused consciousness of being
  pushed, pulled, thumped, pinched, and generally hustled until his head swam.
  And then, quite suddenly, the crowd streamed away towards the course and
  Pottermack was left alone with the straw-hatted man, who stood a few yards
  away, struggling to extract himself from his hat and at the same time
  feverishly searching his pockets. By the well-known process of suggestion,
  this latter action communicated itself to Mr. Pottermack, who proceeded to
  make a hasty survey of his own pockets, which resulted in the discovery that,
  though the inside wallet, securely buttoned in, was still intact, the
  outside, empty one had this time disappeared, and most of his small change
  with it.</p>

  <p>Strange are the inconsistencies of the human mind. But a little while ago
  he had been willing to make a free gift of that wallet to his red-faced
  fellow-traveller. Now that it was gone he was quite appreciably annoyed. He
  had planned to recharge it with a fresh consignment to be planted in a
  desirable quarter, and its loss left him with the necessity of making some
  other plausible arrangements, and at the moment he could not think of any. To
  put the notes loose in his pocket seemed to be but inviting failure, for, to
  the sense of touch from without, the pocket would appear to be empty.</p>

  <p>As he was thus cogitating, he caught the eye of the straw-hatted gentleman
  fixed upon him with unmistakable and undissembled suspicion. This was
  unpleasant, but one must make allowances. The man was, no doubt, rather
  upset. With a genial smile, Mr. Pottermack approached the stranger and
  expressed the rather optimistic hope that he had not suffered any loss; but
  the only reply that his enquiry elicited was an inarticulate grunt.</p>

  <p>"They have been through my pockets," said Mr. Pottermack cheerfully, "but
  I am glad to say that they took nothing of any value."</p>

  <p>"Ha," said the straw-hatted gentleman.</p>

  <p>"Yes," pursued Pottermack, "they must have found me rather
  disappointing."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said the other in a tone of sour indifference.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Pottermack, "all they got from me was an empty letter-case and
  a little loose silver."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said the straw-hatted man.</p>

  <p>"I hope," Pottermack repeated, beginning slightly to lose patience, "that
  you have not lost anything of considerable value."</p>

  <p>For a moment or two the other made no reply. At length, fixing a baleful
  eye on Pottermack, he answered with significant emphasis: "If you want to
  know what they took, you'd better ask them"; and with this he turned
  away.</p>

  <p>Pottermack also turned away&mdash;in the opposite direction, and some
  inward voice whispered to him that it were well to evacuate the neighbourhood
  of the man in the straw hat.</p>

  <p>He strolled away, gradually increasing his pace, until he reached the
  outskirts of the crowd that had gathered at the margin of the course. By a
  sound of cheering he judged that some ridiculous horses were careering along
  somewhere beyond the range of his vision. But they were of no interest to
  him. They did, however, furnish him with a pretext for diving into the crowd
  and struggling towards the source of the noise, and this he did, regardless
  of the unseemly comments that he provoked and the thumps and prods that he
  received in his progress. When, as it seemed, he had become immovably
  embedded, he drew a deep breath and turned to look back. For a few blissful
  moments he believed that he had effected a masterly retreat and escaped
  finally from his suspicious fellow-victim; but suddenly there emerged into
  view a too-familiar battered straw hat, moving slowly through the resisting
  multitude, and moving in a bee-line in his direction.</p>

  <p>Then it was that Mr. Pottermack became seized with sudden panic. And no
  wonder. His previous experiences of the law had taught him that mere
  innocence is of no avail; and now, simply to be charged involved the risk of
  recognition and inevitable return to a convict prison. But apart from that,
  his position was one of extreme peril. On his person at this very moment were
  fifteen stolen notes of which he could give no account, but which connected
  him with that thing that reposed under the sun-dial. At the best, those notes
  might fairly send him to penal servitude; at the worst, to the gallows.</p>

  <p>It is therefore no matter for surprise that the sight of that ominous
  straw hat sent a sudden chill down his spine. But Mr. Pottermack was no
  coward. Unforeseen as the danger was, he kept his nerve and made no outward
  sign of the terror that was clutching at his heart. Calmly he continued to
  worm his way through the crowd, glancing back now and again to note his
  distance from that relentless hat, and ever looking for a chance to get rid
  of those fatal notes. For, if once he could get clear of those, he would be
  ready to face with courage and composure the lesser risk. But no chance ever
  came. Openly to jettison the notes in the midst of the crowd would have been
  fatal. He would have been instantly written down a detected and pursued
  pickpocket.</p>

  <p>While his mind was busy with these considerations his body was being
  skilfully piloted along the line of least resistance in the crowd. Now and
  again he made excursions into the less dense regions on the outskirts,
  thereby securing a gain in distance, only to plunge once more into the thick
  of the throng in the faint hope of being lost sight of. But this hope was
  never realized. On the whole, he maintained his distance from his pursuer and
  even slightly increased it. Sometimes for the space of a minute or more the
  absurd sleuth was lost to his view; but just as his hopes were beginning to
  revive, that accursed hat would make its reappearance and reduce him, if not
  to despair, at least to the most acute anxiety.</p>

  <p>In the course of one of his excursions into the thinner part of the crowd,
  he noticed that, some distance ahead, a bold curve of the course brought it
  comparatively near to the entrance to the enclosure. He could see a steady
  stream of people still pouring in through the entrance turnstile, but that
  which gave exit from the ground was practically free. No one seemed to be
  leaving the enclosure at present, so the way out was quite unobstructed.
  Noting this fact with a new hope, he plunged once more into the dense crowd
  and set a course through it nearly parallel to the railings. When he had
  worked his way to a point nearly opposite to the entrance, he looked back to
  ascertain the whereabouts of his follower. The straw-hatted man was plainly
  visible, tightly jammed in the thickest part of the crowd and apparently not
  on amicable terms with his immediate neighbours. Pottermack decided that this
  was his chance and proceeded to take it. Skilfully extricating himself from
  the throng, he walked briskly towards the gates and made for the exit
  turnstile. As there was no one else leaving the ground, he passed out
  unhindered, pausing only for a moment to take a quick glance back. But what
  he saw in that glance was by no means reassuring. The straw-hatted man was,
  indeed, still tightly jammed in the thick of the crowd; but at his side was a
  policeman to whom he appeared to be making a statement as he pointed
  excitedly towards the turnstile. And both informer and constable seemed to be
  watching his departure.</p>

  <p>Pottermack waited to see no more. Striding away from the entrance, he came
  to a road on which was a signpost pointing to the station. The railway being
  the obvious means of escape, he turned in the opposite direction, which
  apparently led into the country. A short distance along the road, he
  encountered an aged man, engaged in trimming the hedge, who officiously
  wished him good-afternoon and whom he secretly anathematized for being there.
  A little farther on, round a sharp turn in the road, he came to a stile which
  gave access to a little-used footpath which crossed a small meadow. Vaulting
  over the stile, he set out along the footpath at a sharp walk. His impulse
  was to run, but he restrained it, realizing that a running man would attract
  attention where a mere walker might pass unobserved, or at least unnoticed.
  However, he quickly came to the farther side of the meadow, where another
  stile gave on a narrow by-lane. Here Pottermack paused for a moment, doubtful
  which way to turn; but the fugitive's instinct to get as far as possible from
  the pursuers decided the question. He turned in the direction that led away
  from the race-course.</p>

  <p>Walking quickly along the lane for a minute or two, he came to a sudden
  turn and saw that, a short distance ahead, the lane opened into a road. At
  the same moment there rose among a group of elms on his right the tower of a
  church; and here the hedgerow gave place to a brick wall, broken by a
  wicket-gate, through which he looked into a green and pleasant churchyard.
  The road before him he surmised to be the one that he had left by the stile,
  and his surmise received most alarming confirmation. For, even at the very
  moment when he was entering the wicket, two figures walked rapidly across the
  end of the lane. One of them was a tall, military-looking man who swung along
  with easy but enormous strides; the other, who kept up with him with
  difficulty, was a small man in a battered straw hat.</p>

  <p>With a gasp of horror, Pottermack darted in through the wicket and looked
  round wildly for possible cover. Then he saw that the church door was open,
  and, impelled, possibly, by some vague idea of sanctuary, bolted in. For a
  moment he stood at the threshold looking into the peaceful, silent interior,
  forgetting in his agitation even to take off his hat. There was no one in the
  church; but immediately confronting the intruder, securely bolted to a stone
  column, was a small iron-bound chest. On its front were painted the words
  "Poor Box," and above it, an inscription on a board informed Mr. Pottermack
  that "The Lord loveth a Cheerful Giver."</p>

  <p>Well, He had one that time. No sooner had Mr. Pottermack's eyes lighted on
  that box than he had whipped out his wallet and extracted the notes. With
  trembling fingers he folded them up in twos and threes and poked them through
  the slit; and when the final pair&mdash;as if protesting against his
  extravagant munificence&mdash;stuck in the opening and refused to go in, he
  adroitly persuaded them with a penny, which he pushed through and dropped in
  by way of an additional thank-offering. As that penny dropped down with a
  faint, papery rustle, he put away his wallet and drew a deep breath. Mr.
  Pottermack was his own man again.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was the straw-hatted man. But now that those
  incriminating notes were gone, so great was the revulsion that he could truly
  say, in the words of the late S. Pepys&mdash;or at least in a polite
  paraphrase of them&mdash;that he "valued him not a straw." The entire
  conditions were changed. But as he turned with a new buoyancy of spirit to
  leave the church, there came to him a sudden recollection of the red-faced
  man's skill and ingenuity which caused him to thrust his hands into his
  pockets. And it was just as well that he did, for he brought up from his
  left-hand coat pocket a battered silver pencil-holder that was certainly not
  his and that advertised the identity of its legitimate owner by three initial
  letters legibly engraved on its flat end.</p>

  <p>On this&mdash;having flung the pencil-holder out through the porch doorway
  into the high grass of the churchyard&mdash;he turned back into the building
  and made a systematic survey of his pockets, emptying each one in turn on to
  the cushioned seat of a pew. When he had ascertained beyond all doubt that
  none of them contained any article of property other than his own, he went
  forth with a light heart and retraced his steps through the wicket out into
  the lane, and, turning to the right, walked on towards the road. It had been
  his intention to return along it to the station, but when he came out of the
  lane, he found himself at the entrance to a village street and quite near to
  a comfortable-looking inn which hung out the sign of "The Farmer's Boy." The
  sight of the homely hostelry reminded him that it was now well past his usual
  luncheon hour and made him aware of a fine, healthy appetite.</p>

  <p>It appeared, on enquiry, that there was a cold sirloin in cut and a nice,
  quiet parlour in which to consume it. Pottermack smiled with anticipatory
  gusto at the report and gave his orders; and within a few minutes found
  himself in the parlour aforesaid, seated at a table covered with a clean
  white cloth on which was an abundant sample of the sirloin, a hunk of bread,
  a slab of cheese, a plate of biscuits and a jovial, pot-bellied brown jug
  crowned with a cap of foam.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack enjoyed his lunch amazingly. The beef was excellent, the
  beer was of the best, and their combined effect was further to raise his
  spirits and lower his estimate of the straw-hatted man. He realized now that
  his initial panic had been due to those ill-omened notes; to the fact that a
  false charge might reveal the material for a real one of infinitely greater
  gravity. Now that he was clear of them, the fact that he was a man of
  substance and known position would be a sufficient answer to any mere casual
  suspicion. His confidence was completely restored, and he even speculated
  with detached interest on the possible chance of encountering his pursuers on
  his way back to the station.</p>

  <p>He had finished the beef to the last morsel and was regarding with tepid
  interest the slab of high-complexioned cheese when the door opened and
  revealed two figures at the threshold, both of whom halted with their eyes
  fixed on him intently. After a moment's inspection, the shorter&mdash;who
  wore a battered straw hat&mdash;pointed to him and affirmed in impressive
  tones:</p>

  <p>"That's the man."</p>

  <p>On this, the taller stranger took a couple of steps forward and said, as
  if repeating a formula: "I am a police officer" (it was a perfectly
  unnecessary statement. No one could have supposed that he was anything else).
  "This&mdash;er&mdash;gentleman informs me that you picked his pocket."</p>

  <p>"Does he really?" said Pottermack, regarding him with mild surprise and
  pouring himself out another glass of beer.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he does; and the question is, what have you got to say about it? It
  is my duty to caution you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said Pottermack. "The question is, what has he got to say
  about it? Has he given you any particulars?"</p>

  <p>"No. He says you picked his pocket. That's all."</p>

  <p>"Did he see me pick his pocket?"</p>

  <p>The officer turned to the accuser. "Did you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"No, of course I didn't," snapped the other. "Pickpockets don't usually
  let you see what they are up to."</p>

  <p>"Did he feel me pick his pocket?" Pottermack asked, with the air of a
  cross-examining counsel.</p>

  <p>"Did you?" the officer asked, looking dubiously at the accuser.</p>

  <p>"How could I," protested the latter, "when I was being pulled and shoved
  and hustled in the crowd?"</p>

  <p>"Ha," said Pottermack, taking a sip of beer. "He didn't see me pick his
  pocket, he didn't feel me pick his pocket. Now, how did he arrive at the
  conclusion that I did pick his pocket?"</p>

  <p>The officer turned almost threateningly on the accuser.</p>

  <p>"How did you?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well," stammered the straw-hatted man, "there was a gang of pickpockets
  and he was among them."</p>

  <p>"But so were you," retorted Pottermack. "How do I know that you didn't
  pick my pocket? Somebody did."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said the officer. "Had your pocket picked too? What did they take of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>"Mighty little&mdash;just a few oddments of small change. I kept my coat
  buttoned."</p>

  <p>There was a slightly embarrassed silence, during which the officer, not
  for the first time, ran an appraising eye over the accused. His experience of
  pickpockets was extensive and peculiar, but it did not include any persons of
  Pottermack's type. He turned and directed a dubious and enquiring look at the
  accuser.</p>

  <p>"Well," said the latter, "here he is. Aren't you going to take him into
  custody?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless you can give me something to go on," replied the officer. "The
  station inspector wouldn't accept a charge of this sort."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," said the accuser, "I suppose you will take his name and
  address?"</p>

  <p>The officer grinned sardonically at the artless suggestion but agreed that
  it might be as well, and produced a large, funereal note-book.</p>

  <p>"What is your name?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Marcus Pottermack," the owner of that name replied, adding "my address is
  'The Chestnuts' Borley, Buckinghamshire."</p>

  <p>The officer wrote down these particulars, and then closing the note-book,
  put it away with a very definite air of finality, remarking: "That's about
  all that we can do at present." But this did not at all meet the views of the
  straw-hatted man, who protested plaintively:</p>

  <p>"And you mean to say that you are going to let him walk off with my gold
  watch and my note-case with five pounds in it? You are not even going to
  search him?"</p>

  <p>"You can't search people who haven't been charged," the officer growled;
  but here Pottermack interposed.</p>

  <p>"There is no need," he said suavely, "for you to be hampered by mere
  technical difficulties. I know it is quite irregular, but if it would give
  you any satisfaction just to run through my pockets, I haven't the slightest
  objection."</p>

  <p>The officer was obviously relieved. "Of course, sir, if you volunteer that
  is a different matter, and it would clear things up."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, Pottermack rose and presented himself for the operation,
  while the straw-hatted man approached and watched with devouring eyes. The
  officer began with the wallet, noted the initials, M. P., on the cover,
  opened and considered the orderly arrangement of the stamps, cards and other
  contents; took out a visiting-card, read it and put it back, and finally laid
  the wallet on the table. Then he explored all the other pockets
  systematically and thoroughly, depositing the treasure trove from each on the
  table beside the wallet. When he had finished, he thanked Mr. Pottermack for
  his help, and turning to the accuser, demanded gruffly: "Well, are you
  satisfied now?"</p>

  <p>"I should be better satisfied," the other man answered, "if I had got back
  my watch and my note-case. But I suppose he passed them on to one of his
  confederates."</p>

  <p>Then the officer lost patience. "Look here," said he, "you are behaving
  like a fool. You come to a race-meeting, like a blooming mug, with a gold
  watch sticking out, asking for trouble, and when you get what you asked for,
  you let the crooks hop off with the goods while you go dandering about after
  a perfectly respectable gentleman. You bring me traipsing out here on a wild
  goose chase, and when it turns out that there isn't any wild goose, you make
  silly, insulting remarks. You ought to have more sense at your age. Now, I'll
  just take your name and address and then you'd better clear off."</p>

  <p>Once more he produced the Black Maria note-book, and when he had entered
  the particulars he dismissed the straw-hatted man, who slunk off, dejected
  but still muttering.</p>

  <p>Left alone with the late accused, the officer became genially and politely
  apologetic. But Pottermack would have none of his apologies. The affair had
  gone off to his complete satisfaction, and, in spite of some rather
  half-hearted protests, he insisted on celebrating the happy conclusion by the
  replenishment of the brown jug. Finally, the accused and the minion of the
  law emerged from the inn together and took their way back along the road to
  the station, beguiling the time by amicable converse on the subject of crooks
  and their ways and the peculiar mentality of the straw-hatted man.</p>

  <p>It was a triumphant end to what had threatened to be a most disastrous
  incident. But yet, when he came to consider it at leisure, Pottermack was by
  no means satisfied. The expedition had been a failure, and he now wished,
  heartily, that he had left well alone and simply burnt the notes. His
  intention had been to distribute them in small parcels among various
  pickpockets, whereby they would have been thrown into circulation with the
  certainty that it would have been impossible to trace them. That scheme had
  failed utterly. There they were, fifteen stolen notes, in the poor-box of
  Illingham church. When the reverend incumbent found them, he would certainly
  be surprised, and, no doubt, gratified. Of course, he would pay them into his
  bank; and then the murder would be out. The munificent gift would resolve
  itself into the dump of a hunted and hard-pressed pickpocket; and Mr.
  Pottermack's name and address was in the note-book of the plain-clothes
  constable.</p>

  <p>Of course, there was no means of connecting him directly with the dump.
  But there was the unfortunate coincidence that both he and the stolen notes
  were connected with Borley, Buckinghamshire. That coincidence could hardly
  fail to be noticed; and, added to his known proximity to the church, it might
  create a very awkward situation. In short, Mr. Pottermack had brought his
  pigs to the wrong market. He had planned to remove the area of investigation
  from his own neighbourhood to one at a safe and comfortable distance; instead
  of which, he had laid down a clue leading straight to his own door.</p>

  <p>It was a lamentable affair. As he sat in the homeward train with an unread
  evening paper on his knee, he found himself recalling the refrain of the old
  revivalist hymn and asking himself "Oh, what shall the harvest be?"</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER IX&mdash;PROVIDENCE INTERVENES</h3>

  <p>In his capacity of medico-legal adviser to the "Griffin" Life Assurance
  Company, Thorndyke saw a good deal of Mr. Stalker, who, in addition to his
  connection with Perkins's Bank, held the post of Managing Director of the
  "Griffin." For if the bank had but rarely any occasion to seek Thorndyke's
  advice, the Assurance Office was almost daily confronted with problems which
  called for expert guidance. It thus happened that, about three weeks after
  the date of the Illingham Races, Thorndyke looked in at Mr. Stalker's office
  in response to a telephone message to discuss the discrepancies between a
  proposal form and the medical evidence given at an inquest on the late
  proposer. The matter of this discussion does not concern us and need not be
  detailed here. It occupied some considerable time, and when Thorndyke had
  stated his conclusions, he rose to take his departure. As he turned towards
  the door, Mr. Stalker held up a detaining hand.</p>

  <p>"By the way, doctor," said he, "I think you were rather interested in that
  curious case of disappearance that I told you about&mdash;one of our branch
  managers, you may remember."</p>

  <p>"I remember," said Thorndyke; "James Lewson of your Borley branch."</p>

  <p>"That's the man," Stalker assented, adding: "I believe you keep a card
  index in your head."</p>

  <p>"And the best place to keep it," retorted Thorndyke. "But what about
  Lewson? Has he been run to earth?"</p>

  <p>"No; but the notes that he took with him have. You remember that he went
  off with a hundred pounds&mdash;twenty five-pound notes, of all of which we
  were able to ascertain the numbers. Now, the numbers of those notes were at
  once given to the police, who circulated the information in all the likely
  quarters and kept a sharp look-out for their appearance. Yet in all this
  time, up to a week or two ago, there was not a sign of one of them. Then a
  most odd thing happened. The whole lot of them made their appearance almost
  simultaneously."</p>

  <p>"Very remarkable," commented Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Very," agreed Stalker. "But there is something still more queer about the
  affair. Of course, each note, as it was reported, was rigorously traced. As a
  rule there was no difficulty&mdash;up to a certain point. And at that point
  the trail broke off short, and that point was the possession of the note by a
  person known to the police. In every case in which tracing was possible, the
  trail led back to an unquestionable crook."</p>

  <p>"And were the crooks unable to say where they got the notes?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not at all. They were able, in every case, to give the most lucid and
  convincing accounts of the way in which they came into possession of the
  notes. Only, unfortunately, not one of them could give 'a local habitation
  and a name.' They had all received the notes from total strangers."</p>

  <p>"They probably had," said Thorndyke, "without the stranger's
  concurrence."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. But you see the oddity of the affair&mdash;at least, I expect
  you do. Remember that, although the individual notes were reported at
  different times, on tracing them to their origin it looks almost as if the
  whole of them had come into circulation on the same day; about three weeks
  ago. Now, what does that suggest to you?"</p>

  <p>"The obvious suggestion," replied Thorndyke, "seems to be that Lewson had
  been robbed; that some fortunate thief had managed to relieve him of the
  whole consignment at one coup. The only other explanation&mdash;and it is far
  less probable&mdash;is that Lewson deliberately jettisoned an incriminating
  cargo."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Stalker agreed doubtfully, "that is a possibility; but, as you say,
  it is very much less probable. For if he had simply thrown them away, there
  would be no reason why they should have been so invariably traceable to a
  member of the criminal class; and surely, out of the whole lot, there would
  have been one or two honest persons who would admit to having found them. No,
  I feel pretty certain that Lewson has been robbed, and if he has, he must be
  in a mighty poor way. One is almost tempted to feel sorry for him."</p>

  <p>"He has certainly made a terrible hash of his affairs," said Thorndyke;
  and with this, the subject having been exhausted, he picked up his hat and
  stick and took his departure.</p>

  <p>But as he wended his way back to the Temple he cogitated profoundly on
  what Stalker had told him; and very surprised would Mr. Stalker have been if
  he could have been let into the matter of those cogitations. For, as to what
  had really happened, Thorndyke could make an approximate guess, though
  guesses were not very satisfying to a man of his exact habit of mind. But he
  had been expecting those notes to reappear, and he had expected that when
  they did reappear it would prove impossible to trace them to their real
  source.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, though events had befallen, so to speak, according to plan,
  he speculated curiously on the possible circumstances that had determined the
  issue of the whole consignment at once; and on arrival at his chambers he
  made certain notes in his private shorthand which he bestowed in a small
  portfolio labelled "James Lewson," which, in its turn, reposed, safely under
  lock and key, in the cabinet in which he kept his confidential documents.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Pottermack was passing through a period of tribulation and
  gnawing anxiety. Again and again did he curse the folly that had impelled
  him, when everything seemed to have settled down so comfortably, to launch
  those notes into the world to start a fresh train of trouble. Again and again
  did he follow in imagination what appeared to be the inevitable course of
  events. With horrid vividness did his fancy reconstruct the scenes of that
  calamitous comedy; the astonished parson lifting the treasure with
  incredulous joy from the poor-box; the local bank manager carrying the notes
  round to the police station; the plain-clothes constable triumphantly
  producing his note-book and pointing to the significant word "Borley"; and
  finally, the wooden-faced detective officer confronting him in his
  dining-room and asking embarrassing questions. Sometimes his imagination went
  farther, and, becoming morbid, pictured Mr. Gallett, the mason, volunteering
  evidence, with a resulting exploration of the well. But this was only when he
  was unusually depressed.</p>

  <p>In his more optimistic moods he presented the other side of the case. If
  enquiries were made, he would, naturally, deny all knowledge of the notes.
  And who was to contradict him? There was not a particle of evidence that
  could connect him with them directly&mdash;at least, he believed there was
  not. But still, deep down in his consciousness was the knowledge that he was
  connected with them; that he had taken them from the dead man's pocket and he
  had dumped them in the church. And Mr. Pottermack was no more immune than the
  rest of us from the truth that "conscience does make cowards of us all."</p>

  <p>So, in those troublous times, by day and by night, in his walks abroad and
  in his solitude at home, he lived in a state of continual apprehension. The
  fat was in the fire and he waited with constantly strained ears to catch the
  sound of its sizzling; and though, as the days and then the weeks went by and
  no sound of sizzling became audible, the acuteness of his anxiety wore off,
  still his peace of mind was gone utterly and he walked in the shadow of
  dangers unknown and incalculable. And so he might have gone on indefinitely
  but for one of those trivial chances that have befallen most of us and that
  sometimes produce results so absurdly disproportionate to their own
  insignificance.</p>

  <p>The occasion of this fortunate chance was a long, solitary walk through
  the beautiful Buckinghamshire lanes. Of late, in his disturbed state of mind,
  which yielded neither to the charms of his garden nor the allurements of his
  workshop, Mr. Pottermack had developed into an inveterate pedestrian; and on
  this particular day he had taken a long round, which brought him at length,
  tired and hungry, to the town of Aylesbury, where, at a frowsy restaurant in
  a by-street, he sat him down to rest and feed. It was a frugal meal that he
  ordered, for with the joy of living had gone his zest for food. Indeed, to
  such depths of despondency had he sunk that he actually scandalized the
  foreign proprietor by asking for a glass of water.</p>

  <p>Now, it happened that on an adjacent chair was an evening paper. It was
  weeks old, badly crumpled and none too clean. Almost automatically, Mr.
  Pottermack reached out for it, laid it on the table beside him and smoothed
  out its crumpled pages. Not that he had any hankering for news; but, like
  most of us, he had contracted the pernicious habit of miscellaneous
  reading&mdash;which is often but an idle substitute for thought&mdash;and he
  scanned the ill-printed columns in mere boredom. He was not in the least
  interested in the Hackney Man who had kicked a cat and been fined forty
  shillings. No doubt it served him right&mdash;and the cat too,
  perhaps&mdash;but it was no affair of his, Pottermack's. Nevertheless he let
  an inattentive eye ramble aimlessly up and down the page, lightly scanning
  the trivial vulgarities that headed the paragraphs, while in the background
  of his consciousness, hovering, as it were, about the threshold, lurked the
  everlasting theme of those accursed notes.</p>

  <p>Suddenly his roving eye came to a dead stop, for it had alighted on the
  word "Illingham." With suddenly sharpened attention, he turned back to the
  heading and read:</p>

  <p>'Sacrilege in a Surrey Church'</p>

  <p>'A robbery of a kind that is now becoming increasingly common occurred
  late in the afternoon of last Tuesday at the picturesque and venerable church
  of Illingham. This was the day of the races on the adjacent course, and it is
  believed that the outrage was committed by some of the doubtful characters
  who are always to be found at race-meetings. At any rate, when the sexton
  entered to close the church in the evening, he found that the lid of the
  poor-box had been wrenched open, and, of course, the contents, whatever they
  may have been, abstracted. The rector is greatly distressed at the
  occurrence, not on account of what has been stolen&mdash;for he remarked,
  with a pensive smile, that the loss is probably limited to the cost of
  repairing the box&mdash;but because he holds strong opinions on the duty of a
  clergyman to leave his church open for private prayer and meditation, and he
  fears that he may be compelled to close it in future, at least on
  race-days.'</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack read this paragraph through, first with ravenous haste and
  then again, slowly and with the minutest attention. It was incredible. He
  could hardly believe the evidence of his eyes. Yet there it was, a clear and
  unmistakable message, of which the marvellous significance was to be grasped
  by him alone of all the world. Providence&mdash;which is reported to make
  some queer selections for its favourites&mdash;had stepped in and mercifully
  repaired his error.</p>

  <p>In a moment he was a new man, or rather the old man restored. For he was
  saved. Now could he go abroad with a confident step and look the world in the
  face. Now could he take his ease at home in peace and security; could return
  with gusto to his garden and know once more the joys of labour in his
  workshop. With a fresh zest he fell to upon the remainder of his meal. He
  even electrified the proprietor by calling for coffee and a green Chartreuse.
  And when he at length went forth refreshed, to take the road homeward, he
  seemed to walk upon air.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER X&mdash;A RETROSPECT</h3>

  <p>The fortunate ending of the great note-adventure, which had at one time
  looked so threatening, had a profound effect on Mr. Pottermack's state of
  mind, and through this on his subsequent actions. Wherever the notes might be
  circulating, they were, he felt confident, well out of his neighbourhood; and
  since they had all fallen into the hands of thieves, he was equally confident
  that they would prove untraceable. So far as he was concerned, they had
  served their purpose. The field of inquiry concerning Lewson's disappearance
  was now shifted from Borley to the localities in which those notes had made
  their appearance.</p>

  <p>Thus, to Mr. Pottermack it appeared that he was finally rid of Lewson,
  alive or dead. The incident was closed. He could now consign the whole
  horrible affair to oblivion, forget it if he could, or at least remember it
  only as a hideous experience which he had passed through and finished with,
  just as he might remember certain other experiences which belonged to the
  unhappy past. Now he might give his whole attention to the future. He was
  still a comparatively young man, despite the grizzled hair upon his temples.
  And Fortune was deeply in his debt. It was time that he began to collect from
  her some of the arrears.</p>

  <p>Now, whenever Mr. Pottermack let his thoughts stray into the future, the
  picture that his fancy painted was wont to present a certain constant
  deviation from the present. It was not that the surroundings were different.
  Still in imagination he saw himself rambling through the lovely
  Buckinghamshire lanes, busying himself in his workshop or whiling away the
  pleasant hours in the walled garden among his flowers and his fruit trees.
  But in those pictures of the sunny future that was to indemnify him for the
  gloomy past there were always two figures; and one of them was that of the
  comely, gracious young widow who had already brought so much sunshine into
  his rather solitary life.</p>

  <p>During the last few strenuous weeks he had seen little of her, indeed he
  had hardly seen her at all. Now that he could put behind him for ever the
  events that had filled those weeks, now that he was free from the haunting
  menace of the blackmailer's incalculable actions and could settle down to a
  stable life with his future in his own hands, the time had arrived when he
  might begin to mould that future in accordance with his heart's desire.</p>

  <p>Thus reflecting on the afternoon following his visit to Aylesbury, he
  proceeded to make the first move. Having smartened himself up in a modest
  way, he took down from his shelves a favourite volume to serve as a pretext
  for a call, and set forth with it in his pocket towards the quiet lane on the
  fringe of the town wherein Mrs. Alice Bellard had her habitation. And a very
  pleasant habitation it was, though, indeed, it was no more than an
  old-fashioned country cottage, built to supply the simple needs of some rural
  worker or village craftsman. But houses, like dogs, have a way of reflecting
  the personalities of their owners; and this little dwelling, modest as it
  was, conveyed to the beholder a subtle sense of industry, of ordered care,
  and a somewhat fastidious taste.</p>

  <p>Pottermack stood for a few moments with his hand on the little wooden
  gate, looking up with an appreciative eye at the ripe red brickwork, the
  golden tiles of the roof, and the little stone tablet with the initials of
  the first owners and the date, 1761. Then he opened the latch and walked
  slowly up the path. Through the open window came the sound of a piano
  rendering, with no little skill and feeling, one of Chopin's preludes. He
  waited at the door, listening, until the final notes of the piece were
  played, when he turned and rapped out a flourish on the brightly burnished
  brass knocker.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately the door opened, revealing a girl of about sixteen, who
  greeted him with a friendly smile, and forthwith, without question or comment
  inducted him to the sitting-room, where Mrs. Bellard had just risen from the
  piano-stool.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," said he, as they shook hands, "that I am interrupting your
  playing&mdash;in fact, I know I am. I was half inclined to wait out in the
  garden and enjoy your performance without disturbing you."</p>

  <p>"That would have been foolish of you," she replied, "when there is a nice,
  comfortable armchair in which you can sit and smoke your pipe and listen at
  your ease&mdash;if you want to."</p>

  <p>"I do, most certainly," said he. "But first, lest I should forget it, let
  me hand you this book. I mentioned it to you once&mdash;'The Harvest of a
  Quiet Eye.' It is by a nice old west country parson and I think you will like
  it."</p>

  <p>"I am sure I shall if you do," she said. "We seem to agree in most
  things."</p>

  <p>"So we do," assented Pottermack, "even to our favourite brands of snail.
  Which reminds me that the pleasures of the chase seem to have been rather
  neglected of late."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have been quite busy lately furbishing up the house. But I have
  nearly finished. In a few days I shall have everything straight and tidy, and
  then a-snailing we will go."</p>

  <p>"We will," he agreed, "and if we find that we are exhausting the subject
  of molluscs, we might, perhaps, give a passing thought to the question of
  beetles. They are practically inexhaustible and they are not so hackneyed as
  butterflies and moths, and not so troublesome to keep. And they are really
  very beautiful and interesting creatures."</p>

  <p>"I suppose they are," she said a little doubtfully, "when you have got
  over your prejudice against their undeniable tendency to crawliness. But I am
  afraid you will have to do the slaughtering. I really couldn't kill the poor
  little wretches."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I will do that cheerfully," said Pottermack, "if you will make the
  captures."</p>

  <p>"Very well; then, on that understanding I will consider the beetle
  question. And now, would you really like me to play to you a little?"</p>

  <p>"I should like it immensely. I seem to hear so little music nowadays, and
  you play so delightfully. But are you sure you don't mind?"</p>

  <p>She laughed softly as she sat down at the piano. "Mind, indeed!" she
  exclaimed. "Did you ever know a musician who wasn't only too delighted to
  play to a sympathetic listener? It is the whole joy and reward of the art.
  Now, you just sit in that chair and fill your pipe, and I will play to you
  some of the things that I like playing to myself and that you have got to
  like too."</p>

  <p>Obediently Pottermack seated himself in the easy-chair and reflectively
  filled his pipe while he watched the skilful hands moving gracefully with
  effortless precision over the keyboard. At first she kept to regular
  pianoforte music, mostly that of Chopin: one or two of the shorter nocturnes,
  a prelude and a polonaise, and a couple of Mendelssohn's "Lieder." But
  presently she began to ramble away reminiscently among all sorts of
  unconventional trifles: old-fashioned songs, country dances, scraps of church
  music, and even one or two time-honoured hymn tunes. And as she played these
  simple melodies, softly, tastefully, and with infinite feeling, she glanced
  furtively from time to time at her visitor until, seeing he was no longer
  looking at her but was gazing dreamily out of the window, she let her eyes
  rest steadily on his face. There was something very curious in that long,
  steady look; a strange mingling of sadness, of pity and tenderness and of
  yearning affection with a certain vague anxiety as if something in his face
  was puzzling her. The eyes that dwelt on him with such soft regard yet seemed
  to ask a question.</p>

  <p>And Pottermack, sitting motionless as a statue, grasping his unlighted
  pipe, let the simple, homely melodies filter into his soul and deliver their
  message of remembrance. His thoughts were at once near and far away; near to
  the woman at his side, yet far away from the quiet room and the sunlit garden
  on which his eyes seemed to rest. Let us for a while leave him to his
  reverie, and if we may not follow his thoughts, at least&mdash;in order that
  we may the better enter into the inwardness of this history&mdash;transport
  ourselves into the scenes that memory is calling up before his eyes.</p>

  <p>Fifteen years ago there was no such person as Marcus Pottermack. The
  sober, middle-aged man, greyheaded, bearded, spectacled, who sits dreaming in
  the widow's parlour, was a handsome, sprightly youth of
  twenty-two&mdash;Jeffrey Brandon by name&mdash;who, with his shapely,
  clean-shaven face and his striking Grecian nose, had the look and manner of a
  young Olympian. And his personality matched his appearance. Amiable and
  kindly by nature, with a gay and buoyant temperament that commended him alike
  to friends and strangers, his keen intelligence, his industry and energy
  promised well for his worldly success in the future.</p>

  <p>Young as he was, he had been, at this time, engaged for two years. And
  here again he was more than commonly fortunate. It was not merely that the
  maiden of his choice was comely, sweet-natured, clever and accomplished; or
  that she was a girl of character and spirit; or even that she had certain
  modest expectations. The essence of the good fortune lay in the fact that
  Jeffrey Brandon and Alice Bentley were not merely lovers; they were staunch
  friends and sympathetic companions, with so many interests in common that it
  was incredible that they should ever tire of each other's society.</p>

  <p>One of their chief interests&mdash;perhaps the greatest&mdash;was music.
  They were both enthusiasts. But whereas Jeffrey's accomplishments went no
  farther than a good ear, a pleasant baritone voice and the power of singing a
  part at sight, Alice was really a musician. Her skill at the piano was of the
  professional class; she was a fair organist, and in addition she had a good
  and well-trained contralto voice. Naturally enough, it happened that they
  drifted into the choir of the little friendly Evangelical church that they
  attended together, and this gave them a new and delightful occupation. Now
  and again Alice would take a service at the organ; and then there were
  practice nights and preparations for special services, musical festivals or
  informal sacred concerts which kept them busy with the activities that they
  both loved. And so their lives ran on, serenely, peacefully, filled with
  quiet enjoyment of the satisfying present, with the promise of a yet more
  happy future when they should be married and in full possession of each
  other.</p>

  <p>And then, in a moment, the whole fabric of their happiness collapsed like
  a house of cards. As if in an incomprehensible nightmare, the elements of
  that tragedy unfolded: the amazing accusation, the still more amazing
  discovery; the trial at the Old Bailey Sessions, the conviction, the
  sentence; the bitter, despairing farewell, and, last of all, the frowning
  portals of the convict prison.</p>

  <p>Of course, Alice Bentley scouted the idea of her lover's guilt. She
  roundly declared that the whole affair was a plot, a wicked and foolish
  miscarriage of justice, and she announced her intention of meeting him at the
  prison gate when he should be set free, to claim him as her promised husband,
  that she might try to make up to him by her devotion and sympathy what he had
  suffered from the world's injustice. And when it was coldly pointed out to
  her that he had had a fair trial and had been found guilty by a jury of his
  fellow-countrymen, she broke away indignantly and thereafter withdrew herself
  from the society of these fair-weather friends.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the unfortunate Jeffrey, meditating in his prison cell, had
  come with no less resolution to his decision. In so far as was possible he
  would bear the burden of his misfortune alone. Deeply, passionately as he
  loved the dear girl who, almost alone of all the world, still believed in his
  innocence, he must cast her out of his life for ever. He gloried in her
  loyalty, but he could not accept her sacrifice. Alice&mdash;his
  Alice&mdash;should never marry a convict. For that was what he was: a
  convicted thief and forger; and nothing but a miracle could alter his
  position. The fact that he was innocent was beside the mark, since his
  innocence was known only to himself and one other&mdash;the nameless villain
  who had set this infamous trap for him. To all the rest of the world he was a
  guilty man; and the world was right according to the known facts. He had had
  a fair trial, a perfectly fair trial. The prosecution had not been
  vindictive, the judge had summed up fairly, and the jury had found him
  guilty; and the jury had been right. On the evidence before them, they could
  have found no other verdict. He had no complaint against them. No one could
  have guessed that all the evidence was false and illusory. From which it
  followed that he must go through life stamped as a convicted thief, and as
  such could never be a possible husband for Alice Bentley.</p>

  <p>But he realized very clearly that Alice, certain as she was of his
  innocence, would utterly refuse to accept this view. To her he was a martyr,
  and as such she would proclaim him before all the world. On his release, she
  would insist on the restoration of the status quo ante. Of that he felt
  certain; and hour after hour, in his abundant solitude, he sought vainly a
  solution of the problem. How should he meet her demand? Letters he knew would
  be useless. She would wait for the day of his release, and then&mdash;The
  prospect of having, after all, to refuse her love, to repudiate her loyalty,
  was one that wrung his heart to contemplate.</p>

  <p>And then, in the most unforeseen way, the problem was solved. His escape
  from the gang was totally unpremeditated. He just saw a chance, when the
  attention of the civil guard was relaxed, and took it instantly. When he
  found the absent bather's clothes upon the shore and hastily assumed them in
  place of his prison suit, he suspected that the bather was already dead, and
  the report which he read in the next day's paper confirmed this belief. But
  during the next few weeks, as he tramped across country to
  Liverpool&mdash;subsisting, not without qualms, on the little money that he
  had found in the unknown bather's pockets, eked out by an occasional odd
  job&mdash;he watched the papers eagerly for further news. For six long weeks
  he found nothing either to alarm or reassure him. Indeed, it was not until he
  had secured a job as deck-hand on an American tramp steamer and was on the
  point of departure that he learned the welcome tidings. On the very night
  before the ship was due to sail, he was sitting in the forecastle, watching
  an evening paper that was passing round from hand to hand, when the man who
  was reading it held it towards him, pointing with a grimy forefinger to a
  particular paragraph.</p>

  <p>"I call that damned hard luck, I do," said he. "Just you read it, mate,
  and see what you think of it."</p>

  <p>Jeffrey took the paper, and, glancing at the indicated paragraph, suddenly
  sat up with a start. It was the report of an inquest on the body of a man who
  had been found drowned; which body had been identified as that of Jeffrey
  Brandon, a convict who had recently escaped from Colport Gaol. He read it
  through slowly, and then, with an inarticulate mumble, handed the paper back
  to his sympathetic messmate. For some minutes he sat dazed, hardly able to
  realize this sudden change in his condition. That the bather's body would,
  sooner or later, be found he had never doubted. But he had expected that the
  finding of it and its identification would solve the mystery of his escape
  and immediately give rise to a hue and cry. Never had he dreamed that the
  body could be identified as his.</p>

  <p>But now that this incredible thing had happened, he would be simply
  written off and forgotten. He was free. And not only was he free; Alice was
  free too. Now he would quietly pass out of her life without bitterness or
  misunderstanding; not forgotten, indeed, but cherished only, in the years to
  come, with loving remembrance.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, when at daybreak on the morrow the good ship Potomac of New
  Orleans crossed the Mersey bar, the new deck-hand, Joe Watson, looked back at
  the receding land with a heavy heart and a moistening eye. The world was all
  before him. But it was an empty world. All that could make life gracious and
  desirable was slipping away farther with each turn of the propeller, and a
  waste of waters was stretching out between him and his heart's desire.</p>

  <p>His life in America need not be followed in detail. He was of the type
  that almost inevitably prospers in that country. Energetic, industrious,
  handy, ready to put his heart into any job that offered; an excellent
  accountant with a sound knowledge of banking business and general finance, he
  was not long in finding a position in which he could prove his worth. And he
  had undeniably good luck. Within a year of his landing, almost penniless, he
  had managed, by hard work and the most drastic economy, to scrape together a
  tiny nest-egg of capital. Then he met with a young American, nearly as poor
  as himself but of the stuff of which millionaires are made; a man of
  inexhaustible energy, quick, shrewd and resolute, and possessed by a
  devouring ambition to be rich. But notwithstanding his avidity for wealth,
  Joseph Walden was singularly free from the vices of his class. He looked to
  become rich by work, good management, thrift, and a reputation for straight
  dealing. He was a man of strict integrity, and, if a little blunt and
  outspoken, was still a good friend and a pleasant companion.</p>

  <p>With his shrewd judgment, Walden saw at once that his new friend would
  make an ideal collaborator in a business venture. Each had special
  qualifications that the other lacked, and the two together would form a
  highly efficient combination. Accordingly the two young men pooled forces and
  embarked under the style and title of the Walden Pottermack Company. (Jeffrey
  had abandoned the name of Joe Watson on coming ashore, and, moved by some
  whimsical sentiment, had adopted as his godparent the ship which had carried
  him away to freedom and the new life. With a slight variation of spelling, he
  was now Marcus Pottermack.)</p>

  <p>For some time the new firm struggled on under all the difficulties that
  attend insufficient capital. But the two partners held together in absolute
  unison. They neglected no chances, they spared no effort, they accepted
  willingly the barest profits, and they practised thrift to the point of
  penury. And slowly the tension of poverty relaxed. The little snowball of
  their capital began to grow, imperceptibly at first, but then with a
  constantly increasing acceleration&mdash;for wealth, like population, tends
  to increase by geometrical progression. In a year or two the struggles were
  over and the company was a well-established concern. A few more years and the
  snowball had rolled up to quite impressive dimensions. The Walden Pottermack
  Company had become a leading business house, and the partners men of
  respectable substance.</p>

  <p>It was at this point that the difference between the two men began to make
  itself apparent. To the American, the established prosperity of the firm
  meant the attainment of the threshold of big business with the prospect of
  really big money. His fixed intention was to push the success for all that it
  was worth, to march on to greater and yet greater things, even unto
  millionairedom. Pottermack, on the other hand, began to feel that he had
  enough. Great wealth held out no allurements for him. Nor did he, like
  Walden, enjoy the sport of winning and piling it up. At first he had worked
  hard for a mere livelihood, then for a competence that should presently
  enable him to live his own life. And now, as he counted up his savings, it
  seemed to him that he had achieved his end. With what he had he could
  purchase all that he desired and that was purchasable.</p>

  <p>It was not purchasable in America. Grateful as he was to the country that
  had sheltered him and taken him to her heart as one of her own sons, yet he
  found himself from time to time turning a wistful eye towards the land beyond
  the great ocean. More and more, as the time went on, he was conscious of a
  hankering for things that America could not give; for the sweet English
  countryside, the immemorial villages with their ancient churches, their
  oast-houses and thatched barns, for all the lingering remains of an older
  civilization.</p>

  <p>And there was another element of unrest. All through the years the image
  of Alice had never ceased to haunt him. At first it was but as the cherished
  memory of a loved one who had died and passed out of his life for ever. But
  as the years ran on there came a subtle change. Gradually he began to think
  of their separation, not as something final and irretrievable but as
  admitting in a vague and shadowy way of the idea of reunion this side of the
  grave. It was very nebulous and indefinite, but it clung to him persistently,
  and ever the idea grew more definite. The circumstances were, indeed, changed
  utterly. When he left her, he was a convict, infamous in the eyes of all the
  world. But the convict, Jeffrey Brandon, was dead and forgotten, whereas he,
  Marcus Pottermack, was a man of position and repute. The case was entirely
  altered.</p>

  <p>So he would argue with himself in moments of expansiveness. And then he
  would cast away his dreams, chiding himself for his folly and telling himself
  that doubtless, she had long since married and settled down that dead he was
  and dead he must remain, and not seek to rise again like some unquiet spirit
  to trouble the living.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the leaven continued to work, and the end of it was that Mr.
  Pottermack wound up his business affairs and made arrangements for his
  retirement. His partner regretfully agreed to take over his interest in the
  company&mdash;which he did on terms that were not merely just but
  generous&mdash;and thus his commercial life came to an end. A week or two
  later he took his passage for England.</p>

  <p>Now, nebulous and shadowy as his ideas had been with reference to Alice,
  partaking rather of the nature of day-dreams than of thoughts implying any
  settled purpose, no sooner had he landed in the Old Country than he became
  possessed by a craving, at least to hear of her, to make certain that she was
  still alive, if possible to see her. He could not conceal from himself some
  faint hope that she might still be unmarried. And if she were&mdash;well,
  then it would be time for him to consider what he would do.</p>

  <p>His first proceeding was to establish himself in lodgings in the old
  neighbourhood, where he spent his days loitering about the streets that she
  had been used to frequent. On Sundays he attended the church with scrupulous
  regularity, modestly occupying a back seat and lingering in the porch as the
  congregation filed out. Many familiar faces he noted, changed more or less by
  the passage of time; but no one recognized in the grey-haired, bearded,
  spectacled stranger the handsome youth whom they had known in the years gone
  by. Indeed, how should they, when that youth had died, cut off in the midst
  of his career of crime?</p>

  <p>He would have liked to make some discreet enquiries, but no enquiries
  would have been discreet. Above all things, it was necessary for him to
  preserve his character as a stranger from America. And so he could do no more
  than keep his vigil in the streets and at the church, watching with hungry
  eyes for the beloved face&mdash;and watching in vain.</p>

  <p>And then at last, after weeks of patient searching with ever-dwindling
  hope, he had his reward. It was on Easter Sunday, a day which had, in old
  times, been kept as the chief musical festival of the year. Apparently the
  custom was still maintained, for the church was unusually full and there was
  evidently a special choir. Mr. Pottermack's hopes revived, though he braced
  himself for another disappointment. Surely, he thought, if she ever comes to
  this church, she will come to-day.</p>

  <p>And this time he was not disappointed. He had not long been seated on the
  modest bench near the door when a woman, soberly dressed in black, entered
  and walked past him up the aisle, where she paused for a few moments looking
  about her somewhat with the air of a stranger. He knew her in a moment by her
  figure, her gait, and the poise of her head. But if he had had any doubt, it
  would have been instantly dispelled when she entered a pew, and, before
  sitting down, glanced back quickly at the people behind her.</p>

  <p>For Pottermack it was a tremendous moment. It was as if he were looking on
  the face of one risen from the dead. For some minutes after she had sat down
  and become hidden from his sight by the people behind her he felt dazed and
  half-incredulous of the wonderful vision that he had seen. But as the effects
  of the shock passed, he began to consider the present position. That single
  instantaneous glance had shown him that she had aged a little more than the
  lapse of time accounted for. She looked graver than of old, perhaps even a
  thought sombre, and something matronly and middle-aged in the fashion of her
  dress made disquieting suggestions.</p>

  <p>When the long service was ended, Pottermack waited on his bench watching
  her come down the aisle and noting that she neither spoke to nor seemed to
  recognize any one. As soon as she had passed his bench, he rose and joined
  the throng behind her. His intention was to follow her and discover, if
  possible, where she lived. But as they came into the crowded porch he heard
  an elderly woman exclaim in a markedly loud tone:</p>

  <p>"Why, surely it is Miss Bentley!"</p>

  <p>"Yes," was the reply in the well-remembered voice. "At least, I was Miss
  Bentley when you knew me. Nowadays I am Mrs. Bellard."</p>

  <p>Pottermack, standing close behind her and staring at a notice-board, drew
  a deep breath. Only in that moment of bitter disappointment did he realize
  how much he had hoped.</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," said the loud-spoken woman. "Mrs. Bennett&mdash;it was
  Bennett that you said?"</p>

  <p>"No, Bellard&mdash;B.e.l.l.a.r.d."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Bellard. Yes. And so you are married. I have often wondered what
  became of you when you stopped coming to the church after&mdash;er&mdash;all
  those years ago. I hope your good husband is well."</p>

  <p>"I lost my husband four years ago," Mrs. Bellard replied in a somewhat
  dry, matter-of-fact tone.</p>

  <p>Pottermack's heart gave a bound and he listened harder than ever.</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear!" exclaimed the other woman. "What a dreadfully sad thing! And
  are there any children?"</p>

  <p>"No; no children."</p>

  <p>"Ah, indeed. But perhaps it is as well, though it must be lonely for you.
  Are you living in London?"</p>

  <p>"No," replied Mrs. Bellard, "I have only just come up for the week-end. I
  live at Borley in Buckinghamshire&mdash;not far from Aylesbury."</p>

  <p>"Do you? It must be frightfully dull for you living all alone right down
  in the country. I do hope you have found comfortable lodgings."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Bellard laughed softly. "You are pitying me more than you need, Mrs.
  Goodman. I am not dull at all, and I don't have to live in lodgings. I have a
  house to myself. It is only a very small one, but it is big enough and it is
  my own; so I am secure of a shelter for the rest of my life."</p>

  <p>Here the two women drifted out of distinct ear-shot, though their voices
  continued to be audible as they walked away, for they both spoke in raised
  tones, Mrs. Goodman being, apparently, a little dull of hearing. But
  Pottermack had heard enough. Drawing out his pocket-book, he carefully
  entered the name and the address, such as it was, glancing at the
  notice-board as if he were copying some particulars from it. Then he emerged
  from the porch and walked after the two women; and when they separated, he
  followed Mrs. Bellard at a discreet distance, not that he now had any
  curiosity as to her present place of abode, but merely that he might pleasure
  his eyes with the sight of her trim figure tripping youthfully along the dull
  suburban street.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack's joy and triumph were tempered with a certain curiosity,
  especially with regard to the late Mr. Bellard. But his cogitations were not
  permitted to hinder the necessary action. Having no time-table, it being
  Sunday, he made his way to Marylebone Station to get a list of the week-day
  trains; and at that station he presented himself on the following morning at
  an unearthly hour, suitcase in hand, to catch the first train to Borley.
  Arrived at the little town, he at once took a room at the Railway Inn, from
  whence he was able conveniently to issue forth and stroll down the station
  approach as each of the London trains came in.</p>

  <p>It was late in the afternoon when, among the small crowd of passengers who
  came out of the station, he saw her, stepping forward briskly and carrying a
  good-sized handbag. He turned, and, walking back slowly up the approach, let
  her pass him and draw a good distance ahead. He kept her in sight without
  difficulty in the sparsely peopled streets until, at the outskirts of the
  town, she turned into a quiet by-lane and disappeared. Thereupon he quickened
  his pace and entered the lane just in time to see her opening the garden gate
  of a pleasant-looking cottage, at the open door of which a youthful
  maidservant stood, greeting her with a welcoming grin. Pottermack walked
  slowly past the little house, noting the name, "Lavender Cottage," painted on
  the gate, and went on to the top of the lane, where he turned and retraced
  his steps, indulging himself as he passed the second time with a long and
  approving look at the shrine which held the object of his worship.</p>

  <p>On his return to the inn he proceeded to make enquiries as to a reliable
  house-agent, in response to which he was given, not only the name of a
  recommended agent but certain other more valuable information. For the
  landlord, interested in a prospective new resident, was questioning
  Pottermack as to the class of house that he was seeking when the landlady
  interposed.</p>

  <p>"What about 'The Chestnuts,' Tom, where Colonel Barnett used to live?
  That's empty and for sale&mdash;been empty for months. And it's a good house
  though rather out-of-the-way. Perhaps that might suit this gentleman."</p>

  <p>Further details convinced Mr. Pottermack that it would, and the upshot was
  that on the very next day, after a careful inspection, the deposit was paid
  to the agents, Messrs. Hook and Walker, and a local solicitor was instructed
  to carry out the conveyance. Within a week the principal builder of the town
  had sent in his estimates for repairs and decoration, and Mr. Pottermack was
  wrestling with the problem of household furnishing amidst a veritable library
  of catalogues.</p>

  <p>But these activities did not distract him from his ultimate object.
  Realizing that, as a stranger to the town, his chance of getting a regular
  introduction to Mrs. Bellard was infinitely remote he decided to waive the
  conventions and take a short-cut. But the vital question was. Would she
  recognize him? It was a question that perplexed him profoundly and that he
  debated endlessly without reaching any conclusion. Of course, under normal
  circumstances there would be no question at all. Obviously, in spite of his
  beard, his spectacles, and his grey hair, she would recognize him instantly.
  But the circumstances were very far from normal. To her, he was a person who
  had died some fifteen years ago. And the news of his death would have come to
  her, not as a mere rumour or vague report, but as an ascertained fact. He had
  been found dead and identified by those who knew him well. She could never
  have had a moment's doubt that he was dead.</p>

  <p>How, then, would she react to the conflict between her knowledge and the
  evidence of her senses? Which of the two alternate possibilities would she
  accept? That a dead man might come to life again or that one human being
  might bear so miraculous a resemblance to another? He could form no opinion.
  But of one thing he felt confident. She would certainly be deeply impressed
  by the resemblance, and that state of mind would easily cover anything
  unconventional in the manner of their meeting.</p>

  <p>His plan was simple to crudeness. At odd times, in the intervals of his
  labours, he made it his business to pass the entrance of the
  lane&mdash;Malthouse Lane was its name&mdash;from whence he could see her
  house. For several days no opportunity presented itself. But one morning, a
  little more than a week after his arrival, on glancing up the lane, he
  perceived a manifestly feminine hat above the shrubs in her garden. Thereupon
  he turned boldly into the little thoroughfare and walked on until he was
  opposite the cottage, when he could see her, equipped with gardening gloves
  and a rather juvenile fork, tidying up the borders. Unobserved by her, he
  stepped up to the wooden palings, and, lifting his hat, enquired
  apologetically if she could inform him whether, if he followed the lane, he
  would come to the Aylesbury road.</p>

  <p>At the first sound of his voice she started up and gazed at him with an
  expression of the utmost astonishment; nor was her astonishment diminished
  when she looked at his face. For an appreciable time she stood quite still
  and rigid, with her eyes fixed on him and her lips parted as if she had seen
  a spectre. After an interval, Pottermack&mdash;who was more or less prepared,
  though his heart was thumping almost audibly&mdash;repeated his question,
  with apologies for intruding on her; whereupon, recovering herself with an
  effort, she came across to the palings and began to give him some directions
  in a breathless, agitated voice, while the gloved hand that she rested on the
  palings trembled visibly.</p>

  <p>Pottermack listened deferentially and then ventured to explain his
  position: that he was a stranger, about to settle in the district and anxious
  to make himself acquainted with his new surroundings. As this was received
  quite graciously, he went on to comment in admiring terms on the appearance
  of the cottage and its happy situation in this pleasant leafy lane. Through
  this channel they drifted into amicable conversation concerning the town and
  the surrounding country, and as they talked&mdash;Pottermack designedly
  keeping his face partially turned away from her&mdash;she continued to watch
  him with a devouring gaze and with a curious expression of bewilderment and
  incredulity mingled with something reminiscent, far away and dreamy. Finally,
  encouraged by his success, Pottermack proceeded to expound the embryonic
  state of his household, and enquired if by any chance she happened to know of
  a reliable middle-aged woman who would take charge of it.</p>

  <p>"How many are you in family?" Mrs. Bellard asked with ill-concealed
  eagerness.</p>

  <p>"My entire family," he replied, "is covered by one rather shabby hat."</p>

  <p>"Then you ought to have no difficulty in finding a housekeeper. I do, in
  fact," she continued, "know of a woman who might suit you, a middle-aged
  widow named Gadby&mdash;quite a Dickens name, isn't it? I know very little
  about her abilities, but I do know that she is a pleasant, good-natured, and
  highly respectable woman. If you like, and will give me your address, I will
  send her to see you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack jumped at the offer, and having written down his name and
  his address at the inn (at the former of which she glanced with eager
  curiosity) he thanked her warmly, and, wishing her good-morning with a
  flourish of the shabby hat, went on his way rejoicing. That same evening,
  Mrs. Gadby called at the inn and was promptly engaged; and a very fortunate
  transaction the engagement proved. For, not only did she turn out to be an
  incomparable servant, but she constituted herself a link between her employer
  and her patroness. Not that the link was extremely necessary, for whenever
  Pottermack chanced to meet Mrs. Bellard&mdash;and it was surprising how often
  it happened&mdash;she greeted him frankly as an acknowledged acquaintance; so
  that gradually&mdash;and not so very gradually either&mdash;their footing as
  acquaintances ripened into that of friends. And so, as the weeks passed and
  their friendship grew up into a pleasant, sympathetic intimacy, Mr.
  Pottermack felt that all was going well and that the time was at hand when he
  should collect some of the arrears that were outstanding in his account with
  Fortune.</p>

  <p>But Fortune had not done with him yet. The card that she held up her
  sleeve was played a few weeks after he had entered into occupation of his new
  house and was beginning to be comfortably settled. He was standing by the
  counter of a shop where he had made some purchases when he became aware of
  some person standing behind him and somewhat to his left. He could not see
  the person excepting as a vague shadow, but he had the feeling that he was
  being closely scrutinized. It was not a pleasant feeling, for, altered as he
  was, some inopportune recognition was always possible; and when the person
  moved from the left side to the right, Mr. Pottermack began to grow
  distinctly apprehensive. His right ear bore a little purple birthmark that
  was highly distinctive, and the movement of the unknown observer associated
  itself very disagreeably in his mind with this mark. After enduring the
  scrutiny for some time with growing uneasiness, he turned and glanced at the
  face of the scrutinizer. Then he received a very distinct shock, but at the
  same time was a little reassured. For the stranger was not a stranger at all,
  but his old friend and fellow-clerk, James Lewson.</p>

  <p>Involuntarily his face must have given some sign of recognition, but this
  he instantly suppressed. He had no fear of his old friend, but still, he had
  renounced his old identity and had no intention of acknowledging it. He had
  entered on a new life with a new personality. Accordingly, after a brief
  glance, as indifferent as he could make it, he turned back to the counter and
  concluded his business. And Lewson, for his part, made no outward sign of
  recognition, so that Pottermack began to hope that he had merely noticed an
  odd resemblance, without any suspicion of actual identity. After all, that
  was what one would expect, seeing that the Jeffrey Brandon whom he resembled
  had been dead nearly fifteen years.</p>

  <p>But when he left the shop and went his way through the streets on other
  business, he soon discovered that Lewson was shadowing him closely. Once or
  twice he put the matter to the test by doubling back or darting through
  obscure passages and by-ways; and when he still found Lewson doggedly
  clinging to his skirts, he had to accept the conviction that he had been
  recognized and deal with the position to the best of his discretion.
  Accordingly, he made straight for home; but instead of entering by the front
  door, he took the path that skirted the long wall of his garden and let
  himself in by the small side gate, which he left unlatched behind him. A
  minute later, Lewson pushed it open and looked in then, seeing that the
  garden was unoccupied save by Pottermack, he entered and shut the gate.</p>

  <p>"Well, Jeff," he said genially, as he faced Pottermack, "so here you are.
  A brand&mdash;or shall we say a Brandon&mdash;snatched from the burning. I
  always wondered if you had managed to do a mizzle, you are such an uncommonly
  downy bird."</p>

  <p>Pottermack made a last, despairing effort. "Pardon me," said he, "but I
  fancy you must be mistaking me for&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, rats," interrupted Lewson. "Won't do, old chap. Besides, I saw that
  you recognized me. No use pretending that you don't know your old pal, and
  certainly no use pretending that he doesn't know you."</p>

  <p>Pottermack realised the unwelcome truth and, like a wise man, bowed to the
  inevitable.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it isn't," he admitted, "and, for that matter, I don't know
  that there is any reason why I should. But you will understand
  that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I understand well enough," said Lewson. "Don't imagine that I am
  offended. Naturally you are not out for digging up your old acquaintances,
  especially as you seem to have feathered your nest pretty well. Where have
  you been all these years?"</p>

  <p>"In the States. I only came back a few weeks ago."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you'd have been wiser to stay there. But I suppose you made a pile
  and have come home to spend it."</p>

  <p>"Well, hardly a pile," said Pottermack, "but I have saved enough to live
  on in a quiet way. I am not expensive in my habits."</p>

  <p>"Lucky beggar!" said Lewson, glancing around with greedy eyes. "Is this
  your own place?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have just bought it and moved in. Got it remarkably cheap,
  too."</p>

  <p>"Did you? Well, I say again, lucky beggar. It's quite a lordly little
  estate."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am very pleased with it. There's a good house and quite a lot of
  land, as you see. I hope to live very comfortably here."</p>

  <p>"You ought to, if you don't get blown on; and you never need be if you are
  a wise man."</p>

  <p>"No, I hope not," said Pottermack, a little uneasily. He had been looking
  at his old friend and was disagreeably impressed by the change that the years
  had wrought. He was by no means happy to know that his secret was shared with
  this unprepossessing stranger&mdash;for such he, virtually, was. But still he
  was totally unprepared for what was to follow.</p>

  <p>"It was a lucky chance for me," remarked Lewson, "that I happened to drop
  in at that shop. Best morning's work that I have done for a long time."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" said Pottermack, looking a little puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I reckon that chance was worth a thousand pounds to me."</p>

  <p>"Was it really? I don't quite see how."</p>

  <p>"Don't you?" demanded Lewson, with a sudden change of manner. "Then I'll
  explain. I presume you don't want the Scotland Yard people to know that you
  are alive and living here like a lord?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally I don't."</p>

  <p>"Of course you don't. And if you show a proper and liberal spirit towards
  your old pal, they are never likely to know."</p>

  <p>"But," gasped Pottermack, "I don't think I quite understand what you
  mean."</p>

  <p>"You are devilish thick-headed if you don't," said Lewson. "Then I'll put
  in a nutshell. You hand me over a thousand pounds and I give you a solemn
  undertaking to keep my mouth shut for ever."</p>

  <p>"And if I don't?"</p>

  <p>"Then I hop off to Scotland Yard and earn a small gratuity by giving them
  the straight tip."</p>

  <p>Pottermack recoiled from him in horror. He was thunderstruck. It was
  appalling to find that this man, whom he had known as an apparently decent
  youth, had sunk so low. He had actually descended to blackmail&mdash;the
  lowest, the meanest, and the shabbiest of crimes. But it was not the
  blackmail alone that filled Pottermack's soul with loathing of the wretch who
  stood before him. In the moment in which Lewson made his demand, Pottermack
  knew the name of the villain who had forged those cheques and had set the
  dastardly trap in which he, Pottermack, was, in effect, still held.</p>

  <p>For some moments he was too much shocked to reply. When at length he did,
  it was merely to settle the terms of the transaction. He had no choice. He
  realized that this was no empty threat. The gleam of malice in Lewson's eye
  was unmistakable. It expressed the inveterate hatred that a thoroughly base
  man feels towards one on whom he has inflicted an unforgivable injury.</p>

  <p>"Will a crossed cheque do for you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord! no!" was the reply; "nor an open one either. No cheques for
  me. Hard cash is what I should prefer, but as that might be difficult to
  manage I'll take it in notes&mdash;five-pound notes."</p>

  <p>"What, a thousand pounds!" exclaimed Pottermack. "What on earth will the
  people at the bank think?"</p>

  <p>Lewson sniggered. "What would they think, old chap, if I turned up with an
  open cheque for a thousand pounds? Wouldn't they take an interest in the
  endorsement? No, dear boy, you get the notes&mdash;fivers, mind. They know
  you. And look here. Jeff. This is a strictly private transaction. Neither of
  us wants it to leak out. It will be much safer for us both if we remain
  tee-total strangers. If we should meet anywhere, you needn't take off your
  hat. I shan't. We don't know one another. I don't even know your name. By the
  way, what is your name?"</p>

  <p>"Marcus Pottermack."</p>

  <p>"God, what a name! However, I'll forget it if I can. You agree with
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," replied Pottermack with unmistakable sincerity. "But where
  and how am I to hand you over the money?"</p>

  <p>"I was coming to that," said Lewson. "I will come along here and collect
  it on Thursday night&mdash;that will give you time to get the notes. I shall
  come after dark, about nine o'clock. You had better leave this gate
  unlatched, and then, if I see that the coast is clear, I can pop in
  unobserved. Will that do?"</p>

  <p>Pottermack nodded. "But there is one thing more, Lewson," said he. "This
  is a single, final transaction. I pay you a thousand pounds to purchase your
  silence and secrecy for ever!"</p>

  <p>"That is so. In saecula saeculorum."</p>

  <p>"There will be no further demands?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Lewson replied indignantly. "Do you think I don't know
  what a square deal is? I've given you my solemn promise and you can trust me
  to keep it."</p>

  <p>Pottermack pursued the matter no farther; and as the calamitous business
  was now concluded, he softly opened the gate, and, having ascertained that no
  one was in sight, he let his visitor out and watched the big burly figure
  swaggering townwards along the little path that bordered his wall.</p>

  <p>Closing the gate, he turned back into the garden, his heart filled with
  bitterness and despair. His dream was at an end. Never, while this
  horse-leech hung on to him, could he ask Alice Bellard to be his wife. For
  his prophetic soul told him only too truly that this was but a beginning;
  that the blackmailer would come again and again and yet again, always to go
  away still holding the thing that he had sold.</p>

  <p>And so it befell; and so the pitiless extortion might have gone on to its
  end in the ruin and impoverishment of the victim but for the timely
  appearance of the sundial in Mr. Gallett's yard.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XI&mdash;MR. POTTERMACK'S DILEMMA</h3>

  <p>The sound of the piano faded away in a gradual diminuendo and at last
  stopped. A brief interval of silence followed.</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Pottermack, withdrawing his gaze from the infinite distance
  beyond the garden, turned to look at his hostess and found her regarding him
  with a slightly quizzical smile.</p>

  <p>"You haven't lit your pipe after all, Mr. Pottermack," said she.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied. "My savage breast was so effectually soothed by your
  music that tobacco would have been superfluous. Besides, my pipe would have
  gone out. It always does when my attention is very completely occupied."</p>

  <p>"And was it? I almost thought you were dozing."</p>

  <p>"I was dreaming," said he; "day-dreaming; but wide awake and listening. It
  is curious," he continued after a pause, "what power music has to awaken
  associations. There is nothing like it, excepting, perhaps, scents. Music and
  odours, things utterly unlike anything but themselves, seem to have a power
  of arousing dormant memories that is quite lacking in representative things
  such as pictures and statues."</p>

  <p>"So it would seem," said Mrs. Bellard, "that I have been, in a fashion,
  performing the function of an opium pipe in successful competition with the
  tobacco article. But it is too late to mend matters now. I can hear Anne
  approaching with the tea-things."</p>

  <p>Almost as she spoke, the door opened and the maid entered, carrying a tray
  with anxious care, and proceeded to set out the tea-things with the manner of
  one performing a solemn rite. When she had gone and the tea was poured out,
  Mrs. Bellard resumed the conversation.</p>

  <p>"I began to think you had struck me off your visiting list. What have you
  been doing with yourself all this time?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Pottermack replied evasively&mdash;for, obviously, he could not go
  into details&mdash;"I have been a good deal occupied. There have been a lot
  of things to do; the sun-dial, for instance. I told you about the sun-dial,
  didn't I?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but that was a long time ago. You said you were going to show it to
  me when it was set up, but you never have. You haven't even shown it to Mrs.
  Gadby. She is quite hurt about it."</p>

  <p>"Dear me'" exclaimed Mr. Pottermack; "how self-centred we old bachelors
  get! But this neglect must be remedied at once. When can you come and see it?
  Could you come round and have tea with me tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I should like to; but I can't come very early. Will a quarter to
  five do?"</p>

  <p>"Of course it will. We can have tea first and then make a leisurely survey
  of the sun-dial and the various other things that I have to show you."</p>

  <p>Thus the arrangement was made, very much to Mr. Pottermack's satisfaction,
  for it enabled him to postpone to the morrow a certain very momentous
  question which he had thought of raising this very afternoon, but which now
  appeared a little inopportune. For a delicate question must be approached
  cautiously through suitable channels, and no such means of approach had
  presented themselves or seemed likely to. Accordingly, relieved of the
  necessity of looking for an opening, Mr. Pottermack was able to give his
  whole attention to making himself agreeable, and eventually took his
  departure in the best of spirits, looking forward with confidence to the
  prospects of the morrow.</p>

  <p>The tea, as arranged by Mrs. Gadby in the pleasant dining-room of "The
  Chestnuts," was a triumphant success. It would have been an even greater
  success if the fair visitor had happened to have been on short commons for
  the preceding week. But the preposterous abundance at least furnished the
  occasion of mirth, besides serving as an outlet for Mrs. Gadby's feelings of
  regard and admiration towards the guest and a demonstration of welcome.</p>

  <p>"It is really very nice of her," said Mrs. Bellard, glancing smilingly
  round the loaded table, "and tactful too. It is a compliment to us both. It
  implies that she has cause to be grateful to me for introducing her here, and
  you are that cause. I expect she has a pretty comfortable time."</p>

  <p>"I hope so," said Pottermack. "I have, thanks to her and to you. And she
  keeps the house in the most perfect order. Would you like to look over it
  presently?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally I should. Did you ever meet a woman who was not devoured by
  curiosity in regard to a bachelor's household arrangements? But I am really
  more interested in the part of the premises that is outside Mrs. Gadby's
  domain; the part that reflects your own personality. I want especially to see
  your workshop. Am I to be allowed to?"</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly you are; in fact, if we have finished, as it seems we have,
  you shall be introduced to it forthwith."</p>

  <p>They rose, and, passing out at the back door, walked together up the long
  path through the kitchen garden and orchard until they came to the gate of
  the walled garden, which Pottermack unlocked with his Yale key.</p>

  <p>"This is very impressive and mysterious," said Mrs. Bellard as the gate
  closed and the spring-latch snapped. "I am quite proud to be admitted into
  this holy of holies. It is a delightful garden," she continued, letting her
  eyes travel round the great oblong enclosure, "so perfectly peaceful and
  quiet and remote. Here one is cut off from all the world, which is rather
  restful at times."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack agreed, and reflected that the present was one of those
  times. "When I want to be alone," he remarked, "I like to be definitely alone
  and secure from interruption."</p>

  <p>"Well, you are secure enough here, shut in from the sight of any human
  eye. Why, you might commit a murder and no one would be any the wiser."</p>

  <p>"So I might," agreed Mr. Pottermack, rather taken aback. "I hadn't thought
  of that advantage, and, of course, you understand that the place wasn't laid
  out with that purpose in view. What do you think of the sun-dial?"</p>

  <p>"I was just looking at it and thinking what a charming finish it gives to
  the garden. It is delightful, and will be still more so when the new stone
  has weathered down to the tone of the old. And I think you told me that there
  is a well underneath. That adds a sort of deliciously horrible interest to
  it."</p>

  <p>"Why horrible?" Pottermack enquired uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't you think wells are rather gruesome things? I do. There is one
  in my garden, and it gives me the creeps whenever I lower the bucket and
  watch it sinking down, down that black hole and vanishing into the bowels of
  the earth."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Pottermack, "I have that feeling myself. Probably most
  town-bred people have. And they are really rather dangerous, especially when
  they are unguarded as this one was. That was why I took the opportunity to
  cover it up."</p>

  <p>By this time they were close up to the dial, and Mrs. Bellard walked round
  it to read the motto. "Why do they always write these things in Latin?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Partly for the sake of brevity," he replied. "Here are five Latin words.
  The equivalent in English is: 'At the rising of the sun, hope: at the going
  down thereof, peace.'"</p>

  <p>"It is a beautiful motto," she said, looking wistfully and a little sadly
  at the stone pillar. "The first part is what we all know by experience; the
  second is what we pray for to compensate us for the sorrows and
  disillusionments of the years that come between. But now let us go and look
  at the workshop."</p>

  <p>Pottermack conducted her behind the yew hedge into the range of
  well-lighted workrooms, where he exhibited, not without a touch of pride, his
  very complete outfit. But the fair widow's enthusiastic interest in the tools
  and appliances rather surprised him; for women are apt to look on the
  instruments of masculine handicraft with a slightly supercilious eye. No
  general survey satisfied her. He had to display his "plant" in detail and
  explain and demonstrate the use of each appliance: the joiner's bench with
  its quick-grip vice; the metalwork bench with its anvil and stakes and the
  big brazing-jet; the miniature forge, the lathe, the emery-wheel, and the
  bench-drill. She examined them all with the closest attention and with a
  singularly intelligent grasp of their purposes and modes of action.
  Pottermack became so absorbed in the pleasure of exhibiting his treasures
  that, for the moment, he almost forgot his main purpose.</p>

  <p>"I am glad I have seen the place where you work," she said, as they came
  out into the garden. "Now I can picture you to myself among your workshop
  gods, busy and happy. You are happy when you are working there, aren't
  you?"</p>

  <p>She asked the question with so much concern that Pottermack was fain to
  reply:</p>

  <p>"Every workman, I think, is happy when he is working. Of course, I mean a
  skilled man, working with his hands and his brain, creating something, even
  if it is only a simple thing. Yes, I am happy when I am doing a job,
  especially if it is a little difficult."</p>

  <p>"I understand; for a little extra planning and thought. But are you, in
  general, a happy man? Do you find life pleasant? You always seem very
  cheerful and yet sometimes I wonder if you really enjoy life."</p>

  <p>Pottermack reflected a few moments. "You are thinking," said he, "of my
  solitary and apparently friendless state, though I am not friendless at all,
  seeing that I have you&mdash;the dearest and kindest friend that a man could
  wish for. But in a sense you are right. My life is an incomplete affair, and
  these activities of mine, pleasant as they are, serve but as makeshifts to
  fill a blank. But it could easily be made complete. A word from you would be
  enough. If you were my wife there would be nothing left in the world for me
  to covet. I should be a perfectly happy man."</p>

  <p>He paused and looked at her, and was a little disconcerted to see that her
  eyes had filled and that she was looking down with an evident expression of
  distress. As she made no answer, he continued, more eagerly:</p>

  <p>"Why should it not be, Alice? We are the very best of friends&mdash;really
  devoted and affectionate friends. We like the same things and the same ways
  of life. We have the same interests, the same pleasures. We should try to
  make one another happy, and I am sure we should succeed. Won't you say the
  word, dear, and let us join hands to go our ways together for the rest of our
  lives?"</p>

  <p>She turned and looked in his face with brimming eyes and laid her hand on
  his arm.</p>

  <p>"Dear friend," she said, "dearest Marcus, I would say yes, joyfully,
  thankfully, if only it were possible. I have given you my friendship, my most
  loving friendship, and that is all I have to give. It is impossible for me to
  be your wife."</p>

  <p>Pottermack gazed at her in dismay. "But," he asked huskily, "why is it
  impossible? What hinders?"</p>

  <p>"My husband hinders," she replied in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"Your husband!" gasped Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"Yes. You have believed, as every one here believes, that I am a widow. I
  am not. My husband is still alive. I cannot and will not live with him or
  even acknowledge him. But he lives, to inflict one more injury on me by
  standing between you and me. Come," she continued, as Pottermack, numb with
  amazement, gazed at her in silence, "let us go and sit down in the
  summer-house and I will tell you the whole pitiful story."</p>

  <p>She walked across the lawn, and Pottermack accompanied her with
  half-unconscious reluctance. Since that fatal night he had made little use of
  the summer-house. Its associations repelled him. Even now he would, by
  choice, have avoided it; and it was with a certain vague discomfort that he
  saw his beloved friend seat herself in the chair that had stood vacant since
  that night when Lewson had sat in it.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you my story," she began, "from the time when I was a girl,
  or perhaps I should say a young woman. At that time I was engaged to a young
  man named Jeffrey Brandon. We were devotedly attached to each other. As to
  Jeffrey, I need say no more than that you are&mdash;allowing forthe
  difference of age&mdash;quite extraordinarily like him; like in features, in
  voice, in tastes, and in nature. If Jeffrey had been alive now, he would have
  been exactly like you. That is what attracted me to you from the first.</p>

  <p>"We were extremely happy&mdash;perfectly happy&mdash;in our mutual
  affection, and we were all-sufficient to one another. I thought myself the
  most fortunate of girls, and so I was; for we were only waiting until I
  should come into a small property that was likely to fall to me shortly, when
  we should have had enough to marry upon comfortably. And then, in a moment,
  our happiness was shattered utterly. A most dreadful thing happened. A series
  of forgeries was discovered at the bank where Jeffrey was employed. Suspicion
  was made to fall upon him. He was prosecuted, convicted&mdash;on false
  evidence, of course&mdash;and sentenced to a term of penal servitude.</p>

  <p>"As soon as he was convicted, he formally released me from our engagement,
  but I need not say that I had no intention of giving him up. However, the
  question never arose. Poor Jeffrey escaped from prison, and in trying to swim
  out to some ship in the river was drowned. Later, his body was recovered and
  taken to the prison, where an inquest was held. I went down, and by special
  permission attended the funeral and laid a wreath on the grave in the prison
  cemetery. And that was the end of my romance.</p>

  <p>"When Jeffrey died, I made up my mind that I was a spinster for life; and
  so I ought to have been. But things fell out otherwise. Besides me, Jeffrey
  had one intimate friend, a fellow-clerk at the bank named James Lewson. Of
  course, I knew him fairly intimately, and after Jeffrey's conviction I saw a
  good deal of him. Indeed, we became quite friendly&mdash;which we had hardly
  been before&mdash;by reason of the firm belief that he expressed in Jeffrey's
  innocence. Every one else took the poor boy's guilt for granted, so,
  naturally, I was drawn to the one loyal friend. Then, when Jeffrey died and
  was lost to me for ever, he took every opportunity of offering me comfort and
  consolation; and he did it so tactfully, was so filled with grief for our
  lost friend and so eager to talk of him and keep his memory green between us,
  that we became greater friends than ever.</p>

  <p>"After a time, his friendship took on a more affectionate and
  demonstrative character, and finally he asked me plainly to marry him. Of
  course, I said no; in fact, I was rather shocked at the proposal, for I still
  felt that I belonged to Jeffrey. But he was quietly persistent. He took no
  offence, but he did not pretend to accept my refusal as final. Especially he
  urged on me that Jeffrey would have wished that I should not be left to go
  through life alone, but that I should be cherished and protected by his own
  loyal and devoted friend.</p>

  <p>"Gradually his arguments overcame my repugnance to the idea of the
  marriage, though it was still distasteful to me, and when he asked for my
  consent as a recognition and reward of his loyalty to Jeffrey, I at last gave
  way. It appeared ungrateful to go on refusing him; and after all, nothing
  seemed to matter much now that Jeffrey was gone. The end of it was that we
  were married just before he started to take up an appointment in a branch of
  the bank at Leeds.</p>

  <p>"It was not long before the disillusionment came, and when it did come, I
  was astonished that I could have been so deceived. Very soon I began to
  realize that it was not love of me that had made him such a persistent
  suitor. It was the knowledge that he had gathered of the little fortune that
  was coming to me. His greediness for money was incredible; and yet he was
  utterly unable to hold it. It ran through his hands like water. He had a fair
  salary, but yet we were always poor and usually in debt. For he was an
  inveterate gambler&mdash;a gambler of that hopeless type that must inevitably
  lose. He usually did lose at once, for he was a reckless plunger, but if by
  chance he made a coup, he immediately plunged with his winnings and lost
  them. It was no wonder that he was always in difficulties.</p>

  <p>"When, at last, my little property came to me, he was deeply disappointed;
  for it was tied up securely in the form of a trust, and my uncle, who is a
  solicitor, was the managing trustee. And a very careful trustee he was, and
  not at all well impressed by my husband. James Lewson had hoped to get
  control of the entire capital, instead of which he had to apply to me for
  money when he was in difficulties and I had to manage my trustee as best I
  could. But in spite of this, most of the income that I received went to pay
  my husband's debts and losses.</p>

  <p>"Meanwhile our relations grew more and more unsatisfactory. The
  disappointment due to the trust, and the irritation at having to ask me for
  money and explain the reasons for his need of it, made him sullen and morose,
  and even, at times, coarsely abusive. But there was something more. From the
  first I had been dismayed at his freedom in the matter of drink. But the
  habit grew upon him rapidly, and it was in connection with this that the
  climax of our disagreement came about and led to our separation.</p>

  <p>"I understand that drink has different effects on different types of men.
  On James Lewson its effects began with the loss of all traces of refinement
  and a tendency to coarse facetiousness. The next stage was that of noisy
  swagger and boasting, and then he soon became quarrelsome and even brutal.
  There were one or two occasions when he threatened to become actually
  violent. Now it happened more than once that, when he had drunk himself into
  a state of boastful exaltation, he spoke of Jeffrey in a tone of such
  disrespect and even contempt that I had to leave the room to avoid an open,
  vulgar quarrel. But on the final occasion he went much farther. He began by
  jeering at my infatuation for 'that nincompoop,' as he called him, and when
  I, naturally, became furiously angry and was walking out of the room, he
  called me back, and, laughing in my face, actually boasted to me&mdash;to
  me!&mdash;that his was the master mind that had planned and carried out the
  forgeries and then set up 'that mug, Jeff,' as the man of straw for the
  lawyers to knock down.</p>

  <p>"I was absolutely thunderstruck. At first I thought that it was mere
  drunken fooling. But then he went on to give corroborative details, chuckling
  with idiotic self-complacency, until at last I realized that it was true;
  that this fuddled brute was the dastardly traitor who had sent my Jeffrey to
  his death.</p>

  <p>"Then I left him. At once I packed a small suitcase and went out and took
  a room at an hotel in the town. The next day I returned and had an interview
  with him. He was mightily flustered and apologetic. He remembered quite well
  what he had said, but tried to persuade me that it was a mere drunken joke
  and that it was all a fabrication, invented to annoy me. But I knew better.
  In the interval I had thought matters over, and I saw how perfectly his
  confession explained everything and agreed with what I now knew of him; his
  insatiable greed for money, his unscrupulousness, his wild gambling, and the
  reckless way in which he contracted debts. I brushed aside his explanations
  and denials and presented my ultimatum, of which the terms were these:</p>

  <p>"We should separate at once and completely, and henceforth be as total
  strangers, not recognizing one another if we should ever meet. I should take
  my mother's maiden name, Bellard, and assume the status of a widow. He should
  refrain from molesting me or claiming any sort of acquaintance or
  relationship with me.</p>

  <p>"If he agreed to these terms, I undertook to pay him a quarterly allowance
  and to take no action in respect of what I had learned. If he refused, I
  should instruct my uncle to commence proceedings to obtain a judicial
  separation and I should state in open court all that I knew. I should
  communicate these facts to the directors of the bank; and if, in my uncle's
  opinion, any prosecution were possible&mdash;for perjury or any other offence
  connected with the forgeries&mdash;I should instruct him to prosecute.</p>

  <p>"My ultimatum took him aback completely. At first he tried to bluster,
  then he became pathetic and tried to wheedle. But in the end, when he saw
  that I was not to be moved from my resolution, he gave way. I could see that
  my threats had scared him badly, though, in fact, I don't believe that I
  could have done anything. But perhaps he knew better. There may have been
  some other matters of which I had no knowledge. At any rate, he agreed, with
  the one stipulation, that the quarterly allowance should be paid in notes and
  not by a cheque.</p>

  <p>"As soon as I had settled the terms of the separation I moved to
  Aylesbury, where my mother's people had lived, and stayed there in lodgings
  while I looked for a small, cheap house. At length I found the cottage at
  Borley, and there I have lived ever since, as comfortably as my rather
  straitened means would let me. For, of course, the allowance has been rather
  a strain, though I have paid it cheerfully as the price of my freedom; and I
  may say that James Lewson has kept to the terms of our agreement with one
  exception&mdash;an exception that I expected. He has not been satisfied with
  the allowance. From time to time, and with increasing frequency, he has
  applied for loans&mdash;which, of course, meant gifts&mdash;to help him out
  of some temporary difficulty; and sometimes&mdash;but not always&mdash;I have
  been weak enough to supply him.</p>

  <p>"But I was not to be left completely in peace. When I had been settled in
  Borley for about a year, I received a letter from him informing me that 'by a
  strange coincidence' he had been appointed to the managership of the Borley
  branch of the bank. Of course, I knew that it was no coincidence at all. He
  had engineered the transfer himself."</p>

  <p>"With what object, do you suppose?" asked Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"It may have been mere malice," she replied, "just to cause me annoyance
  without breaking the terms of the agreement. But my impression is that it was
  done with the deliberate purpose of keeping me in a state of nervous unrest
  so that I should be the more easily prevailed on to comply with his
  applications for money. At any rate, those applications became more frequent
  and more urgent after he came to live here, and once he threw out a hint
  about calling at my house for an answer. But I put a stop to that at
  once."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever meet him in Borley?" Pottermack asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, once or twice. But I passed him in the street without a glance of
  recognition and he made no attempt to molest me. I think he had a wholesome
  fear of me. And, of course, I kept out of his way as much as I could. But it
  was an immense relief to me when he went away. You heard of his
  disappearance, I suppose? It was the talk of the town at the time."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," replied Pottermack. "My friend, Mr. Gallett, the mason, was the
  first to announce the discovery. But I little thought when I heard of it how
  much it meant to you&mdash;and to me. What do you suppose has become of
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I can't imagine. It is a most mysterious affair. There is no reason that
  I can think of why he should have absconded at all. I can only suppose that
  he had done something which he expected to be found out but which has not
  come to light. Perhaps the most mysterious thing about it is that he has
  never applied to me for money. He would know quite well that I should, at
  least have sent him his allowance, and that he could depend on me not to
  betray him, profoundly as I detest him."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack cogitated anxiously. He loathed the idea of deceiving this
  noble, loyal-hearted woman. Yet what could he do? He was committed
  irrevocably to a certain line of action, and in committing himself he had
  unconsciously committed her. He had embarked on a course of deception and had
  no choice but to follow it. And with regard to the future, he could honestly
  assure himself that whatever made for his happiness would make for hers.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he may have gone abroad?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It is impossible to say," she replied. "I have no reason to suppose he
  has, excepting his extraordinary silence."</p>

  <p>"It is even possible," Pottermack suggested in a slightly husky voice,
  "that he may be dead."</p>

  <p>"Yes," she admitted, "that is possible, and it would certainly account for
  his silence. But is it any use guessing?"</p>

  <p>"I was only thinking," said Pottermack, "that if he should happen to have
  died, that would&mdash;er&mdash;dispose of our difficulties."</p>

  <p>"Not unless we knew that he was dead. On the contrary. If he should have
  died and his death should remain undiscovered, or, what is the same thing, if
  he should have died without having been identified, then I should be bound to
  him beyond any possible hope of release."</p>

  <p>Pottermack drew a deep breath, and unconsciously his glance fell on the
  sun-dial.</p>

  <p>"But," he asked in a low tone, "if it should ever become known as an
  ascertained fact that he was dead? Then, dear Alice, would you say yes?"</p>

  <p>"But have I not said it already?" she exclaimed. "Did I not tell you that,
  if I were free, I would gladly, thankfully take you for my husband? Then, if
  that is not enough, I say it again. Not that it is of much use to say it,
  seeing that there is no reason to suppose that he is dead or likely to die. I
  only wish there were. It may sound callous to express such a wish, but it
  would be mere hypocrisy to pretend to any other feeling. He ruined poor
  Jeffrey's life and he has ruined mine."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that," Pottermack protested gently. "The sands of your
  life have yet a long time to run. There is still time for us both to salve
  some happy years from the wreckage of the past."</p>

  <p>"So there is," she agreed. "I was wrong. It is only a part of my life that
  has been utterly spoiled. And if you, too, have been through stormy
  weather&mdash;as I, somehow, think you have&mdash;we must join forces and
  help one another with the salvage work. But we shall have to be content to be
  friends, since marriage is out of our reach."</p>

  <p>"My dear," said Pottermack, "if you say that you would be willing to have
  me for your husband that is all I ask."</p>

  <p>They went forth from the summer-house and walked slowly, hand in hand,
  round the old garden; and Pottermack, anxious to conceal his bitter
  disappointment, chatted cheerfully about his fruit trees and the flowers that
  he meant to plant in the sunny borders. Very soon they seemed to be back on
  the old footing, only with a new note of affection and intimacy which made
  itself evident when Pottermack, with his hand on the latch of the gate, drew
  his companion to him and kissed her before they passed through together into
  the orchard.</p>

  <p>He walked with her back to the cottage and said good-bye at the little
  wooden gate.</p>

  <p>"I hope, dear," she whispered, as she held his hand for a moment, "that
  you are not very, very disappointed."</p>

  <p>"I am not thinking of disappointments," he replied cheerily. "I am
  gloating over the blessings that I enjoy already and hoping that Fortune may
  have something to add to them later on."</p>

  <p>But despite his assumed cheeriness of manner, Mr. Pottermack took his way
  homeward in a profoundly depressed state of mind. The dream of settled
  happiness that had haunted him for years, vague and unreal at first but ever
  growing more definite and vivid, had been shattered in the very moment when
  it seemed to have become a reality. He thought bitterly of the later years in
  America when his purpose of seeking his lost love had been forming, almost
  unrecognized by himself as a thing actually intended; of his long search in
  London with its ultimate triumph; of the patient pursuit of the beloved
  object to this place and the purchase of his house; of the long untiring
  effort, always bringing him nearer and nearer to success. And then, when he
  seemed to have conquered every difficulty, to have his treasure within his
  very grasp, behold an obstacle undreamed of and apparently insuperable.</p>

  <p>It was maddening; and the most exasperating feature of it was that the
  obstacle was of his own creating. Like most men who have committed a fatal
  blunder, Mr. Pottermack was impelled to chew the bitter cud of the
  might-have-been. If he had only known! How easy it would have been to arrange
  things suitably! Looking back, he now saw how unnecessary had been all that
  laborious business of the gutta-percha soles. It had been the result of mere
  panic. He could see that now. And he could have met the conditions so much
  more simply and satisfactorily. Supposing he had just made a few footprints
  in the soft earth leading to the well&mdash;he could have done that with the
  plaster casts&mdash;flung down the coat by the brink and gone out on the
  following morning and informed the police. There would have been no risk of
  suspicion. Why should there have been? He would have told a perfectly
  convincing story. He could have related how he had gone out in the evening,
  leaving his gate unlocked, had returned in the dark and found it ajar; had
  discovered in the morning strange footprints and a coat, suggesting that some
  stranger had strayed into the garden and, in the darkness, had fallen down
  the well. It would have been a perfectly natural and straightforward story.
  Nobody would have doubted it or connected him with the accident. Then the
  well would have been emptied, the body recovered and the incident closed for
  ever.</p>

  <p>As it was, the situation was one of exasperating irony. He was in a
  dilemma from which there seemed to be no escape. He alone, of all the world,
  knew that Alice Bellard was free to marry him; and that knowledge he must
  carry locked up in his breast for the remainder of his life.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XII&mdash;THE UNDERSTUDY</h3>

  <p>Readers who have followed this history to its present stage will have
  realized by this time that Mr. Pottermack was a gentleman of uncommon
  tenacity of purpose. To the weaker vessels the sudden appearance of an
  apparently insuperable obstacle is the occasion for abandoning hope and
  throwing up the sponge. But Mr. Pottermack was of a tougher fibre. To him a
  difficulty was not a matter for wringing of hands but for active search for a
  solution.</p>

  <p>Hence it happened that the black despair that enveloped and pervaded him
  after his proposal to Alice Bellard soon began to disperse under the
  influence of his natural resiliency. From profitless reflections on the
  might-have-been he turned to the consideration of the may-be. He began to
  examine the obstacle critically, not as a final extinguisher of his hopes,
  but as a problem to be dealt with.</p>

  <p>Now what did that problem amount to? He, Marcus Pottermack, desired to
  marry Alice Bellard. That had been the darling wish and purpose of his life
  and he had no intention of abandoning it. She, on her side, wished to marry
  him, but she believed that her husband was still alive. He, Pottermack, knew
  that the said husband was dead, but he could not disclose his knowledge. Yet
  until the fact of the husband's death was disclosed, the marriage was
  impossible and must remain so for ever. For there is this unsatisfactory
  peculiarity about a dead man: that it is hopeless to look forward to the
  possibility of his dying. Thus the problem, put in a nutshell, amounted to
  this: that James Lewson, being dead de facto, had got to be made dead de
  jure.</p>

  <p>But how was this to be done? It is hardly necessary to say that, at first,
  a number of wild-cat schemes floated through Mr. Pottermack's mind, though
  they found no lodgment there. For instance, he actually considered the
  feasibility of dismounting the sun-dial, fishing up the body and planting it
  in some place where it might be found. Of course, the plan was physically
  impossible even if he could have faced the horrors of its execution.</p>

  <p>Then he turned his attention to the now invaluable coat. He conceived the
  idea of depositing it at the edge of a cliff or on the brink of a river or
  dock. But this would not have served the required purpose. Doubtless it would
  have raised a suspicion that the owner was dead. But suspicion was of no use.
  Absolute certainty was what was needed to turn the wife into a widow. In
  connection with this idea, he studied the law relating to Presumption of
  Death; but when he learned that, about 1850, the Court of Queen's Bench had
  refused to presume the death of a person who was known to have been alive in
  the year 1027, he decided that the staying power of the law was considerably
  greater than his own and finally abandoned the idea.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless his resolution remained unshaken. Somehow James Lewson would
  have to be given the proper, recognized status of a dead man. Though no
  practicable scheme presented itself, the problem was ever present in his
  mind. By day and by night, in his work in the garden, in his walks through
  the quiet lanes, even in the fair widow's pleasant sitting-room, his thoughts
  were constantly busy with the vain search for some solution; and so they
  might have continued indefinitely but for a chance circumstance that supplied
  him with a new suggestion. And even then, the suggestion was so indirect and
  so little related to the nature of his problem that he had nearly missed
  it.</p>

  <p>From time to time, Mr. Pottermack was in the habit of paying a visit to
  London for the purpose of making various purchases, particularly of tools and
  materials. On one of these occasions, happening to be in the neighbourhood of
  Covent Garden, and realizing suddenly that the day was Friday, it occurred to
  him to, look in at the auction rooms in King Street, hard by and see what was
  going. For the Friday sales of "miscellaneous property" are of special
  interest to those who use tools, appliances, or scientific instruments, and
  Pottermack had on one or two previous occasions picked up some very useful
  bargains.</p>

  <p>But this time he seemed to have drawn a blank; for when he ran his eye
  over the catalogue which was fixed to the doorpost he found, to his disgust,
  that the principal feature was "The valuable collection brought together by a
  well-known Egyptologist, lately deceased." He was on the point of turning
  away when he noticed, near the end of the catalogue, "another property"
  consisting of a quantity of model-maker's tools and appliances; whereupon he
  entered the office, and, having provided himself with a catalogue, made his
  way to the inner room where the tools were on view. These he looked over
  critically, marking here and there a "Lot" which might be worth buying if it
  should go cheaply enough. Then, having finished his actual business, he
  proceeded rather aimlessly to browse round the room, catalogue in hand,
  glancing at the various items of the Egyptologist's collection.</p>

  <p>There is always something impressive about the relics of Ancient Egypt.
  Their vast antiquity, the evidence that they present of strange knowledge and
  a rather uncanny skill, with suggestions of a state of mind by no means
  primitive, yet utterly unlike our own, gives them a certain weird quality
  that makes itself felt by most observers. Pottermack was distinctly aware of
  it. As he looked over the collection of venerable objects&mdash;the ushabti
  figures, the wooden head-rests, the pre-dynastic painted vases, the
  jar-sealings, the flint implements and copper tools and weapons&mdash;he had
  the feeling that the place was unworthy of them. Particularly in regard to
  the wooden and stone steles, the portrait statuettes, the canopic jars and
  other pious memorials of the dead, did he feel that their presence here,
  offered for sale in the public market, was an affront to their sacred
  character. As to the coffins, and above all the mummies, their exposure here
  seemed to him positively indecent. Here were the actual bodies of deceased
  ladies and gentlemen, persons of rank and station in their day, as the
  inscriptions testified, catalogued as mere curios, with the auctioneer's
  ticket pasted on their very coffins or even on their funeral vesture.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack halted by a large open box into which a much-damaged mummy
  had been crammed and lay, partly doubled up, amidst a litter of broken wood.
  The ticket, stuck on the linen bandage in which the body was swathed, marked
  it as "Lot 15"; and reference to the catalogue elicited the further
  particulars: "Mummy of an official with portions of wooden coffin (a.f.),"
  while a label attached to the mummy identified the deceased as "Khama-Heru, a
  libationer of the 19th or 20th dynasty."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack stood by the box, looking down distastefully, almost
  resentfully, at the shapeless figure, wrapped in its bulky swathings, and
  looking like a gigantic rag doll that had been bundled into a rubbish-box.
  That great rag doll had once been a respected attendant at feasts and solemn
  ceremonials. Presently it would be put up "with all faults" and probably
  knocked down for a few shillings to some speculative curio dealer. And as he
  reflected thus, the words of Sir Thomas Browne floated through his mind: "The
  Egyptian mummies which Time or Cambyses hath spared. Avarice now consumeth."
  Vain, indeed, were the efforts of the pious Mizraim to achieve even physical
  immortality.</p>

  <p>He had turned away and was beginning to move slowly towards the door. And
  then, suddenly, in a moment of time, two separate ideas, apparently
  unrelated, linked themselves together and evolved a third. And a very strange
  one that newly evolved idea was. Mr. Pottermack was quite startled. As it
  flashed into his mind, he stopped dead, and then, retracing his steps, halted
  once more beside the box. But now, as he looked down on the great rag doll
  that had once been Khama-Heru, no distaste or resentment was in his eye, but
  rather an eager curiosity that estimated and measured and sought for details.
  He inspected critically the fracture where the brittle corpse had been
  doubled up to jam it in the box; the spot where part of a shrivelled nose
  peeped through a hole in the rotten linen. The history of this thing
  interested him no more. What it had been was no concern of his. Its
  importance to him was in what it was now. It was a dead body&mdash;a dead
  human body; the body of a man; of a tall man, so far as he could judge.</p>

  <p>He made a pencil mark on his catalogue opposite Lot 15, and then, having
  glanced at his watch, walked out into King Street, there to pace up and down
  until it should be time for the auction to begin; and meanwhile to try to
  fashion this startling but rather nebulous idea into a more definite shape;
  to decide, in short, the part which the late Khama-Heru could be given to
  play in his slightly involved affairs.</p>

  <p>The actual acquirement of the gruesome relic presented no difficulties. It
  is true that the auctioneer made some conscientious efforts to invest Lot 15
  with some semblance of value. But his plausible suggestions as to the
  "trifling restorations" that might be necessary aroused no enthusiasm. He had
  to start the bidding himself&mdash;at ten shillings; and at fifteen the
  hammer descended to confirm Mr. Pottermack in the lawful possession of a
  deceased libationer. Thereupon the money was handed in and the box handed
  out, and when it had its lid nailed on and a length of cord tied round it, it
  was conveyed out to the pavement, whence it was presently transferred to the
  roof of a cab and in due course transported to Marylebone Station to await
  the next train to Borley.</p>

  <p>The advent of Khama-Heru, deceased, to "The Chestnuts," Borley,
  inaugurated a radical change in Mr. Pottermack's habits and mental state.
  Gone was the restless indecision that had kept him mooning about, thinking
  everlastingly and getting nothing done. Now, his mind was, in a measure, at
  rest. He had a job, and if all the details of that job were not yet clear to
  him, still he could, as in any other job, get on with the part that he knew
  while he was planning out the remainder.</p>

  <p>The first problem was to dispose of the box&mdash;and of the occupant when
  he should emerge. In the first place, it had been conveyed through the side
  gate to the workshop, where it at present reposed. But this would never do,
  especially when the emergence should take place. For, of late, Alice Bellard
  had taken to bringing him little commissions and sitting by him in the
  workshop babbling cheerfully while he carried them out. Which was exceedingly
  pleasant. But two is company, and, assuredly, Khama-Heru would have made a
  very undesirable third. And there was another point. At present, in his box
  with the fragments of the coffin and the auctioneer's ticket, K.-H. was
  harmless enough; a mere fifteen shillings' worth of miscellaneous property.
  But after a few "trifling restorations" (of a rather different kind from
  those contemplated by the auctioneer) the said K.-H. would present a highly
  compromising appearance. Arrangements would have to be made for keeping him
  in strict retirement.</p>

  <p>The conditions were met fairly well by emptying the tool-house. The roller
  and the lawn-mower could rest safely outside under a tarpaulin, and the
  garden tools could be stowed at the end of the metal-shop. When this had been
  done and the tool-house door fitted with a really safe lock, Pottermack
  dragged the box thither; and having taken off the lid, strengthened it, and
  fitted it with a pair of stout hinges and a good lever lock, he felt that he
  had made things secure for the present. The tool-house was furnished with a
  long bench for the storage of flower-pots, and, as it was lighted only by a
  window in the roof, he would be able to work there conveniently and safe from
  observation.</p>

  <p>His first proceeding was to unroll the mummy, to unwind the countless
  yards of rotten linen bandage with which it had been covered. He wanted to
  see what the mummy itself was like and whether it was complete. But when he
  had got all the wrappings off and looked at the thing as it lay on the bench,
  he was appalled at its appearance. In its wrappings it had been gruesome
  enough&mdash;a great, horrible rag doll; but divested of those wrappings it
  was ghastly. For now it revealed itself frankly for what it was&mdash;a dead
  man; dry, shrivelled, unnatural, but still undeniably the dead body of a
  man.</p>

  <p>Pottermack stood by the bench gazing at it distastefully and with
  something of the compunction that he had felt in the auction room. But it was
  of no use being squeamish. He had bought the thing for a specific and most
  necessary purpose, and that purpose had got to be carried into effect.
  Gulping down his qualms, therefore, he set himself to make a systematic
  examination.</p>

  <p>Apparently the body was quite complete. The abdomen looked a little queer,
  but probably that was due to the drying, though there were unmistakable signs
  of its having been opened. Both legs were partially broken off at the
  hip-joints, just hanging on loosely by a few strings of dried flesh. But the
  bones seemed quite uninjured. The head was in the same condition as the legs,
  detached from the spine save for one or two strands of dry muscle, and at the
  moment rolled over on its side with its face turned towards Pottermack. And a
  grisly face it was; for despite the shrivelled nose, the papery ears, the
  sunken eyes, and the horrid sardonic grin, it had a recognizable human
  expression. Looking at it with shuddering interest, Pottermack felt that he
  could form a fairly clear idea as to what Khama-Heru must have looked like
  when alive.</p>

  <p>Careful measurement with a two-foot rule showed that the body was just
  under five feet nine inches in length. Allowing for shrinkage in drying, his
  height had probably been well over five feet ten; enough to make him a
  passable understudy for James Lewson. Unfortunately, there was no facial
  resemblance whatever, but this, Pottermack hoped, would be of no consequence.
  The dimensions were what really mattered. But, of course, the body was
  useless for Pottermack's purpose in its present rigid, brittle state, and the
  important question was how far it could be softened and rendered flexible.
  Pottermack decided to make a tentative experiment on one shoulder by leaving
  it for an hour or two under several thicknesses of wet rag; which he did,
  with results that were, on the whole, satisfactory. The moistened flesh and
  skin swelled up appreciably and took on a much more natural appearance, and
  the arm now moved freely at the shoulder-joint. But it was evident that this
  treatment must not be applied prematurely, or other, less desirable changes
  would set in. He accordingly allowed the moistened area to dry thoroughly and
  then put the mummy away in its box, there to remain hidden until the other
  preparations had been completed.</p>

  <p>These were of two kinds. First, the understudy had to be provided with a
  "make-up" which would be perfectly convincing under somewhat rigorous
  conditions; and secondly, a suitable setting had to be found for the little
  drama in which the understudy should play his part. Both gave Mr. Pottermack
  considerable occupation.</p>

  <p>In connection with the make-up, it happened most fortunately that he had
  preserved the copy of the local paper containing the announcement of the
  disappearance with the description of the missing man issued by the police.
  With native caution, Mr. Pottermack had used the paper to line a drawer, and
  he now drew it forth and studied its remarkably full details. The coat was in
  his possession; most fortunately, since it was of a conspicuous pattern and
  would have been almost impossible to duplicate. The other clothing&mdash;the
  pin-head worsted waistcoat and trousers, the plain grey cotton shirt, the
  collar, neck-tie, and underclothing&mdash;was all of a kind that could be
  easily matched from the description, aided in some cases by his own memory;
  and the shoes, which were described minutely, could be duplicated with ease
  at any large shoe-retailers, while as to the rubber soles, they were of a
  pattern that were turned out by the thousand.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, the outfit for the deceased gave him endless trouble and
  occasioned numerous visits to London. The clothing called for tactful
  manoeuvring, since it was obviously not for his own wear. The "Invicta" sole
  manufacturers had to be found through the directory, and the circular heels,
  with their five-pointed stars, involved a long and troublesome search; for
  most of the star-pattern heels have six-pointed stars. And even when the
  outfit had been obtained the work was not at an end. For all the things were
  new. They had to be "conditioned" before they would be ready for the final
  act. The garments had to be worn, and worn roughly (in the garden and
  workshop, since their size made them entirely unpresentable), to produce
  marks of wear and convincing creases. The shoes, when the soles had been
  stuck on and a knife-cut made across the neck of the horse on the right sole,
  had to be taken out for long nocturnal walks on rough roads, having been
  previously fitted with two pairs of inner cork soles to prevent them from
  dropping off. The underclothing would require to be marked, but this
  Pottermack prudently put off until the last moment. Still, all these
  preparatory activities took up a good deal of time and gave a considerable
  amount of trouble. Not that time was of any importance. There was no hurry.
  Now that Pottermack had a plan his mind was at rest.</p>

  <p>Moreover, he had certain distractions, besides his frequent visits to
  Lavender Cottage. For, in addition to these preparations connected with the
  costume of the actor, there were others concerned with the scene of the
  drama. A suitable setting had to be found for James Lewson's next&mdash;and,
  as Pottermack devoutly hoped, final&mdash;appearance.</p>

  <p>The place must of necessity be close at hand and ought to be on the line
  of Lewson's known route. This left, practically, the choice between the heath
  and the wood. The former he rejected as too exposed for his purpose and too
  much frequented to be perfectly convincing. Of the wood he knew little
  excepting that few persons seemed ever to enter it, probably for the reason
  that had led him to avoid it; that, owing to its neglected state, it was
  choked by almost impenetrable undergrowth.</p>

  <p>Now he decided to explore it thoroughly, and since the path which
  meandered through it divided it into two nearly equal parts, he proposed to
  make a systematic exploration of each part separately.</p>

  <p>He began with the part that lay to the left of the path, which was, if
  possible, less frequented than the other. Choosing a place where the
  undergrowth was least dense, he plunged in and began to burrow through the
  bushes, stooping low to avoid the matted twigs and branches and keeping an
  eye on a pocket-compass that he held in his left hand. It was a wearisome and
  uncomfortable mode of progression, and had the disadvantage that, doubled up
  as he was, he could see little but the compass and the ground at his feet.
  And it nearly brought him to disaster; for he had been blundering along thus
  for about ten minutes in as near to a straight line as was possible, when he
  suddenly found himself at the edge of what looked like a low cliff. Another
  step forward and he would have been over the brink.</p>

  <p>He stopped short, and, straightening his back, drew aside the branches of
  the tall bushes and looked down. Beneath him was what had evidently been a
  gravel-pit; but it must have been disused for many years, for its floor was
  covered, not only with bushes but trees of quite a respectable size. It
  seemed to him that this place was worth a closer examination. And since the
  pit had been produced by excavation, there must obviously be some passage-way
  to the bottom, up and down which the carts had passed when the gravel was
  being dug.</p>

  <p>Accordingly he began to make his way cautiously along the brink, keeping a
  safe distance from the possibly crumbling edge. He had proceeded thus for a
  couple of hundred yards when he came to the edge of a sunken cart-track, and
  following this, soon reached the entrance. Walking down the rough track, in
  which the deep cart-ruts could still be made out, he reached the floor of the
  pit and paused to look around; but the trees that had grown up and the high
  bushes made it impossible to see across. He therefore embarked on a
  circumnavigation of the pit, wading through beds of tall nettles that grew
  luxuriantly right up to the cliff-like face of the gravel.</p>

  <p>He had made nearly half the circuit of the pit when he perceived, some
  distance ahead, a large wooden gate which guarded the entrance to a tunnel or
  excavation of some kind. It had two leaves, in which he could see, as he came
  nearer, a wicket which stood half open. Approaching and peering in through
  the opening, he found the cavity to be an artificial cave dug in the hard
  gravel, apparently to serve as a cart-shelter, for the floor was marked by a
  pair of wide ruts and the remains of a broken sway-bar lay close to one
  side.</p>

  <p>Deeply interested in this excavation, Mr. Pottermack pulled open the
  wicket-gate&mdash;in the lock of which a rusty key still remained&mdash;and
  stepping in through the opening, looked critically around the interior. That
  it had been for many years disused, so far as its original purpose was
  concerned, followed from the state of the pit and the absence of any signs of
  recent digging. But yet the cave itself showed traces of comparatively recent
  occupation; and those traces threw considerable light on the character of the
  occupants. A sooty streak up one wall, fading away on the roof, and a heap of
  wood-ashes mixed with fragments of charcoal, told of not one fire but a
  series of fires lit on the same spot. Beside the long-extinct embers lay a
  rusty "billy," originally made from a bully-beef tin fitted with a wire
  handle; fragments of unsavoury rags and a pair of decayed boots spoke of
  changes of costume that could certainly not have been premature; while
  numbers of bird and rabbit bones strewn around hinted at petty poaching,
  with, perchance, a fortunate snatch now and again in the vicinity of a
  farmyard.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack viewed these relics of the unknown nomad with profound
  attention. Like most resourceful men, he was quick to take a suggestion. And
  here, in the pit, the cavern, and these unmistakable relics, was a ready-made
  story. His own scheme had hardly advanced beyond the stage of sketchy
  outline. He knew broadly what he intended, but the details had not yet been
  filled in. Now he could complete the sketch in such detail that nothing would
  remain but the bare execution; and even that had been robbed of its chief
  difficulties by the discovery of this cavern.</p>

  <p>He paced slowly up and down the echoing chamber, letting his imagination
  picture the dramatic climax and congratulating himself on this fortunate
  discovery. How astonishingly well it all came together! The place and the
  circumstances might have been designed for the very purpose. No need now to
  puzzle out a plausible cause of death. The empty poison-bottle and the
  discharged pistol-bullet, which he had considered alternatively, could now be
  discarded. The cause of death would be obvious. He had nearly broken his own
  neck coming here in broad daylight. If he had come in the dark, he would have
  broken it to a certainty.</p>

  <p>Then there were the vanished notes and the necessarily empty
  pockets&mdash;necessarily empty, since, as he did not know what they had
  contained, he would not dare to introduce contents. He had hoped that a
  reasonable inference would be drawn. But now no inference would be needed.
  Even the most guileless village constable, when he had seen those fowl and
  rabbit bones, would understand how deceased's pockets came to be empty.</p>

  <p>From reflections on the great denouement Pottermack recalled his thoughts
  to the practical details of procedure. He proposed forthwith to take over the
  reversion of the late resident's tenancy. But he could not leave it in its
  present unguarded state. When the time came for him to occupy it he would
  require "the use and enjoyment of the said messuage and premises" in the
  strictest privacy. It would never do to have casual callers dropping in there
  in his absence. He must see how the place could be made secure.</p>

  <p>Inspection of the entrance showed that the large gates were fastened on
  the inside by massive bars of wood thrust through great iron staples.
  Consequently, when the wicket-gate was locked the cave was absolutely secure
  from intrusion. The important question now was as to the lock of the
  wicket-gate. Was it possible to turn the key? A few strenuous wrenches
  answered the question in the negative. It is true that, by a strong effort,
  the rusty key could be made to turn backwards, but by no effort whatever
  could it be made to shoot the bolt. Key and lock were both encrusted with the
  rust of years.</p>

  <p>There was only one thing to be done. The key must be taken away and
  scraped clean. Then, with the aid of oil or paraffin, it would probably be
  possible to make the lock work. By putting out all his strength, Pottermack
  managed to turn the key backwards far enough to enable him to pull it out of
  the lock; whereupon, having dropped it in his pocket, he retraced his steps
  to the entrance to the pit and walked up the sloping cart-track until it
  emerged on the level, when he halted, and having consulted his compass, set
  forth, holding it in his hand, and trying by means of the ruts to find the
  track along which the carts used to pass to and fro across the road.</p>

  <p>As the matter was of considerable importance (since the cave was to be the
  scene of some momentous operations and it was necessary for him to be able to
  find his way to it with ease and certainty), he took his time over the
  survey, tracing the ruts until they faded away into the younger undergrowth,
  and thereafter identifying the overgrown track by the absence of large bushes
  or trees. From time to time he jotted down a note of the compass-bearing and
  sliced off with his knife a piece of bark from one of the larger branches of
  a bush or the trunk of a sapling, and so proceeded methodically, leaving an
  inconspicuously blazed trail behind him until at last he came out on to the
  path. Here he paused and looked about him for a landmark, his natural caution
  restraining him from making an artificial mark; nor was this necessary, for
  exactly opposite to the point where he had emerged, a good-sized beech tree
  stood back only a few yards from the path.</p>

  <p>Having taken a good look at the tree, that he might recognize it at the
  next visit, he pocketed his compass and started homewards, counting his paces
  as he went until he reached the place where the path entered the wood, when
  he halted and wrote down in his pocket-book the number of paces. That done,
  his exploration was finished for the time being. The rest of the day he
  devoted to cleaning the key, to drawing on a card a little sketch-map of his
  route from the notes in his pocket-book, and to one or two odd jobs connected
  with the great scheme.</p>

  <p>We need not follow his proceedings in minute detail. On the following day,
  having furnished himself with the cleaned key, a small spanner, a bottle of
  paraffin mixed with oil, and one or two feathers, he returned to the cave,
  finding his way thither without difficulty by the aid of his map. There he
  made a determined attack on the rusty lock, oiling its interior parts freely
  and turning the key&mdash;also oiled&mdash;by means of the spanner. At length
  its corroded bolt shot out with a reluctant groan; and when this, too, had
  been oiled and shot back and forth a few times, Pottermack shut the wicket,
  locked it and carried off the key in his pocket, with the comfortable feeling
  that he now had a secure place in which the highly compromising final
  operations could be carried out in reasonable safety.</p>

  <p>And now the time drew nigh for those final operations to be proceeded
  with. The costume was complete and its various items had been brought by wear
  and rough usage to a suitable condition. The waning summer hinted at the
  approach of autumn and the weather would presently be such as to render
  woodland expeditions, especially of a nocturnal kind, disagreeable and
  difficult. And then Pottermack, though not in any way hustled, was beginning
  to look forward a little eagerly to the end of this troublesome, secret
  business. He yearned to feel that the tableau was set and that he could wait
  quietly for the denouement. Also, he was getting to feel very strongly that
  he would be glad to be relieved of the society of Khama-Heru.</p>

  <p>But meanwhile that ancient libationer became daily a more and more
  undesirable tenant. For the time had come for the course of treatment that
  should render him at once more convincing and more portable. His condition
  when first unrolled from his wrappings was that of a wooden effigy, hard and
  stiff as a board. In that state he could never be got into his clothes, nor
  could he be transported to the cave under the necessary conditions of
  secrecy; nor could he effectively impersonate the late James Lewson. The work
  that the embalmers had done so well would have to be undone. After all, he
  had had some four thousand years of physical immortality, so the embalmers'
  fees would not have been thrown away.</p>

  <p>There was no difficulty about the treatment. Pottermack simply wrapped the
  mummy in several thicknesses of wet rag, poured a can of water over it, and,
  having enclosed it in an outer covering of tarpaulin, left it to macerate for
  forty-eight hours. When, at the end of that time, he uncovered it, he was at
  once encouraged and appalled. The last trace of the museum atmosphere was
  dissipated. It was a mummy no more but just an unburied corpse. The dry
  muscles had absorbed the moisture and swelled up to an unexpected bulk; the
  parchment-like skin had grown soft and sodden, and the skeleton hands had
  filled out and looked almost natural save for the queer, dirty orange colour
  of the fingernails. And even that, when Pottermack had observed it with a
  strong suspicion that it was an artificial stain, disappeared almost
  completely after a cautious application of chlorinated soda. In short,
  Khama-Heru seemed already to call aloud for the coroner. All, then, was going
  well so far. But Pottermack realized only too clearly that the part that was
  done was the easy part. The real difficulties had now to be faced; and when
  he considered those difficulties, when he reflected on the hideous risks that
  he would have to run, the awful consequences of a possible miscarriage of his
  plans, he stood aghast.</p>

  <p>But still with unshaken resolution he set himself to plotting out the
  details of the next move.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;THE SETTING OF THE TABLEAU</h3>

  <p>The task which confronted Mr. Pottermack in the immediate future involved
  a series of operations of greatly varying difficulty. The materials for the
  "tableau" had to be transported from the workshop and tool-house to the cave
  in the gravel-pit. Thither they would be conveyed in instalments and left
  safely under lock and key until they were all there, ready to be "assembled."
  In the case of the clothing, the conveyance would be attended by no
  difficulties and little risk. It could be done quite safely by daylight. But
  the instalments of Khama-Heru, particularly the larger ones, would have to be
  transported, not merely after dark, but so late as to make it practically
  certain that he would have the path and the wood to himself.</p>

  <p>The latter fact had been evident from the beginning, and in view of it,
  Pottermack had provided himself with a night-marching compass (having a
  two-inch luminous dial and direction-pointer) and an electric lamp of the
  police pattern; so that he was now ready to begin; and as he had decided to
  convey the clothing first, he commenced operations by making a careful survey
  of the separate items and putting the necessary finishing touches to
  them.</p>

  <p>It was now for the first time that he made a thorough examination of
  Lewson's coat and of the contents of the letter-case. And it was just as well
  that he did; for among those contents was a recent letter from Alice,
  refusing a "loan" (probably that letter had precipitated the catastrophe). It
  was unsigned and bore no address, but still it might have given trouble, even
  if no one but himself should have been able to identify the very
  characteristic handwriting. Accordingly he burned it forthwith and went still
  more carefully through the remaining papers; but there was nothing more that
  interested him. They consisted chiefly of tradesmen's bills, demands for
  money owing, notes of racing transactions, a letter from his broker, and a
  few visiting-cards&mdash;his own&mdash;all of which Pottermack returned to
  their receptacle. The other pockets contained only a handkerchief, marked "J.
  Lewson," a leather cigarette-case, and a loose key which looked like a safe
  key. The key he transferred to the trousers pocket, the cigarette-case he
  burned, and the handkerchief he retained as a guide to the next operation,
  that of marking the underclothing. This he did with great care, following his
  copy closely and placing the marks in accordance with the particulars in the
  police description, using a special ink of guaranteed durability.</p>

  <p>When the "properties" were ready for removal he considered the question of
  time. This need not be a nocturnal expedition. There would be nothing
  suspicious in his appearance, and he had, in fact, during his exploration of
  the wood, not met or seen a single person. Still, it might be better to make
  his visit to the pit after dusk, when, even if he should be seen, he would
  not be recognized, and the nature of his proceedings there would not be
  clearly observable.</p>

  <p>Accordingly he prepared for his start with the first instalment as the sun
  was getting low in the west. Lewson's coat he put on in lieu of his own,
  covering it with a roomy showerproof overcoat. The trousers and waistcoat he
  stowed neatly at the bottom of his rucksack with his moth-collecting kit and
  folding-net above them. Then, with the net-staff in his hand, he let himself
  out of the side gate just as the crimson disc of the sun began to dive behind
  a bank of slaty cloud.</p>

  <p>The expedition was quite uneventful. He tramped along the path in the
  gloaming, a solitary figure in the evening landscape; he followed it into the
  wood and along to the now familiar beech tree; and in all the way he met not
  a soul. He turned off on the almost indistinguishable track, finding no need
  for his sketch-map and only glancing at the inconspicuous blazings on bush
  and sapling. By the time he reached the entrance to the pit, the dusk had
  closed in but even now there was light enough for him to find his way down
  the sloping cart-track, and even to note that apparently since his last
  visit, inasmuch as he had not noticed it before, a small tree had toppled
  over the edge of the cliff, bringing down with it a little avalanche of
  stones and gravel. He looked up and made a slight detour, picking his way
  cautiously among the fallen stones; and, preoccupied as he was, that fallen
  tree and those heaped and scattered stones started a train of thought of
  which he was hardly conscious at the time.</p>

  <p>When he had shed Lewson's coat and by the light of a little, dim
  pocket-lamp unpacked the trousers and waistcoat, he threw them down in a
  corner at the back of the cave. Apprehensively he glanced round for some
  trace of recent visitors (though he knew there could have been none); then he
  extinguished the lamp, passed out through the wicket, shut the little gate,
  locked it, and, having pocketed the key, turned away with a sigh of relief.
  The first instalment was delivered. It wasn't much, but still, he had made a
  beginning.</p>

  <p>On his way back through the wood he made use of the night-compass; not
  that he seemed greatly to need it, for he found his way with an ease that
  surprised him. But it was obviously a useful instrument and it was well that
  he should acquire experience in its management, for there were circumstances
  that might possibly arise in which it would be invaluable. It would be a
  fearsome experience to be lost at night in the wood&mdash;especially with one
  of the later instalments.</p>

  <p>The easy success of this first expedition had a beneficial moral effect,
  and with each of the succeeding journeys the strangeness of the experience
  wore off more and more. Even in the twilight he threaded the blazed track
  through the wood quite readily without reference to the blazings; and the
  return in the dark, with the glowing compass in his hand, was hardly more
  difficult. Half a dozen of these evening jaunts found the entire
  costume&mdash;clothes, shoes, cap, socks, underclothing&mdash;stored under
  lock and key in the cave&mdash;waiting for the arrival of the wearer.</p>

  <p>But now came the really formidable part of the undertaking, and as
  Pottermack contemplated those next few journeys he quailed. There was now no
  question of setting forth in the gloaming; these journeys would have to be
  made in the very dead of night. So he felt; and even as he yielded to the
  feeling as to something inevitable, he knew that the reason for it was
  largely psychological; that it was determined by his own mental state rather
  than by external circumstances. Admittedly, a human head is an awkward thing
  to pack neatly in a rucksack. Still, it is of no great size. Its longest
  diameter, including the lower jaw, is no more than nine or ten inches. A
  half-quartern loaf and a bottle of beer would make a bigger bulge; yet with
  these, Pottermack would have gone abroad gaily, never dreaming of having his
  burden challenged.</p>

  <p>He knew all this. And yet as he took up the head (it came off in his hands
  owing to the frayed-out condition of the softened muscle and ligament) a
  thrill of horror ran through him at the thought of that journey. The thing
  seemed to grin derisively in his face as he carried it from the tool-house to
  the workshop; and when he laid it down on the sheet of brown paper on the
  bench, the jaws fell open as if it were about to utter a yell.</p>

  <p>He wrapped it up hastily and thrust it into the rucksack, and then, by way
  of feeble and futile precaution stuffed the sugaring-tin and collecting-box
  on top. With creeping flesh he slung the package on his back and, grasping
  the net-stick, went out across the garden to the gate. He was frankly
  terrified. When he had passed out of the gate, he stood for some seconds
  irresolute, unwilling to shut it behind him; and when at last he closed it
  softly, the click of the spring-latch shutting him out definitely gave him
  such a qualm that he could hardly resist the impulse to reopen the gate, or,
  at least, to leave the key in the lock ready for instant use.</p>

  <p>Once started, he strode forward at a rapid pace, restraining himself by an
  effort from breaking into a run. It was a pitch-dark night, near to new moon
  and overcast as well; so dark that he could barely see the path in the open,
  and only a slightly intenser gloom told him when he had entered the wood.
  Here he began to count his paces and strain his eyes into the blackness
  ahead; for, anticipating some nervousness on this journey, he had taken the
  precaution when returning from the last to spread a sheet of newspaper at the
  foot of the beech tree (which formed his "departure" for the cart-track and
  the gravel-pit) and weight it with a large stone. For this patch of light on
  the dark background he looked eagerly as he stumbled forward, peering into
  utter blackness and feeling his way along the path with his feet; and when he
  had counted out the distance and still saw no sign of it, he halted, and,
  listening fearfully to the stealthy night sounds of the wood, looked
  anxiously both ahead and behind him.</p>

  <p>Nothing whatever could be seen. But perhaps it was too dark for even a
  white object to show. Perhaps he had counted wrong, or possibly in his haste
  he had "stepped out" or "stepped short." Reluctantly he drew out his little
  pocket-lamp (he did not dare to use the powerful inspection-lamp, though he
  had it with him) and let its feeble glimmer travel around him. Somehow the
  trees and bushes looked unfamiliar; but doubtless everything would look
  unfamiliar in that deceptive glimmer. Still, he had begun to know this path
  pretty well, even by night. Eventually he turned back and slowly retraced his
  steps, throwing the dim lamplight on the path ahead. Presently, out of the
  greenish gloom with its bewildering shadows there sprang a spot of white; and
  hurrying forward, he recognized with a sigh of relief the sheet of paper
  lying at the foot of the beech.</p>

  <p>From this point he had no more difficulty. Plunging forward into the
  cellar-like darkness, he went on confidently, guided by the trusty compass
  which glowed only the more brightly for the impenetrable gloom around. Now
  and again he stopped to let the swinging dial come to rest and to verify his
  position by a momentary flash of the lamp. Soon he felt the familiar ruts
  beneath his feet and came out into the mitigated obscurity of the open track;
  then, following it down the slope, found his way through the nettles under
  the cliff, over the remains of the avalanche, until he reached the gate of
  the cave. A few minutes more and he had discharged his ghastly cargo, locked
  it into its new abode, and started, free at last from his horrid incubus, on
  the homeward journey, noting with a certain exasperation how, now that it was
  of no consequence, he made his way through the wood almost as easily as he
  would have done by daylight.</p>

  <p>But it had been a harrowing experience. Short as had been the journey and
  light the burden, he stumbled in at his gate as wearily as if he had tramped
  a dozen miles with a sack of flour on his back. And yet it was but the first
  and by far the easiest of these midnight expeditions. He realized that
  clearly enough as he stole silently into the house while a neighbouring
  church clock struck two. There were three more instalments; and of the last
  one he would not allow himself to think.</p>

  <p>But events seldom fall out precisely as we forecast them. The next two
  'trips' gave Pottermack less trouble than had the first, though they were
  undeniably more risky. The safe conveyance of the first instalment gave him
  confidence, and the trifling, but disconcerting, hitch in finding the
  'departure' mark suggested measures to prevent its repetition. Still, it was
  as well that he had transported the easiest load first, for the two
  succeeding ones made call enough on his courage and resolution. For whereas
  the head had merely created a conspicuous bulge in the rucksack, the legs
  refused to be concealed at all. Doubled up as completely as the softened
  muscles and ligaments permitted, each made an unshapely, elongated parcel
  over twenty inches in length, of which nearly half projected from the mouth
  of the rucksack.</p>

  <p>However, the two journeys were made without any mishap. As on the previous
  occasions, Pottermack met nobody either on the path or in the wood, and this
  circumstance helped him to brace up his nerves for the conveyance of the
  final instalment. Indeed, the chance of his meeting any person at one or two
  in the morning in this place, which was unfrequented even by day, was
  infinitely remote. At those hours one could probably have walked the whole
  length of the town without encountering a single human being other than the
  constables on night duty; and it was certain that no constable would be
  prowling about the deserted countryside or groping his way through the
  wood.</p>

  <p>So Pottermack argued, and reasonably enough; but still he shied at that
  last instalment. The headless trunk alone was some twenty-six inches long,
  and, with the attached arms, was a bulky mass. No disguise was possible in
  its conveyance. It would have to be put into a sack and frankly carried on
  his shoulder. Of course, if he met nobody, this was of no consequence apart
  from the inconvenience and exertion; and again he assured himself that he
  would meet nobody. There was nobody to meet. But still&mdash;well, there was
  no margin for the unexpected. The appearance of a man carrying a sack at one
  o'clock in the morning was a good deal more than suspicious. No rural
  constable or keeper would let him pass. And a single glance into that
  sack&mdash;</p>

  <p>However, it was useless to rack his nerves with disquieting suppositions.
  There was pretty certainly not a human creature abroad in the whole
  countryside, and at any rate the thing had got to be taken to the cave.
  Quivering with disgust and apprehension, he persuaded the limp torso into the
  sack that he had obtained for it, tied up the mouth, and, hoisting it on his
  shoulder, put out into the darkness.</p>

  <p>As soon as he had closed the gate he set off at a quick walk. He had no
  inclination to run this time, for his burden was of a very substantial weight
  from the moisture that it had absorbed. From time to time he had to halt and
  transfer it from one shoulder to the other. He would have liked to put it
  down and rest for a few moments, but did not dare while he was in the open.
  An unconquerable terror urged him forward to the shelter of the wood and
  forbade him to slacken his pace, though his knees were trembling and the
  sweat trickled down his face. Yet he kept sufficient presence of mind to make
  sure of his "departure," counting his paces from the entrance to the wood and
  showing the glimmer of his little lamp as his counting warned him of his
  approach to the beech tree. Soon its light fell on the sheet of paper, and,
  with a sigh of relief, he turned off the path into the old cart-track.</p>

  <p>Once off the path, his extreme terror subsided and he followed the track
  confidently with only an occasional flash of his lamp to pick up a blaze on
  bush or tree and verify his direction. He even contemplated a brief rest, and
  he had, in fact, halted and was about to lower his burden from his shoulders
  when his ear seemed to catch a faint sound of movement somewhere within the
  wood. Instantly all his terrors revived. His limbs trembled and his hair
  seemed to stir under his cap as he stood stock-still with mouth agape,
  listening with almost agonized intentness.</p>

  <p>Presently he heard the sound again; the sound of something moving through
  the undergrowth. And then it became quite distinct and clearly recognizable
  as footfalls&mdash;the footsteps of two persons at least, moving rather
  slowly and stealthily; and by the increasing distinctness of the sounds, it
  was evident that they were coming in his direction. The instant that he
  recognized this, Pottermack stole softly off the track into the dense wood
  until he came to a young beech tree, at the foot of which he silently
  deposited the sack, leaning it against the bole of the tree. Then in the same
  stealthy manner he crept away a dozen paces or so and again halted and
  listened. But now the sounds had unaccountably ceased; and to Pottermack the
  profound silence that had followed them was sinister and alarming. Suddenly
  there came to him distinctly a hoarse whisper:</p>

  <p>"Joe, there's some one in the wood!"</p>

  <p>Again the deathly silence descended. Then the sack, which must have been
  stood up insecurely, slipped from the bole of the tree and rolled over among
  the dead leaves.</p>

  <p>"J'ear that?" came the hushed voice of the unseen whisperer.</p>

  <p>Pottermack listened intently, craning forward in an effort to locate the
  owner of the voice. In fact, he craned a little too far and had to move one
  foot to recover his balance. But the toe of that foot caught against a
  straggling root and tripped him up, so that he staggered forward a couple of
  paces, not noisily, but still very audibly.</p>

  <p>Instantly the silence of the wood was dissipated. A startled voice
  exclaimed: "Gawd! Look out!" and then Joseph and his companion took to
  undissembled flight, bursting through the undergrowth and crashing into the
  bushes like a couple of startled elephants. Pottermack made a noisy pretence
  of pursuit which accelerated the pace of the fugitives; then he stood still,
  listening with grateful ears to the hurried tramplings as they gradually grew
  faint in the distance.</p>

  <p>When they had nearly died away, he turned, and re-entering the dense wood,
  made his way, with the aid of the little lamp, towards the beech where he had
  put down the sack. But the beech was not exactly where he had supposed it to
  be, and it took him a couple of minutes of frantic searching to locate it. At
  last the feeble rays of his lamp fell on the slender trunk, and he hurried
  forward eagerly to retrieve his treasure. But when he reached the tree and
  cast the light of his lamp on the buttressed roots, the sack was nowhere to
  be seen. He gazed in astonishment at the roots and the ground beyond, but the
  sack was certainly not there. It was very strange. He had heard the sack fall
  over and roll off the roots, but it could not have rolled out of sight. Was
  it possible that the poachers, or whatever they were, could have picked it up
  and carried it away? That seemed quite impossible, for the voice had come
  from the opposite direction. And then the simple explanation dawned on him.
  This was the wrong tree.</p>

  <p>As he realized this, his self-possession forsook him completely. With
  frantic haste he began to circle round, thrusting through the undergrowth,
  peering with starting eyes at the ground carpeted with last year's leaves on
  which the light fell from his lamp. Again and again a tall, slender trunk
  lured him on to a fresh disappointment. He seemed to be bewitched. The place
  appeared to be full of beech trees&mdash;as in fact it was, being a beech
  wood. And with each failure he became more wildly terrified and distraught.
  All sense of direction and position was gone. He was just blindly seeking an
  unknown tree in a pitch-dark wood.</p>

  <p>Suddenly he realized the horrid truth. He was lost. He had no idea
  whatever as to his whereabouts. He could not even guess in which direction
  the track lay, and as to his hideous but precious burden, he might have
  strayed half a mile away from it. He stopped short and tried to pull himself
  together. This sort of thing would never do. He might wander on, at this
  rate, until daylight or topple unawares into the pit and break his neck.
  There was only one thing to be done. He must get back to the path and take a
  fresh departure.</p>

  <p>As this simple solution occurred to him, his self-possession became
  somewhat restored and he was able to consider his position more calmly.
  Producing his compass and opening it, he stood quite still until the dial
  came to rest. Then he turned slowly, so as not to set it swinging again,
  until the luminous "lubber-line" pointed due west. He had only to keep it
  pointing in that direction and it would infallibly lead him to the path,
  which ran nearly north and south. So, with renewed confidence, he began to
  walk forward, keeping his eye fixed on that invaluable direction-line.</p>

  <p>He had been walking thus some three or four minutes, progressing slowly of
  necessity since he had to push straight forward through the undergrowth, when
  he tripped over some bulky object and butted rather heavily into the trunk of
  a tree. Picking himself up, a little shaken by the impact, he snatched out
  his lamp and threw its light on the object over which he had stumbled. And
  then he could hardly repress a shout of joy.</p>

  <p>It was the sack.</p>

  <p>How differently do we view things under different circumstances. When
  Pottermack had started, the very touch of that sack with its damp, yielding
  inmate had sent shudders of loathing down his spine. Now he caught it up
  joyfully, he could almost have embraced it, and as he set forward in the new
  direction he steadied it fondly on his shoulder. For he had not only found
  the sack, he had recovered his position. A dozen paces to the north brought
  him to the spot from whence he had stepped off the track into the wood. Now
  he had but to turn east and resume his interrupted journey.</p>

  <p>But the meeting with those two men had shaken his confidence. He stole on
  nervously along the cart-track, and when he reached the pit, he peered
  apprehensively into the darkness on every side, half expecting to detect some
  lurking figure watching him from among the high nettles. Only when he had at
  last deposited his burden in the cave and locked and tried the wicket was his
  mind even moderately at rest; and even then throughout the homeward journey
  his thoughts occupied themselves in picturing, with perverse ingenuity, all
  the mischances that might possibly have befallen him and that might yet lie
  in wait to defeat his plans in the very moment of their accomplishment.</p>

  <p>He arrived home tired, shaken, and dispirited, inclined rather to let his
  thoughts dwell on the difficulties and dangers that lay ahead than to
  congratulate himself on those that he had surmounted. As he crept noiselessly
  up to bed and thought of the gruesome task that had yet to be accomplished,
  he resolved to give himself a day or two's rest to steady his nerves before
  he embarked on it. But the following day saw a change of mind. Refreshed even
  by the short night's sleep, as soon as he had risen he began to be possessed
  by a devouring anxiety to finish this horrible business and be done with it.
  Besides which, common sense told him that the presence of the body and the
  clothes in the cave constituted a very serious danger. If they should be
  discovered, very awkward enquiries might be set on foot, and at the best his
  scheme would be "blown on" and rendered impossible for ever after.</p>

  <p>A long nap in the afternoon further revived him, and as the evening wore
  on he began to be impatient to get on the road. This time there were no
  special preparations to make and no risks in the actual journeys, either
  going or returning. The recollection of those two men occasioned some passing
  thoughts of means of defence, for they had obviously been out for no good, as
  their precipitate retreat showed. He even considered taking a revolver, but
  his thorough-going British dislike of lethal weapons, which his long
  residence in the States had accentuated rather than diminished, made him
  reject the idea. The net-staff was quite a good weapon, especially in the
  dark; and, in fact, he was not particularly nervous about those men, or any
  others, so long as he bore no incriminating burden.</p>

  <p>When at last he started, just after midnight, he carried the rucksack
  slung from his shoulders and the stout net-stick in his hand. But the former
  contained nothing but a bona fide collecting outfit, including the
  inspection-lamp, so even a police patrol had no terrors for him. Naturally,
  it followed that he neither met, saw, nor heard a single person either on the
  path or in the wood. Swinging easily along the now familiar way, he made his
  departure almost by instinct and threaded the cart-track with hardly a glance
  at the compass. And all too soon&mdash;as it seemed to him&mdash;he found
  himself at the gate of the cave with the last horrid task immediately
  confronting him.</p>

  <p>It was even worse than he had expected, for he had never dared to let his
  imagination fill in all the dreadful details. But now, when he had locked
  himself in and hung the inspection-lamp on a nail in the gate so that a broad
  beam of light fell on the grisly heap, he stood, shivering and appalled,
  struggling to brace up his courage to begin. And at last he brought himself
  to the sticking point and fell to work.</p>

  <p>We need not share his agonies. It was a loathly business. The dismembered
  parts had to be inducted separately into their garments, leaving the
  "assembling" for a later stage; and the sheer physical difficulty of
  persuading those limp, flabby, unhelpful members into the closer-fitting
  articles of clothing was at once an aggravation and a distraction from the
  horror of the task. And with it all, it was necessary to keep the attention
  wide awake. For there must be no mistakes. A time would come when the
  clothing would be submitted to critical examination and the slightest error
  might rouse fatal suspicions. So Pottermack told himself as, with trembling
  fingers, he buttoned the waistcoat on the headless, legless torso; only to
  discover, as he fastened the last button, that he had forgotten the
  braces.</p>

  <p>At length the actual clothing was completed. The legs, encased in
  underclothing, trousers, socks and shoes, lay on the floor, sprawling in
  hideous, unnatural contortion; the trunk, fully dressed even to collar and
  neck-tie, reposed on its back with its arms flung out and the brown,
  claw-like hands protruding from the sleeves; while, hard by, the head seemed
  to grin with sardonic amusement at the cloth cap that sat incongruously on
  its ancient cranium. All was now ready for the "assembling."</p>

  <p>This presented less difficulty, but the result was far from satisfactory.
  For no kind of fastening was permissible. The legs were joined to the trunk
  by the trousers only, secured precariously by the braces. As to the head, it
  admitted of no junction, but would have to be placed in position as best it
  could. However, bad as the "assemblage" was, it would answer well enough if
  there were no premature discovery.</p>

  <p>Having seen everything ready for the final act, Pottermack switched off
  the lamp and stood awhile to let his eyes grow accustomed to the darkness
  before he should venture outside. It was not a situation that was helpful to
  a man whose nerves were already on edge. All sorts of sinister suggestions
  awakened in his mind in connection with the ghastly figure that sprawled
  unseen within a few inches of his feet. And then he became acutely sensible
  of the sepulchral silence of the place; a silence which was yet penetrated by
  sounds from without, especially by the hootings of a company of owls, whose
  derisive "hoo-hoos" seemed particularly addressed to him with something of a
  menacing quality. At length, finding the suspense unbearable, he unlocked the
  wicket and looked out. By now his eyes had recovered from the glare of the
  lamp sufficiently for him to be able to see the nearer objects distinctly and
  to make out the shadowy mass of the cliff close at hand. He peered into the
  gloom on all sides and listened intently. Nothing seemed to be moving, nor
  could his ear detect aught but the natural sounds of the woods.</p>

  <p>He turned back into the cave, and, guided by a momentary glimmer of his
  small lamp, carefully gathered up the limp, headless effigy and lifted it
  with infinite precaution not to disturb the insecure fastenings that held its
  parts together. Thus he carried it tenderly out through the wicket, and,
  stepping cautiously over the rough ground and through the rank vegetation,
  bore it to "the appointed place"&mdash;the place where the fallen tree and
  the scattered stones and gravel marked the site of the "avalanche." Here,
  close by the tree, he laid it down, and, having inspected it rapidly by the
  light of the lamp and made a few readjustments, he went back and fetched out
  the head. This he laid in position by what was left of the neck and supported
  it in the chosen posture by packing handfuls of gravel round it. When the
  arrangement was completed he threw the feeble glimmer of the lamp on it once
  more and looked it over quickly. Then, satisfied that its appearance was as
  convincing as he could make it, he gathered a few stones and laid them on it,
  sprinkled over it a handful or two of gravel, and, finally, pulled the high
  nettles down over it until it was almost hidden from view.</p>

  <p>And with that, his task was finished. Now, all he had to do was to get
  clear of the neighbourhood and wait for whatever might happen. With a sigh of
  relief he turned away and re-entered the cave, for the last time, as he
  hoped. Shutting himself in once more, he made a thorough examination of the
  place by the light of the inspection-lamp to make sure that he had left no
  traces of his tenancy. The remains of the tramp's fire, the billy, and the
  fowl and rabbit bones, he left intact; and, having satisfied himself that
  there was nothing else, he slipped on his rucksack, picked up his net-stick
  and went out, leaving the wicket-gate ajar with the key in the outside of the
  lock as he had found it.</p>

  <p>Very different were his feelings this night as he wended homewards through
  the woods from what they had been on the night before. Now he cared not whom
  he might meet&mdash;though he was better pleased that he met nobody. His task
  was done. All the troublesome secrecy and scheming was over, and all the
  danger was at an end. His premises were purged of every relic of that night
  of horror and release. Now he could go back to his normal life and resume his
  normal occupations. And as to the future; at the worst, a premature discovery
  might expose the fraud and spoil his plans. But no one would connect him with
  the fraud. He had given no name to the auctioneer. If suspicion fell on any
  one, it would fall on the fugitive, James Lewson.</p>

  <p>But it was infinitely unlikely that the fraud would be detected. And if it
  were not, if all went well, James Lewson would be given a decent, reasonable
  death, and, in due course, a suitable burial. And&mdash;again in due
  course&mdash;Alice Bellard would become Mrs. Pottermack.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;THE DISCOVERY</h3>

  <p>It will not appear surprising that for some days after his final
  expedition Mr. Pottermack's thoughts were almost exclusively occupied by the
  product of that night's labour. Indeed, his interest in it was so absorbing
  that on the very next day he was impelled to pay it a visit of inspection. He
  did not, however, go down to the gravel-pit, but, approaching it from above,
  found his way easily to that part of the brink from which the tree had
  fallen, carrying the 'avalanche' with it. Here, going down on hands and
  knees, he crept to the extreme edge and peered over. There was not much to
  see. There lay the fallen tree, there was the great bed of nettles, and in
  the midst of it an obscure shape displaying at one end a pair of shoes and at
  the other, part of a shabby cap.</p>

  <p>It was surprisingly inconspicuous. The tall nettles, which he had pulled
  down across it, concealed the face and broke the continuity of the figure so
  that its nature was not evident at the first glance. This was eminently
  satisfactory, for it multiplied the improbabilities of early discovery. It
  was unlikely that any one would come here at all, but if some person should
  chance to stray hither, still it was unlikely that the body would be
  observed.</p>

  <p>Considerably reassured, Mr. Pottermack backed away from the insecure edge
  and went his way, and thereafter firmly resisted the strong impulse to repeat
  his visit. But, as we have said, that grim figure, though out of sight, was
  by no means out of mind; and for the next week or two Mr. Pottermack was
  uncomfortably on the qui vive for the rumour of discovery. But as the weeks
  went by and still the body lay undiscovered, his mind settled down more and
  more to a state of placid expectancy.</p>

  <p>The summer came to an end with a month of steady rain that made the woods
  impossible for wayfarers despite the gravel soil. The autumn set in mild and
  damp. Hedgerow elms broke out into patches of yellow, and the beeches in the
  wood, after a few tentative changes, burst out into a glory of scarlet and
  crimson and orange. But their glory was short-lived. A sudden sharp frost
  held them in its grip for a day or two; and when it lifted, the trees were
  bare. Their gay mantles had fallen to form a carpet for the earth at their
  feet.</p>

  <p>Then came the autumn gales, driving the fallen leaves hither and thither,
  but sooner or later driving most of them into the gravel-pit, whence there
  was no escape. And there they accumulated in drifts and mounds, moving
  restlessly round their prison as the winds eddied beneath the cliffs, and
  piling up in sheltered places, smothering the nettles and flattening them
  down by their weight.</p>

  <p>Once, at this time, Mr. Pottermack was moved to call on the disguised
  libationer. But when he crawled to the edge of the pit and looked down, the
  figure was invisible. Even the nettles were hidden. All that was to be seen
  was a great russet bank, embedding the fallen tree, and revealing to the
  expert eye a barely perceptible elongated prominence.</p>

  <p>These months of waiting were to Pottermack full of peace and quiet
  happiness. He was not impatient. The future was rich in promise and it was
  not so far ahead but that it seemed well within reach. He had no present
  anxieties, for the danger of premature discovery was past, and every month
  that rolled away added its contribution of security as to the final result.
  So he went his way and lived his life, care-free and soberly cheerful.</p>

  <p>There were, indeed, times when he was troubled with twinges of compunction
  with regard to his beloved friend, for whom these Titanic labours had been
  undertaken. For Alice Bellard was acutely aware of the unsatisfactory nature
  of their relationship. She realized that simple, almost conventional
  friendship is no sort of answer to passionate love, and she made it clear to
  Pottermack that it was an abiding grief to her that she had no more to give.
  He yearned to disillusion her; to let her share his confident hopes that all
  would yet be well. But how could he? It was unavoidable that, in deceiving
  all the world, he must deceive her.</p>

  <p>But, in fact, he was not deceiving her. He was merely conveying to her the
  actual truth by an indirect and slightly illusory method. So he argued in
  regard to his ultimate purpose; and as to this intervening period&mdash;well,
  obviously he could not make her an accessory to his illegal actions. So he
  had to put up, as best he could, with her grateful acknowledgments of his
  patience and resignation, his cheerful acceptance of the inevitable; feeling
  all the time an arrant humbug as he realized how far he had been from any
  such acceptance.</p>

  <p>Thus, in quiet content and with rising hopes, he watched the seasons pass;
  saw the countryside mantled with snow, heard "the ring of gliding steel" on
  icebound ponds and streams, and walked with smoking breath on the hard-frozen
  roads. And still, as the sands of time trickled out slowly, he waited, now
  hardly expectant and not at all impatient but rather disposed to favour a
  little further delay. But presently the winter drew off her forces
  reluctantly, like a defeated army, with rear guard actions of rain and
  howling gales. And then the days began to lengthen, the sunbeams to shed a
  sensible warmth; the birds ventured on tentative twitterings and the buds
  made it clear that they were getting ready for business. In short, the spring
  was close at hand; and with the coming of spring, Mr. Pottermack's fancy
  lightly turned to thoughts of inquests.</p>

  <p>For the time had come. The long months of waiting had been all to the
  good. They had given the crude understudy time to mature, to assimilate
  itself to its setting and to take on the style of the principal actor. But
  the preparatory stage must not be unduly prolonged or it might defeat its own
  end. There might come a stage at which the transformation would be so
  complete as not only to prevent the detection of the imposture but to render
  identification even of the counterfeit impossible. Hence, as the spring
  sunshine brightened and the buds began to burst, Mr. Pottermack's expectancy
  revived, not untinged with anxiety. Hopefully his thoughts dwelt on
  primrose-gatherers and rambling juveniles in search of birds' nests and eggs;
  and when still no news was heard from the gravel-pit, he began seriously to
  consider the abandonment of his purely passive attitude and the adoption of
  some active measures to bring about the discovery.</p>

  <p>It was a difficult problem. The one thing that was quite clear to him was
  that he must on no account appear personally in the matter. He could not say
  exactly why. But he had that feeling, and probably he was right. But if he
  could not appear in it himself, how was the thing to be managed? That was the
  question that he put to himself a hundred times in a day, but to which he
  could find no answer. And as events fell out, no answer had, after all, to be
  found, for a contingency that he had never contemplated arose and solved his
  problem for him.</p>

  <p>It happened that on a fine sunny day after a spell of wet he was moved to
  take a walk along the path through the wood, which he had not done for a week
  or two. He was conscious of a rather strong desire to pay a visit to the pit
  and see for himself how matters were progressing, but he had no intention of
  yielding to this weakness; for the nearer the discovery, the more necessary
  it was for him to keep well in the background. Accordingly he trudged on,
  propounding to himself again and again that seemingly unanswerable question,
  and meanwhile picking up half-unconsciously the old landmarks. He had
  approached within a few yards of the well-remembered "departure" beech tree
  when he suddenly caught sight of a new feature that brought him instantly to
  a stand. Right across the path, cutting deep into the soft loam of the
  surface, was a pair of cart-ruts with a row of large hoof-marks between them.
  They were obviously quite fresh, and it was clear, by the depth and width of
  the ruts and by the number of hoof-prints and the fact that they pointed in
  both directions, that they had been made by more than one cart, or at least
  by more than one journey to and fro of a single cart.</p>

  <p>As he was standing eagerly examining them and speculating on what they
  portended, a hollow rumbling on his right heralded the approach of an empty
  cart from the west. A few moments later it came into sight through an opening
  just beyond the beech, the carter, dismounted, leading his horse by the
  bridle. Seeing Pottermack, he touched his hat and civilly wished him good
  morning.</p>

  <p>"Now, where might you be off to?" Pottermack enquired genially.</p>

  <p>"To the old gravel-pit, sir," was the reply. "'Tis many a year since any
  gravel was dug there. But Mr. Barber he's a-makin' a lot of this here
  concrate stuff for to put into the foundations of the new houses what he's
  buildin', and he thought as it were foolishness to send for gravel to a
  distance when there's a-plenty close at hand. So we're a-openin' up the old
  pit."</p>

  <p>"Where about is the pit?" asked Pottermack. "Is it far from here?"</p>

  <p>"Far! Lor' bless yer, no, sir. Just a matter of a few hundred yards. If
  you like to walk along with me, I'll show you the place."</p>

  <p>Pottermack accepted the offer promptly, and as the man started his horse
  with a friendly "gee-up," he walked alongside, following the new ruts down
  the familiar track&mdash;less familiar now that the great hoofs and the wide
  cart wheels had cleared an open space&mdash;until they came out at the top of
  the rough road that led down to the pit. Here Pottermack halted, wishing his
  friend "good morning," and stood watching the cart as it rumbled down the
  slope and skirted the floor of the pit towards a spot where a bright-coloured
  patch on the weathered "face" showed the position of the new working.</p>

  <p>Here Pottermack could see two men loosening the gravel with picks and two
  more shovelling the fallen stuff into a cart that was now nearly full. The
  place where they were at work was on the right side of the pit, as Pottermack
  stood, and nearly opposite to the cave, the gates of which he could see
  somewhat to his left. Standing there, he made a rapid mental note of the
  relative positions, and then, turning about, made his way back to the path,
  cogitating profoundly as he went.</p>

  <p>How long would it be before one of those men made the momentous discovery?
  Or was it possible that they might miss it altogether? The British labourer
  is not by nature highly observant, nor has he an excessively active
  curiosity. Nearly the whole width of the pit separated them from the remains.
  No occasion need arise for them to stray away from the spot where their
  business lay. But it would be exasperating if they should work there for a
  week or two and then go away leaving the discovery still to be made.</p>

  <p>However, it was of no use to be pessimistic. There was a fair probability
  that one of them would at least go round to the cave. Quite possibly it might
  again be put to its original use as a cart-shelter. For his part, he could do
  no more than wait upon the will of Fortune and meanwhile hold himself
  prepared for whatever might befall. But in spite of the latter discreet
  resolution, the discovery, when it came, rather took him by surprise. He was
  lingering luxuriously over his after-breakfast pipe some four or five days
  after his meeting with the carter, idly turning over the leaves of a new
  book, while his thoughts circled about the workers in the pit and balanced
  the chances of their stumbling upon that gruesome figure under the cliff,
  when a familiar knock at the front door dispelled his reverie in an instant
  and turned his thoughts to more pleasant topics. He had risen and was about
  to go to the door himself, but was anticipated by Mrs. Gadby, who, a few
  moments later, announced and ushered in Mrs. Bellard.</p>

  <p>Pottermack advanced to greet her, but was instantly struck by something
  strange and disquieting in her appearance and manner. She stopped close by
  the door until the housekeeper's footsteps had died away, then, coming close
  to him, exclaimed almost in a whisper:</p>

  <p>"Marcus, have you heard&mdash;about James, I mean?"</p>

  <p>"James!" repeated Pottermack helplessly, his wits for the moment paralysed
  by the suddenness of the disclosure; then, pulling himself together with a
  violent effort, he asked: "You don't mean to say that fellow has turned up
  again?"</p>

  <p>"Then you haven't heard. He is dead, Marcus. They found his body yesterday
  evening. The news is all over the town this morning."</p>

  <p>"My word!" exclaimed Pottermack. "This is news with a vengeance! Where was
  he found?"</p>

  <p>"Quite near here. In a gravel-pit in Potter's Wood. He must have fallen
  into it the very night that he went away."</p>

  <p>"Good gracious!" ejaculated Pottermack. "What an astonishing thing! Then
  he must have been lying there all these months! But&mdash;er&mdash;I suppose
  there is no doubt that it is Lewson's body?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not the least. Of course the body itself was quite unrecognizable.
  They say it actually dropped to pieces when they tried to pick it up. Isn't
  it horrible? But the police were able to identify it by the clothes and some
  letters and visiting-cards in the pockets. Otherwise there was practically
  nothing left but the bones. It makes me shudder to think of it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Pottermack admitted calmly, his self-possession being now restored,
  "it does sound rather unpleasant. But it might have been worse. He might have
  turned up alive. Now you are rid of him for good."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," said she; "and I can't pretend that it isn't a great relief
  to know that he is dead. But still&mdash;what ought I to do, Marcus?"</p>

  <p>"Do?" Pottermack repeated in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Yes. I feel that I ought to do something. After all, he was my
  husband."</p>

  <p>"And a shocking bad husband at that. But I don't understand what you mean.
  What do you suppose you ought to do?"</p>

  <p>"Well, don't you think that somebody&mdash;somebody belonging to
  him&mdash;ought to come forward to&mdash;to identify him?"</p>

  <p>"But," exclaimed Pottermack, "you said that there is nothing left of him
  but his bones. Now, my dear, you know you can't identify his bones. You've
  never seen them. Besides, he has been identified already."</p>

  <p>"Well, say, to acknowledge him."</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Alice, why on earth should you acknowledge him, when you
  had, years ago, repudiated him, and even taken another name to avoid being in
  any way associated with him? No, no, my dear, you just keep quiet and let
  things take their course. This is one of those cases in which a still tongue
  shows a wise head. Think of all the scandal and gossip that you would start
  if you were to come forward and announce yourself as Mrs. Lewson. You would
  never be able to go on living here. I take it that no one in this place knows
  who you are?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul."</p>

  <p>"And how many people altogether know that you were married to him?"</p>

  <p>"Very few, and those practically all strangers. We lived a very solitary
  life at Leeds."</p>

  <p>"Very well. Then the least said the soonest mended. Besides," he added, as
  another highly important consideration burst on him, "there is our future to
  think of. You are still willing to marry me, dear, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, Marcus, of course I am. But please don't let us talk about it
  now."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to, my dear, but we have to settle this other matter. The
  position now is that we can get married whenever we please."</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is no obstacle now."</p>

  <p>"Then, Alice dearest, don't let us make obstacles. But we shall if we make
  known the fact that you were Lewson's wife. Just think of the position. Here
  were you and your husband in the same town, posing as total strangers. And
  here were you and I, intimate friends and generally looked upon almost as an
  engaged couple. Now, suppose that we marry in the reasonably near future.
  That alone would occasion a good deal of comment. But suppose that it should
  turn out that Lewson met his death by foul means. What do you imagine people
  would say then?"</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed Alice. "I had never thought of that. Of course,
  people&mdash;or at any rate, some people&mdash;would say that we had
  conspired to get him out of the way. And really, that is what it would look
  like. I am glad I came and consulted you."</p>

  <p>Pottermack drew a deep breath. So that danger was past. Not that it had
  been a very obvious danger. But instinct warned him&mdash;and it was a
  perfectly sound instinct&mdash;to avoid at all costs having his personality
  in any way connected with that of James Lewson. Now he would be able to watch
  the course of events at his ease, and to all appearance from the detached
  standpoint of a total stranger. Nor was Alice less relieved. Some obscure
  sense of loyalty had seemed to impel her to proclaim her relationship to the
  dead wastrel. But she was not unwilling to be convinced of her mistake; and
  when presently she went away, her heart was all the lighter for feeling
  herself excused from the necessity of laying bare to the public gaze the
  sordid details of her domestic tragedy.</p>

  <p>When she was gone, Pottermack reflected on the situation and considered
  what he had better do. Caution conflicted with inclination. He was on the
  very tiptoe of curiosity, but yet he felt that he must show no undue interest
  in the affair. Nevertheless, it was desirable that he should know, if
  possible, what had really happened and what was going to be done about it.
  Accordingly he decided to go forth and perambulate the town and passively
  permit the local quidnuncs to supply him with the latest details.</p>

  <p>He did not, however, add much to his knowledge excepting in one important
  respect, which was that the date of the inquest was already fixed. It was to
  take place at three o'clock in the afternoon on the next day but one; and
  having regard to the public interest in the case, the inquiry was to be held
  in the Town Hall. When he had ascertained this fact, and that the public
  would have free access to the hall during the proceedings, he went home and
  resolved to manifest no further interest in the case until those proceedings
  should open.</p>

  <p>But the interval was one of intense though suppressed excitement. He could
  settle to nothing either in the workshop or in the garden. He could only seek
  relief in interminable tramps along the country roads. His mind seethed with
  mingled anxiety and hope. For the inquest was the final scene of this strange
  drama of which he was at once author and stage manager; and it was the goal
  of all his endeavours. If it went off successfully, James Lewson would be
  finished with for ever; he would be dead, buried, and duly registered at
  Somerset House; and Marcus Pottermack could murmur "Nunc dimittis" and go his
  way in peace.</p>

  <p>Naturally enough, he was punctual, and more than punctual, in his
  attendance at the Town Hall on the appointed day, for he arrived at the
  entrance nearly half an hour before the time announced for the opening of the
  inquiry. However, he was not alone. There were others still more punctual and
  equally anxious to secure good places. In fact, there was quite a substantial
  crowd of early place-seekers which grew from moment to moment. But their
  punctuality failed to serve its purpose, since the main doors were still
  closed and a constable stationed in front of them barred all access. Some of
  them strayed into the little square or yard adjoining, apparently for the
  satisfaction of looking at the closed door of the mortuary on its farther
  side.</p>

  <p>Pottermack circulated among the crowd, speaking to no one but listening to
  the disjointed scraps of conversation that came his way. His state of mind
  was very peculiar. He was acutely anxious, excited, and expectant. But behind
  these natural feelings he had a queer sense of aloofness, of superiority to
  these simple mortals around him, including the coroner and the police. For he
  knew all about it, whereas they would presently grope their way laboriously
  to a conclusion, and a wrong conclusion at that. He knew whose were the
  remains lying in the mortuary. He could have told them that they were about
  to mistake the scanty vestiges of a libationer of the nineteenth or twentieth
  dynasty for the body of the late James Lewson. So it was that he listened
  with a sort of indulgent complacency to the eager discussions concerning the
  mysterious end of the deceased branch manager.</p>

  <p>Presently a report began to circulate that a gentleman had been admitted
  to the mortuary by the sergeant and, as the crowd forthwith surged along in
  that direction, he allowed himself willingly to be carried with it. Arrived
  at the little square, the would-be spectators developed a regular gyratory
  movement down one side and up the other, being kept on the move by audible
  requests to "pass along, please." In due course Pottermack came in sight of
  the mortuary door, now half open and guarded by a police-sergeant who
  struggled vainly to combine the incompatible qualities of majestic
  impassivity and a devouring curiosity as to what was going on inside.</p>

  <p>At length Pottermack reached the point at which he could see in through
  the half-open door, and at the first glance his "superiority complex"
  underwent sudden dissolution. A tall man, whose back was partly turned
  towards him, held in his hand a shoe, the sole of which he was examining with
  concentrated attention. Pottermack stopped dead, gazing at him in
  consternation. Then the sergeant sang out his oft-repeated command and
  Pottermack was aware of increasing pressure from behind. But at the very
  instant when he was complying with the sergeant's injunction to "pass along,"
  the tall man turned his head to look out at the door and their eyes met. And
  at the sight of the man's face Pottermack could have shrieked aloud.</p>

  <p>It was the strange lawyer.</p>

  <p>For some moments Pottermack's faculties were completely paralysed by this
  apparition. He drifted on passively with the crowd in a state of numb dismay.
  Presently, however, as the effects of the shock passed off and his wits began
  to revive, some of his confidence revived with them. After all, what was
  there to be so alarmed about? The man was only a lawyer, and he had seemed
  harmless enough when they had talked together at the gate. True, he had
  seemed to be displaying an unholy interest in the soles of those shoes. But
  what of that? Those soles were all correct, even to the gash in the horse's
  neck. They were, in fact, the most convincing and unassailable part of the
  make-up.</p>

  <p>But, encourage himself as he would, the unexpected appearance of this
  lawyer had given his nerves a nasty jar. It suggested a number of rather
  disquieting questions. For instance, how came this man to turn up at this
  "psychological moment" like a vulture sniffing from afar a dead camel in the
  desert? Why was he looking at those soles with such extraordinary interest?
  Was it possible that he had seen those photographs? And if so, might they
  have shown something that was invisible to the unaided eye?</p>

  <p>These questions came crowding into Mr. Pottermack's mind, each one more
  disquieting than the others. But always he came back to the most disquieting
  one of all. How, in the name of Beelzebub, came this lawyer to make his
  appearance in the Borley mortuary at this critical and most inopportune
  moment?</p>

  <p>It was natural that Mr. Pottermack should ask himself this very pertinent
  question; for, in truth, it did appear a singular coincidence. And inasmuch
  as coincidences usually seem to demand some explanation, we may venture to
  pursue the question that the reader may attain to the enlightenment that was
  denied to Mr. Pottermack.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XV&mdash;DR. THORNDYKE'S CURIOSITY IS AROUSED</h3>

  <p>The repercussions of Mr. Pottermack's activities made themselves felt at a
  greater distance than he had bargained for. By the agency of an enterprising
  local reporter they became communicated to the daily press, and thereby to
  the world at large, including Number 5A King's Bench Walk, Inner Temple,
  London, E.C., and the principal occupant thereof. The actual purveyor of
  intelligence to the latter was Mr. Nathaniel Polton, and the communication
  took place in the afternoon of the day following the discovery. At this time
  Dr. Thorndyke was seated at the table with an open brief before him, jotting
  down a few suggestions for his colleague, Mr. Anstey, when to him entered
  Nathaniel Polton aforesaid, with a tray of tea-things in one hand and the
  evening paper in the other. Having set down the tray, he presented the paper,
  neatly folded into a small oblong, with a few introductory words.</p>

  <p>"There is a rather curious case reported in the Evening Post, sir. Looks
  rather like something in our line. I thought you might be interested to see
  it, so I've brought you the paper."</p>

  <p>"Very good of you, Polton," said Thorndyke, holding out his hand with
  slightly exaggerated eagerness. "Curious cases are always worth our
  attention."</p>

  <p>Accordingly he proceeded to give his attention to the marked paragraph;
  but at the first glance at the heading, the interest which he had assumed out
  of courtesy to his henchman became real and intense. Polton noted the change,
  and his lined face crinkled up into a smile of satisfaction as he watched his
  employer reading the paragraph through with a concentration that, even to
  him, seemed hardly warranted by the matter. For, after all, there was no
  mystery about the affair, so far as he could see. It was just curious and
  rather gruesome. And Polton had distinct liking for the gruesome. So,
  apparently, had the reporter, for he used that very word to lend attraction
  to his heading. Thus:&mdash; 'Gruesome discovery at Borley.'</p>

  <p>'Yesterday afternoon some labourers who were digging gravel in a pit in
  Potter's Wood, Borley, near Aylesbury, made a shocking discovery. When going
  round the pit to inspect a disused cart-shelter, they were horrified at
  coming suddenly upon the much-decomposed body of a man lying at the foot of
  the perpendicular 'face,' down which he had apparently fallen some months
  previously. Later it was ascertained that the dead man is a certain James
  Lewson, the late manager of the local branch of Perkins's Bank, who
  disappeared mysteriously about nine months ago. An inquest on the body is to
  be held at the Town Hall, Borley, on Thursday next at 3 p.m., when the
  mystery of the disappearance and death will no doubt be elucidated.'</p>

  <p>"A very singular case, Polton," said Thorndyke, as he returned the paper
  to its owner. "Thank you for drawing my attention to it."</p>

  <p>"There doesn't seem to be any mystery as to how the man met his death,"
  remarked Polton, cunningly throwing out this remark in the hope of eliciting
  some illuminating comments. "He seems to have just tumbled into the pit and
  broken his neck."</p>

  <p>"That is what is suggested," Thorndyke agreed. But there are all sorts of
  other possibilities. It would be quite interesting to attend the inquest and
  bear the evidence."</p>

  <p>"There is no reason why you shouldn't, sir," said Polton. "You've got no
  arrangements for Thursday that can't easily be put off."</p>

  <p>"No, that is true," Thorndyke rejoined. "I must think it over and consider
  whether it would be worth giving up the time."</p>

  <p>But he did not think it over, for the reason that he had already made up
  his mind. Even as he read the paragraph, it was clear to him that here was a
  case that called aloud for investigation.</p>

  <p>The call was twofold. In the first place he was profoundly interested in
  all the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of James Lewson. In any
  event he would have wished to make his understanding of the case complete.
  But there was another and a more urgent reason for inquiry. Hitherto his
  attitude had been simply spectatorial. Neither as a citizen nor as an officer
  of the law had he felt called upon to interfere. Now it became incumbent on
  him to test the moral validity of his position; to ascertain whether that
  detached attitude was admissible in these new circumstances.</p>

  <p>The discovery had taken him completely by surprise. Some developments he
  had rather expected. The appearance of the stolen notes, for instance, had
  not surprised him at all. It had seemed quite "according to plan"; just a
  manoeuvre to shift the area of inquiry. But this new development admitted of
  no such explanation; for if it was an "arrangement" of some kind, what could
  be the motive? There appeared to be none.</p>

  <p>He was profoundly puzzled. If this was really James Lewson's body, then
  the whole of his elaborate scheme of reasoning was fallacious. But it was not
  fallacious. For it had led him to the conclusion that Mr. Marcus Pottermack
  was Jeffrey Brandon, deceased. And investigation had proved beyond a doubt
  that that conclusion was correct. But a hypothesis which, on being applied,
  yields a new truth&mdash;and one that is conditional upon its very
  terms&mdash;must be true. But again, if his reasoning was correct, this could
  not be Lewson's body.</p>

  <p>But if it was not Lewson's body, whose body was it? And how came it to be
  dressed in Lewson's clothes&mdash;if they really were Lewson's clothes and
  not a carefully substituted make-up? It was here that the question of public
  policy arose. For here was undoubtedly a dead person. If that person proved
  to be James Lewson, there was nothing more to be said. But if he were not
  James Lewson, then it became his, Thorndyke's, duty as a citizen and a
  barrister to ascertain who he was and how his body came to be dressed in
  Lewson's clothes; or, at least, to set going inquiries to that effect.</p>

  <p>That evening he rapidly reviewed the material on which his reasoning had
  been based. Then, unrolling the strip of photographs, he selected a pair of
  the most distinct&mdash;showing a right and a left foot&mdash;and, with the
  aid of the little document microscope, made an enlarged drawing of each on
  squared paper to a scale of three inches to the foot, i.e. a quarter of the
  natural size. The drawings, however, were little more than outlines, showing
  none of the detail of the soles; but the dimensions were accurately rendered,
  excepting those of the screws which secured the heels, which were drawn
  disproportionately large and the position of the slots marked in with special
  care and exactness.</p>

  <p>With these drawings in his pocket and the roll of photographs in his
  attache-case for reference if any unforeseen question should arise, Thorndyke
  started forth on the Thursday morning en route for Borley. He did not
  anticipate any difficulties. An inquest which he had attended at Aylesbury
  some months previously had made him acquainted with the coroner who would
  probably conduct this inquiry; but in any case, the production of his card
  would secure him the necessary facilities.</p>

  <p>It turned out, however, that his acquaintance was to conduct the
  proceedings, though he had not yet arrived when Thorndyke presented himself
  at the Town Hall nearly an hour before the time when the inquest was due to
  open. But the police officer on duty, after a glance at his card, showed him
  up to the coroner's room and provided him with a newspaper wherewith to while
  away the time of waiting; which Thorndyke made a show of reading, as a
  precaution against possible attempts at conversation, until the officer had
  retired, when he brought forth the two drawings and occupied himself in
  memorizing the dimensions and other salient characteristics of the
  footprints.</p>

  <p>He had been waiting close upon twenty minutes when he heard a quick step
  upon the stair and the coroner entered the room with extended hand.</p>

  <p>"How do you do, doctor?" he exclaimed, shaking Thorndyke's hand warmly.
  "This is indeed an unexpected pleasure. Have you come down to lend us a hand
  in solving the mystery?"</p>

  <p>"Is there a mystery?" Thorndyke asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, no, there isn't," was the reply, "excepting how the poor fellow
  came to be wandering about the wood in the dark. But I take it, from your
  being here, that you are in some way interested or concerned in the
  case."</p>

  <p>"Not in the case," replied Thorndyke. "Only in the body. And my interest
  in that is rather academic. I understand that it is known to have been lying
  exposed in the open for nine months. Now, I have never had an opportunity of
  inspecting a body that has been exposed completely in the open for so long.
  Accordingly, as I happened to be in the neighbourhood, I thought that I would
  ask your kind permission just to look it over and make a few notes as to its
  condition"</p>

  <p>"I see; so that you may know exactly what a nine-months-old exposed body
  looks like, with a view to due future contingencies. But of course, my dear
  doctor, I shall be delighted to help you to this modest extent. Would you
  like to make your inspection now?"</p>

  <p>"How will that suit you?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly. The jury will be going in to view the remains in about half an
  hour, but they won't interfere with your proceedings. But you will probably
  be finished by then. Are you coming to the inquest?"</p>

  <p>"I may as well, as I have nothing special to do for an hour or two; and
  the evidence may help me to amplify my notes."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said the coroner, "then I will see that a chair is kept for
  you. And now I will tell Sergeant Tatnell to take you to the mortuary and see
  that you are not disturbed while you are making your notes."</p>

  <p>Hereupon, the sergeant, being called in and given his instructions, took
  Thorndyke in custody and conducted him down a flight of stairs to a side door
  which opened on a small square, on the opposite side of which was the
  mortuary. A considerable crowd had already collected here, in front of the
  Town Hall and at the entrance of the square, and by its members Thorndyke's
  emergence with the sergeant by no means passed unnoticed; and when the latter
  proceeded to unlock the mortuary door and admit the former, there was a
  general movement of the crowd into the square with a tendency to converge on
  the mortuary door.</p>

  <p>The sergeant, having admitted Thorndyke, gazed at him hungrily as he
  pointed out the rather obvious whereabouts of the corpse and the clothing.
  Then, with evident reluctance, he retired, leaving the door half open and
  stationing himself on guard in a position which commanded an unobstructed
  view of the interior. Thorndyke would rather have had the door closed, but he
  realized the sergeant's state of mind and viewed it not unsympathetically.
  And a spectator or two was of no consequence since he was merely making an
  inspection.</p>

  <p>As the sergeant had obligingly explained, the body was in the open shell
  or coffin which rested on one of the tables, while the clothing was laid out
  on an adjoining table in a manner slightly reminiscent of a rummage sale or a
  stall in the Petticoat Lane Market. Having put down his attache-case,
  Thorndyke began his inspection with the clothing, and, bearing in mind the
  sergeant's eye, which was following his every movement, he first looked over
  the garments, one by one, until he came naturally to the shoes. These he
  inspected from various points of view, and when he had minutely examined the
  uppers he picked up the right shoe, and, turning it over, looked at the heel.
  And in the instant that his glance fell on it his question was answered.</p>

  <p>It was not Lewson's shoe.</p>

  <p>Putting it down, he picked up the left shoe and inspected it in the same
  manner. It gave the same answer as the right had done, and each confirmed the
  other with the force of cumulative evidence. These were not James Lewson's
  shoes. There was no need to apply the measurements that he had marked on his
  diagrams. The single fact which he had elicited settled the matter.</p>

  <p>It was quite a plain and obvious fact, too, though it had escaped the
  police for the simple reason that they were not looking for a discrepancy in
  the position of the screws. But it was absolutely conclusive. For the central
  screw by which a circular rubber heel is secured is of necessity a fixture.
  When once it is driven in, it remains immovable so long as the heel continues
  in position. For if the screw turns in the slightest degree, its hold is
  loosened, it unscrews from its hole and the heel comes off. But these heels
  had not come off. They were quite firmly attached, as Thorndyke ascertained
  by grasping them and as was proved by the extent to which they were worn
  down. Therefore the screws could not have moved. But yet their slots were at
  a totally different angle from the slots of the screws in Lewson's shoes.</p>

  <p>He was standing with the shoe in his hand when a sharply spoken command
  from the sergeant to "pass along, please" caused him half-unconsciously to
  turn his head. As he did so, he became aware of Mr. Pottermack gazing at him
  through the half-open door with an expression of something very like
  consternation. The glance was only momentary, for, even as their eyes met,
  Pottermack moved away in obedience to the sergeant's command, reinforced by a
  vigorous vis a tergo applied by the spectators in his rear.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke smiled grimly at the coincidence&mdash;which was hardly a
  coincidence at all&mdash;and then returned to the consideration of the shoes.
  He had thoroughly memorized his drawings, but still, his rigorously exact
  mind demanded verification. Accordingly he placed both shoes sole uppermost
  and&mdash;with his back to the sergeant&mdash;produced the drawings from his
  pocket for comparison with the shoes. Of course he had made no mistake. In
  the drawing of the right foot, the slot of the screw was at a right angle to
  the long axis of the shoe&mdash;in the position of the hands of a clock at a
  quarter to three; in the right shoe before him, the slot was oblique&mdash;in
  the position of the clock-hands at five minutes past seven. So with the left;
  in the drawing it was in the position of ten minutes to four; in the mortuary
  shoe it was in that of twenty minutes to two.</p>

  <p>The proof was conclusive, and it justified Thorndyke's forecast. For he
  had assumed that if the shoes on the discovered body were counterfeits, the
  one detail which the counterfeiter would overlook or neglect would be the
  position of the screw-slots; while, by the ordinary laws of probability, it
  was infinitely unlikely that the positions of the slots would happen to match
  in both feet by mere chance.</p>

  <p>But, this point being settled, a more important one arose. If the shoes
  were not Lewson's shoes, the body was probably not Lewson's body. And if it
  were not, then it was the body of some other person; which conclusion would
  raise the further question. How was that body obtained? This was the vitally
  important issue, for it would appear that the having possession of a dead
  human body almost necessarily implies the previous perpetration of some
  highly criminal act.</p>

  <p>So Thorndyke reflected, a little anxiously, as he stood by the open shell,
  looking down on the scanty remains of what had once been a man. His position
  was somewhat difficult, for, since he had never seen Lewson and knew nothing
  of his personal characteristics beyond his approximate age and what he had
  inferred from the footprints&mdash;that he was a man approaching six feet in
  height, which appeared to be also true of the body in the shell&mdash;he had
  no effective means of identification. Nevertheless, it was possible that a
  careful examination might bring into view some distinctive characters that
  would furnish a basis for further inquiry when the witnesses should presently
  be called.</p>

  <p>Thus encouraging himself, he began to look over the gruesome occupant of
  the shell more critically. And now, as his eye travelled over it, he began to
  be conscious of an indefinite something in its aspect that was not quite
  congruous with the ostensible circumstances. It seemed to have wasted in a
  somewhat unusual manner. Then his attention was attracted by the very
  peculiar appearance of the toe-nails. They showed a distinct orange-yellow
  coloration which was obviously abnormal, and when he turned for comparison to
  the finger-nails, traces of the same unnatural colour were detectable though
  much less distinct.</p>

  <p>Here was a definite suggestion. Following it up, he turned his attention
  to the teeth, and at once the suggestion was confirmed. These were the teeth
  of no modern civilized European. The crowns of the molars, cuspless and
  ground down to a level surface, spoke of the gritty meal from a hand-quern
  and other refractory food-stuffs beyond the powers of degenerate civilized
  man. Still following the clue, Thorndyke peered into the nasal cavities, the
  entrance to which had been exposed by the almost complete disappearance of
  the nose. With the aid of a tiny pocket electric lamp, he was able to make
  out on both sides extensive fractures of the inner bones&mdash;the turbinates
  and ethmoid. In the language of the children's game, he was "getting warm";
  and when he had made a close and prolonged examination of the little that was
  left of the abdomen, his last lingering doubts were set at rest.</p>

  <p>He stood up, at length, with a grim but appreciative smile, and
  recapitulated his findings. Here was a body, found in a gravel-pit, clothed
  in the habiliments of one James Lewson. The toe- and finger-nails were
  stained with henna; the teeth were the characteristic teeth of somewhat
  primitive man; the ethmoid and turbinate bones were fractured in a manner
  incomprehensible in connection with any known natural agency but in precisely
  the manner in which they would have been damaged by the embalmer's hook;
  there was not the faintest trace of any abdominal viscera, and there did
  appear to be&mdash;though this was not certain, owing to the wasted condition
  of the remains&mdash;some signs of an incision in the abdominal wall; and
  finally, the hair showed evidence of chemical corrosion, not to be accounted
  for by any mere exposure to the weather. In short, this body displayed a
  group of distinctive features which, taken collectively, were characteristic
  of, and peculiar to, an Egyptian mummy; and that it was an Egyptian mummy he
  felt no doubt whatever.</p>

  <p>He hailed the conclusion with a sigh of relief. He had come here prepared
  to intervene at the inquest and challenge the identity of the corpse if he
  had found any evidence of the perpetration of a crime. But he would have been
  profoundly reluctant to intervene. Now there was no need to intervene, since
  there was no reason to suppose that any crime had been committed. Possession
  of an Egyptian mummy does not imply any criminal act. Admittedly, these
  proceedings of Mr. Pottermack's were highly irregular. But that was a
  different matter. Allowance had to be made for special circumstances.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, Thorndyke was not a little puzzled. Acting on his invariable
  principle, he had disregarded the apparent absence of motive and had steadily
  pursued the visible facts. But now the question of motive arose as a separate
  problem. What could be the purpose that lay behind this quaint and ingenious
  personation of a dead man? Some motive there must have been, and a powerful
  motive too. Its strength could be measured by the enormous amount of patient
  and laborious preparation that the result must have entailed, to say nothing
  of the risk. What could that motive have been? It did not, apparently, arise
  out of the original circumstances. There must be something else that had not
  yet come into view. Perhaps the evidence at the inquest might throw some
  light upon it.</p>

  <p>At any rate, no crime had been committed, and as to this dummy inquest,
  there was no harm in it. On the contrary, it was all to the good. For it
  would establish and put on record a fact which otherwise would have gone
  unascertained and unrecorded, but which ought, on public grounds, to be duly
  certified and recorded.</p>

  <p>As Thorndyke reached this comfortable conclusion, the sergeant announced
  the approach of the jury to view the body; whereupon he picked up his
  attache-case, and, emerging from the mortuary, made his way to the court-room
  and took possession of a chair which a constable was holding in reserve for
  him, close to that which was to be occupied by the coroner.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;EXIT KHAMA-HERU</h3>

  <p>Having taken his seat&mdash;and wished that it had been a little farther
  from the coroner's&mdash;Thorndyke glanced round the large court-room, noting
  the unusual number of spectators and estimating from it the intense local
  interest in the inquiry. And as his eye roamed round, it presently alighted
  on Mr. Pottermack, who had secured a seat in a favourable position near the
  front and was endeavouring, quite unsuccessfully, to appear unaware of
  Thorndyke's arrival. So unsuccessful, indeed, were his efforts that
  inevitably their eyes met, and then there was nothing for it but to
  acknowledge as graciously as he could the lawyer's friendly nod of
  recognition.</p>

  <p>Pottermack's state of mind was one of agonized expectation. He struggled
  manfully enough to summon up some sort of confidence. He told himself that
  this fellow was only a lawyer, and that lawyers know nothing about bodies.
  Now, if he had been a doctor it might have been a different matter. But there
  was that accursed shoe. He had certainly looked at that as if he saw
  something unusual about it; and there was no reason why a lawyer shouldn't
  know something about shoes. Yet what could he have seen in it? There was
  nothing to see. It was a genuine shoe, and the soles and heels were
  unquestionably correct in every detail. He, Pottermack, could hardly have
  distinguished them from the originals himself.</p>

  <p>So his feelings oscillated miserably between unreasonable hope and an all
  too reasonable alarm. He would have got up and gone out but that even his
  terrors urged him to stay at all costs and hear what this lawyer should say
  when his turn came to give evidence. And thus, though he longed to escape, he
  remained glued to his chair, waiting, waiting for the mine to blow up; and
  whenever his roving glance fell, as it constantly did from minute to minute,
  on the sphinx-like countenance of that inopportune lawyer, a cold chill ran
  down his spine.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke, catching from time to time that wandering, apprehensive gaze,
  was alive to Mr. Pottermack's condition and felt a humane regret that it was
  impossible to reassure him and put an end to his sufferings. He realized how
  sinister a significance his unexpected arrival would seem to bear to the eyes
  of the self-conscious gamester, sitting there trembling for the success of
  his last venture. And the position was made even worse when the coroner,
  re-entering with the jury, stopped to confer with him before taking his
  seat.</p>

  <p>"You had a good look at the body, doctor?" he asked, stooping and speaking
  almost in a whisper. "I wonder if it would be fair for me to ask you a
  question?"</p>

  <p>"Let us hear the question," Thorndyke replied cautiously.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is this: the medical witness that I am calling is the police
  surgeon's locum tenens. I don't know anything about him, but I suspect that
  he hasn't had much experience. He tells me that he can find nothing definite
  to indicate the cause of death, but that there are no signs of violence. What
  do you say to that?"</p>

  <p>"It is exactly what I should have said myself if I had been in his place,"
  Thorndyke replied. "I saw nothing that gave any hint as to the cause of
  death. You will have to settle that question on evidence other than
  medical."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, thank you," said the coroner. "You have set my mind completely
  at rest. Now I will get on with the inquiry. It needn't take very long."</p>

  <p>He retired to his chair at the head of the long table, on one side of
  which sat the jury and on the other one or two reporters, and having seen
  that his writing materials were in order, prepared to begin. And Thorndyke,
  once more meeting Mr. Pottermack's eye, found it fixed on him with an
  expression of expectant horror.</p>

  <p>"The inquiry, gentlemen," the coroner began, "which we are about to
  conduct concerns the most regrettable death of a fellow-townsman of yours,
  Mr. James Lewson, who, as you probably know, disappeared rather mysteriously
  on the night of the 23rd of last July. Quite by chance, his dead body was
  discovered last Monday afternoon, and it will be our duty to inquire and
  determine how, when, and where he met with his death. I need not trouble you
  with a long preliminary statement, as the testimony of the witnesses will
  supply you with the facts and you will be entitled to put any questions that
  you may wish to amplify them. We had better begin with the discovery of the
  body and take events in their chronological order. Joseph Crick."</p>

  <p>In response to this summons a massively built labourer rose and advanced
  sheepishly to the table. Having been sworn, he deposed that his name was
  Joseph Crick and that he was a labourer in the employ of Mr. Barber, a local
  builder.</p>

  <p>"Well, Crick," said the coroner, "now tell us how you came to discover
  this body."</p>

  <p>The witness cast an embarrassed glance at the eager jurymen, and, having
  wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, began: "'Twere last Monday
  afternoon&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That was the thirteenth of April," the coroner interposed.</p>

  <p>"Maybe 'twere," the witness agreed cautiously, "I dunno. But 'twere last
  Monday afternoon. Me and Jim Wurdle had been workin' in the pit a-fillin' the
  carts with gravel. We'd filled the last cart and seen her off, and then, as
  it were gettin' on for knockin'-off time, we lights our pipes and goes for a
  stroll round the pit to have a look at the old shelter-place where they used
  to keep the carts in the winter. We'd got round to the gate and Jim Wurdle
  was a lookin'-in when I happened to notice a tree that had fell down from the
  top of the face. And then I see something layin' by the tree what had got a
  cap at one end and a pair of shoes at the other. Give me a regler start, it
  did. So I says to Jim Wurdle I says, Jim, I says, that's a funny-lookin'
  thing over yonder long-side the tree, I says. Looks like some one a-layin'
  down there, I says. So Jim Wurdle he looks at it and he says, 'right you are,
  mate,' he says,' so it do, he says. So we walked over to have a look at it
  and then we see as 'twere a dead man, or leastways a man's skillinton. Give
  us a rare turn, it did, to see it a-layin' there in its shabby old clothes
  with the beedles a-crawlin' about on it."</p>

  <p>"And what did you do then?" asked the coroner.</p>

  <p>"We sung out to the other chaps t'other side of the pit and told them
  about it, and then we set off for the town as hard as we could go until we
  come to the police station, where we see Sergeant Tatnell and told him about
  it; and he sent us back to the pit to wait for him and show him where it
  were."</p>

  <p>When the coroner had written down Crick's statement he glanced at the jury
  and enquired: "Do you wish to ask the witness any questions, gentlemen?" And
  as nobody expressed any such wish, he dismissed Crick and called James
  Wurdle, who, in effect, repeated the evidence of the previous witness and was
  in his turn dismissed.</p>

  <p>The next witness was Inspector Barnaby of the local police force, a
  shrewd-looking man of about fifty, who gave his evidence in the concise,
  exact manner proper to a police officer.</p>

  <p>"On Monday last, the thirteenth of April, at five twenty-one p.m., it was
  reported to me by Sergeant Tatnell that the dead body of a man had been
  discovered in the gravel-pit in Potter's Wood. I obtained an empty shell from
  the mortuary, and, having put it on a wheeled stretcher, proceeded with
  Sergeant Tatnell to the gravel-pit, where the previous witnesses showed us
  the place where the body was lying. We found the body lying at the foot of
  the gravel-face close to a tree that had fallen from the top. I examined it
  carefully before moving it. It was lying in a sprawling posture, not like
  that of a sleeping man but like that of a man who had fallen heavily. There
  were a few stones and some gravel on the body, but most of the gravel which
  had come down with the tree was underneath. The body was in an advanced stage
  of decay; so much so that it began to fall to pieces when we lifted it to put
  it into the shell. The head actually dropped off, and we had great trouble in
  preventing the legs from separating."</p>

  <p>An audible shudder ran round the court at this description and the coroner
  murmured, "Horrible! horrible!" But the inspector proceeded in matter-of-fact
  tones:</p>

  <p>"We conveyed the remains to the mortuary, where I removed the clothing
  from the body and examined it with a view to ascertaining the identity of
  deceased. The underclothing was marked clearly 'J. Lewson' and in the breast
  pocket of the coat I found a letter-case with the initials 'J.L.' stamped on
  the cover. Inside it were a number of visiting-cards bearing the name 'Mr.
  James Lewson' and the address 'Perkins's Bank, Borley, Bucks,' and some
  letters addressed to James Lewson, Esquire, at that address. In one of the
  trousers pockets I found a key, which looked like a safe key, and as there
  seemed to be no doubt that the body was that of Mr. Lewson, the late manager
  of the Borley branch of Perkins's Bank, I cleaned the rust off the key and
  showed it to Mr. Hunt, the present manager, who tried it in the lock of the
  safe and found that it entered and seemed to fit perfectly."</p>

  <p>"Did it shoot the bolt of the lock?" one of the jurors asked.</p>

  <p>"No," replied the inspector, "because, after Mr. Lewson went away and took
  the key with him, the manager had the levers of the lock altered and a pair
  of new keys made. But the old duplicate key was there, and when we compared
  it with the key from the body, it was obvious that the two keys were
  identical in pattern."</p>

  <p>"Did you take any other measures to identify the body?" the coroner
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. I checked the clothing carefully, garment by garment, by the
  description that we issued when Mr. Lewson disappeared, and it corresponded
  to the description in every respect. Then I got the caretaker from the bank
  to look it over, and he identified the clothes and shoes as those worn by Mr.
  Lewson on the night when he disappeared."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," said the coroner. "Most thorough and most conclusive. I
  think, gentlemen, that we can fairly take it as an established fact that the
  body is that of Mr. James Lewson. And now. Inspector, to return to the
  clothing; you have mentioned two articles found by you in deceased's pockets.
  What else did you find?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir. With the exception of those two articles&mdash;which I
  handed to you&mdash;the pockets were all completely empty."</p>

  <p>"And the letter-case?"</p>

  <p>"That contained nothing but letters, bills, cards, and a few stamps;
  nothing but what was in it when I gave it to you."</p>

  <p>Here the coroner opened his attache-case, and, taking from it the
  letter-wallet, the letters, cards, bills, and other contents, placed them,
  together with the key, on a wooden office tray which he pushed along the
  table for the jurymen's inspection. While they were curiously poring over the
  tray, he continued his examination.</p>

  <p>"Then you found nothing of value on the person of deceased?"</p>

  <p>"With the exception of the stamps, nothing whatsoever. The pockets were
  absolutely empty."</p>

  <p>"Do you happen to know if deceased, at the time of his disappearance, had
  any valuable property about him?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. It is nearly certain that when he went away at about eight
  o'clock on the night of Wednesday, the twenty-third of last July, he had on
  his person one hundred pounds in five-pound Bank of England notes."</p>

  <p>"When you say that it is nearly certain, what does that certainty amount
  to?"</p>

  <p>"It is based on the fact that after he had gone, banknotes to that amount
  were found to be missing from the bank."</p>

  <p>"And is it known what became of those notes?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. Their numbers were known and they have now all been recovered.
  As soon as they appeared in circulation they were traced; and in nearly every
  case traced to some person who was known to the police."</p>

  <p>"Is it certain that these notes were taken by deceased and not by some
  other person?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, practically certain. Deceased was in sole charge, and he had one key
  on his person and the other locked in the safe, where it was found when the
  lock was picked. But, if you will allow me, sir, I should like to say, in
  justice to deceased, that he had, apparently, no intention of stealing these
  notes, as was thought at first. Certain facts came to light later which
  seemed to show that he had merely borrowed this money to meet a sudden urgent
  call and that he meant to replace it."</p>

  <p>"I am sure every one will be very glad to hear that," said the coroner.
  "We need not go into the circumstances that you mention, as they do not seem
  relevant to this inquiry. But these notes raise an important point. If they
  were on his person when he went away and they were not on his body when it
  was found, and if, moreover, they are known to have been in circulation since
  his death, the question of robbery arises, and with it the further question
  of possible murder. Can you give us any help in considering those
  questions?"</p>

  <p>"I have formed certain opinions, sir, but, of course, it is a matter of
  guesswork."</p>

  <p>"Never mind, Inspector. A coroner's court is not bound by the strict rules
  of evidence; and, besides, yours is an expert opinion. Let us hear what view
  you take of the matter."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, my opinion is that deceased met his death by accident the
  night that he went away. I think that he fell into the pit in the dark,
  dislodging a lot of gravel and pulling the small tree down with him. Both the
  body and the tree were on top of the heap of gravel, but yet there was a good
  deal of gravel and some stones on the body."</p>

  <p>The coroner nodded and the witness proceeded:</p>

  <p>"Then I think that, about a month later, some tramp found the body and
  went through the pockets, and when he discovered the notes, he cleared off
  and said nothing about having seen the body."</p>

  <p>"Have you any specific reasons for this very definite theory?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir. First, there is clear evidence that the pit has been frequented
  by one or more tramps. Quite close to where the body was discovered is an old
  cart-shelter, dug out of the gravel, and that shelter has been used from time
  to time by some tramp or tramps as a residence. I found in it a quantity of
  wood-ashes and charcoal and large sooty deposits on the wall and roof,
  showing that many fires had been lit there. I also found an old billy, or
  boiling-can, a lot of rags and tramps' raffle and a quantity of small
  bones&mdash;mostly rabbits' and fowls' bones. So tramps have certainly been
  there.</p>

  <p>"Then the state of deceased's pockets suggests a tramp's robbery. It was
  not only the valuables that were taken. He had made a clean sweep of
  everything. Not a thing was left. Not even a pipe or a packet of cigarettes
  or even a match-box."</p>

  <p>"And as to the time that you mentioned?"</p>

  <p>"I am judging by the notes. A sharp look-out was kept for them from the
  first. A very sharp look-out. But for fully a month after the disappearance
  not one of them came to light. And then, suddenly, they began to come in one
  after the other and even in batches, as if the whole lot had been thrown into
  circulation at once. But if it had been a case of robbery with violence, the
  robber would have got rid of the notes immediately, before the hue and cry
  started."</p>

  <p>"So you consider that the possibility of robbery with murder may be ruled
  out?"</p>

  <p>"On the facts known to me, sir, I do&mdash;subject, of course, to the
  medical evidence."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said the coroner. "But in any case you have given us most
  valuable assistance. Is there any point, gentlemen, that is not quite clear,
  or any question that you wish to put to the inspector? No questions? Very
  well. Thank you, Inspector."</p>

  <p>The next witness called was the police surgeon's deputy, a youngish
  Irishman of somewhat convivial aspect. Having been sworn, he deposed that his
  name was Desmond M'Alarney, that he was a Doctor of Medicine and at present
  acting as locum tenens for the police surgeon, who was absent on leave.</p>

  <p>"Well, doctor," said the coroner, "I believe that you have made a careful
  examination of the body of deceased. Is that so?"</p>

  <p>"I have made a most careful examination, sir," was the reply, "though as
  to calling it a body, I would rather describe it as a skeleton."</p>

  <p>"Very well!" the coroner agreed good-humouredly, "call it what you like.
  Perhaps we may refer to it as the remains."</p>

  <p>"Ye may," replied the witness, "and mighty small remains, by the same
  token. But such as they are, I have examined them with the greatest
  care."</p>

  <p>"And did your examination enable you to form any opinion as to the cause
  of death?"</p>

  <p>"It did not."</p>

  <p>"Did you find any injuries or signs of violence?"</p>

  <p>"I did not."</p>

  <p>"Were any of the bones fractured or injured in any way?"</p>

  <p>"They were not."</p>

  <p>"Can you give us no suggestion as to the probable cause of death?"</p>

  <p>"I would suggest, sir, that a twenty-foot drop into a gravel-pit is a
  mighty probable cause of death."</p>

  <p>"No doubt," said the coroner. "But that is hardly a matter of medical
  evidence."</p>

  <p>"'Tis none the worse for that," the witness replied cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Can you say, definitely, that deceased did not meet his death by any kind
  of homicidal violence?"</p>

  <p>"I can not. When a body is rejuiced to a skeleton, all traces of violence
  are lost so long as there has been no breaking of bones. He might have been
  strangled or smothered or stabbed or had his throat cut without leaving any
  marks on the skeleton. I can only say that I found no indications of any kind
  of homicidal violence or any violence whatsoever."</p>

  <p>"The inspector has suggested that deceased met his death by
  accident&mdash;that is by the effects of the fall, and that appears to be
  your opinion too. Now, if that were the case, what would probably be the
  immediate cause of death?"</p>

  <p>"There are several possible causes, but the most probable would be shock,
  contusion of the brain, or dislocation of the neck."</p>

  <p>"Would any of those conditions leave recognizable traces?"</p>

  <p>"Contusion of the brain and dislocation of the neck could be recognized in
  the fresh body but not in a skeleton like this. Of course, if the dislocation
  were accompanied&mdash;as it very often is&mdash;by fracture of the little
  neck-bone known as the odontoid process of the axis, that could be seen in
  the skeleton. But there is no such fracture in the skeleton of deceased. I
  looked for it particularly."</p>

  <p>"Then we understand that you found nothing definite to indicate the cause
  of death?"</p>

  <p>"That is so, sir."</p>

  <p>"Do you consider that the appearance of the body, in a medical sense, is
  consistent with a belief that deceased was killed by the effects of the
  fall?"</p>

  <p>"I do, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then," said the coroner, "that seems to be about all that we can say as
  to the cause of death. Do the jury wish to put any questions to the medical
  witness? If not, we need not detain the doctor any longer."</p>

  <p>As Dr. M'Alarney picked up an uncommonly smart hat and retired, the
  coroner glanced quickly over his notes and then proceeded to address the
  jury.</p>

  <p>"I need not occupy your time, gentlemen, with a long summing-up. You have
  heard the evidence and probably have already arrived at your conclusions.
  There are certain mysterious circumstances in the case, as, for instance, how
  deceased came to be wandering about in the wood at night. But these questions
  do not concern us. We have to consider only how deceased met his death, and
  as the doctor justly remarked, the fact that the body was found at the bottom
  of a gravel-pit, having evidently fallen some eighteen or twenty feet, offers
  a pretty obvious explanation. The only suspicious circumstance was that
  deceased had clearly been robbed either before or after death. But you have
  heard the opinion of a very able and experienced police inspector, and the
  excellent reasons that he gave for that opinion. So I need say no more, but
  will now leave you to consider your verdict."</p>

  <p>During the short interval occupied by the discussions of the jurymen among
  themselves, two members of the audience were engaged busily in reviewing the
  evidence in its relation to the almost inevitable verdict. To Thorndyke the
  proceedings offered an interesting study in the perverting effect upon the
  judgment of an unconscious bias, engendered by the suggestive power of a
  known set of circumstances. All the evidence that had been given was true.
  All the inferences from that evidence were sound and proper inferences, so
  far as they went. Yet the final conclusion which was going to be arrived at
  would be wildly erroneous, for the simple reason that all the parties to the
  inquiry had come to it already convinced as to the principal fact&mdash;the
  identity of the deceased person&mdash;which had accordingly been left
  unverified.</p>

  <p>As to Pottermack, his state of mind at the close of the inquiry was one of
  astonished relief. All through the proceedings he had sat in tremulous
  expectancy, with a furtive eye on the strange lawyer, wondering when that
  lawyer's turn would come to give his evidence and what he would have to say.
  That the stranger had detected some part, at least, of the fraud he had at
  first little doubt, and he expected no less than to hear the identity of the
  body challenged. But, as the time ran on and witness after witness came
  forward guilelessly and disgorged the bait for the nourishment of the jury,
  his fears gradually subsided and his confidence began to revive. And now that
  the inquiry was really over and they had all gobbled the bait and got it
  comfortably into their gizzards; now that it was evident that this lawyer had
  nothing to say, after all, in spite of his preposterous porings over those
  admirable shoes, Mr. Pottermack was disposed just a little to despise himself
  for having been so easily frightened. The "superiority complex" began to
  reassert itself. Here he sat, looking upon a thoroughly bamboozled assembly,
  including a most experienced police inspector, a coroner, a lawyer, and a
  doctor. He alone of all that assembly, indeed of the whole world, knew all
  about it.</p>

  <p>But perhaps his alarm had been excusable. We get into the habit too much
  importance to these lawyers and doctors. We credit them with knowing a great
  deal more than they do. But, at any rate, in this case it was all to the
  good. And as Mr. Pottermack summed up in this satisfactory fashion, the
  foreman of the jury announced that the verdict had been agreed on.</p>

  <p>"And what is your finding, gentlemen, on the evidence that you have
  heard?" the coroner asked.</p>

  <p>"We find that the deceased, James Lewson, met his death on the night of
  the twenty-third of last July by falling into a gravel-pit in Potter's
  Wood."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the coroner. "That amounts to a verdict of Death by
  Misadventure. And a very proper verdict, too, in my opinion. I must thank
  you, gentlemen, for your attendance and for the careful consideration which
  you have given to this inquiry, and I may take this opportunity of telling
  you what I am sure you will be glad to hear, that the directors of Perkins's
  Bank have generously undertaken to have the funeral conducted at their
  expense."</p>

  <p>As the hall slowly emptied, Thorndyke lingered by the table to exchange a
  few rather colourless comments on the case with the coroner. At length, after
  a cordial handshake, he took his departure, and, joining the last stragglers,
  made his way slowly out of the main doorway, glancing among the dispersing
  crowd as he emerged; and presently his roving glance alighted on Mr.
  Pottermack at the outskirts of the throng, loitering irresolutely as if
  undecided which way to go.</p>

  <p>The truth is that the elation at the triumphant success of his plan had
  begotten in that gentleman a spirit of mischief. Under the influence of the
  "superiority complex" he was possessed with a desire to exchange a few
  remarks with the strange lawyer; perhaps to "draw" him on the subject of the
  inquest; possibly even to "pull his leg"&mdash;not hard, of course, which
  would be a liberty, but just a gentle and discreet tweak. Accordingly he
  hovered about opposite the hall, waiting to see which way the lawyer should
  go; and as Thorndyke unostentatiously steered in his direction, the meeting
  came about quite naturally, just as the lawyer was turning&mdash;rather to
  Mr. Pottermack's surprise&mdash;away from the direction of the station.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you remember me," he began.</p>

  <p>But Thorndyke interrupted promptly: "Of course I remember you, Mr.
  Pottermack, and am very pleased to meet you again."</p>

  <p>Pottermack, considerably taken aback by the mention of his name, shook the
  proffered hand and cogitated rapidly. How the deuce did the fellow know that
  his name was Pottermack? He hadn't told him.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said. "I am very pleased, too, and rather surprised. But
  perhaps you are professionally interested in this inquiry."</p>

  <p>"Not officially," replied Thorndyke. "I saw a notice in the paper of what
  looked like an interesting case, and, being in the neighbourhood, I dropped
  in to see and hear what was going on."</p>

  <p>"And did you find it an interesting case?" Pottermack asked.</p>

  <p>"Very. Didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Well," replied Pottermack, "I didn't bring an expert eye to it as you
  did, so I may have missed some of the points. But there did seem to be some
  rather queer features in it. I wonder which of them in particular you found
  so interesting?"</p>

  <p>This last question he threw out by way of a tentative preliminary to
  "drawing" the lawyer, and he waited expectantly for the reply.</p>

  <p>Thorndyke reflected a few moments before answering it. At length he
  replied;</p>

  <p>"There was such a wealth of curious matter that I find it difficult to
  single out any one point in particular. The case interested me as a whole,
  and especially by reason of the singular parallelism that it presented to
  another most remarkable case which was related to me in great detail by a
  legal friend of mine, in whose practice it occurred."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said Mr. Pottermack, still intent on tractive operations; "and
  what were the special features in that case?"</p>

  <p>"There were many very curious features in that case," Thorndyke replied in
  a reminiscent tone. "Perhaps the most remarkable was an ingenious fraud
  perpetrated by one of the parties, who dressed an Egyptian mummy in a
  recognizable suit of clothes and deposited it in a gravel-pit."</p>

  <p>"Good gracious!" gasped Pottermack, and the "superiority complex" died a
  sudden death.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Thorndyke continued with the same reminiscent air, observing that
  his companion was for the moment speechless, "it was a most singular case. My
  legal friend used to refer to it, in a whimsical fashion, as the case of the
  dead man who was alive and the live man who was dead."</p>

  <p>"B-but," Pottermack stammered, with chattering teeth, "that sounds like a
  c-contradiction."</p>

  <p>"It does," Thorndyke agreed, "and of course it is. What he actually meant
  was that it was a case of a living man who was believed to be dead, and a
  dead man who was believed to be alive&mdash;until the mummy came to
  light."</p>

  <p>Pottermack made no rejoinder. He was still dumb with amazement and
  consternation. He had a confused feeling of unreality as if he were walking
  in a dream. With a queer sort of incredulous curiosity he looked up at the
  calm, inscrutable face of the tall stranger who walked by his side and asked
  himself who and what this man could be. Was he, in truth, a lawyer&mdash;or
  was he the Devil? Stranger as he certainly was, he had some intimate
  knowledge of his&mdash;Pottermack's&mdash;most secret actions; knowledge
  which could surely be possessed by no mere mortal. It seemed beyond
  belief.</p>

  <p>With a violent effort he pulled himself together and made an attempt to
  continue the conversation. For it was borne in on him that he must, at all
  costs, find out what those cryptic phrases meant and how much this
  person&mdash;lawyer or devil&mdash;really knew. After all, he did not seem to
  be a malignant or hostile devil.</p>

  <p>"That must have been a most extraordinary case," he observed at length. "I
  am&mdash;er&mdash;quite intrigued by what you have told me. Would it be
  possible or admissible for you to give me a few details?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know why not," said Thorndyke, "excepting that it is rather a
  long story, and I need not say highly confidential. But if you know of some
  place where we could discuss it in strict privacy, I should be pleased to
  tell you the story as it was told to me. I am sure it would interest you. But
  I make one stipulation."</p>

  <p>"What is that?" Pottermack asked.</p>

  <p>"It is that you, too, shall search your memory, and if you can recall any
  analogous circumstances as having arisen within your experience or knowledge,
  you shall produce them so that we can make comparisons."</p>

  <p>Pottermack reflected for a few moments, but only a few. For his native
  common sense told him that neither secrecy nor reservation was going to serve
  him.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said, "I agree; though until I have heard your story I
  cannot judge how far I shall be able to match it from my limited experience.
  But if you will come and take tea with me in my garden, where we shall be
  quite alone, I will do my best to set my memory to work when I have heard
  what you have to tell."</p>

  <p>"Excellent," said Thorndyke. "I accept your invitation with great
  pleasure. And I observe that some common impulse seems to have directed us
  towards your house, and even towards the very gate at which I had the good
  fortune to make your acquaintance."</p>

  <p>In effect, as they had been talking, they had struck into the footpath and
  now approached the gate of the walled garden.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;DR. THORNDYKE RELATES A QUEER CASE</h3>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack inserted the small, thin key into the Yale lock of the gate
  and turned it while Thorndyke watched him with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"Admirable things, these Yale locks," the latter remarked as he followed
  his host in through the narrow gateway and cast a comprehensive glance round
  the walled garden, "so long as you don't lose the key. It is a hopeless job
  trying to pick one."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever try?" asked Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and had to give it up. But I see you appreciate their virtues. That
  looks like one on the farther gate."</p>

  <p>"It is," Pottermack admitted. "I keep this part of the garden for my own
  sole use and I like to be secure from interruption."</p>

  <p>"I sympathize with you," said Thorndyke. "Security from interruption is
  always pleasant, and there are occasions when it is indispensable."</p>

  <p>Pottermack looked at him quickly but did not pursue the topic.</p>

  <p>"If you will excuse me for a minute," he said, "I will run and tell my
  housekeeper to get us some tea. You would rather have it out here than in the
  house, wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Much rather," replied Thorndyke. "We wish to be private, and here we are
  with two good Yale locks to keep eavesdroppers at bay."</p>

  <p>While his host was absent he paced slowly up and down the lawn, observing
  everything with keen interest but making no particular inspections. Above the
  yew hedge he could see the skylighted roof of what appeared to be a studio or
  workshop, and in the opposite corner of the garden a roomy, comfortable
  summer-house. From these objects he turned his attention to the sun-dial,
  looking it over critically and strolling round it to read the motto. He was
  thus engaged when his host returned with the news that tea was being prepared
  and would follow almost immediately.</p>

  <p>"I was admiring your sun-dial, Mr. Pottermack," said Thorndyke. "It is a
  great adornment to the garden and a singularly happy and appropriate one; for
  the flowers, like the dial, number only the sunny hours. And it will look
  still better when time has softened the contrast between the old pillar and
  the new base."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Pottermack agreed, a trifle uneasily, "the base will be all the
  better for a little weathering. How do you like the motto?"</p>

  <p>"Very much," replied Thorndyke. "A pleasant, optimistic motto, and new to
  me. I don't think I have ever met with it before. But it is a proper sun-dial
  motto: 'Hope in the morning, Peace at eventide.' Most of us have known the
  first and all of us look forward to the last. Should I be wrong if I were to
  assume that there is a well underneath?"</p>

  <p>"N-no," stammered Pottermack, "you would not. It is an old well that had
  been disused and covered up. I discovered it by accident when I was levelling
  the ground for the sun-dial and very nearly fell into it. So I decided to put
  the sun-dial over it to prevent any accidents in the future. And mighty glad
  I was to see it safely covered up."</p>

  <p>"You must have been," said Thorndyke. "While it was uncovered it must have
  been a constant anxiety to you."</p>

  <p>"It was," Pottermack agreed, with a nervous glance at his guest.</p>

  <p>"That would be about the latter part of last July," Thorndyke suggested
  with the air of one recalling a half-forgotten event; and Mr. Pottermack
  breathlessly admitted that it probably was.</p>

  <p>Here they were interrupted by the arrival of Mrs. Gadby, for whom the gate
  had been left open, followed by a young maid, both laden with the materials
  for tea on a scale suggestive of a Sunday School treat. The housekeeper
  glanced curiously at the tall, imposing stranger, wondering inwardly why he
  could not come to the dining-room like a Christian. In due course the load of
  provisions was transferred to the somewhat inadequate table in the
  summer-house and the two servants then retired, Mrs. Gadby ostentatiously
  shutting the gate behind her. As its lock clicked, Mr. Pottermack ushered his
  guest into the summer-house, offering him the chair once occupied by James
  Lewson and since studiously avoided by its owner.</p>

  <p>When the hospitable preliminaries had been disposed of and the tea poured
  out, Thorndyke opened the actual proceedings with only the briefest
  preamble.</p>

  <p>"I expect, Mr. Pottermack, you are impatient to hear about that case which
  seemed to pique your curiosity so much, and as the shadow is creeping round
  your dial, we mustn't waste time, especially as there is a good deal to tell.
  I will begin with an outline sketch of the case, in the form of a plain
  narrative, which will enable you to judge whether anything at all like it has
  ever come to your knowledge.</p>

  <p>"The story as told to me by my legal friend dealt with the histories of
  two men, whom we will call respectively Mr. Black and Mr. White. At the
  beginning of the story they appear to have been rather intimate friends, and
  both were employed at a bank, which we will call Alsop's Bank. After they had
  been there some time&mdash;I don't know exactly how long&mdash;a series of
  forgeries occurred, evidently committed by some member of the staff of the
  bank. I need not go into details. For our purpose the important fact is that
  suspicion fell upon Mr. White. The evidence against him was striking, and, if
  genuine, convincing and conclusive. But to my friend it appeared decidedly
  unsatisfactory. He was strongly disposed to suspect that the crime was
  actually committed by Mr. Black and that he fabricated the evidence against
  Mr. White. But, however that may have been, the Court accepted the evidence.
  The jury found Mr. White guilty and the judge sentenced him to five years'
  penal servitude.</p>

  <p>"It was a harsh sentence, but that does not concern us, as Mr. White did
  not serve the full term. After about a year of it, he escaped and made his
  way to the shore of an estuary, and there his clothes were found and a set of
  footprints across the sand leading into the water. Some six weeks later a
  nude body was washed up on the shore and was identified as his body. An
  inquest was held and it was decided that he had been accidentally drowned.
  Accordingly he was written off the prison books and the records at Scotland
  Yard as a dead man.</p>

  <p>"But he was not dead. The body which was found was probably that of some
  bather whose clothes Mr. White had appropriated in exchange for his own
  prison clothes. Thus he was able to get away without hindrance and take up a
  new life elsewhere, no doubt under an assumed name. Probably he went abroad,
  but this is only surmise. From the moment of his escape from prison he
  vanishes from our ken, and for the space of about fifteen years remains
  invisible, his existence apparently unknown to any of his former friends or
  acquaintances.</p>

  <p>"This closes the first part of the history; the part which deals with the
  person whom my friend whimsically described as 'the dead man who was alive.'
  And now, perhaps, Mr. Pottermack, you can tell me whether you have ever heard
  of a case in any way analogous to this one."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack reflected for a few moments. Throughout Thorndyke's recital
  he had sat with the feeling of one in a dream. The sense of unreality had
  again taken possession of him. He had listened with a queer sort of
  incredulous curiosity to the quiet voice of this inscrutable stranger,
  relating to him with the calm assurance of some wizard or clairvoyant the
  innermost secrets of his own life; describing actions and events which he,
  Pottermack, felt certain could not possibly be known to any human creature
  but himself. It was all so unbelievable that any sense of danger, of imminent
  disaster, was merged in an absorbing wonder. But one thing was quite clear to
  him. Any attempt to deceive or mislead this mysterious stranger would be
  utterly futile. Accordingly he replied:</p>

  <p>"By a most strange coincidence it happens that a case came to my knowledge
  which was point by point almost identical with yours. But there was one
  difference. In my case, the guilt of the person who corresponds to your Mr.
  Black was not problematical at all. He admitted it. He even boasted of it and
  of the clever way in which he had set up Mr. White as the dummy to take all
  the thumps."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Thorndyke. "That is extremely interesting. We must
  bear that point in mind when we come to examine the details. Now I go on to
  the second part of the narrative; the part that deals with the 'live man who
  was dead.'</p>

  <p>"After the lapse of some fifteen years, Mr. White came to the surface, so
  to speak. He made his appearance in a small country town, and from his
  apparently comfortable circumstances he seemed to have prospered in the
  interval. But here he encountered a streak of bad luck. By some malignant
  chance, it happened that Mr. Black was installed as manager of the branch
  bank in that very town, and naturally enough they met. Even then all might
  have been well but for an unaccountable piece of carelessness on Mr. White's
  part. He had, by growing a beard and taking to the use of spectacles, made a
  considerable change in his appearance. But he had neglected one point. He
  had, it appears, on his right ear a small birth-mark. It was not at all
  conspicuous, but when once observed it was absolutely distinctive.</p>

  <p>"But," exclaimed Pottermack, "I don't understand you. You say he neglected
  this mark. But what could he possibly have done to conceal it?"</p>

  <p>"He could have had it obliterated," replied Thorndyke. "The operation is
  quite simple in the case of a small mark. The more widespread 'port-wine'
  mark is less easy to treat; but a small spot, such as I understand that this
  was, can be dealt with quite easily and effectively. Some skin surgeons
  specialize in the operation. One of them I happen to know personally: Mr.
  Julian Parsons, the dermatologist to St. Margaret's Hospital."</p>

  <p>"Ha," said Mr. Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"But," continued Thorndyke, "to return to our story. Mr. White had left
  his birth-mark untreated, and that was probably his undoing. Mr. Black would
  doubtless have been struck by the resemblance, but the birth-mark definitely
  established the identity. At any rate, Mr. Black recognized him and forthwith
  began to levy blackmail. Of course, Mr. White was an ideal subject for a
  blackmailer's operations. He was absolutely defenceless, for he could not
  invoke the aid of the law by reason of his unexpired sentence. He had to pay,
  or go back to prison&mdash;or take some private measures.</p>

  <p>"At first, it appears that he accepted the position and paid. Probably he
  submitted to be bled repeatedly, for there is reason to believe that quite
  considerable sums of money passed. But eventually Mr. White must have
  realized what most blackmailers' victims have to realize: that there is no
  end to this sort of thing. The blackmailer is always ready to begin over
  again. At any rate, Mr. White adopted the only practicable alternative to
  paying out indefinitely. He got Mr. Black alone in a secluded garden in which
  there was a disused well. Probably Mr. Black came there voluntarily to make
  fresh demands. But however that may have been, Mr. Black went, dead or alive,
  down into the well."</p>

  <p>"In the case which came to my knowledge," said Pottermack, "it was to some
  extent accidental. He had become rather violent, and in the course of what
  amounted to a fight he fell across the opening of the well, striking his head
  heavily on the brick coping, and dropped down in a state of
  insensibility."</p>

  <p>"Ah," said Thorndyke, "that may be considered, as you say, to some extent
  accidental. But probably to a rather small extent. I think we may take it
  that he would have gone down that well in any case. What do you say?"</p>

  <p>"I think I am inclined to agree with you," replied Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"At all events," said Thorndyke, "down the well he went. And there seemed
  to be an end of the blackmailer. But it was not quite the end, and the sequel
  introduces a most interesting feature into the case.</p>

  <p>"It appears that the path by which Mr. Black approached Mr. White's
  premises was an earth path, and owing to the peculiar qualities of the soil
  in that locality, it took the most extraordinarily clear impressions of the
  feet that trod on it. Now, it happened that Mr. Black was wearing shoes with
  rubber soles and heels of a strikingly distinctive pattern, which left on the
  earth path impressions of the most glaringly conspicuous and distinctive
  character. The result was a set of footprints, obviously and certainly those
  of Mr. Black, leading directly to Mr. White's gate and stopping there. This
  was a most dangerous state of affairs, for as soon as the hue and cry was
  raised&mdash;which it would be immediately in the case of a bank
  manager&mdash;the missing Black would be traced by his footprints to Mr.
  White's gate. And then the murder would be out.</p>

  <p>"Now what was Mr. White to do? He could not obliterate those footprints in
  any practicable manner. So he did the next best&mdash;or even
  better&mdash;thing. He continued them past his gate, out into the country and
  across a heath, on the farther side of which he allowed them discreetly to
  fade away into the heather.</p>

  <p>"It was an admirable plan, and it succeeded perfectly. When the hue and
  cry was raised, the police followed those tracks like bloodhounds until they
  lost them on the heath. A photographer with a special camera patiently took
  samples of the footprints along the whole route, from the place where they
  started to where they were lost on the heath. But no one suspected Mr. White.
  He did not come into the picture at all. It seemed that he had now nothing to
  do but to lie low and let the affair pass into oblivion.</p>

  <p>"But he did nothing of the kind. Instead, he embarked on a most
  unaccountable proceeding. Months after the disappearance of Mr. Black, when
  the affair had become nearly forgotten, he proceeded deliberately to revive
  it. He obtained an Egyptian mummy, and having dressed it in Mr. Black's
  clothes, or in clothes that had been specially prepared to counterfeit those
  of Mr. Black, he deposited it in a gravel-pit. His reasons for doing this are
  unknown to my legal friend and are difficult to imagine. But whatever the
  object may have been, it was attained, for in due course the mummy was
  discovered and identified as the body of Mr. Black, an inquest was held and
  the mystery of the disappearance finally disposed of.</p>

  <p>"That is a bare outline of the case, Mr. Pottermack; just sufficient to
  enable us to discuss it and compare it with the one that you have in
  mind."</p>

  <p>"It is a very remarkable case," said Pottermack, "and the most remarkable
  feature in it is its close resemblance to the one of which I came to hear. In
  fact, they are so much alike that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," interrupted Thorndyke. "The same thought had occurred to us
  both&mdash;that your case and the one related by my legal friend are in
  reality one and the same."</p>

  <p>"Yes," agreed Pottermack, "I think they must be. But what is puzzling me
  is how your legal friend came by the knowledge of these facts, which would
  seem to have been known to no one but the principal actor."</p>

  <p>"That is what we are going to consider," said Thorndyke. "But before we
  begin our analysis, there is one point that I should like to clear up. You
  said that Mr. Black had explicitly admitted his guilt in regard to those
  forgeries. To whom did he make that admission?"</p>

  <p>"To his wife," replied Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"His wife!" exclaimed Thorndyke. "But it was assumed that he was a
  bachelor."</p>

  <p>"The facts," said Pottermack, "are rather singular. I had better fill in
  this piece of detail, which apparently escaped your legal friend's
  investigations.</p>

  <p>"Mr. White, in the days before his troubles befell, was engaged to be
  married to a very charming girl to whom he was completely devoted and who was
  equally devoted to him. After Mr. White's reported death, Mr. Black sought
  her friendship and later tried to induce her to marry him. He urged that he
  had been Mr. White's most intimate friend and that their marriage was what
  the deceased would have wished. Eventually she yielded to his persuasion and
  married him, rather reluctantly, since her feeling towards him was merely
  that of a friend. What his feeling was towards her it is difficult to say.
  She had some independent means, and it is probable that her property was the
  principal attraction. That is what the subsequent history suggests.</p>

  <p>"The marriage was a failure from the first. Black sponged on his wife,
  gambled with her money and was constantly in debt and difficulties. Also he
  drank to an unpleasant extent. But she put up with all this until one day he
  let out that he had committed the forgeries, and even boasted of his
  smartness in putting the suspicion on White. Then she left him, and, assuming
  another name, went away to live by herself, passing herself off as a
  widow."</p>

  <p>"And as to her husband? How came he to allow this?"</p>

  <p>"First, she frightened him by threatening to denounce him; but she also
  made him an allowance on condition that he should not molest her. He seems to
  have been rather scared by her threats and he wanted the money, so he took
  the allowance and as much more as he could squeeze out of her, and agreed to
  her terms.</p>

  <p>"Later Mr. White returned to England from America. As he had now quite
  shed his old identity and was a man of good reputation and comfortably off,
  he sought her out in the hopes of possibly renewing their old relations.
  That, in fact, was what brought him to England. Eventually he discovered her,
  apparently a widow, and had no difficulty in making her acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"Did she recognize him?"</p>

  <p>"I think we must assume that she did. But nothing was said. They
  maintained the fiction that they were new acquaintances. So they became
  friends. Finally he asked her to marry him, and it was then that he learned,
  to his amazement, that she had married Mr. Black."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's face had suddenly become grave. He cast a searching glance at
  Mr. Pottermack and demanded: "When was this proposal of marriage made? I
  mean, was it before or after the incident of the well?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, after, of course. No marriage could have been thought of by Mr. White
  while he was under the thumb of the blackmailer, with the choice of ruin or
  the prison before him. It was only when the affair was over and everything
  seemed to be settling down quietly that the marriage seemed to have become
  possible."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke's face cleared and a grim smile spread over it. "I see," he
  chuckled. "A quaint situation for Mr. White. Now, of course, one understands
  the mummy. His function was to produce a death certificate. Very ingenious.
  And now I gather that you would like an exposition of the evidence in this
  case?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," replied Pottermack. "Your legal friend seems to have had knowledge
  of certain actions of Mr. White's which I should have supposed could not
  possibly have been known to any person in the world but Mr. White himself. I
  should like to hear how he came by that knowledge if you would be so kind as
  to enlighten me."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Thorndyke, "then we will proceed to consider the
  evidence in this case; and I must impress on you, Mr. Pottermack, the
  necessity of discriminating clearly between what my legal friend knew and
  what he inferred, and of observing the point at which inference becomes
  converted into knowledge by verification or new matter.</p>

  <p>"To begin with what my friend knew, on the authority of a director of Mr.
  Black's bank. He knew that Mr. Black had disappeared under very mysterious
  circumstances. That he had received an urgent and threatening demand from a
  creditor for the payment of a certain sum of money. That before starting that
  night he had taken from the monies belonging to the bank a sum of money in
  notes exactly equal to the amount demanded from him. The reasonable inference
  was that he set out intending to call on that creditor and pay that money;
  instead of which, he appeared to have walked straight out of the town into
  the country, where all trace of him was lost.</p>

  <p>"Then my friend learned from the director that, whereas the books of the
  bank showed Mr. Black's known income and ordinary expenditure, there was
  evidence of his having paid away large sums of money on gambling
  transactions, always in cash&mdash;mostly five-pound notes; that these sums
  greatly exceeded his known income, and that his account showed no trace of
  their having been received. Since he must have received that money before he
  could have paid it away, he must clearly have had some unknown source of
  income; and since he had paid it away in cash, and there was no trace of his
  having received any cheques to these amounts, the inference was that he had
  received it in cash. I need not remind you, Mr. Pottermack, that the receipt
  of large sums of money in notes or specie is a very significant and rather
  suspicious circumstance."</p>

  <p>"Might not these sums represent his winnings?" Pottermack asked.</p>

  <p>"They might, but they did not, for all the transactions that were traced
  resulted in losses. Apparently he was the type of infatuated gambler who
  always loses in the end. So much for Mr. Black. Next, my friend learned from
  the director the circumstances of the forgeries, and he formed the
  opinion&mdash;which was also that of the director&mdash;that Mr. White had
  been a victim of a miscarriage of justice and that the real culprit had been
  Mr. Black. He also learned the particulars of Mr. White's escape from prison
  and alleged death. But he differed from the director in that, being a lawyer
  with special experience, he did not accept that death as an established fact,
  but only as a probability, reserving in his mind the possibility of a
  mistaken identity of the body and that Mr. White might have escaped and be
  still alive.</p>

  <p>"Thus, you see, Mr. Pottermack, that my friend started with a good deal of
  knowledge of this case and the parties to it. And now we come to some facts
  of another kind which carry us on to the stage of inference. The director who
  furnished my friend with the information that I have summarized also put into
  his hands a long series of photographs of the footprints of Mr. Black, taken
  by an employee of the bank on the second morning after the
  disappearance."</p>

  <p>"For what purpose?" asked Mr. Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"Principally, I suspect, to try a new camera of a special type, but
  ostensibly to help the investigators to discover what had become of the
  missing man. They were handed to my friend for his inspection and opinion as
  to their value for this purpose. Of course, at the first glance they appeared
  to be of no value at all, but as my friend happens to be deeply interested in
  footprints as material for evidence, he retained them for further examination
  in relation to a particular point which he wished to clear up. That point was
  whether a series of footprints is anything more that a mere multiple of a
  single footprint; whether it might be possible to extract from a series any
  kind of evidence that would not be famished by an individual footprint.</p>

  <p>"Evidently, those photographs offered an exceptional opportunity for
  settling this question. They were in the form of a long paper ribbon on which
  were nearly two hundred numbered photographs of footprints, and they were
  accompanied by a twenty-five-inch ordnance map on which each footprint was
  indicated by a numbered dot. The row of dots started at the bank, and then,
  after a blank interval, entered and followed a footpath which passed along a
  wall in which was a gate, and which enclosed a large garden or plantation;
  beyond the wall the dots continued, still on the footpath, between some
  fields, through a wood and across a heath, on the farther side of which they
  stopped. A note at the end of the ribbon stated that here the missing man had
  turned off the path into the heather and that no further traces of him could
  be found."</p>

  <p>"Well," remarked Pottermack. "the police could see all that for
  themselves. It doesn't seem as if the photographs gave any further
  information."</p>

  <p>"It does not." Thorndyke agreed. "And yet a careful examination of those
  photographs led my friend to the conviction that the missing man had entered
  the gate in the wall and had never come out again."</p>

  <p>"But," exclaimed Pottermack, "I understood you to say that the footprints
  continued past the wall, through the wood and out across the heath."</p>

  <p>"So they did. But a careful scrutiny of the photographs convinced my
  friend that this was not a single series of footprints, made by one man but
  two series, made by two different men. The first series started from the bank
  and ended at the gate. The second series started from the gate and ended on
  the heath."</p>

  <p>"Then the footprints were not all alike?"</p>

  <p>"That," replied Thorndyke, "depends on what we mean by 'alike.' If you had
  taken any one footprint from any part of the whole series and compared it
  with any other corresponding footprint&mdash;right or left&mdash;in any other
  part of the series, you would have said that they were undoubtedly prints of
  the same foot."</p>

  <p>"Do I understand you to mean that every footprint in the whole series was
  exactly like every other footprint of the same side?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Every right footprint was exactly like every other right footprint,
  and the same with the left. That is, considered as individual
  footprints."</p>

  <p>"Then I don't see how your friend could have made out that the whole
  series of footprints, all indistinguishably alike, consisted of two different
  series, made by two different men."</p>

  <p>Thorndyke chuckled. "It is quite a subtle point," he said, "and yet
  perfectly simple. I am a little surprised that it had not occurred to Mr.
  White, who seems to have been an acute and ingenious man. You see, the
  difference was not between the individual footprints but between certain
  periodic characters in the two series."</p>

  <p>"I don't think I quite follow you," said Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"Well, let us follow my legal friend's procedure. I have told you that his
  object in examining these photographs was to ascertain whether footprints in
  series present any periodic or recurrent characters that might be of
  evidential importance. Now, a glance at these photographs showed him that
  these footprints must almost certainly present at least one such character.
  They were the prints of shoes with rubber soles of a highly distinctive
  pattern and circular rubber heels. Now, Mr. Pottermack, why does a man wear
  circular rubber heels?"</p>

  <p>"Usually, I suppose, because if he wears ordinary leather heels he wears
  them down all on one side."</p>

  <p>"And how do the circular heels help him?"</p>

  <p>"In the case of circular heels," Pottermack replied promptly, "the wear
  does not occur all at one point, but is distributed round the whole
  circumf&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped abruptly with his mouth slightly open and looked at
  Thorndyke.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said the latter, "you see the point. A circular heel is secured
  to the shoe by a single, central screw. But it is not a complete fixture. As
  the wearer walks, the oblique impact as it meets the ground causes it to
  creep round; very slowly when the heel is new and tightly screwed on, more
  rapidly as it wears thinner and the central screw-hole wears larger. Of
  course, my friend knew this, but he now had an opportunity of making his
  knowledge more exact and settling certain doubtful points as to rapidity and
  direction of rotation. Accordingly he proceeded, with the ribbon of
  photographs and the ordnance map before him, to follow the track
  methodically, noting down the distances and the rate and direction of
  rotation of each heel.</p>

  <p>"His industry was rewarded and justified within the first dozen
  observations, for it brought to light a fact of considerable importance,
  though it does not happen to be relevant to our case. He found that both
  heels revolved in the same direction&mdash;clock-wise&mdash;though, of
  course, since they were in what we may call 'looking-glass' relation, they
  ought to have revolved in opposite directions."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Pottermack, "it is curious, but I don't see what its
  importance is."</p>

  <p>"Its importance in an evidential sense," replied Thorndyke, "is this: the
  anomaly of rotation was evidently not due to the shoes but to some
  peculiarity in the gait of the wearer. The same shoes on the feet of another
  person would almost certainly have behaved differently. Hence the character
  of the rotation might become a test point in a question of personal identity.
  However, that is by the way. What concerns us is that my friend established
  the fact that both heels were rotating quite regularly and rather rapidly.
  Each of them made a complete rotation in about a hundred and fifty yards.</p>

  <p>"My friend, however, did not accept this result as final, but continued
  his observations to ascertain if this regular rate of rotation was maintained
  along the whole of the track. So he went on methodically until he had
  examined nearly half of the ribbon. And then a most astonishing thing
  happened. Both the heels suddenly ceased to revolve. They stopped dead, and
  both at the same place.</p>

  <p>"Now, the thing being apparently an impossibility, my friend thought that
  he must have made some error of observation. Accordingly he went over this
  part of the ribbon again. But the same result emerged. Then, abandoning his
  measurements, he went rapidly along the whole remaining length of the ribbon
  to the very end, but still with the same result. Throughout the whole of that
  distance, neither heel showed the slightest sign of rotation. So it came to
  this: the photographs from number 1 to number 92 showed both heels rotating
  regularly about once in every hundred and fifty yards; from number 93 to
  number 197 showed the heels completely stationary.</p>

  <p>"My friend was profoundly puzzled. On the showing of the photographs, the
  heels of this man's shoes which had been turning quite freely and regularly
  as he walked, had, in an instant, become immovably fixed. And both at the
  same moment. He tried to think of some possible explanation, but he could
  think of none. The thing was utterly incomprehensible. Then he turned to the
  ordnance map to see if anything in the environment could throw any light on
  the mystery. Searching along the row of dots for number 93 he at length found
  it&mdash;exactly opposite the gate in the wall.</p>

  <p>"This was a decidedly startling discovery. It was impossible to ignore the
  coincidence. The position was that this man's heels had been turning freely
  until he reached the gate; after passing the gate his heels had become
  permanently fixed. The obvious suggestion was that this mysterious change in
  the condition of the heels was in some way connected with the gate. But what
  could be the nature of the connection? And what could be the nature of the
  change in the shoes?</p>

  <p>"To the first question the suggested answer was that the man might have
  gone in at the gate; and while he was inside, something might have happened
  to his shoes which caused the heels to become fixed. But still the difficulty
  of the shoes remained. What could cause revolving heels to become fixed? To
  this question my friend could find no answer. The possibility that the heels
  had been taken off and screwed on again more tightly would not have explained
  their complete immobility; and, in fact, they had not been. The screws showed
  plainly in many of the photographs, and the position of their slots in all
  was identical. The footprints in the second series&mdash;those past the
  gate&mdash;were in every respect the exact counterparts of those in the first
  series&mdash;those from the town to the gate. The only condition that my
  friend could think of as agreeing with the physical facts was that which
  would have occurred if the prints in the second series had been made, not by
  the shoes themselves but by some sort of reproductions of them, such as
  plaster casts or casts in some other material."</p>

  <p>"That sounds rather a far-fetched suggestion," remarked Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"It does," Thorndyke agreed; "and in fact my friend did not entertain it
  seriously at first. He merely noted that the appearances were exactly such as
  would be produced by making impressions with casts; in which, of course,
  since the soles and heels would be all in one piece, no movement of the heels
  would be possible. But, Mr. Pottermack, we must bear in mind whose footprints
  these were. They were the footprints of a man who had disappeared in the most
  mysterious and unaccountable manner. The whole affair was highly abnormal. No
  reasonable explanation was possible either of the disappearance or of the
  singular character of the footprints. But in the absence of a reasonable
  explanation, it is admissible to consider an unreasonable one, if it agrees
  with the known facts. The cast theory did agree with the physical facts, and,
  on reflection, my friend decided to adopt it as a working hypothesis and see
  what came of it.</p>

  <p>"Now, if the footprints from the gate to the heath were counterfeits of
  Black's footprints, made with shoes the soles and heels of which were
  mechanical reproductions of the soles and heels of Black's shoes, it followed
  that the wearer of these shoes was not Black, but some other person, in which
  case Black's own footprints ended at the gate. This at once got rid of the
  most unaccountable feature of the disappearance&mdash;the nocturnal flight
  out into the country; for if his footprints ended at the gate he must have
  gone in. But there was nothing at all abnormal about his calling at a house
  quite close to, and, in fact, almost in the town, from which he could have
  easily gone to keep his appointment with his creditor. Thus far, the
  hypothesis seemed to simplify matters.</p>

  <p>"But it not only followed that Black must have gone in at the gate, it
  followed that he could never have come out. For the footprints that went on
  were not his, and there were no footprints going back towards the town."</p>

  <p>"He might have come out another way; by the front door, for instance,"
  Pottermack suggested.</p>

  <p>"So he might," Thorndyke agreed, "under different circumstances. But the
  counterfeit footprints showed that he did not. For if the continuing
  footprints were counterfeits, made by some other person, what could have been
  their purpose? Clearly their purpose could have been no other than that of
  concealing the fact that Black had gone in at the gate. But if he had come
  out of the premises, there could have been no reason for concealing the fact
  that he had gone in.</p>

  <p>"If, however, he did not come out, then, obviously, he remained inside.
  But in what condition? Was he alive and in hiding? Evidently not. In the
  first place, he had no occasion to hide, since he could have gone back to the
  bank and replaced the money. But the conclusive evidence that he was not in
  hiding was the counterfeit footprints. No mechanical reproduction of the
  shoes would have been necessary if Black had been there. Black's own shoes
  would have been borrowed and used to make the false footprints. But,
  obviously, the whole set of circumstances was against the supposition that he
  could be alive. If the evidence was accepted that he went in and was never
  seen again, the most obvious inference was that he had been made away with.
  And this inference was strongly supported by the troublesome and elaborate
  measures that had been taken to conceal the fact that he had gone in at the
  gate. Accordingly my friend adopted the view, provisionally, that Mr. Black
  had been made away with by some person inside the gate, hereinafter referred
  to as the tenant.</p>

  <p>"But the adoption of this view at once raised two questions. First, how
  came it to be necessary to make reproductions of the dead man's shoes? Why
  did not the tenant simply take the shoes off the corpse and put them on his
  own feet? If he had done this, if he had made the false footprints with the
  dead man's own shoes, the illusion would have been perfect. No detection
  would have been possible. Why had he not done it? The shoes themselves could
  have presented no difficulty. They were large shoes, and large shoes can,
  with suitable preparation, be worn even by a small man.</p>

  <p>"The answer that suggested itself was that, for some reason, the shoes
  were not available; that by the time that the necessity for the false
  footprints had been perceived, the shoes had in some way become inaccessible.
  But how could they have become inaccessible? Could the body have been buried?
  Apparently not. For it would have been much less trouble to dig up a body and
  recover the shoes than to make a pair of reproductions of them. Could it have
  been burned? Evidently not. Apart from the extreme difficulty of the
  operation, there had not been time. The false footprints were made on the
  very night of the disappearance since they were traced by the police the next
  morning.</p>

  <p>"The possibility that the body might have been conveyed away off the
  premises had to be borne in mind. But it was highly improbable, for many
  obvious reasons and it did not dispose of the difficulty. For it would surely
  have been easier and quicker to go&mdash;at night&mdash;and retrieve the
  shoes than to make the counterfeits. Indeed, when my friend considered the
  immense labour that the making of those reproductions must have entailed, to
  say nothing of the great expenditure of time, just when every moment was
  precious, he felt that nothing but the absolute physical impossibility of
  getting access to the original shoes would explain their having been
  made.</p>

  <p>"Now, what conditions would have rendered those shoes totally
  inaccessible? Remember the circumstances. Inasmuch as the sham footprints
  were found on the following morning, they must have been made that night. But
  before they could be made, the counterfeit soles must have been made, and the
  making of them must have been a long and tedious piece of work. It therefore
  followed that the tenant must have begun work on them almost immediately
  after the death of Mr. Black. From this it followed that the body of Mr.
  Black must have been immediately disposed of in such a way as at once to
  become inaccessible.</p>

  <p>"What methods of disposing of a body would fulfil these conditions? My
  friend could think of only three, all very much alike: the dropping of the
  body down a dene-hole, or into a cess-pit, or into a disused well. Any of
  these methods would at once put the body completely out of reach. And all
  these methods had a special probability in this particular case. The great
  difficulty that confronts the would-be murderer is the disposal of the body.
  Hence the knowledge that there was available a means of immediately,
  securely, and permanently hiding the body might be the determining factor of
  the murder. Accordingly, my friend was strongly inclined to assume that one
  of these three methods was the one actually employed.</p>

  <p>"As to the particular method, the question was of no great importance.
  Still, my friend considered it. The idea of a dene-hole was at once excluded
  on geological grounds. Dene-holes are peculiar to the chalk. But this was not
  a chalk district.</p>

  <p>"The cess-pit was possible but not very probable; for if in use, it would
  be subject to periodical clearance, which would make it quite unsuitable as a
  hiding-place, while cess-pits which become superseded by drainage are usually
  filled in and definitely covered up. A well, on the other hand, is often kept
  open for occasional and special use after the laying on of a pipe
  service."</p>

  <p>"Your friend," remarked Pottermack, "seems to have taken it for granted
  that a well actually existed."</p>

  <p>"Not entirely," said Thorndyke. "He looked up an older map and found that
  this house had formerly been a farm-house, so that it must once have had a
  well; and as it now fronts on a road in which other houses have been built
  and which is virtually a street, it is pretty certainly connected with the
  water-service. So that it was practically certain that there was a well, and
  that well would almost certainly be out of use.</p>

  <p>"And now, having deduced a reason why the counterfeit soles should have
  been necessary, he had to consider another question. If the original shoes
  were inaccessible, how could it have been possible to make the counterfeits,
  which were, apparently, casts of the originals? At first it looked like an
  impossibility. But a little reflection showed that the footprints themselves
  supplied the answer. Mr. Black's own footprints on the path were such perfect
  impressions that a little good plaster poured into selected samples of them
  would have furnished casts which would have been exact reproductions of the
  soles and heels of Mr. Black's shoes. Possibly there were equally good
  footprints inside the premises, but that is of no consequence. Those on the
  footpath would have answered the purpose perfectly.</p>

  <p>"I may say that my friend tested this conclusion and got some slight
  confirmation. For if the false footprints were impressions of reproductions,
  not of the original shoes but of some other footprints, one would expect to
  find the accidental characters of those particular footprints as well as
  those of the shoes which produced them. And this appeared to be the case. In
  one of the points of the star on the left heel a small particle of earth
  seemed to have adhered. This was not to be found in Black's own footprints,
  but it was visible in all the footprints of the second series, from the gate
  to the heath. And the fact that it never changed along the whole series
  suggested that it was really a part of the cast, due to an imperfection in
  the footprint from which it was made.</p>

  <p>"That brings us to an end of my friend's train of reasoning in regard to
  the actual events connected with Mr. Black's disappearance. His conclusions
  were, you observe, that Mr. Black went in at the gate; that he was thereafter
  made away with by some person inside whom we have called the tenant; that his
  body was deposited by the tenant in some inaccessible place, probably a
  disused well; and that the tenant then made a set of false footprints to
  disguise the fact that Mr. Black had gone in at the gate.</p>

  <p>"The questions that remained to be considered were; first. What could be
  the tenant's motive for making away with Mr. Black? and second, Who was the
  tenant? But before we deal with his inferences on those points, I should like
  to hear any observations which you may have to make on what I have told
  you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack pondered awhile on what he had heard, and as he reflected,
  he laid a disparaging hand on the teapot.</p>

  <p>"It is rather cool," he remarked apologetically; "but such as it is, can I
  give you another cup?"</p>

  <p>"Prolonged exposition," Thorndyke replied with a smile, "is apt to have a
  cooling effect upon tea. But it also creates a demand for liquid refreshment.
  Thank you, I think another cup would cheer, and we can dispense with the
  inebriation."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pottermack refilled both the cups and put down the teapot, still
  cogitating profoundly.</p>

  <h3>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;THE SUN-DIAL HAS THE LAST WORD</h3>

  <p>"Your legal friend," Mr. Pottermack said at length, "must be a man of
  extraordinary subtlety and ingenuity if he deduced all that you have told me
  from the mere peculiarities of a set of footprints, and only photographs at
  that. But what strikes me about it is that his reconstruction was, after all,
  pure speculation. There were too many 'ifs.'"</p>

  <p>"But, my dear Mr. Pottermack," exclaimed Thorndyke, "it was all 'ifs.' The
  whole train of reasoning was on the plane of hypothesis, pure and simple. He
  did not, at this stage, assume that it was actually true, but merely true
  conditionally on the facts being what they appeared to be. But what does a
  scientific man do when he sets up a working hypothesis? He deduces from it
  its consequences, and he continues to pursue these so long as they are
  consistent with the facts known to him. Sooner or later, this process brings
  him either to an impossibility or a contradiction&mdash;in which case he
  abandons the hypothesis&mdash;or to a question of fact which is capable of
  being settled conclusively, yes or no.</p>

  <p>"Well, this is what my friend did. So far we have seen him pursuing a
  particular hypothesis and deducing from it certain consequences. The whole
  thing might have been fallacious. But it was consistent, and the consequences
  were compatible with the known facts. Presently we shall come to the question
  of fact&mdash;the crucial experiment which determines yes or no, whether the
  hypothesis is true or false. But we have to follow the hypothetical method a
  little farther first.</p>

  <p>"The questions that remained to be considered were: first, What could have
  been the tenant's motive for killing Mr. Black? and second, Who was the
  tenant? My friend took the questions in this order because the motive might
  be arrived at by reasoning, and, if so arrived at, might throw light on the
  personality of the tenant; whereas the identity of the tenant, taken by
  itself, was a matter of fact capable of being ascertained by enquiry, but not
  by reasoning apart from the motive.</p>

  <p>"Now, what motives suggest themselves? First, we must note that my friend
  assumed that the homicide was committed by the tenant himself, that is, by
  the proprietor of the premises and not by a servant or other person. That is
  a reasonable inference from the facts that the person, whoever he was,
  appeared to have command of all the means and materials necessary for making
  the counterfeits, and also that he must have had full control of the
  premises, both at the time and in the future, in order to hide the body and
  ensure that it should remain hidden. Well, what motive could a man in this
  position have had to kill Mr. Black?</p>

  <p>"There is the motive of robbery, but the circumstances seem to exclude it
  as not reasonably probable. It is true that Black had a hundred pounds on his
  person, but there is no reason to suppose that any one knew that he had; and
  in any case, so small a sum, relatively, furnishes a quite insufficient
  motive for murder in the case of an apparently well-to-do man such as the
  tenant. My friend decided that robbery, though possible, was highly
  improbable.</p>

  <p>"The possibilities that Black's death might have been the result of a
  quarrel or of some act of private vengeance had to be borne in mind, but
  there were no means of forming any opinions for or against them. They had to
  be left as mere speculative possibilities. But there was another possibility
  which occurred to my friend, the probabilities of which were susceptible of
  being argued, and to this he turned his attention. It was based upon the
  application of certain facts actually known and which we will now
  consider.</p>

  <p>"First, he noted that Mr. Black came to this place voluntarily, and that
  he came expressly to visit the premises within the gate is proved by the fact
  that this is the last house on that path. Beyond it is the country. There is
  no other human habitation to which he could have been bound. Now Mr. Black
  was, at this moment, in acute financial difficulties. He had borrowed a
  hundred pounds from the bank's money, and this hundred pounds he was about to
  pay away to meet an urgent demand. But that hundred pounds would have to be
  replaced, and it was of the utmost importance that it should be replaced
  without delay. For if a surprise inspection should have occurred before it
  was replaced, he stood to be charged with robbery. The circumstances,
  therefore, seemed to suggest that he had taken it with the expectation of
  being able to replace it almost immediately.</p>

  <p>"Now, you will remember that it transpired after his disappearance that
  Mr. Black had some mysterious unknown source of income; that he had received
  on several occasions large sums of money, which had apparently come to him in
  the form of cash and had been paid away in the same form&mdash;always in
  five-pound notes. These monies did not appear in his banking account or in
  any other account. They were unrecorded&mdash;and, consequently, their total
  amount is not known. But the sums that he is known to have received were
  ascertained by means of the discovery of certain payments that he had made. I
  need not point out to you the great and sinister significance of these facts.
  When a man who has a banking account receives large payments in cash, and
  when, instead of paying them into his account, he pays them away in cash, it
  is practically certain that the monies that he has received are connected
  with some secret transaction, and that transaction is almost certainly an
  illicit one. But of all such transactions, by far the commonest is blackmail.
  In fact, one would hardly be exaggerating if one were to say that evidence of
  secret payments of large sums in coin or notes is presumptive evidence of
  blackmail. Accordingly my friend strongly suspected Mr. Black of being a
  blackmailer.</p>

  <p>"And now, assuming this to be correct, see how admirably the assumption
  fits the circumstances. Mr. Black is at the moment financially desperate. He
  has taken certain money, which is not his, to pay an urgent and threatening
  creditor. Instead of going direct to that creditor, he comes first to this
  house. But he does not enter by the front door. He goes to a gate which opens
  on an unfrequented lane and which gives entrance to a remote part of the
  grounds, and he does this late in the evening. There is a manifestly secret
  air about the whole proceeding.</p>

  <p>"And now let us make another assumption."</p>

  <p>"What, another!" protested Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"Yes, another; just to see if it will fit the circumstances as the others
  have done. Let us assume that the tenant was the person from whom Mr. Black
  had been extorting those mysterious payments; the victim whom he had been
  blackmailing. That he had called in on his way to his creditor to see if he
  could squeeze him for yet another hundred, so that the notes could be
  replaced before they could be missed. That the victim, being now at the end
  of his patience and having an opportunity of safely making away with his
  persecutor, took that opportunity and made away with him. Is it not obvious
  that we have a perfectly consistent scheme of the probable course of
  events?"</p>

  <p>"It is all pure conjecture," objected Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"It is all pure hypothesis," Thorndyke admitted, "but you see that it all
  hangs together, it all fits the circumstances completely. We have not come to
  any inconsistency or impossibility. And it is all intrinsically probable in
  the special conditions; for you must not forget that we are dealing with a
  set of circumstances that admits of no normal explanation.</p>

  <p>"And now for the last question. Assuming that Mr. Black was a blackmailer
  and that the tenant was his victim, was it possible to give that victim a
  name? Here my friend was handicapped by the fact that Mr. Black was a
  complete stranger, of whose domestic affairs and friends and acquaintances he
  had no knowledge. With one exception. He had knowledge of one of Mr. Black's
  friends. That friend, it is true, was alleged to be dead. But it was by no
  means certain that he was dead. And if he were not dead, he was a perfectly
  ideal subject for blackmail, for he was an escaped convict with a
  considerable term of penal servitude still to run. My friend was, of course,
  thinking of Mr. White. If he should have attained to something approaching
  affluence and should be living in prosperous and socially desirable
  circumstances, he would allow himself to be bled to an unlimited extent
  rather than suffer public disgrace and be sent back to prison. And the person
  who would be, of all others, the most likely to recognize him and in the best
  position to blackmail him would be his old friend Mr. Black.</p>

  <p>"Bearing these facts in mind, my friend was disposed to waive the prima
  facie improbability and assume, provisionally, that the tenant was Mr. White.
  It was certainly rather a long shot."</p>

  <p>"It was indeed," said Pottermack. "Your friend was a regular Robin
  Hood."</p>

  <p>"And yet," Thorndyke rejoined, "the balance of probability was in favour
  of that assumption. For against the various circumstances that suggested that
  the tenant was Mr. White there was to be set only one single improbability,
  and that not at all an impressive one: the improbability that a
  body&mdash;found drowned after six weeks' immersion and therefore really
  unrecognizable&mdash;should have been wrongly identified. However, my friend
  did feel that (to continue the metaphor, since you seem to approve of it) the
  time had come to step forward and have a look at the target. The long train
  of hypothetical reasoning had at length brought him to a proposition the
  truth of which could be definitely tested. The tenant's identity with Mr.
  White was a matter of fact which could be proved or disproved beyond all
  doubt. Of course, the test would not be a real experimentum crucis, because
  it would act in only one direction. If it should turn out that the tenant was
  not Mr. White, that would not invalidate the other conclusions, but if it
  should turn out that he was Mr. White, that fact would very strongly confirm
  those conclusions.</p>

  <p>"My friend, then, left his photographs and his ordnance map and made a
  journey to the scene of these strange events to inspect the place and the man
  with his own eyes. First he examined the path and the exterior of the
  premises, and then he made a survey of the grounds enclosed by the wall."</p>

  <p>"How did he do that?" enquired Pottermack. "It was a pretty high
  wall&mdash;at least, so I understand."</p>

  <p>"He made use of an ancient optical instrument which has been recently
  revived in an improved form under the name of 'periscope.' The old instrument
  had two mirrors; the modern one has two total-reflection prisms in a narrow
  tube. By projecting the upper or objective end of the tube above the top of
  the wall, my friend was able, on looking into the eye-piece, to get an
  excellent view of the premises. What he saw was a large garden, completely
  enclosed by four high walls in which were two small gates, each provided with
  a night-latch and therefore capable of being opened only from within or by
  means of a latchkey. A very secure and secluded garden. On one side of it was
  a range of out-buildings which, by the glazed lights in their roofs, appeared
  to be studios or workshops. Near one end of the lawn was a sun-dial on a very
  wide stone base. The width of the base was rather remarkable, being much
  greater than is usual in a garden dial. A glance at it showed that the dial
  had been quite recently set up, for, though the stone pillar was old, the
  base stones were brand new. Moreover, the turf around it had been very
  recently laid and some of the earth was still bare. Further proof of its
  newness was furnished by a gentleman who was, at the moment, engaged, with
  the aid of Whitaker's Almanack and his watch, in fixing the dial-plate in
  correct azimuth.</p>

  <p>"This gentleman&mdash;the mysterious tenant&mdash;naturally engaged my
  friend's attention. There were several interesting points to be noted
  concerning him. The tools that he used were workmen's tools, not amateurs',
  and he used them with the unmistakable skill of a man accustomed to tools.
  Then he had laid aside his spectacles, which were 'curl-sided' and therefore
  habitually worn. It followed, then, that he was near-sighted; for if he had
  been old-sighted or long-sighted he would have needed the spectacles
  especially for the close and minute work that he was doing.</p>

  <p>"When he had made these observations, my friend proceeded to take a couple
  of photographs&mdash;a right and a left profile."</p>

  <p>"How did he manage that?" demanded the astonished Pottermack.</p>

  <p>"By placing his camera on the top of the wall. It was a special, small
  camera, fitted with a four-point-five Ross-Zeiss lens and a cord release. Of
  course, he made the exposure with the aid of the periscope.</p>

  <p>"When he had exposed the photographs, he decided to have a nearer view of
  the tenant. Accordingly he went round and knocked at the gate, which was
  presently opened by the gentleman of the sun-dial, who was now wearing his
  spectacles. Looking at those spectacles, my friend made a very curious
  discovery. The man was not near-sighted, for the glasses were convex
  bi-focals, the upper part nearly plain glass. Now, if he had not needed those
  spectacles for near work, he certainly could not need them for distance.
  Then, obviously, he did not need them at all. But, if so, why was he wearing
  them? The only possible explanation was that they were worn for their effect
  on his appearance; in short, for the purpose of disguise.</p>

  <p>"As this gentleman was answering some questions about the locality my
  friend handed him a folded map. This he did with two objects: that he might
  get a good look at him unobserved, and that he might possibly obtain some
  prints of his finger-tips. As to the first, he was able to make a mental note
  of the tenant's salient characteristics and to observe, among other
  peculiarities, a purplish mark on the lobe of the right ear of the kind known
  to surgeons as a capillary naevus."</p>

  <p>"And the finger-prints?" Pottermack asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"They were rather a failure, but not quite. When my friend developed them
  up, though very poor specimens, they were distinct enough to be recognizable
  by an expert.</p>

  <p>"Now you will have noticed that everything that my friend observed was
  consistent with, and tended to confirm, the conclusions that he had arrived
  at by hypothetical reasoning. But the actual test still remained to be
  applied. Was the tenant Mr. White or was he not? In order to settle this
  question, my friend made enlargements of the photographs of the tenant and
  also of the finger-prints, and, with these in his pocket, paid a visit to
  Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>At the mention of the ill-omened name, Pottermack started and a sudden
  pallor spread over his face. But he uttered no sound, and Thorndyke
  continued:</p>

  <p>"There he presented the finger-prints as probably those of a deceased
  person, photographed from a document, and asked for an expert opinion on
  them. He gave no particulars and was not asked for any; but the experts made
  their examination and reported that the finger-prints were those of a convict
  named White who had died some fifteen years previously. My friend had,
  further, the opportunity of inspecting the prison photographs of the deceased
  White and of reading the personal description. Needless to say, they agreed
  completely in every particular, even to the capillary naevus on the ear.</p>

  <p>"Here, then, my legal friend emerged from the region of hypothesis into
  that of established fact. The position now was that the person whom we have
  called 'the tenant' was undoubtedly the convict, White, who was universally
  believed to be dead. And since this fact had been arrived at by the train of
  reasoning that I have recited, there could be no doubt that the other,
  intermediate, conclusions were correct; that, in fact, the hypothesis as a
  whole was substantially true. Do you agree with that view?"</p>

  <p>"There seems to be no escape from it," replied Pottermack; and after a
  brief pause he asked, a little tremulously: "And what action did your legal
  friend take?"</p>

  <p>"In respect of the identity of the tenant? He took no action. He now
  considered it perfectly clear that Mr. White ought never to have been a
  convict at all. That unfortunate gentleman had been the victim of a
  miscarriage of justice. It would have been actually against public policy to
  disclose his existence and occasion a further miscarriage.</p>

  <p>"With regard to the killing of Mr. Black, the position was slightly
  different. If it comes to the knowledge of any citizen&mdash;and especially a
  barrister, who is an officer of justice&mdash;that a crime has been
  committed, it is the duty of that citizen to communicate his knowledge to the
  proper authorities. But my friend had not come by any such knowledge. He had
  formed the opinion&mdash;based on certain inferences from certain
  facts&mdash;that Mr. Black had been killed. But a man is not under any
  obligation to communicate his opinions.</p>

  <p>"This may seem a little casuistical. But my friend was a lawyer, and
  lawyers are perhaps slightly inclined to casuistry. And in this case there
  were certain features that encouraged this casuistical tendency. We must take
  it, I think, that a man who suffers a wrong for which the law provides a
  remedy and in respect of which it offers him protection is morally and
  legally bound to take the legal remedy and place himself under the protection
  of the law. But if the law offers him no remedy and no protection, he would
  appear to be entitled to resume the natural right to protect himself as best
  he can. That, at any rate, is my friend's view.</p>

  <p>"Of course, the discovery of the alleged body of Mr. Black in the
  gravel-pit seemed to put an entirely new complexion on the affair. My friend
  was greatly perturbed by the news. It was hardly conceivable that it could
  really be Mr. Black's body. But it was some person's body, and the deliberate
  'planting' of a dead human body seemed almost inevitably to involve a
  previous crime. Accordingly, my friend started off, hot-foot, to investigate.
  When the deceased turned out to be a mummy, his concern with the discovery
  came to an end. There was no need for him to interfere in the case. It was a
  harmless deception and even useful, for it informed the world at large that
  Mr. Black was dead.</p>

  <p>"That, Mr. Pottermack, is the history of the dead man who was alive and
  the live man who was dead; and I think you will agree with me and my legal
  friend that it is a most curious and interesting case."</p>

  <p>Pottermack nodded, but for some time remained silent. At length, in a tone
  the quietness of which failed to disguise the suppressed anxiety, he
  said:</p>

  <p>"But you have not quite finished your story."</p>

  <p>"Have I not?" said Thorndyke. "What have I forgotten?"</p>

  <p>"You have not told me what became of Mr. White."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Mr. White. Well, I think we can read from here upon your sun-dial a
  few words that put his remaining history in a nutshell. 'Sole decedente pax.'
  He had the mark removed from his ear, he married his old love and lived happy
  ever after."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Mr. Pottermack, and suddenly turned away his head.</p>
