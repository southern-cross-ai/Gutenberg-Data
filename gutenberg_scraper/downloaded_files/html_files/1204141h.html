<h2>Murder at the Pageant<br>
by<br>
Victor L. Whitechurch</h2>

<h3>First published 1930</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>"The sedan-chair used in this scene is the chair in which Queen
Anne was carried on the occasion of her visit to Frimley Manor in
1705."</p>

<p>So ran the footnote on the programme of the pageant which was
being held in the spacious grounds of Frimley Manor two hundred and
twenty-four years after the above date; a pageant in aid of the
funds of the local hospital at Chiltonbury, the neighboring
market-town.</p>

<p>The scenario of the pageant had been written, and the various
historical scenes in it produced, by Captain Roger Bristow, well
known among his friends as a first-rate organiser of amateur
theatricals, and down on the aforesaid programme as the "Master of
the Pageant."</p>

<p>And so, once again, after the lapse of all those years, a bit of
family tradition was being revived and the visit of that
long-defunct sovereign was being enacted.</p>

<p>On the broad, grassy slopes of a rising bit of ground on the
right front of the house sat, or stood, a large audience, drawn
from the surrounding villages and from Chiltonbury. Before the
spectators was a great sweep of lawn, intersected by the carriage
drive which led from the high road to the manor, a drive which
ended in a wide oval immediately in front of the house.</p>

<p>Some three hundred yards on its way from the house towards the
road this carriage-drive crossed an ornamental bridge which spanned
a stream running through the grounds. On either side were clumps of
trees, forming, just then, the wings of the great scene. Behind one
of these clumps, unseen by the audience, but in full view of the
front of the house, a large marquee had been erected, forming
dressing-rooms and a centre for the assemblings of the numerous
properties.</p>

<p>Amid these sylvan surroundings Queen Anne came once again to
Frimley Manor, in the traditional way in which she had come in
1705. For the story, handed down in the family, was that the Queen
had alighted from her coach near the entrance gate, and had been
carried up the drive in the sedan-chair belonging to the manor;
carried by four stalwart serving-men wearing the livery of Sir
Henry Lynwood, the Lord of the Manor.</p>

<p>So there it was, all over again, arranged accurately in detail
by Captain Roger Bristow. From the terrace in front of the house
came a little procession, led by the present Sir Henry Lynwood, all
in the costume of the period, moving slowly towards the bridge,
where a halt was made. Then a fanfare on the royal trumpets ushered
another procession, which came into sight from behind a clump of
trees, the procession of that amiable monarch, Queen Anne, with her
attendant courtiers, ladies-in-waiting and soldiers.</p>

<p>Four lackeys arrayed in the historical livery of the
Lynwoods&mdash;green and orange&mdash;bore the old sedan-chair,
with Mrs. Cresswell, an old friend of the family, seated regally
therein, wearing over her costume what Queen Anne certainly did
<i>not</i> wear in 1705, her famous pearl necklace. Beside the
chair walked Captain Bristow himself&mdash;it was the only scene in
which he was taking a part&mdash;personating the celebrated
Churchill, afterwards Duke of Marlborough, full wig and all.</p>

<p>On the bridge the bearers set down the chair, and Sir Harry
Lynwood, hat in hand, bowing low, welcomed to his house a
Queen&mdash;who extended her hand from the chair, through the open
window, for him to kiss.</p>

<p>It was all very prettily done, and the spectators applauded
accordingly. Perhaps, though, the sedan-chair drew as much of their
attention as did its occupant. Some of them, friends of the
Lynwoods, had often seen it as it stood in the hall of the manor,
its long carrying-poles withdrawn from the side sockets and piled
in the corner behind it. But the majority of the onlookers had
never seen the sedan-chair before, though many had heard of it.</p>

<p>It was a very handsome old chair, lacquered in black and dark
red and overlaid with brass filigree-work. The poles, also, were
similarly ornamented. One of the bearers lifted the roof, which was
hinged, slightly, and tilted it back, while another opened the side
door. Queen Anne rose from her seat, stepped out, and graciously
accepted the hand of her host. They led the way, followed by their
respective retainers, to the entrance of the house, into which they
disappeared. The historic scene came to an end.</p>

<p>The sedan-chair, having served its purpose, was carried by the
liveried serving-men into the marquee behind the trees. People
glanced at their programmes to see what was the next tableau.<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>It was late, but still daylight on the long summer day, when the
pageant was over. The big audience had melted away. Players, drawn
from all over the neighbourhood, were departing; many of them still
wearing costumes which looked incongruous enough in car or on
bicycle. At length only a little group, gathered beside the
marquee, remained&mdash;the members of Sir Harry Lynwood's family
and the house party invited for the occasion. All of them were in
pageant costumes.</p>

<p>Sir Harry, a tall, upright man of about sixty, wore the garb of
the reign of Queen Anne. Captain Bristow, of medium height and a
little inclined to err on the side of stoutness, appeared as the
Duke of Marlborough. Harry Lynwood, the eldest son, who had taken
part in an earlier scene, was dressed in the trunk hose, puffed and
slashed doublet, and flat cap of the Tudor period; his brother
Charles, as a dandy of the Regency, wore white pantaloons strapped
tightly at the feet, long blue coat, brocaded waistcoat. Anstice
Lynwood looked perfectly charming in Early Victorian high-waisted
gown and bonnet. She was talking to her great friend, Sonia
Fullinger, an old schoolfellow, and about the same age as herself.
Sonia had been taking the leading part in a scene which had been
suggested by the Vicar, the founding of the Grammar School at
Chiltonbury by the boy-king, Edward the Sixth, who had actually
paid a visit to the town during his brief reign. And Sonia, in her
puce-coloured velvet Tudor costume, made a charming little Edward,
perhaps not exactly representative of that delicate and not very
happy boy, for her laughing brown eyes, dark hair, and quick, agile
movements rather belied what history has handed down as the
appearance and demeanour of the weakly son of bluff King Harry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cresswell posed still&mdash;very much posed&mdash;as Queen
Anne. There was no doubt that she thoroughly enjoyed the
impersonation, none the less because it gave the vain little woman
the opportunity of flaunting her pearls.</p>

<p>Mr. Ashley-Smith, the Vicar of the parish, true to his cloth and
calling, represented, at that moment, the Church of the Early
Georgian period, being dressed in black gown, knee-breeches, silk
stockings and buckled shoes, with white bands at his neck, and
wearing a very dignified white, full wig.</p>

<p>Standing close by Sir Harry was a man wearing a Puritan dress,
black velvet, with a cloak of the same material, broad-brimmed,
high-crowned hat, with a silver band around it, and moustache and
short chin-beard. Sir Harry was speaking to him.</p>

<p>"Very good of you to help us, Mr. Hurst. It's been a great
success, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"Capital," replied the other, "and I've enjoyed taking part in
it immensely. I hope you'll clear a good round sum for the
hospital."</p>

<p>"I don't think there's much doubt about that. Yes?&mdash;" he
turned half around&mdash;"what is it?"</p>

<p>A girl had come up to him from the direction of the house,
dressed in plain black, and bareheaded.</p>

<p>"I was looking for Miss Fullinger, Sir Harry," she said. "She
asked me, just now, to bring her something she wanted."</p>

<p>"Miss Fullinger?" replied Sir Harry, looking about him. "She was
here a moment ago&mdash;Ah, there she is&mdash;coming out of the
marquee." The girl went up to her.</p>

<p>"I've brought you the clean handkerchief you asked for, miss,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Bates. I lost my other one, somehow." The
lady's-maid lingered for a moment.</p>

<p>"I'm putting out your apricot frock for dinner, miss. Will that
be all right?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. If I want it. But I believe we're going to dine just
as we are&mdash;anyhow, it's all right."</p>

<p>"Very good, miss."</p>

<p>The two men had turned instinctively, and were looking towards
the entrance of the tent.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed Sir Harry, "she makes a pretty boy, doesn't
she?"</p>

<p>"Very," replied Hurst.</p>

<p>"Look here," went on Sir Harry, genially, "we're just going to
have some sort of a meal. Everyone ought to be ready for it. Won't
you come in and join us, Hurst?"</p>

<p>"Oh, really&mdash;thank you very much," said Hurst, still
looking towards the two girls. "I don't know&mdash;" Then, as if
suddenly making up his mind&mdash;"Yes, I'd like
to&mdash;only,&mdash;these togs, you see?" and he laughed.</p>

<p>"That's all right," exclaimed the Baronet, and added, raising
his voice for the benefit of the group around him, "Now then, you
people! It's about time we fed, what? Come along in. We won't
bother to change."</p>

<p>"How about the sedan-chair, daddy?" asked Anstice. "Hadn't we
better bring it along?"</p>

<p>Sir Harry glanced into the big marquee, with its jumbled
assortment of properties and discarded costumes.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother," he replied. "It isn't likely to rain and if
it did, it wouldn't matter. It'll be all right in the tent with the
rest of the stuff. You young folks will have to sort things out in
the morning. Come along," he added to Hurst, who was still standing
by him, looking at the vivacious Mrs. Cresswell, who was talking
and laughing with two men of the house party. As he walked away
with Sir Harry, he took the pageant programme from his pocket and
glanced at it. Only the names of the leading characters were
printed in each scene.</p>

<p>"I see," he remarked, "that Edward the Sixth&mdash;that pretty
girl you were admiring just now&mdash;is Miss Sonia Fullinger. One
of your house party, Sir Harry?"</p>

<p>"Yes. One of my daughter's friends."</p>

<p>"And Queen Anne?&mdash;She is staying with you, too?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Cresswell? Oh, yes."</p>

<p>"You must have your house quite full."</p>

<p>Sir Harry laughed.</p>

<p>"We have. But they are all off tomorrow, except
Bristow&mdash;he's got things to finish up before he leaves."</p>

<p>"Ah," replied Hurst nonchalantly, "so Her Majesty departs
tomorrow&mdash;as an ordinary subject once more."</p>

<p>Sir Harry laughed again.</p>

<p>"Dear lady!" he exclaimed. "I think she thoroughly enjoyed
playing her part. Well, I suppose all the women did. Love
dressing-up, you know."</p>

<p>The others were following Sir Harry towards the manor, split up
into little groups. Charlie was walking with Sonia Fullinger, in
deep conversation with her. Anstice Lynwood, who, with her brother
Harry, came after them, smiled. She had more than an inkling that
Charlie and Sonia were getting extremely interested in one another,
and the thought pleased her. Sonia was her very special
friend&mdash;and the possibility of having her for a
sister-in-law&mdash;</p>

<p>But, just then, Harry Lynwood, who was not living at home but
had only run down for a few days to take his part, broke in on her
thoughts.</p>

<p>"Who's the governor got hold of, sis? That fellow in the black
cloak he's taking into the house? I've noticed him more than once.
Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's Jasper Hurst. He's father's new tenant. He's taken
The Gables, you know."</p>

<p>"When did he do that?"</p>

<p>"About a couple of months ago."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. An old bachelor, I think. Anyhow, he lives by
himself. Oh, he's all <i>right</i>, you know," she added. "Father
called, and he's dined with us once. Rather a stuffy old
bird&mdash;not much to say for himself. Charlie fixed him for this
show."</p>

<p>"Looks rather like the villain of the piece, in that black
rig-up." Mrs. Cresswell's laugh rang out just then. Anstice glanced
over her shoulder at her, and then said to her brother, in a low
voice: "Don't you think Mrs. Cresswell is a silly ass to sport
those pearls of hers all over the place?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, they are frightfully valuable, you know. I think she's
simply asking for trouble."</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean it's a temptation?"</p>

<p>"Well, you don't know who there might have been among the crowd
we had in here today. I know one thing, and that is that her
husband would be perfectly hectic about it if he knew she'd been
wearing that necklace. He's most awfully particular about
it&mdash;family heirloom, and all that sort of thing. They say he
only lets her put the thing on when he's present, or at shows where
detectives are engaged."</p>

<p>"Well, he isn't here today, anyway. And the thing's all over
now. If any motor bandits were about they'd have had the bally
pearls by this time."</p>

<p>"All the same," replied Anstice, "I shan't be sorry when she
clears out tomorrow and takes them away. She only wanted to take
the part of Queen Anne so that she could swank around with her
beastly jewelry. You know, Roger hadn't really meant her to, but
she had the cheek to ask for it, and he let her have it because he
thought she'd sulk if he didn't."</p>

<p>By this time they had reached the house. The large entrance-hall
quickly filled up with the assembling guests. Sir Harry raised his
voice. "Now, you good people, get ready as soon as you can&mdash;no
changing, you know. I expect you are all precious hungry, what?
Come along, Hurst," he added, beginning to lead the way upstairs.
At the end of a long corridor on the first floor was a large
bathroom with a couple of lavatory basins. Here the men of the
party assembled to make a hasty toilet, laughing and joking as they
did so. Jasper Hurst washed his hands, glanced at his face in a
mirror, adjusted his false moustache and beard, went out into the
corridor, but, instead of making his way down again into the hall
at once, stood, unobtrusively, at the extreme end of the corridor,
apparently looking out of the window. Standing there, in his black
suit, in the darkening shadows, he was scarcely noticeable. A
shrewd observer, however, had there been one, would have remarked
that he kept turning his head and glancing along the corridor, into
which the doors from the bedrooms on either side opened.</p>

<p>One by one the men came out of the bathroom and went downstairs.
Women appeared, also, coming out of their rooms. Mrs. Cresswell,
followed by a girl in black, who was evidently her maid; then Sonia
Fullinger, from a room exactly opposite. Presently Sonia's maid
emerged. By this time Hurst had moved, and was slowly walking along
the corridor to the stairs. He came down into the hall with one of
the other men. There was a babel of conversation, and the butler
announced that the meal was ready.</p>

<p>"In you go," cried Sir Harry. "No ceremony!"</p>

<p>"Oh," said one of the ladies, "but you <i>must</i> take Her
Majesty in, Sir Harry. It's only proper. We'll all follow."</p>

<p>Sir Harry turned to "Queen Anne," who was still wearing the
famous pearls, laid his hand on his heart, bowed low, and said:</p>

<p>"May it please Your Majesty graciously to permit me to escort
you to the banquet?"</p>

<p>With a smile of appreciation, "Queen Anne," accepting his
proffered hand, replied:</p>

<p>"We are delighted, Sir Harry."</p>

<p>Amid a burst of merriment Sir Harry and his regal companion led
the way to the dining-room, the rest of the company following
informally. Charles Lynwood, however, took care to have Sonia
Fullinger close by him when the table was reached. Jasper Hurst
slipped into a chair on the other side of Sonia, so that the girl
sat between them.</p>

<p>It was more of a supper than a formal meal, and the excitement
of the pageant and the actual wearing of the costumes produced
hilarity fast and furious. Attempts were made to act parts over the
supper-table. Hudson, the grave, white-haired old butler, was quite
startled out of his dignified deportment by receiving such orders
as:</p>

<p>"What ho, varlet! Wine in this goblet of mine. Dost hear,
sirrah!"</p>

<p>"Queen Anne" enjoyed being constantly addressed as "Your
Majesty," and quite felt the part. Sir Harry looked on, smiling,
from the head of the table. He loved to see his guests in merry
mood.</p>

<p>From time to time Jasper Hurst got in a few words with Sonia.
Once he led the conversation to Mrs. Cresswell.</p>

<p>"She makes an excellent queen," he said. "Quite the right part
for her."</p>

<p>"Isn't it? I don't know that I ever saw her looking so pleased
with herself."</p>

<p>"Ah," he replied, "and you know her well, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. She's a neighbour of ours. We both live at
Hampstead, you see. Mr. Cresswell and my father are both on the
Stock Exchange&mdash;and old friends."</p>

<p>She turned from him to answer some remark of Charlie's.
Presently, however, he found an opportunity to talk to her
again.</p>

<p>"I thought," he said, "that you and Mrs. Cresswell acted your
parts splendidly in that earlier scene&mdash;the Norman one. Surely
you must have had a lot of rehearsing&mdash;I mean more than we
actually had here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, you see," she replied, "we both knew we were going to
play in that scene&mdash;Captain Bristow fixed it up more than a
month ago. So we <i>did</i> arrange a few details before we came
down here. So glad you approved."</p>

<p>A burst of laughter arising from some joke at the other end of
the table drowned conversation for a minute or two. Then Hurst
said, casually:</p>

<p>"I hear this merry party breaks up tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Yes. Most of us are off."</p>

<p>"You go by train?"</p>

<p>"No. I ran down here in my car. As a matter of fact, I brought
Mrs. Cresswell with me, and I'm taking her back. I've a ripping
little two-seater," she went on, with all the car-owner's pride,
"and I just love driving. What are you laughing at?"</p>

<p>"I was wondering how you managed to carry all your luggage," he
said. "Mrs. Cresswell gives me the idea of the sort of woman who
wouldn't be content with a dressing-case when she goes out to
stay."</p>

<p>"You are observant," she replied. "She takes a small cargo with
her. Much too much for my little run-about. So our respective maids
take our goods and chattels by train. Saves a lot of bother."</p>

<p>"I suppose she doesn't send those pearls of hers with her maid?"
asked Hurst, dryly.</p>

<p>Sonia shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Don't know," she replied lightly. "Never asked her. Anyhow, her
maid's trustworthy. Been with her for years&mdash;Oh, Charlie," she
went on, turning to him, "I want to ask you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again a burst of laughter made conversation, for the time being,
impossible. It was followed by one of those sudden silences which
sometimes fall upon the most animated parties, a silence which was
broken by someone saying, across the table:</p>

<p>"When was that sedan-chair of yours used last, Sir Harry? Or was
it kept sacredly empty after the real Queen Anne had ridden in
it?"</p>

<p>"No, no," he began. Then his face clouded a little. "I believe
my family made use of it&mdash;until later Georgian times."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the last occasion? Is there any record?"</p>

<p>It was the Vicar who asked the question. Harry Lynwood shot a
quick glance at his brother, who frowned, slightly, and looked down
on his plate. There was silence for a moment. Then Sir Harry
said:</p>

<p>"It was a tragedy."</p>

<p>"A tragedy?" exclaimed Mrs. Cresswell, clapping her hands. "Oh,
do tell us, Sir Harry!"</p>

<p>Sir Harry paused again; and then said:</p>

<p>"Very well. It's a bit of family history, and, perhaps, not
quite creditable, what? But I'll tell you, if you like. That chair
was last used by my great-grandfather, in 1814. And, as far as I
know, no one has ever been carried in it since&mdash;till
today."</p>

<p>A little murmur of expectation ran round the group. Sir Harry
went on:</p>

<p>"My great-grandfather, Sir Charles Lynwood, was the second son.
His brother, Harry, had died when quite a boy&mdash;we're always
'Harry' first, and then 'Charles,' we Lynwoods, you know. So
Charles inherited the baronetcy and the estate. He was one of the
old hard-drinking, stick-at-nothing in the hunting-field squires.
Instead of coming to an untimely end with a broken neck, as most
people thought he would, he developed gout, and had to give up
hunting. But he didn't appear to give up his temper as well, which
was as chronic and violent as his gout, it seems. And the hunt
called him still, though he was a cripple and couldn't ride to
hounds any longer. But, whenever there was a meet in front of the
house here, he insisted on being carried outside in that
sedan-chair, and the men who carried him had a deuce of a time of
it, by all accounts. If they tilted the chair ever so little, or
stopped when he wanted to go on, or went on when he wanted to stop,
he let 'em have it&mdash;hot and strong.</p>

<p>"Well, one day, when the meet was outside, a restive horse began
kicking up his heels close to the old man. The bearers made a move
to get him out of danger, but one of them stumbled over a tussock
of grass, and nearly fell. My testy ancestor was pitched forward,
and his head broke the glass. Then he let out sulphur and
brimstone, you know&mdash;and his face as hot as a coal, with a
trickle of blood running over it. Suddenly he gurgled&mdash;and
stopped&mdash;and&mdash;well&mdash;there was an end of Sir
Charles."</p>

<p>"Apoplexy?"</p>

<p>The one word, spoken by the Vicar, broke the silence. Sir Harry
nodded.</p>

<p>"Apoplexy," he echoed. "They brought him indoors&mdash;dead. And
that's the last occasion until today, so far as I know, that anyone
was carried in that sedan-chair. It has stood in the hall ever
since."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cresswell shivered.</p>

<p>"And I&mdash;I&mdash;was the first&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear lady," broke in Sir Harry, smiling and turning towards
her, "or may I say, 'Your Majesty'? Today your gracious presence
within our old chair has broken any spell that may have attached
itself to it. You have recalled the memories of all the dear,
beautiful women who have sat in it. Never again can we associate it
with a tragedy, what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, daddy!" exclaimed Anstice, "since when have you learned to
pay such compliments?"</p>

<p>"Since I became one of Her gracious Majesty's courtiers, my
dear," replied her father, placing his hand on his heart, and
bowing to Mrs. Cresswell, gallantly.</p>

<p>"You play your part well, Sir Harry," said Captain Bristow. "I
shall never attempt to coach you again."</p>

<p>Once more laughter and merriment broke out round the
supper-table. Presently, the meal over, an adjournment was made to
the hall. Cigars and cigarettes added incongruity to the various
costumes.</p>

<p>Sonia Fullinger was the first to retire, on the plea of a
headache; the other ladies followed. A move was made on the part of
the men, to the smoking-room. The Vicar, who was a bachelor and
kept late hours, was easily persuaded to stay for a little while.
Hudson brought whisky, siphons and glasses.</p>

<p>The hour grew late. One by one the men slipped off. Sir Harry
begged to be excused. He was tired, he said. Finally, only four
remained in the smoking-room&mdash;Captain Bristow, Charles
Lynwood, Jasper Hurst and the Vicar. The latter, like many of the
clergy, was a reader of detective-stories and an amateur student of
criminology. And, in the course of conversation, he discovered that
Captain Bristow, in the last two years of the Great War, had been
in the Secret Service. He tried to draw him; Bristow, at first, was
reticent, but presently opened out a little&mdash;on general topics
only, however. He ignored all innuendoes which might have led up to
personal experiences. Charles Lynwood and Jasper Hurst for the most
part were silent&mdash;but interested&mdash;listeners.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," the Captain said presently, in answer to a question
put by the Vicar, "it isn't easy to answer. A <i>perfect</i>
criminal! None of the criminals we know of were perfect. They
wouldn't have been found out if they had been. If ever there was
what you mean by a 'perfect' criminal, no one ever knew him as a
criminal. Perfection, you see, in such a case, means absolute
concealment. Doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I suppose it does," agreed the Vicar. "What do you
think, Hurst?" he went on.</p>

<p>Jasper Hurst took his cigar from his mouth, flicked the ash from
it with his little finger into one of the trays on the table, and
said, thoughtfully:</p>

<p>"Absolute concealment, yes&mdash;as far as the criminal himself
is aware. But there may have been those&mdash;and no doubt there
were&mdash;who imagined themselves to be perfect criminals, as you
call them, but whose secrets were known by someone else, all the
time."</p>

<p>"Someone who never let it out, you mean?" asked Charlie.</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Someone who himself kept the secret from motives of
self-preservation?" hazarded Charles.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," replied Hurst. "One might keep the secret of
another's crime out of purely altruistic motives."</p>

<p>"But, surely," broke in the Vicar, "that would be extremely
immoral, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>It was a little difficult, on account of his false moustache and
beard, to see if Hurst was smiling slightly, as he answered:</p>

<p>"That depends upon how one interprets moral action&mdash;or, in
the case we are considering, inaction."</p>

<p>"Well," said the Vicar, "to go back to what we were saying about
the perfect criminal. Reverse the question. Is there such a thing
as a perfect detective?"</p>

<p>"Can't be&mdash;unless he's the Pope," replied Bristow, with a
smile. "The Pope?" asked Charlie.</p>

<p>"The Vicar understands&mdash;don't you, Vicar?" said Bristow.
"Infallibility?" suggested the cleric.</p>

<p>"Exactly. The perfect detective must be infallible in method,
deduction&mdash;and even instinct."</p>

<p>"Which latter," observed the Vicar, "is much more, by its
nature, inclined to infallibility than method or deduction. But,"
he added, "that brings us from the realms of criminology into an
even more extensive area, in which I, for one, haven't time to
wander tonight&mdash;I mean psychology. Oh," he went on, glancing
at his watch, "I'd no idea it was so late."</p>

<p>He got up. So did the others. Charlie, acting as host, pointed
to the decanter.</p>

<p>"Another&mdash;?" he began.</p>

<p>"No, thanks," said the Vicar. "I limit myself now and then to a
small one. And I've had it."</p>

<p>"Hurst?"</p>

<p>Jasper Hurst, also, refused.</p>

<p>"Well," went on the young man, "a cigarette&mdash;to start
with&mdash;" and he produced and opened his case. "Oh! da&mdash;I
beg your pardon, Vicar! Hang it all!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Bristow.</p>

<p>"Empty," replied Charlie, showing his case. "Fact is, I took my
last box with me to the dressing-tent. Thought they'd be useful
there."</p>

<p>"I've got plenty," said Bristow.</p>

<p>"Thanks, but I'm used to my own peculiarly vicious brand. I'll
run over to the tent and get the box."</p>

<p>The four men walked to the hall. The Vicar found there the
old-fashioned, three-cornered hat belonging to his costume, and put
it on. "The back gates are not locked, are they?" he asked Charlie.
"No. They're all right."</p>

<p>"That's my nearest way. A bit further round for you, Hurst?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Hurst, putting on his big, black, broad-brimmed
hat. "I'll go down the drive."</p>

<p>Charlie opened the front door.</p>

<p>"Don't wait up for me, old man," he said to Bristow. "I'll lock
up when I get back."</p>

<p>"All right," replied Bristow. "I'm going up to bed. Good
night."</p>

<p>He stepped outside, however, on to the terrace. The moon, well
on in her last quarter, had risen, but behind clouds. There was
just light enough to see dimly. He watched the three men as they
left the house&mdash;and separated. The Vicar turned to the left,
to make his way through the stable-yard to the back entrance; the
sombre figure of Jasper Hurst took the carriage-drive towards the
bridge and the main entrance; while Charles Lynwood walked across
the lawn to the marquee. He was the most distinct of the three, on
account of the white trousers he was wearing.</p>

<p>Then Roger Bristow came in, shut the door quietly, and slowly
went up the stairs from the hall. Half-way up, in a niche, stood a
grandfather-clock. As he passed it it struck&mdash;once. He glanced
at the dial. Half-past one.</p>

<h2>Chapter 2</h2>

<p>Roger Bristow was tired. The pageant had given him much work,
both of brain and body, and, that day, he had been on the go since
an early hour in the morning. He was not sorry to get to his room,
and confessed to himself that the prospect of bed was an inviting
one.</p>

<p>His room was one of several in the front of the house, opening
into the long corridor on the first floor. When he entered it,
heavy curtains were drawn across the window, and the room was in
darkness. He turned on the electric light and began to divest
himself of his garments. Off came the long jack-boots, the
voluminous, full-skirted coat and full wig. He gave a sigh of
relief, filled and lighted his pipe, and sat down in a comfortable
arm-chair for a final whiff. He was in one of those tired,
lethargic moods when one knows the sooner one is between the sheets
the better, and yet dawdles in the preparations for getting
there.</p>

<p>Presently, however, he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and
lazily proceeded to take off the rest of his clothes and get into
pyjamas. He wound up his watch, placing it on a small table beside
his bed, and laid by it a little pocket electric torch. He liked to
know what time it was if he woke in the night.</p>

<p>Turning off the light, he found his way to the window, drew
aside the curtains, and opened one of the casements, lingering for
a moment or two to breathe the cool, fresh air. It was a very still
night outside; the moon was obscured by slowly-moving clouds, but
there was just light enough to discern the larger objects, the
trees, the broad sweep of the carriage-drive, the bridge with its
low stone parapets, and, especially, the big white mass of the
marquee, standing solidly against its background of trees, a white
mass broken by a dark square shape in its centre, the opening into
the tent.</p>

<p>He was just about to move away from the window and get into bed
when he hesitated: a blur appeared against the white of the
marquee&mdash;someone was coming out of the opening&mdash;Oh,
Charles, of course, he thought. What a time he had been, though!
No&mdash;it was very strange&mdash;against that white background
something else appeared&mdash;a crude, big mass of a thing,
followed, as it moved slowly, by another figure. Just then the
clouds partly cleared for a moment from the moon, the dim light
strengthened. There could be no mistake about it.</p>

<p>It was the sedan-chair, being carried by two men out of the
marquee. Charlie!&mdash;no, neither of them could be
Charlie&mdash;he was wearing white trousers. And the two moving
figures were as dark and black as the trees.</p>

<p>Astonishment at so weird an occurrence in the middle of the
night gave way to a smile. What a cumbersome thing to steal, and
how could it be disposed of afterwards? For that was the first
thought that entered his mind. It had become known that a valuable
antique had been left in the marquee for the night, and thieves
were calmly carrying it away. But they should not get far with it,
anyhow. He would see to that. He was wide-awake once more, now.</p>

<p>Without turning on the light he slipped into a jacket, put on a
pair of shoes, took the little electric torch, and opened the door
very quietly, turning on his torch as he stepped into the corridor.
He went swiftly down the stairs: the hall, which had a single
electric light burning in it when he had gone up to his room, was
now in darkness. Of course. Charlie had turned off the light when
he had come in. By the door in the hall was a stand full of
umbrellas and walking-sticks. Taking one of the latter, a good,
heavy one, he prepared to unfasten the door.</p>

<p>But it proved to be unlocked and unbolted, and he had only to
turn the handle to open it. "Queer!" he thought. "Charlie must have
forgotten to lock up."</p>

<p>He had extinguished his torch before going outside. He had no
wish for a light to be seen. Outside he stood still for just a
moment on the terrace. He could just discern the two men, still
carrying the chair. They were taking it away from the house, along
the drive, and had almost reached the bridge.</p>

<p>Stepping lightly over the gravelled oval of the drive, Bristow
made for the lawn, and sprinted silently over the grass. But he
forgot, in his haste, that a gravelled path, leading from the
drive, crossed the lawn about half-way to the bridge. As he raced
across it, "scrunch-scrunch" rang out his two footsteps in the
quiet night.</p>

<p>"Damn!" he ejaculated beneath his breath. For he knew that he
had given the alarm.</p>

<p>Then he saw, in the shrouded moonlight, the bearers set down the
chair and start running down the drive. He gave chase, passing the
chair, which was now standing on the bridge. The two men had a
start, but Bristow, in spite of his inclination to stoutness, was a
quick runner, and hoped condition would tell.</p>

<p>But the instant he had rounded the slight curve beyond the
bridge, he caught sight of something which had been, up to this
time, completely hidden by intervening trees&mdash;a small, open
four-seater motor-car, with its head pointing down the drive.
Already his quarry had scrambled into her, and he heard the
"Whir-r-r-chug-chug" of the engine as the electric starter was
pressed. She began to move off, slowly, on first gear, but without
her light showing. He sprinted, desperately, to overtake her, if he
could, but there was a grinding noise as a hasty change of gear was
made, she gathered speed&mdash;and he knew the chase was up.</p>

<p>But he did not lose his presence of mind. The lights on the car
were still extinguished, so that the rear number-plate was
indiscernible. He flashed on his torch, however, just in time to
read and memorize the registration number:</p>

<p>"QV 5277."</p>

<p>Then he stopped to recover his breath. Even then he laughed to
himself. It all seemed so absurd. How could a clumsy sedan-chair be
carried away in that little car? Was it, after all, only a
practical joke?</p>

<p>He stood for a minute or so, listening. He could hear the car,
as she ran down the drive&mdash;no longer in sight, though. Then
came silence. She had stopped. Ah, probably while one of the
inmates got out to open the gate leading into the high-road outside
the Manor grounds. Yes, that must have been it&mdash;for he heard
her starting again. Well, he had missed the bit of fun he had
anticipated&mdash;but, anyhow, the beggars hadn't got away with
that chair!</p>

<p>He began to walk back to the house leisurely, being still a
little out of breath. As he rounded the curve the sedan-chair came
into view, a dim mass, standing on the bridge, just faintly
outlined by the cloud-hidden moon, which was directly in front of
him. Sir Harry's grim story flashed into his mind, and he pictured
the irascible old baronet being carried for the last time in that
historic chair. As he came up to it he slackened his pace. The
interior of the chair, facing him, was naturally in deep shadow,
the moon being behind. Bristow still held his little torch in his
hand, and, acting on a chance impulse, flashed it upon the old
chair&mdash;then stopped short.</p>

<p>There was someone inside. The first idea that came to him,
following naturally upon the train of thought suggested by Sir
Harry's story, was that Charles Lynwood&mdash;but no! Charlie had
evidently come back to the house and turned out the hall light,
though he seemed to have forgotten to lock the front door.</p>

<p>The next moment he was peering through the open side window of
the chair, the beam of light from his torch illuminating the
inside. And there, seated, was Jasper Hurst in his black velvet
cloak, the false moustache and beard torn off his face, and a dark
dribble of blood trickling down one cheek from what appeared to be
a wound on his temple.</p>

<p>Captain Bristow was one of those men who rarely lose their
self-possession in an emergency. The first thing he did was to take
the limp, dangling hand of Jasper Hurst and feel his pulse. He
thought there was just a faint beating, and the thought was
justified when he saw&mdash;as he held the torch towards his
face&mdash;the eyelids of the man quiver, very slightly. The head
was resting back in a corner, motionless.</p>

<p>Then Jasper Hurst's lips moved. He was trying to say
something&mdash;Bristow bent his head down to catch it&mdash;just a
whisper&mdash;almost inaudible; in fact, he only caught two
words:</p>

<p>"the...line..."</p>

<p>Then Hurst's mouth opened&mdash;the lower jaw fell&mdash;there
was a deep sigh...Bristow tore aside the heavy cloak and thrust his
hand under his clothing...there was no response. Jasper Hurst's
heart had ceased to beat now. He was dead!</p>

<p>Captain Bristow, eminently alive to the importance of immediate
action, and eminently cool in carrying out such action, did not
pause to consider the strangeness of the circumstances. Jasper
Hurst was dead. Bristow had seen too many men die to doubt this,
and felt that there was nothing more he could do for him, though he
realised it was imperative to get a doctor as swiftly as possible.
He was not only dead, though, but apparently, murdered. And the
murderers had had a start. The hunt was up. The hounds must follow
quickly.</p>

<p>Thank goodness he had taken the number of that car! As he
hurried back to the house, he found himself repeating it&mdash;"QV
5277"&mdash;at least he was certain of that.</p>

<p>He let himself in, ran upstairs, tapped at the door of Sir
Harry's room, entered it before the suddenly-awakened Baronet could
collect his dazed ideas, and turned on the light by the switch
beside the door.</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;what the deuce&mdash;?" began the astonished Sir
Harry, sitting up in bed. "Bristow! What's the matter?"</p>

<p>Hastily Bristow told him. And seemed to take command of the
situation.</p>

<p>"I'll telephone to the police at Chiltonbury, while you get some
things on, Sir Harry," he said, "if you'll give me the number. And
is there a doctor in the village?"</p>

<p>"Chiltonbury Nine is the number of the police. The telephone's
in the hall. Yes&mdash;Dr. Forbes lives in the village," replied
Sir Harry, who was out of bed now. "I'll call Harry, and ask him to
go for Forbes. You might rouse Charlie, if you would. Good God,
Bristow&mdash;this is a terrible thing. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Bristow was already out of the room, speeding along the
corridor. Half-way along, he stopped, at Charles Lynwood's
room&mdash;a room that looked out at the back of the house. Charlie
was in bed. Bristow explained.</p>

<p>"All right," said Charlie, his head still on the pillow. "I'll
be down in half a shake. <i>Dead</i>, you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;best not rouse the guests," replied Bristow, leaving
the room&mdash;and leaving Charlie still in bed.</p>

<p>A sergeant on night duty at Chiltonbury Police Station, three
miles away, answered the call.</p>

<p>"Right, sir," he said, when he had taken in the grim message.
"I'll have the Superintendent up at once, and we'll run out in a
car. We'll bring the police surgeon with us."</p>

<p>"Sir Harry is sending for the local doctor at once."</p>

<p>"I see. But we'll have our man out all the same. Please repeat
the number of that car, sir."</p>

<p>"QV 5277."</p>

<p>"You didn't see which direction it took when it got out on the
main road?"</p>

<p>"No. Too far off. And they hadn't lit up."</p>

<p>He rang off. Sir Harry, half-dressed, came down the stairs,
followed by his eldest son.</p>

<p>"No need to disturb the whole household," he said, in a low
voice. "You've rung up the police, Bristow?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They'll be here directly."</p>

<p>"Good. You go and fetch Forbes," he went on, turning to his
son.</p>

<p>"Right," said Harry. "I'll run the two-seater up the village. I
can get out the back way without making a row. If Jarvis is about,
I'll bring him along, too."</p>

<p>"Who is Jarvis?" Bristow asked the Baronet as Harry went
out.</p>

<p>"Our village policeman. Sharp fellow. Ah&mdash;here's
Charlie."</p>

<p>Charlie came down into the hall. He appeared to have slipped on
those Regency white trousers, as the first thing that came to hand.
And a golf jacket, tightly buttoned, with the collar turned up and
a muffler round his neck. Sir Harry said:</p>

<p>"Bristow, we'd better go outside&mdash;and see to things.
Coming, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think I'll stay here, dad,&mdash;in case anyone gets
alarmed, and&mdash;" Bristow, about to go out with Sir Harry,
turned abruptly, and broke in:</p>

<p>"Didn't you lock the front door when you came in from getting
your cigarettes, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Did I?&mdash;no&mdash;yes&mdash;no&mdash;hanged if I remember.
I was awfully tired and sleepy."</p>

<p>"You didn't see anything&mdash;outside?"</p>

<p>"This beastly business?&mdash;Hurst, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>Sir Harry and Bristow were in the act of stepping outside when
another voice made them stop and turn. Hudson had come into the
hall, his dress-coat over his pyjamas, a poker in his hand.</p>

<p>"Is anything the matter, Sir Harry? I thought I
heard&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush! We don't want to wake everyone. Yes. There's been an
accident. You might ask James to dress and come down&mdash;but
don't make a noise about it. Come along, Bristow."</p>

<p>The two men hurried to the bridge. Bristow flashed his torch on
the face of the dead man. Sir Harry exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Poor chap! It's ghastly, what? To think he was with us at
supper tonight. A tenant of mine, you know, Bristow," he added.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"And that's about all I know concerning him. He's only been in
my house, The Gables, a couple of months. Quiet, decent
fellow."</p>

<p>He leaned forward, putting his hand against the chair.</p>

<p>"Better not do that, Sir Harry," remarked Bristow.
"Finger-prints, you know. Not that there's much to be got out of
them, for plenty of folks have touched that chair in the last few
hours. But it's best to leave everything alone&mdash;for the
police."</p>

<p>Sir Harry turned to him.</p>

<p>"I forgot, Bristow," he said. "Bit of policeman yourself, aren't
you? Secret Service, and all that. What?"</p>

<p>Captain Bristow shrugged his shoulders, slightly.</p>

<p>"I'm out of that now," he replied, "and even if I
wasn't&mdash;this isn't my business. Ah!" he went on, "Harry's
back, I think."</p>

<p>For they heard a car coming into the stable-yard beside the
house. In a moment or two three dark figures came quickly across
the lawn. Harry, Dr. Forbes, and a man in police uniform.</p>

<p>"He's found Jarvis," said Sir Harry.</p>

<p>Dr. Forbes was a little man, with a round face, and small
bristly moustache. He spoke in a quick, staccato manner.</p>

<p>"Terrible business, I hear, Sir Harry. Can't do much, from what
your son tells me. Let's have a look, though. Ha!&mdash;flash that
torch a bit nearer, sir," to Bristow. "That'll do. Good. Umph!
Don't take long to diagnose this. The poor chap's dead, right
enough. Nasty-looking wound that, too!"</p>

<p>"Broke his skull, what?" asked the Baronet.</p>

<p>"Can't say, Sir Harry,&mdash;not without a further examination.
That'll come. Burton, from Chiltonbury, will have to take things in
hand. Yes. Quite!"</p>

<p>"The police surgeon?" asked Bristow.</p>

<p>"Exactly. I can't do any more at the moment. Unprofessional.
Harry tells me he's on the way here now. Good!"</p>

<p>The policeman stepped forward, addressing Bristow.</p>

<p>"Are you the gentleman who found the body, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Mr. Harry Lynwood tells me there was a car driven off by two
men, and that you had noted the number."</p>

<p>"Quite right. I've already 'phoned it to the police-station at
Chiltonbury."</p>

<p>"What was it, sir?"</p>

<p>"QV 5277."</p>

<p>Jarvis, if the light had been sufficient, would have been seen
to raise his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"You're certain, sir?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"That's very queer, then."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"QV 5277 is the number of the Vicar's car. I know it well."</p>

<p>"The <i>Vicar's</i> car?" exclaimed Sir Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes, Sir Harry. A four-seater Morris&mdash;open tourer. Was
that it, sir?" he added, to Bristow.</p>

<p>"Four-seater. Yes. I couldn't swear to the make. I only caught
sight of the back of it, you see."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the Vicar's car, right enough, sir. Funny
thing!"</p>

<p>"Queer business, queer business!" ejaculated the little doctor.
"Man knocked on the head and carried off in sedan-chair. Murderers
make their getaway in the padre's car. Queer business," he
repeated.</p>

<p>"Here comes one who can solve it, if anyone can, I reckon," said
Jarvis, just a vestige of pride in his voice as being connected
with the solver to whom he alluded. "Here's the
Superintendent."</p>

<p>A glaring beam of light shot out towards them, coming round the
curve of the drive. The chair, with its silent, still inmate, was
illuminated brilliantly, as was the little group of men standing
beside it. The driver was the first to get out when the car
stopped. Turning, for a moment, as he came forward, to say a word
to one of its other occupants, his face was lighted up in the glare
of the headlights; a clean-shaven, cultured face, rather long, with
pointed chin, large nose, and dark, penetrating eyes.</p>

<p>Then he turned once more.</p>

<p>"Ah, Jarvis," he said, before addressing anyone else. "Glad you
are here. Go straight to the Vicarage and get hold of Mr.
Ashley-Smith. Find out if his car is in the garage there, and, if
so, if the radiator is warm. But don't touch it, or let anyone else
do so. Find out all you can about that car, where it was tonight.
The Vicarage is on the telephone, so you can 'phone your report
straight through to the Station before you come back here. And tell
the Vicar I shall want to see him,&mdash;later on. You needn't
bring him back."</p>

<p>Jarvis, first casting a look on the assembled company which
plainly said, "I told you so," was off like a shot. Superintendent
Kinch went on, speaking to the police surgeon, who had got out of
the car:</p>

<p>"You will do what is necessary to begin with, Doctor...Now..."
he summed up the little group, swiftly, eliminating the Baronet and
his two sons, and Dr. Forbes.</p>

<p>"Who telephoned to us?" he asked, looking straight at Bristow,
as if he knew already.</p>

<p>"I did," replied Bristow.</p>

<p>"Ah! And you found the body?"</p>

<p>Bristow nodded.</p>

<p>"He was not dead when I found him."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand that. Your name, sir?"</p>

<p>"Bristow&mdash;Captain Roger Bristow."</p>

<p>The Superintendent shot a keen glance at him. But, if he knew
him by repute, he said nothing.</p>

<p>"Staying at the Manor?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'll get you to tell me, presently, the whole sequence of
events. Ah, Doctor," he went on, "you've finished?"</p>

<p>"All I can do now," said the police surgeon. "The Coroner is
pretty well sure to order an autopsy. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, surely," broke in Sir Harry, "the cause of death is pretty
plain? A blow on the forehead, what?"</p>

<p>Dr. Burton shook his head, in a non-committal way.</p>

<p>"Externally it looks like it, certainly," he replied. "All the
same,&mdash;" and he arched his eyebrows questioningly, at his
fellow-professional.</p>

<p>"Quite so, quite so," ejaculated Dr. Forbes, "I thought you'd
say so, Burton."</p>

<p>"Well," said Sir Harry, "we can't leave the poor chap here,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Where does he live?" asked the Superintendent.</p>

<p>"At The Gables. Best part of a mile away."</p>

<p>"Would it be possible&mdash;at all events for the time
being&mdash;to take him into the Manor House?" asked Kinch. "If you
wouldn't mind, Sir Harry?"</p>

<p>"No," said Sir Harry; "I think we might manage that,
er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How about the gun-room, dad?" asked Harry Lynwood.
"Ah&mdash;that would do. I'll go back and make arrangements."</p>

<p>"If you will," said the Superintendent. Then he turned to the
other man, who had come with him and the police surgeon from
Chiltonbury, a big, good humored-looking fellow with a broad, open
face, clean-shaven, and fair hair; a man who was dressed in
civilian clothes and who, up to this moment, had not opened his
mouth. "You'll stay here, Mentmore? You'll know what to do?"
Mentmore nodded.</p>

<p>"I'll come back presently&mdash;and run home. See you before I
go."</p>

<p>Again Mentmore only nodded. He seemed to be a man of few words.
Then the Superintendent turned to Bristow. The two doctors, deep in
conversation, were following Sir Harry and his son towards the
house.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said Kinch, "I'd like you to tell me exactly what
happened tonight, if you will."</p>

<p>He listened to Bristow's concise, clear account of events,
occasionally asking a question, but, for the most part, letting the
other run on without interruption. He evidently realised that
Bristow had the knack of putting things into a succinct form. When
the latter had finished, however, he did ask a few questions.</p>

<p>"You noted the time?"</p>

<p>"The clock struck the half-hour&mdash;half-past one&mdash;as I
went up to bed. It would be about twenty minutes later, more or
less, that I looked out of my bedroom window and saw the chair
being carried out of the tent."</p>

<p>"I see. And these three people who went out of the house. Let me
get that clear. Hurst came along this drive. The Vicar went out at
the side gate, and Mr. Charles Lynwood towards the tent?"</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"You didn't see Mr. Charles come back?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Yet, when you went downstairs again you told me the front door
was still unlocked?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But the hall light was out. And I asked Charles about the
door. He forgot to lock it, apparently."</p>

<p>"And he said he saw nothing of this affair?"</p>

<p>"Quite so."</p>

<p>"I suppose he <i>did</i> go into the tent?"</p>

<p>Bristow shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Presumably," he said. "I haven't asked him that. As a matter of
fact, I've only had a moment or two with him since."</p>

<p>"Ah, well. Perhaps he may help us later. About this tent. I'd
like to have a look at it now. You've got your torch?"</p>

<p>"Come along, Superintendent."</p>

<p>He led the way, along the drive and then across the lawn, to the
big marquee, flashing his torch into it when they reached the
opening. There was light enough for the Superintendent to see that
the interior was divided into three parts, the larger portion, into
which the opening led, in the centre, and two others, one on either
side, screened by canvas.</p>

<p>"They were our dressing-rooms, so to speak," explained Bristow.
Kinch nodded.</p>

<p>"And this chair," he said, "can you remember whereabouts it was
left?"</p>

<p>"In this middle division&mdash;not very far inside."</p>

<p>The Superintendent glanced round the tent. In it were lying in
confusion paraphernalia which had been used in the
pageant&mdash;odd costumes, hats, tin helmets, spears,
swords&mdash;many made of wood covered with silver paper&mdash;a
couple of trumpets&mdash;used in the fanfare announcing the arrival
of Queen Anne&mdash;banners, scarves, a Maypole with its
ribbons&mdash;in all a very <i>olla podrida</i>.</p>

<p>The Superintendent shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Writers of detective fiction would have plenty of choice of
clues here," he said, dryly. "The trouble is, of course, that if
there happens to be anything worth noting, how in the world can one
pick it out from the others?"</p>

<p>He stood for a moment, thinking. Then he said:</p>

<p>"It's part of our business to comb things out, though. Look
here, Captain Bristow&mdash;I understand you produced this
pageant?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"Well, is there a property-list?"</p>

<p>"There is. Miss Lynwood drew one up&mdash;a very careful
one."</p>

<p>"And these costumes?"</p>

<p>"Most of them hired&mdash;and all of them only worn by people
living in or staying in the house. The other players provided their
own dresses&mdash;and took them away or wore them home."</p>

<p>"So you would be able to check these?"</p>

<p>"I think Miss Lynwood might. She was extraordinarily careful in
making lists&mdash;and, of course, the firm we hired the things
from sent their own list with them."</p>

<p>"Good! I won't have anything touched here till the morning. I'll
put Jarvis on guard outside the house. Then I shall have to ask
Miss Lynwood to check all that is here&mdash;One moment, sir,
please."</p>

<p>He took the torch from Bristow's hand, and advanced into the
tent, flashing it in every direction. Bristow stood, just inside
the tent, watching him. A detailed search in that realm of costumes
and properties with only a small torch to help was an
impossibility.</p>

<p>Presently Kinch came back to Bristow.</p>

<p>"Found anything?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the Superintendent had not. But he was
non-committal. His business, just then, was to ask for
information&mdash;not to give it. He made no reply to Bristow's
question. A little smile twitched on the lips of the questioner,
but he said nothing.</p>

<p>The Superintendent gave back the torch to Bristow.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said. "I'd like to go to the house for a few
minutes and see Mr. Charles Lynwood&mdash;if he hasn't gone to bed
again. Then I'll run back to Chiltonbury with Dr. Burton. I'm
leaving a good man in charge here," he went on, as the two started
walking across the lawn back to the house.
"Mentmore&mdash;Detective-Sergeant Mentmore. You can rely on him. I
shall be out again about eight o'clock. Of course I shall want to
interview everybody in the house&mdash;as a matter of
routine&mdash;and I don't want any of them to leave before I come.
I shan't disturb them now. But I'd like you to have a list of all
the people who are in the house&mdash;including the
servants,&mdash;please, ready for me when I come out."</p>

<p>"I'll see to that. But it is clearly an outside job, don't you
think, Superintendent?"</p>

<p>"Looks uncommonly like it, certainly. I suppose you can't give
me any details about these two men who made off with the car?
Didn't notice anything about them?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I can't. I didn't get near enough. And it was too
dark to make out anything."</p>

<p>"Ah! I was afraid so. Curious thing about that car, though," he
added.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are taking steps&mdash;" began Bristow.</p>

<p>But the Superintendent broke in, with a keen glance at his
companion&mdash;they were entering the hall now, and the light
shone on Bristow's face&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you think, sir? Within five minutes of getting your
message we had all stations warned to look out for QV 5277. They
hadn't time to get far before you gave the alarm. I don't think for
a moment Jarvis will find that car in the Vicar's garage, but what
I do think is that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sir Harry, who was waiting in the hall, came forward.</p>

<p>"Ah, there you are, Superintendent," he said. "A telephone
message has just come through from your police-station at
Chiltonbury. I took it down&mdash;here it is."</p>

<p>And he handed the Superintendent a pencilled slip of paper.</p>

<p>"Constable Chalmers has just 'phoned from Drifford. He reports a
Morris Oxford four-seater in a ditch on the main London road, seems
to have run into a telegraph-pole. Both number-plates are
missing."</p>

<p>The Superintendent handed the paper to Bristow, a little smile
on his face as he did so. Then, with just a word to Sir Harry,
asking permission, he took up the telephone-receiver.</p>

<p>"Four-two Drifford, please...Hullo...Yes...Superintendent Kinch
speaking...Just got your message sent on from
Chiltonbury...Yes...Constable Chalmers found the car...I know...I
want you to start a search for those
number-plates...Yes&mdash;along the ditches&mdash;hedges&mdash;and
so on&mdash;taking the breakdown as the centre...Yes, report
straight to my office, please...All right."</p>

<p>He turned to Sir Harry and Captain Bristow, a smile on his face.
"You can remove number-plates with a spanner in three minutes," he
said, "but you don't carry the things about with you
afterwards&mdash;if you are trying to make a getaway.
Ah&mdash;here's Jarvis. Car in the Vicarage garage, Jarvis?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right. That's all I want to know just now. The rest can
wait. You've 'phoned your report to Chiltonbury?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. Go outside the house and keep an eye on that big
tent. Don't let anyone go in till I'm back."</p>

<p>"One word," said Bristow. "How far is Drifford from here?"</p>

<p>"Twenty miles or so the other side of Chiltonbury&mdash;on the
main London road," answered the Superintendent. "I know what you're
thinking, sir. Some speed, eh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well," replied Bristow, "one can always run to a fair speed
in the small hours of the morning. After all, there's nothing in
that." The Superintendent looked at him, curiously.</p>

<p>"Do you think they saw you flash your light on the car as they
made off?"</p>

<p>"One of 'em did&mdash;not the driver&mdash;t'other fellow turned
his head. I could just see that. You're sharp, Superintendent. You
have guessed what I was thinking of, evidently."</p>

<p>"I return the compliment, sir," replied Kinch, suavely. "That
is, if I guessed correctly."</p>

<p>"A waste of time?" hazarded Bristow.</p>

<p>"Exactly," retorted the Superintendent. "And now," he went on to
Sir Harry, "if I might have just a word with your son&mdash;Mr.
Charles&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sir Harry quietly led the way to the smoking-room, explaining as
he did so that the body of Jasper Hurst had been conveyed into the
house. In the smoking-room were Harry and Charles Lynwood, and Dr.
Burton, the police surgeon. Hudson had made them some coffee. The
Superintendent accepted a cup.</p>

<p>"May I ask you one or two questions, sir?" he began, speaking to
Charles Lynwood. The latter, who was smoking a cigarette, nodded.
"Captain Bristow tells me you went out of the house with the Vicar
and Hurst just before half-past one."</p>

<p>"Yes. That is so."</p>

<p>"The Vicar left by the side gate&mdash;and Hurst started going
down the drive?"</p>

<p>"He did."</p>

<p>"He didn't give you the appearance of a man who was expecting to
meet someone?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. He made a casual remark about the pageant&mdash;and
said good night. Nothing more."</p>

<p>"And you went on to the marquee&mdash;to get a box of cigarettes
you had left there?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, would you mind telling me exactly what happened
there?"</p>

<p>Charles arched his eyebrows&mdash;as in surprise at such a
question. "What happened?" he echoed. "Why&mdash;nothing, you see.
I found my cigarettes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At once?" asked Kinch, sharply.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I had to rummage about a bit first&mdash;to see where
they were."</p>

<p>"And there was no one in the tent?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of, Superintendent."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"I came back to the house&mdash;and went to bed."</p>

<p>"Without locking the door?"</p>

<p>"I suppose I must have forgotten&mdash;you say you found the
door unlocked when you went out, Roger?" he asked, turning to
Bristow.</p>

<p>The latter, who had taken a cigarette from a box on the table,
was smoking thoughtfully. He was looking down on the
floor&mdash;near Charles' feet. He raised his head.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said.</p>

<p>Kinch, who had been jotting down pencillings in his notebook,
got up.</p>

<p>"That doesn't help us very much. Come along, Doctor. I'll run
you back. I'll be out again about eight o'clock," he went on to Sir
Harry. "We shall have to find out all about this poor chap,
Hurst."</p>

<p>"There I fear I can be of no use," said the Baronet. "I know
very little about him&mdash;now," he added, "we'd all better get a
little sleep, what? There's nothing to be done for the moment."</p>

<p>They all went into the hall, the Superintendent going out of the
house with the police surgeon. Bristow was standing by the front
door as they left. Just for a moment Kinch stopped and turned, and
the two men found themselves looking at one another. A faint,
enigmatical smile broke over the Superintendent's pleasant
face.</p>

<p>"We shall meet again in a few hours," he said, as he went out.
Sir Harry closed and locked the door, and then, with the others,
crept up to bed again very quietly. Apparently no other members of
the household or any of the guests had been disturbed. On a sofa in
the gun-room lay the corpse of Jasper Hurst. Frimley Manor was
enshrouded in stillness once more&mdash;the only sound in the
neighbourhood being the "chug-chug" of the Superintendent's car.
Detective-Sergeant Mentmore was conversing, in whispers, with
Constable Jarvis, just outside the marquee.</p>

<p>The moonlight was a little brighter now, the clouds having
partially cleared. The moon itself, too, had risen higher in the
heavens.</p>

<p>"What's that?" suddenly exclaimed Jarvis, raising his voice
slightly.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I thought I saw a window on the side of the house there flash
in the moonlight as if it moved."</p>

<p>"Let's go and see," said the Detective-Sergeant.</p>

<p>They crossed the lawn and made for the side of the house. The
stone terrace continued round the side, and facing it were four
French windows, two belonging to the dining-room and two to the
library&mdash;windows which opened outwards. Jarvis produced his
lantern, and the two policemen tested each window. They were all
fastened on the inside, and heavy curtains were drawn across them,
screening the two rooms.</p>

<p>"Must have been your fancy," grunted Mentmore.</p>

<h2>Chapter 3</h2>

<p>Superintendent Kinch sat in the library at Frimley Manor, that
room having been placed at his disposal for the time being, his
open notebook on the table in front of him. He glanced at the clock
on the mantelpiece&mdash;twenty minutes past eight. Then he lighted
a cigarette and leaned back in his chair, mentally reviewing the
events of the night.</p>

<p>He had only snatched two or three hours' rest after his return
to Chiltonbury, in the very early hours of that morning, for there
had been much to be done of that meticulous routine work which is
so little known to the general public and bears such a minute part
in modern detective fiction.</p>

<p>In the first place, he had devoted no little time to the
question of that derelict car that had been found in the ditch a
little way out of the village of Drifford. He had begun, when he
first received the message about it at Frimley Manor, to attach
great importance to the finding of this car. Naturally, for, at
first sight, everything seemed to fit in so exactly. The car had
been found about twenty-three miles from the scene of the tragedy,
just about the distance that a good driver would have reached,
having, as Captain Bristow had pointed out, a practically totally
clear road in that hour of the night. Moreover, it was the London
road, the very route that nine out of ten escaping criminals were
most likely to take. Again, in answer to further enquiries, he had
ascertained that no one had turned up either at hotel or garage in
the neighbourhood of Drifford, with the story of a breakdown of his
or her car, as would have happened to the ordinary, innocent
driver. This car was absolutely abandoned, as it was likely to be
by a fugitive escaping from justice. Furthermore, the car was of
the same make as that which was missing from the Vicar's
garage.</p>

<p>And then, there was the removal of the number-plates, which was
very significant. It was not only significant, however. There was a
snag in it, raising a doubt. Bristow had seen this. If the driver
knew that the number had been taken before he had time to get out
of the range of light of that torch, why did he waste even the few
precious minutes it would have taken him to unscrew the fastening
nuts with a spanner and remove the plates? There was only one
answer to this question, and that was that the criminals, whoever
they were, had bungled, as criminals always do bungle.</p>

<p>So he was taking no risks. His men, and men of adjoining
counties, were still on the look-out for a four-seater car numbered
QV 5277, color dark blue, left rear mudguard bent and dented, paint
very much scrubbed on the bonnet (the astute Jarvis had obtained
these details from the owner); they were also on the look-out for
two unknown men who were wanted for the crime of murder. Moreover,
assuming that the car might be abandoned in the neighbourhood, and
that its inmates might possibly be planning to make off by train,
he had issued instructions for a number of railway stations to be
watched, from such time as the first trains of the day began to
run.</p>

<p>As to the derelict car at Drifford, even if it was not the one
he wanted&mdash;and very soon he would satisfy himself on that
score&mdash;it was not negligible. A car the registration number of
which has been removed cannot be negligible in the eyes of the
police. True, it was quite possible that it had nothing to do with
this particular case at all, but no good Superintendent of Police
centers so much on one particular case that he neglects others.
There was something wrong about that car, anyhow.</p>

<p>Just before he left Chiltonbury a message, in reply to his
instructions, had come through from Drifford that the car had been
got out of the ditch, that though the engine was hopelessly out of
gear the wheels and steering-gear were intact, and he had given
orders to have it towed direct to Frimley, so that he might
confront the Vicar with it without bothering that worthy cleric to
make a journey. Besides, it was probably as quick a method as any
other. And the car might arrive at any moment now.</p>

<p>Early as it was, he had already interviewed, briefly, one member
of the household whom he had not seen on his previous visit, and
that was Anstice Lynwood. Anstice was fond of a canter before
breakfast, and, in spite of the fatigues of the day before, had
come down a little after half-past seven. It was Hudson, who was,
in his way, as much a friend of the family as a butler, who had
told her of the tragedy, but then he knew "Miss Anstice" well, and
was quite aware that beneath the vagaries of buoyant youthfulness,
hers was one of those strong characters which can face an emergency
calmly.</p>

<p>Superintendent Kinch, now wearing his uniform, had come just as
Hudson had finished his gruesome story, and the girl had turned to
him, a little pale, it is true, but otherwise quite collected.</p>

<p>"Hudson has just told me," she said. "But this is too terrible.
Is there anything I can do?"</p>

<p>And Kinch, a quiet, but keen, observer of human nature, had
summed her up quickly. He liked those steady grey eyes of
hers&mdash;and the firm little mouth. And he made an ally of her at
once.</p>

<p>"You can help me considerably, Miss Lynwood," he said. "Captain
Bristow tells me that you have a list of all your hired costumes,
and of the properties in the tent. I want you to check this list
very carefully and, if you find anything&mdash;no matter how
insignificant&mdash;in that marquee which is not on your list, I
want you to keep it back for me. Can you do this?"</p>

<p>"I'll do my best&mdash;of course I will. I'll go over to the
tent at once and overhaul all I can before breakfast."</p>

<p>"Plenty of time," said Kinch, with a smile. "Here&mdash;one
minute, Miss Lynwood," and he tore a sheet from his pocketbook and
scribbled something on it. "Give that to Jarvis&mdash;he's outside,
by the tent&mdash;and then he'll let you go in."</p>

<p>She smiled back in return.</p>

<p>"We are all under orders, I see!"</p>

<p>"For the present, yes. But you mustn't mind that, Miss
Lynwood."</p>

<p>And now he was sitting in the library, quietly smoking a
cigarette, but knowing that the work of a very busy day was
beginning. And he was planning it out.</p>

<p>The door opened, and in came Charles Lynwood.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;they told me you were here, Superintendent. Look here,
it's coming it rather strong that we're being treated as suspects
or prisoners."</p>

<p>The Superintendent arched his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Yes?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I was simply going to our garage to tell our man to get out the
two-seater, when that fellow of yours outside asked me where I was
going, and said you'd given orders that none of us were to leave
our own house till you'd seen us."</p>

<p>"Quite so," replied Kinch, urbanely. "I'm very sorry, Mr.
Lynwood, but in a case like this I have to take ordinary
precautions. It isn't a matter of suspicion, only I must interview
everyone. It is only usual."</p>

<p>"Well, you've interviewed me already," replied Charlie. "Is
there any reason why you want me any longer?"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked the Superintendent.</p>

<p>"Because, as it happens, I want to catch the eight-forty-five
train at Chiltonbury. I have an engagement in London."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the Superintendent, drumming on the table with his
finger-tips. "I see. Are you returning tonight?"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"Because I'm fixing the inquest for tomorrow. And it is very
necessary that you should be there."</p>

<p>Charlie thought for a moment or two. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Are you going to have all the people staying in this house at
that inquest? Because, if you are&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, sir. But I shall want Sir Harry and you and the
Vicar and Captain Bristow, at all events. I can't tell about all
the others till I've seen them, but, as far as I know, with the
exception of your brother, they knew nothing of what was taking
place."</p>

<p>"Because," went on Charlie, still in rather a bullying tone,
"most of our guests had arranged to leave today."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Kinch, quietly. "I don't suppose I shall find
any reason to prevent them from doing so. But I must see them
first."</p>

<p>"Well," said the young man, glancing at his wrist-watch, and
speaking sarcastically, "have I your permission to catch that
train?"</p>

<p>"Let's see&mdash;you've told me all you know, I think?"</p>

<p>"Of course I've told you all I know."</p>

<p>"Quite so. Very well, then. Your chauffeur is driving you in, I
suppose?" and he, also, glanced at the time. "You'll do it quite
easily, sir. But don't forget the inquest, please&mdash;tomorrow
afternoon at two."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll be there," and he went out of the room.</p>

<p>The Superintendent sat quite still for a moment or two, a little
smile playing around his lips.</p>

<p>"Not much use asking him any more questions while he's in that
mood," he said to himself. "Daresay there's nothing in it, but I'm
taking no chances."</p>

<p>And he went into the hall and rang up the police-station.
"Hullo&mdash;yes&mdash;Superintendent Kinch speaking." He lowered
his voice, looking swiftly around the empty hall, and said, "Is
Stevens there?...Yes, tell him I want to speak to him...Ah,
Stevens, are you in plain clothes?...Good. You know young Mr.
Charles Lynwood by sight? Very well. He's going up to London by the
8:45&mdash;now. I want you to go too, and shadow him. He'll
probably come back tonight. If not, I'll leave it to you to get
further help up there. Right!"</p>

<p>As he replaced the receiver, Captain Bristow, dressed in a brown
plus-four suit, came down the stairs and said good morning. At the
same moment came a ring at the front door.</p>

<p>"They'll be coming along to breakfast now," lie said, jerking
his head towards the stairs. "You'll let them have that first, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>James, the footman, had crossed the hall and opened the door. In
came the Vicar, and went straight up to Kinch.</p>

<p>"Oh," he exclaimed, "I thought I might find you here instead of
going into Chiltonbury. And, naturally, I didn't want to use the
telephone. Jarvis is outside, and I was so relieved to hear from
him that you were here, though I've come on a very painful errand.
Ah&mdash;good morning, Captain Bristow. What a terrible affair!
Now," and he turned once more to the other, "I want to have a word
or two with you. A terrible affair&mdash;a terrific affair!"</p>

<p>"It is, indeed, sir. And it must be distressful to you to have
your car mixed up in it. I hope we shall find it for
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't that, it isn't that!" broke in the Vicar, and his
voice trembled. "It is something else that worries me exceedingly.
Something you ought to know..."</p>

<p>"Come into the library, won't you, Vicar?" asked the
Superintendent, soothingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the Vicar. "Bristow, I wish you'd come
too,&mdash;as a friend I know I can trust."</p>

<p>Bristow arched his eyebrows enquiringly at the Superintendent.
The latter nodded assent. The three men retired to the library.</p>

<p>The Vicar seated himself in a chair, drew his handkerchief from
his pocket, and passed it over his face. He was making an effort to
control himself. The Superintendent waited patiently for a few
moments; then the Vicar began:</p>

<p>"You see, it was only half-an-hour ago that I
realised...that...it's a very painful matter, but I felt it was my
duty to see you at once." Kinch's interest was awakened. A sudden
thought struck him. The Vicar had, perhaps, seen something when he
went out in the night. "May I ask you one or two questions first?"
he suggested. "I was going to do so later on. I understand you left
the house just about half-past one, with Mr. Charles Lynwood and
Hurst."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the Vicar.</p>

<p>"And you went out by the side gate?"</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;did you see anyone?&mdash;did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It isn't that at all," broke in the Vicar. "Perhaps it will be
best for me to tell my story in my own way,"&mdash;he had begun to
recover himself&mdash;"it is more difficult than I can say to have
to do so at all, and I sincerely trust my fears are groundless. I
assure you the dictates of conscience are hard to obey, but I know
it is my duty to put you in possession of certain facts."</p>

<p>Kinch nodded, silently. The Vicar went on:</p>

<p>"You will understand, Superintendent, that I was absent from my
Vicarage from a little before two o'clock yesterday until I
returned very early this morning&mdash;quite twelve hours in all. I
took part in the afternoon and evening performances of the pageant,
and stayed here to dinner afterwards. I met no one on my way home,
and when I reached the Vicarage, of course my domestics&mdash;a
housekeeper and a maid&mdash;had gone to bed.</p>

<p>"I let myself in very quietly and went straight up to my room.
As a matter of fact, I don't think I went to sleep. Anyhow, I was
awake when I heard steps outside&mdash;I always have my window
open&mdash;and I got out of bed and looked out. It was your man,
Jarvis. I recognised him in his uniform in the half-moonlight. He
said he wanted to see me, so I slipped on some clothes and went
down. Then he told me about the murder and my car, and we went to
the garage&mdash;which was empty.</p>

<p>"What I want you to see is that neither my housekeeper nor my
maid were aroused, and it wasn't until I came down this morning
that I saw either of them. I felt it was no use disturbing them
about the car in the middle of the night. So it was only just now
that my housekeeper told me what&mdash;well&mdash;what I'm afraid
you ought to know."</p>

<p>"Yes?" asked the Superintendent.</p>

<p>"It is not a matter that I care to talk about&mdash;even to my
intimate friends. But I have a relative, Superintendent,&mdash;a
nephew,&mdash;who has caused me much anxiety and, I may say, no
little expense. He is my sister's son. His father died when he was
quite young, and my sister also died a few years ago. I am his
nearest relative, and&mdash;er&mdash;well, being an orphan, how
could I refuse to acknowledge him?"</p>

<p>"If I may suggest it&mdash;a ne'er-do-well?" asked the
Superintendent. The Vicar shook his head, sadly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's a true description," he replied. "Over and over
again he has promised&mdash;well, a good many things. And over and
over again I have set him on his feet. But&mdash;bad companions and
a weak nature...well, to make a long story short, my housekeeper
told me just now that he called at the Vicarage soon after eight
last evening&mdash;and asked for me. I may say I haven't seen him
for many months. In fact, I had to tell him plainly I would not
receive him again till he showed palpable signs of amendment."</p>

<p>"Did your housekeeper know this?" asked Kinch.</p>

<p>"No. I don't discuss my private affairs with her. But she knew
him, of course. She told him where I was, and that I should be home
after the pageant was over. She did not know I was remaining here
to dinner."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"He said he would wait. She served him with a meal, and after
that he appears to have sat in my study, smoking. About ten o'clock
she went in to him and asked if she had not better prepare a room
for him. He replied that he could not stay the night, but that she
could go to bed if she wanted to."</p>

<p>"And did she?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And now comes the painful part of my story. Her room
overlooks the yard into which the garage opens. I don't keep the
door of the garage locked. She says it may have been about
half-past ten, or perhaps nearer eleven, when she heard the front
door bang. In a minute or two there were steps in the yard. She
looked out. He was there. He opened the garage door, went in,
started the car, and drove it out."</p>

<p>"And she said nothing?"</p>

<p>"It never occurred to her that anything was wrong. When he had
stayed with me before he had several times taken the car out for a
run. And she thought that, tired of waiting, he was coming here to
find me."</p>

<p>Superintendent Kinch looked grave.</p>

<p>"Your nephew left no message&mdash;in writing or otherwise?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"None whatever."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea why he came to see you last night?" The Vicar
shook his head.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid," he answered, "from past experience that there
could be only one reason. He probably
came&mdash;well&mdash;er&mdash;to ask me for money."</p>

<p>"I see. Now, tell me, Mr. Ashley-Smith. Let us, for the moment,
assume that he came for this purpose. Have you any idea where he
would come from&mdash;where his home is?"</p>

<p>"I fear I can't tell you."</p>

<p>"When did you see him last?"</p>

<p>"Before Christmas&mdash;yes&mdash;it was about the beginning of
December."</p>

<p>"He came here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It was then that I told him I could help him no further,
unless he gave me proof of having turned over a new leaf. Since
then I have heard nothing of him."</p>

<p>"Did he know anyone in the neighbourhood&mdash;Hurst, for
example?" asked the Superintendent.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. He occasionally stayed with me for a few
days, but, except casually meeting any friends in my house, he knew
no one. As for poor Hurst&mdash;certainly not. Hurst has only been
living at The Gables for a couple of months or so."</p>

<p>Superintendent Kinch reflected for a few moments, and then said
very sympathetically:</p>

<p>"I quite understand how painful it is for you to come and tell
me this, Mr. Ashley-Smith, and I am grateful for the fine sense of
duty which prompted you. You must realise that it is very
serious?"</p>

<p>"I do, indeed."</p>

<p>"And I'm sure you will understand," Kinch went on, "that
<i>I</i> have a duty to perform. I am making no
accusation&mdash;there are not sufficient facts to go upon. But it
is of paramount importance that we should find your nephew as
quickly as possible."</p>

<p>"I realise that, Superintendent. But, as I have told you, I have
no idea where to look for him."</p>

<p>"For your sake I should be glad of that, I suppose," said Kinch,
"for it releases you from an exceedingly unpleasant situation. All
the same, I must ask you for some further information."</p>

<p>And he took up notebook and pencil.</p>

<p>"Your nephew's name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Curtis&mdash;Leonard Ashley Curtis. Ashley is a family name,"
he explained, "but he does not hyphenate it as I do. In his case it
is baptismal."</p>

<p>"I see. His age?"</p>

<p>"Twenty-nine."</p>

<p>"His description?"</p>

<p>With the help of a few leading questions Kinch was able to get a
fairly adequate description. Then he said:</p>

<p>"You mentioned, sir, that he had fallen in with bad companions."
The Vicar nodded.</p>

<p>"You don't happen to know who any of them are?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Or any of his friends?"</p>

<p>The Vicar thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"I did hear him mention, sometimes, the name of some man who, he
said, was a chum of his."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Let me see&mdash;yes&mdash;'Bob' he generally called
him&mdash;Bob Gilbert&mdash;that was it."</p>

<p>"Mention him in any connection?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;er&mdash;I think he did, once. Yes. He said they
were members of the same club."</p>

<p>"Oh, come!" said the Superintendent, "that's something to go
upon. A London club?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Which?"</p>

<p>The Vicar shook his head and smiled, wanly.</p>

<p>"Not the sort of club I should approve of. A night-club. But he
did not tell me the name of it."</p>

<p>"I see...Well, sir, I don't think I want to ask you any more, at
present."</p>

<p>"You'll&mdash;you'll let me know&mdash;?" began the Vicar, "I
shall, naturally, be anxious, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll let you know, sir, if we find out anything about your
nephew&mdash;that is, as far as I can. We can't always, in the
interests of justice, you see, tell even our friends all we know
about a case. Thank you very much for coming to see me at once,
sir."</p>

<p>Captain Bristow, who had lighted a cigarette, had been a silent
listener as the Vicar told his story. A frown had gathered on his
face and he appeared to be lost in thought. The Vicar was just
about to get up to go when Bristow turned to him.</p>

<p>"I'm heartily sorry for you, Vicar," he said; "it's a beastly
worry for you&mdash;first you lose your car, and then this nephew
of yours crops up in connection with it. Used to take it out when
he stayed with you sometimes, you told us. With your permission, of
course?"</p>

<p>The Superintendent had leaned back in his chair, and was
watching</p>

<p>Bristow intently, his eyes half-closed&mdash;but alert, all the
same. The Vicar smiled.</p>

<p>"You don't know my nephew, Bristow," he said, "or you wouldn't
have asked that question. He took my car when he thought he would:
and as for asking my permission&mdash;well, the younger generation
of today," he went on, in true parsonic style, and, therefore,
sententiously, "the younger generation appear to me to have lost
their good manners with their lack of respect for their elders.
They only think of themselves."</p>

<p>"Precious careless sort of chap, eh?" put in Bristow, the
Superintendent still watching him narrowly.</p>

<p>"Absolutely. On the last occasion he was here I wanted my car to
run into Chiltonbury&mdash;but it was not in the garage. I had to
go in by 'bus, and the first thing I saw there&mdash;in the market
square&mdash;quite unattended, was my Morris Oxford. He had run in
to see the pictures&mdash;But he didn't come out in the car," he
added, grimly. "I saw to that!"</p>

<p>Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"What did he say for himself afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Laughed at me to my face and told me no one would ever think of
stealing a five-year old Morris. My car may be a trifle aged as the
lives of cars go," the Vicar went on, a humorous twinkle in his eye
now, "but the care of the aged is a Christian duty, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!" ejaculated the Superintendent, for there was a tap at the
door. "Yes? Come in."</p>

<p>Jarvis entered.</p>

<p>"They've just brought that car from Drifford, sir," he
announced. "Towed it. It's in the stable-yard."</p>

<p>"Oh, come along then," said the Superintendent. "Shan't keep you
a minute, sir," he explained to the Vicar, "but this is a car which
was found abandoned about an hour after the murder had taken place,
and I want you to tell me if it is yours."</p>

<p>In the stable-yard stood a blue Morris Oxford, open two-seater,
the radiator and bonnet crumpled up, the wind-screen smashed to
splinters, one of the wings wrenched off, and otherwise damaged.
But, directly he saw it, the Vicar exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, no. That's not mine&mdash;that's one of the later
models."</p>

<p>The policeman from Drifford, who had been steering the car as it
was towed, came up. The Superintendent asked him:</p>

<p>"Found the missing registration-plate?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. They are searching still."</p>

<p>"Umph! No matter. We'll have the number of the engine." The
Drifford policeman went on:</p>

<p>"I didn't think you'd find this was the car you were after, sir.
When we looked into her a little more closely, we found she
couldn't have been going from Chiltonbury to London. You see, sir,"
he went on, "she must have skidded to begin with; then she struck a
telegraph-post on the side of the road, and went off into the
ditch. But the way she struck that post showed she was coming from
London."</p>

<p>Captain Bristow, who had been silently regarding the car, turned
to the policeman.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he said. "You found this car near Drifford, didn't
you? Small village, isn't it? I seem to remember seeing it stuck up
at a station."</p>

<p>"That's right, sir. Drifford is on the main line. The car was
found about a mile out of the village."</p>

<p>Captain Bristow went on:</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, "you haven't any idea as to the time when
the smash took place, have you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir,&mdash;not the exact time. But, anyhow, it must have
been after half-past eleven. I know that, because I was along the
road myself at that time&mdash;I had a point at Farley Crossroads,"
he went on, addressing the Superintendent, "and I know the car was
not in the ditch then."</p>

<p>The Superintendent nodded. But he was not looking at his
subordinate. Once again his eyes were directed towards Bristow, a
slightly expectant expression in them. But if he expected Bristow
to make any further remarks, he was disappointed. Bristow merely
frowned, and shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>

<p>"Better tow the car into Chiltonbury," said the Superintendent,
to his man. "We'll have to make enquiries, of course. But it
doesn't seem to have anything to do with the matter here.
Well&mdash;good morning, sir," he added, to the Vicar; "as soon as
we get a line on your Morris, I'll let you know."</p>

<p>The Vicar went out by the gate beyond the stable-yard, Kinch
retraced his steps towards the house, Bristow walking with him. And
the Superintendent said:</p>

<p>"I'm glad of the opportunity of a word or two with you,
sir,"&mdash;Bristow glanced at him quickly, but if he thought this
genial policeman was going to share any confidence with him, he was
mistaken. "There's a lot to be done, you see, and you might help
me, if you would. I'd like to see all the people who were in the
house last night&mdash;directly breakfast is over. Perhaps you'll
be good enough to let me leave out that list?"&mdash;Bristow
nodded. "I'm having the body taken to The Gables directly&mdash;the
Coroner has ordered an autopsy, and the doctor will run out there
for it. And, besides, it isn't fair on Sir Harry to keep the corpse
in his house any longer. My sergeant&mdash;Mentmore&mdash;is at The
Gables, getting information about Hurst, and I hope to have him
back with his report soon&mdash;then we may have something more to
go upon. I shall run round there myself as soon as I can, but after
I've interviewed the people here I want to look over the list of
costumes in the tent&mdash;Miss Lynwood has already promised to see
to that. Then, of course, there are the arrangements for the
inquest. I rang up the Coroner before I came out. He's fixed
tomorrow afternoon. I thought of asking Sir Harry if it might take
place here. Mr. Charles Lynwood," he broke off abruptly, "has gone
to London for the day."</p>

<p>"Gone to London?"</p>

<p>There was a note of genuine surprise in Bristow's voice.
"Yes."</p>

<p>And Kinch looked sharply at his companion. But he only got a
monosyllable to crown his own.</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>They reached the house and Bristow opened the door. In the hall
were Sir Harry and his eldest son, Sonia Fullinger, two other
guests, Mrs. Cresswell's maid, and Mrs. Cresswell herself. In fact,
they were all standing round Mrs. Cresswell&mdash;a very excited
Mrs. Cresswell she was, too. There was a babel of confusion. Then
Mrs. Cresswell caught sight of the uniformed Police Superintendent
coming into the hall, broke away from the little group, rushed
excitedly towards him, and cried:</p>

<p>"The police! Oh, I'm so glad you've come, Sergeant&mdash;or
whatever you are! Did you know? Have you found them?"</p>

<p>"Found what, madam?" asked the somewhat bewildered Kinch.</p>

<p>"My pearls," almost shrieked Mrs. Cresswell, "my pearl necklace!
It's gone. It's been stolen! I thought you'd come to tell me you'd
got the thief. What are you going to do about it? I tell you,
they're frightfully valuable. You <i>must</i> get them back for me.
Haven't you a clue, or something? Oh, why don't you say
something?"</p>

<p>"My dear madam," replied Kinch, very suavely and soothingly, "I
assure you this is all news to me. I know nothing about your
pearls."</p>

<p>"Then why are you here? I thought&mdash;Oh,
<i>surely</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Suppose you tell me all about it?" he went on, in his calmest
manner. "Anyhow, I <i>am</i> here, you see, madam, and if you will
just let me know what has happened it's my business to help you.
Shall we go&mdash;?" and he looked at Sir Harry.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sir Harry. "Come along, Mrs. Cresswell&mdash;into
the library. And then you can tell the Superintendent all about
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling pearls!" she went on, as she followed Sir Harry.
"I wouldn't have had this happen for the world. There's a thief in
your house, Sir Harry. Everyone must be searched, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice died away as the much harassed Baronet led her out of
the hall, followed by the Superintendent.</p>

<p>Harry Lynwood turned to Bristow.</p>

<p>"By Jove, Roger! <i>More</i> complications, eh?"</p>

<p>"Possibly simplifications," replied Bristow, dryly. "I've been
wondering all along where the motive was. This may be it."</p>

<h2>Chapter 4</h2>

<p>"Now," said Kinch, when he had succeeded in reducing Mrs.
Cresswell to a state of comparative calmness, "you just try to tell
me exactly what has happened. I'll ask any questions
afterwards."</p>

<p>"When I had finished dressing this morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," interrupted the Superintendent, gently. "Better begin
before that. When you were last wearing your necklace, let us
say."</p>

<p>"I was wearing it yesterday. I was playing the part of Queen
Anne in the pageant, you see"&mdash;even in the midst of her
calamity her inherent vanity asserted itself&mdash;"I wore the
pearls at both performances. After the pageant was over none of us
changed for dinner. I was still wearing them then, and, of course,
I had them on when I went up to my room."</p>

<p>"Just a moment," said Kinch. "What time was that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, rather late. Did you notice, Sir Harry?"</p>

<p>"Just after eleven, I think it was," said the Baronet.</p>

<p>Kinch nodded.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said.</p>

<p>"I put the pearls in their case when I took them off. It was the
first thing I did when I got into my room. I'm always <i>most</i>
particular. Then I locked them up safely in my small leather
dressing-case. I know they were there when I went to bed. And no
one else knew&mdash;not even my maid. I had put them away before I
rang for her. I always do. Well, that's all that happened last
night, and then, this morning&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," Kinch broke in, "you didn't leave your room after
you had locked up the necklace&mdash;I mean last night?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I did&mdash;but only for a minute. I recollected I
wanted to ask Miss Fullinger something&mdash;she was to drive me to
London this morning, you see. So I went out to the corridor and
tapped at her door. But she didn't answer. I suppose she was
asleep."</p>

<p>"She must have undressed very quickly, Mrs. Cresswell?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not necessarily. She went up early, didn't she, Sir
Harry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite," said Sir Harry. "She was tired and had a slight
headache. Also I remember she said something about getting her maid
to help her pack some of her things last night, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she did," said Mrs. Cresswell.</p>

<p>"Then you were actually out of your room for a short time?"
asked the Superintendent.</p>

<p>"Only a few moments. Besides, I should have noticed anyone going
into my room from the corridor. And&mdash;oh, yes&mdash;the
necklace was there when I got back."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I opened the dressing-case again, to put a bracelet in, I'm
quite sure. Well, as I was saying, when I had finished dressing
this morning I wanted something out of the case, and unlocked it.
Then I missed the pearls. They were gone. I looked everywhere.
Oh&mdash;you <i>will</i> get them back for me, <i>won't</i>
you?"</p>

<p>"You may be sure we shall do our best," replied Kinch,
soothingly. "And now, let me ask you a few questions. You say you
were wearing your pearls all yesterday afternoon and evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"So everybody had an opportunity of seeing them?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course. Quite a lot of people told me how much they
admired them."</p>

<p>Kinch smiled, and went on:</p>

<p>"What sort of a case did you keep them in?"</p>

<p>"Oh, an ordinary jewel-case, you know. Oval in shape; flat.
Dark-red leather outside."</p>

<p>"Was it locked?"</p>

<p>"It <i>has</i> a lock. But I mislaid the key some time ago. No,
it wasn't locked."</p>

<p>"But the dressing-case was?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I told you I locked it."</p>

<p>"And the key?"</p>

<p>"It was one of a bunch."</p>

<p>"I see. And where did you put that bunch after you had locked
the dressing-case?"</p>

<p>"In the left-hand little drawer of the chest of drawers,"
replied Mrs. Cresswell promptly.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Superintendent, noting her quick answer. "Does
that mean you are in the habit of keeping your keys there?"</p>

<p>"I am very methodical. Yes; when I am not carrying my keys about
with me, I always keep them in the left-hand drawer."</p>

<p>"Not always a good thing to be methodical, where valuables are
concerned," commented the Superintendent. "Other people get to know
one's habits, you see. But, tell me, were the keys still there this
morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Exactly where you had put them?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;certainly."</p>

<p>"These dressing-cases frequently have duplicate keys,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know what you are thinking of. Yes, there <i>are</i> two
keys. But, as it happens, both of them are on the ring&mdash;of the
bunch."</p>

<p>"Have you that bunch?"</p>

<p>"I left it upstairs&mdash;in my room."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll have a look at it presently. Now, you say your
<i>maid</i> did not see you put the pearls away. Tell me about her,
Mrs. Cresswell."</p>

<p>"She is quite out of the question, if you imagine she had
anything to do with it. Your suspicion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear madam," interrupted Kinch, "I don't ask you from that
point of view. I am hazarding no theories at present. But I
must&mdash;if only for her sake&mdash;have some information about
her."</p>

<p>"Well, Ellen Crane has been in my service for seven years or
more. She is thoroughly trustworthy. If she had ever wanted to
steal those pearls, she has had scores of opportunities."</p>

<p>Kinch nodded&mdash;and asked no further questions about her. He
turned to Sir Harry.</p>

<p>"There was no one in the house&mdash;no outsiders, I
mean,&mdash;after dinner last evening, except the Vicar and Hurst,
I understand, Sir Harry?" he asked.</p>

<p>The Baronet shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," he said. Then he added, as if it had
suddenly occurred to him, "You haven't forgotten that my son forgot
to lock the door when he came in from the marquee,
Superintendent?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Kinch, thoughtfully. "I understand what you mean.
I'd already made a note of it." He turned once more to Mrs.
Cresswell. "There was a guest at dinner here last night," he said,
"a Mr. Hurst. Did you notice him at all?"</p>

<p>"In Puritan dress," explained Sir Harry, remarking the puzzled
expression on Mrs. Cresswell's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I remember him. But I don't think I spoke to
him."</p>

<p>"I think I ought to tell you," went on Kinch, gravely, still
speaking to Mrs. Cresswell, "that a more serious thing has happened
than even the theft of your pearls. That is really why I am here.
This Mr. Hurst was found dead near the house, very early this
morning, and everything points to the face that he was
murdered."</p>

<p>The Superintendent made the announcement very quietly. Nor did
he expect that the grim news would upset Mrs. Cresswell nearly as
much as the loss of her necklace. He had summed her up carefully,
and felt it was only the sense of what was really personal that
affected her strongly. Nor was he mistaken. She gave a little
shudder of horror&mdash;but remained quite calm.</p>

<p>"How perfectly terrible!" she exclaimed, turning to Sir Harry,
who nodded, silently. The Superintendent went on, still very
quietly:</p>

<p>"I am, naturally, inclined to connect both crimes, Mrs.
Cresswell, and not to treat them as coincidences&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Cresswell interrupted him.</p>

<p>"You think, then, this Mr. Hurst had something to do with my
necklace&mdash;that it was he who took it, perhaps? And that they
murdered him because&mdash;Yes, I see! The murderer has got my
pearls. Oh, you <i>must</i> catch him&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kinch smiled, in spite of himself. It was plain that the murder
of Jasper Hurst was quite a minor point in comparison with the
pearls&mdash;so far as Mrs. Cresswell was concerned. He held up his
hand.</p>

<p>"I have to look at the case from every point of view before I
can theorise," he said. "But I agree with you that we must, if
possible, trace the person or persons who committed both crimes.
That is only our duty. And that we shall probably find that both
crimes are closely connected. And now," he went on, "I'd like to
have a look at your room, please, Mrs. Cresswell&mdash;before any
of the maids begin to tidy it. Will you come, too, Sir Harry,
please?"</p>

<p>As they were going, the Superintendent asked Sir Harry:</p>

<p>"By the way, Sir Harry, when Hurst was in your house last night,
did he, by any chance, go upstairs?"</p>

<p>"Not after Mrs. Cresswell went to bed&mdash;if that is what you
mean. He did go up before dinner, with some of the other men, to
the bathroom."</p>

<p>"Not afterwards?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, Captain Bristow and your two sons will be able to
tell us if he did. I'll ask them...Is this the room? One moment,
please; I'd like to go in first, if I may."</p>

<p>Kinch produced no magnifying-glass or measuring tape, after the
manner of the approved detective of fiction, when he went into Mrs.
Cresswell's room. He was pretty observant, all the same. He looked
well at the carpet, but if he thought he might find traces of dusty
footprints there, he was mistaken. The room was in the front of the
house, and had two windows. He looked out. The wall outside was
quite bare, no creeper of any kind. The cleverest cat-burglar could
hardly have scaled it. He gazed upwards. There was no storey
above&mdash;no windows&mdash;and the roof projected with
sharply-sloping eaves. It was quite unlikely that anyone had
reached the window from above.</p>

<p>Obviously, then, if Mrs. Cresswell had given a correct
description of matters, the thief must have come in by the door.
Kinch went back to the door, and closed it&mdash;by the handle. The
key was on the inside. Lying on the floor by the door was a tiny,
shining shred of something. Kinch picked it up and examined it. It
appeared to be a minute bit of gold braid&mdash;torn. He dropped it
into an envelope and put the envelope back in his pocket. He turned
to the door again, and examined the handle plate, carefully. Then
he opened the door again and invited Mrs. Cresswell and Sir Harry
to come in.</p>

<p>"Show me exactly where you kept your keys, will you, please,
Mrs. Cresswell?"</p>

<p>"In here." She opened the left-hand top drawer of a chest of
drawers standing near the window; "in this corner&mdash;underneath
my spare handkerchiefs."</p>

<p>"Where were they before you came to bed? Did you carry them
about with you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I'd left nothing of value in my dressing-case. They
were here&mdash;from the time I dressed for the pageant till I came
up after dinner."</p>

<p>"So that anyone could have got at them all the time?"</p>

<p>"I suppose they could. But I don't see why&mdash;if anyone did.
My pearls were not stolen then, you know."</p>

<p>"Quite so; but a first-hand knowledge of the scene of an
intended crime beforehand is a very useful thing, Mrs.
Cresswell."</p>

<p>"I daresay it is. But how could it have helped in this case? No
one <i>knew</i> that I was going to lock up the pearls in that
dressing-case."</p>

<p>And she pointed to the case itself, which stood open on a chair
not very far from the door, the bunch of keys hanging from the
lock. The Superintendent glanced at it&mdash;at the chest of
drawers&mdash;and back at the door.</p>

<p>"If you make a habit of locking up the necklace when you are
staying away from home&mdash;as you do?"&mdash;she
nodded;&mdash;"well, you know, habits become known. It was probably
known you were bringing the necklace here, for my impression is
that this is a carefully thought-out job&mdash;as regards your
habits&mdash;and then a clever taking advantage of the opportunity.
You see," he went on, "to anyone who <i>knew</i>, it would hardly
take a minute to come into the room&mdash;step across to the chest
of drawers&mdash;get the bunch of keys&mdash;open the case and take
out the pearls&mdash;put the keys back&mdash;and, well, there you
are! Quite simple to anyone who knew the ropes beforehand. By the
way, you didn't lock your door, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No. I never do that."</p>

<p>"Quite so. And&mdash;when you were asleep, were those windows
draped?"</p>

<p>"Not both. I drew up the blind and opened this one," she pointed
it out, "before I got into bed."</p>

<p>"Ah! Plenty of light&mdash;it was dim moonlight outside. You
sleep soundly?"</p>

<p>"Very&mdash;as a rule."</p>

<p>"Probably they knew <i>that</i>, too," said Kinch, with a grim
little smile. "And now let's have a look at those keys."</p>

<p>"Finger-prints, what?" said Sir Harry, who was a very interested
spectator.</p>

<p>Kinch shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not very much chance of that with keys, Sir Harry," he replied.
"No&mdash;I want to make sure of something else."</p>

<p>He took the key from the lock of the dressing-case and, keeping
it separate, spread out the rest of the keys which were on the ring
fan-wise on the palm of his hand. There were about a dozen of them,
of various sizes. He examined each one of them narrowly, and a
little smile broke out on his face. Then he said to Mrs.
Cresswell:</p>

<p>"You told me there were duplicate keys of this
dressing-case?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;there are."</p>

<p>"And that both were on this ring?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course."</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"There's only one of them here now, at any rate," he said. "My
God!" ejaculated Sir Harry. "That's queer!"</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think so?" replied the Superintendent, dryly. "Well,
it doesn't exactly surprise me. This affair has got some clever
brains behind it, and was carefully planned. You see, it would be
much easier to have the key in one's possession beforehand. The
thief knew he had to come into this room and do the job while Mrs.
Cresswell was here. It was a risk anyhow, and a greater risk still
to open that drawer and get the keys first. But, by securing the
duplicate key beforehand, he not only took the minimum of risk, but
he saved more than half the time in doing it. Now, Mrs. Cresswell,
do you think you can tell me with certainty the last occasion when
you <i>knew</i> both keys were on the bunch?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can," she replied. "I've just remembered. It was
yesterday afternoon&mdash;directly after the first performance of
the pageant."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Because I came up here. You see, the spring of a bracelet I was
wearing broke, and I wanted to put it away in my dressing-case. I
took the keys out of the drawer&mdash;I was in a great hurry. The
first one wouldn't fit&mdash;there was a bit of fluff in it, or
something. Anyhow, I <i>know</i> I used the second. I suppose I
ought to have told you all this before, only, in the confusion of
discovering the loss of the pearls it escaped my mind,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't matter. The point is that we are now certain
that someone took the duplicate key after&mdash;what time shall we
say, Sir Harry?"</p>

<p>"The afternoon performance was over about half-past five."</p>

<p>"After that hour, then. Who would be in the house, Sir Harry?"
Sir Harry laughed.</p>

<p>"A good many people," he said. "All the house-party came in to
tea&mdash;and a number of my personal friends in the neighbourhood
as well. There were the servants, of course, though I sincerely
hope&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," broke in Kinch, "we must try to have a perfectly open
mind. It isn't a question of suspecting or not suspecting any
particular individual&mdash;yet. And then," he went on, "after
tea&mdash;during the evening performance?"</p>

<p>"The servants were here&mdash;most of them. But people were
going in and out of the house. Some of my guests&mdash;and I myself
and my sons&mdash;changed our costumes here, in our rooms, between
the scenes."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;yes,"&mdash;he thought for a moment. "And you said
Hurst came upstairs?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;er&mdash;but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, Sir Harry?"</p>

<p>"You must, in fairness, Superintendent, remember that he
wouldn't have come into the house at all if I hadn't invited him to
dinner&mdash;at the last moment."</p>

<p>"Um!" ejaculated Kinch, thoughtfully. "Yes&mdash;that's true.
Well, we've got to find out all about this poor fellow, Hurst, Sir
Harry. My sergeant, Mentmore, is at The Gables now, making
enquiries, and is coming to me here presently, to report. Well,
madam," he went on to Mrs. Cresswell, "I won't trouble you any
further just now&mdash;and I'm sure you both want your breakfast.
After that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," broke in Mrs. Cresswell, "you <i>will</i> find my pearls
for me, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I shall do my best, you may be sure, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But haven't you any idea? What are you going to <i>do</i>?"</p>

<p>Kinch smiled.</p>

<p>"A great deal, Mrs. Cresswell. There is any amount of machinery
to put in motion. We are losing no time&mdash;but this promises to
be a very complicated affair&mdash;this double crime,&mdash;and you
must have patience.&mdash;One moment,"&mdash;he turned to a sofa
upon which an array of gorgeous clothes were lying. "Is this the
costume that you wore yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Superintendent Kinch solemnly took up each garment, held it, and
turned it over.</p>

<p>"Very pretty," was his comment. "You only wore this one
costume?"</p>

<p>"That is all. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Your dress must have suited you admirably, madam," gravely
replied Kinch, as he laid down the skirt on the sofa. "And now I
think we'll go down."</p>

<p>They were all three leaving the room, when Mrs. Cresswell
suddenly exclaimed, with a shudder:</p>

<p>"It's terrible losing my necklace; but, oh, suppose I had woke
up when the thief came into the room, and screamed&mdash;I
<i>know</i> I should have screamed&mdash;he'd probably have
murdered me. Ugh!"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily, Mrs. Cresswell," said Kinch, blandly. "I can't
say, of course, but it's just possible you might not have screamed,
you see. You might not, even, have been surprised."</p>

<p>"Eh?&mdash;what's that?" asked Sir Harry. "I don't
understand."</p>

<p>But the Superintendent made no reply to this. All he said was
that, after breakfast, he would like to interview all the inmates
of the house in the library.</p>

<p>In the hall was standing a tall, distinguished-looking man, with
a decided military bearing, dressed in a grey suit, the cut of
which suggested Saville Row, a man with iron-grey hair, small
moustache, and aristocratic face.</p>

<p>"Ah, good morning, Major," said Sir Harry.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Sir Harry. I'm not going to bother you
now&mdash;they tell me you haven't had breakfast yet. But I
came&mdash;of course. Beastly business. I'm sorry. You go and feed,
and I'll have a word with you afterwards. I want to see Kinch
now."</p>

<p>"Have you breakfasted, Major?" asked Sir Harry, with hospitable
interest.</p>

<p>"Long ago. That's all right."</p>

<p>"Well, shall I send you a cup of coffee in the library?"</p>

<p>"Thanks. I won't say no. Now&mdash;Kinch."</p>

<p>Major Bainbridge, Chief Constable of the County, was
essentially, so he said himself, a military man. He would tell his
friends that he was not, for all his title suggested it, a
policeman, least of all a sleuth. That it was his business to
organise the men who dealt with crime rather than to handle crime
itself. He told the Standing Committee this, more than once. The
Standing Committee never regretted having appointed him, however,
for although he might not have been a policeman, he had the rare
gift of knowing men and of being able to put the right man in the
right place, and the Standing Committee knew that, in the five
years he had been in office, he had brought the police of the
county to a high state of efficiency.</p>

<p>Among the police themselves there were just two predominant
opinions about Major Bainbridge. In the first place, every man,
rank or file, felt that he was personally known by the Chief
Constable. He never failed to call every constable by his right
name, and the homely little questions he asked them about their
domestic affairs made them feel he took a personal interest in
them. The second opinion was held by those of the more exalted
rank, such as Superintendent Kinch, and was the fruit of more
confidential intercourse. They knew very well that although the
Major professed to be "no policeman," he had a pretty shrewd
intellect and that whenever he chose, in his diffident way, to
"offer a suggestion," in some knotty problem, that suggestion was
by no means to be despised.</p>

<p>"Well, Kinch," he said, as he sat down in a chair in the
library, and lighted a cigarette, "this is a big job we're up
against, it seems. Now I don't want to barge in and burden you, for
I know you've got your hands full, but I would like&mdash;just a
brief summary of the case, so far."</p>

<p>This was characteristic of the Chief Constable. He always gave
the officer with whom he was discussing a case the impression that
<i>he</i>, the officer, had it in hand, and that the last thing he
wished to do was to rob him of any credit. Kinch told him, in as
few words as possible, all that had happened up to date.</p>

<p>"Um," said the Major. "Not much doubt that the two crimes were
connected, eh?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it, sir."</p>

<p>"Who was this poor chap, Hurst? Know anything about him?"</p>

<p>"Not much, sir. I've put Mentmore on that job. He'll report here
presently."</p>

<p>"Good. And this nephew of the Vicar's. He's got to be
found."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I've 'phoned through to the station. Fellowes has
gone up to London. He'll call at Scotland Yard. Question of
enquiries about night-clubs."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I see. Why have you had young Lynwood shadowed?"</p>

<p>"Because I've an inkling he knows more than he says. And it was
queer he wanted to run up to town on the spur of the moment. Of
course there may be nothing in it, but I'm taking no chances." The
Major nodded.</p>

<p>"Queer thing carrying off the body in that sedan-chair," he
mused.</p>

<p>"But he wasn't dead then, sir."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Question of getting him out of the way&mdash;in the car, wasn't
it, sir? They couldn't have brought the car nearer&mdash;because of
the noise. After all, it was the handiest way of carrying him."</p>

<p>The Chief Constable, who had been meditatively gazing at the end
of his cigarette, which he held in his hand, suddenly looked up.
"You don't think they meant to kill him, then?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I don't," said Kinch.</p>

<p>The two men looked at one another.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the Chief Constable. Then he went on: "You don't want
Scotland Yard called in?"</p>

<p>"I hope not," replied Kinch, briskly and confidently.</p>

<p>"Good," sighed the Major, almost beneath his breath.</p>

<p>Kinch understood.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," he said.</p>

<p>Major Bainbridge lighted a fresh cigarette, smoked in silence
for a few seconds, and then said, nonchalantly:</p>

<p>"Captain Bristow is still here, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. None of the guests have left yet. And I understand
Captain Bristow is staying on for a few days."</p>

<p>"Oh! You may or you may not know, Kinch, that Captain Bristow
was, for some years, in the Secret Service?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. So I've heard."</p>

<p>"Good record, Kinch, good record. I happen to know that he was
looked upon as one of their smartest men. He hasn't volunteered any
theory, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not to me, sir."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't. It's not his job, of course, and he wouldn't
interfere. But, all the same, I expect he's got a few notions. A
reticent fellow, Kinch, from what I've heard of him.
I&mdash;er&mdash;presume you hadn't thought of taking him into your
confidence at all?"</p>

<p>"I rather prefer to work on my own, sir,&mdash;and with my own
men."</p>

<p>"Oh, quite so, quite so."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I knew something about him, sir,&mdash;so I'm&mdash;well, in a
way, interested. And I'm noticing any remarks he makes without
letting him know."</p>

<p>"As, for example,&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's asked a few questions&mdash;of the Vicar, and
others. I've got them jotted down," and he tapped his notebook,
which lay on the table beside him.</p>

<p>"I think you are wise, Kinch," remarked the Chief Constable.
"Any opinion of his&mdash;if he offers it&mdash;would be worth
considering. And he wouldn't ask questions without a motive. Keep
your eye on him, anyhow, even if you don't deal with him
directly."</p>

<p>Kinch half hesitated&mdash;then began:</p>

<p>"He seemed rather keen on that derelict car we found at
Drifford, but I couldn't see the point he was driving at."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Wanted to know if there was a station at Drifford&mdash;and the
exact time the car was wrecked. That must have been after half-past
eleven."</p>

<p>"Oh!" the Chief Constable's eyes twinkled. "Well, I'm fond of
crossword puzzles&mdash;if the clues are well hidden and call for a
little thought."</p>

<p>He half-closed his eyes. The Superintendent glanced at his
watch, then entered a few notes in his book. It was nearly time
that Mentmore should come to report about his visit to The Gables.
And then there were all these people to interview. He glanced at
the list he had now received&mdash;the members of the
family&mdash;guests, servants. He began ticking them off in the
order in which he would have them in the library. He half forgot
Major Bainbridge's presence.</p>

<p>Lazily, the Chief Constable reached for a Bradshaw which was
lying, with other books of reference, on a writing-table; turned
over the leaves, studied it for a moment or two, put it down, and
said:</p>

<p>"Kinch, may I offer a suggestion?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!"</p>

<p>The Superintendent was alert now. He had had previous experience
of these "suggestions" of his superior officer.</p>

<p>"I'm rather curious to test Captain Bristow's train of thought.
You say they haven't found those registration number-plates
anywhere near the place the car broke down. I suggest you might
arrange to have them looked for by the side of the line between
Drifford and Chiltonbury&mdash;the down side, and probably nearer
Drifford than Chiltonbury. Possibly platelayers&mdash;but there,
it's only a suggestion."</p>

<p>"How on earth&mdash;" began Kinch, but the other waved his hand
to silence him.</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;you try. There may be something in it."</p>

<p>A tap at the door stopped further conversation. Anstice Lynwood
appeared.</p>

<p>"May I come in&mdash;if I'm not disturbing you?"</p>

<p>The Chief Constable sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Miss Lynwood. Yes&mdash;come in, by all
means."</p>

<p>"I'm frightfully hungry," said the girl, "and I want my
breakfast too badly to worry you for long. But I've checked all
those costumes and properties," she went on, speaking to the
Superintendent, "and I've found two things in the tent that had
nothing to do with the pageant&mdash;at least, I don't think so.
Here they are."</p>

<p>She laid on the table, first of all, a navy-and-white
muffler.</p>

<p>"This certainly doesn't belong to us or to any of the hired
costumes, and I don't remember anyone having it on yesterday,
though, of course, someone might have been wearing it in the
ordinary way. And the other thing&mdash;well, here it is, but I
can't make it out at all."</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> can," said Major Bainbridge; "it's what we call a
knuckle-duster,&mdash;that's what this funny-looking bit of brass
is, eh, Kinch?"</p>

<p>"That's right, sir."</p>

<p>"A knuckle-duster?" echoed Anstice.</p>

<p>"A sort of metal boxing-glove," explained the Major. "You just
slip your fingers in those holes, and let out at a fellow. And when
he gets it in the face&mdash;well, it's a knock-out in the first
round, generally. Where did you find it, Miss Lynwood?"</p>

<p>"Half hidden in the grass&mdash;on the floor of the tent...Then,
you think&mdash;?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I don't think there is much doubt about this being the weapon
with which Hurst was killed, Miss Lynwood," said the
Superintendent, gravely. "You see, sir?" and he arched his eyebrows
as he turned to the Chief Constable.</p>

<p>Major Bainbridge nodded. There was a dark brown stain on the
outside of the formidable little brass weapon.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5</h2>

<p>By no means the least important phase in a criminal case is that
which embraces the routine work of the police, work that is often
at once elaborate, detailed, exceedingly dull in parts, but
invariably painstaking. To write the real, complete story of any
crime, however interesting in itself, its detection, and its
result, would be to weary the reader intensely.</p>

<p>Better, therefore, in this story, only to give hints of the
movements which, emanating from the police-station at Chiltonbury,
spread far and wide throughout the country, like the ripples
emanating from the splash of a stone falling in the midst of a
pond. By means of the telephone at Frimley Manor, and by police
messengers who dashed in and out from Chiltonbury, Superintendent
Kinch constantly set the machinery in motion, in the hope that some
little movement of it, somewhere, would lead to the results he had
in view.</p>

<p>Descriptions of the Vicar's nephew, of Mrs. Cresswell's necklace
and of the Vicar's car, had been broadcast. Search was being made,
in relation to frequenters of night-clubs in London, for traces of
Bob Gilbert, the man the Vicar had mentioned as being one of his
nephew's friends. "Fences" were being kept under observation, and
even Charles Lynwood, in blissful ignorance, was being tracked to
his London club&mdash;to which he directed his steps after arriving
at the terminus.</p>

<p>And all this before Sir Harry's house-party had finished their
breakfast and Kinch had had time to interview them. But, all the
time, he felt he had no real knowledge of the central figure of the
tragedy, the man who lay, cold and stiff, in his house, The Gables.
And he waited, a little impatiently, for Mentmore's report.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Mentmore came back from The Gables in time
to have a close and confidential interview with the Superintendent
before the latter tackled the delicate task of interviewing
personally the inmates of Frimley Manor. The Superintendent
welcomed the burly, good-tempered-looking Detective-Sergeant, as
the latter came into the library. He did not at all resemble a
ferret, but Kinch knew that this heavy, lethargic-looking man had
all the ferret's characteristics in finding the scent and in
sticking closely to the trail. He also knew, from long experience,
that the report which Mentmore would present to him would be a
plain, straightforward statement of facts, unvarnished, and nothing
redundant about it. Mentmore invariably stuck, like a bull-dog, to
the point.</p>

<p>"Ah, Sergeant," he said, "glad to see you. We may be able to get
a bit forrader now. By the way&mdash;there's another
crime&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The lady's pearls. I know. The chauffeur told me as I came
through the yard. Anything doing, sir?"</p>

<p>"Humph! A good deal may depend upon what you've found out at The
Gables. Let's have it, Sergeant."</p>

<p>Mentmore produced and opened his pocket-book.</p>

<p>"And that isn't much, sir. Up against a blank wall, mostly."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>And Mentmore, his eyes steadily fixed on his notebook, made his
report.</p>

<p>"There's a married couple in the house, Barnes by name, and a
girl. Jobbing gardener comes in three times a week. I've seen them
all. The girl belongs to the village&mdash;a bit of a fool. No
information worth having from her. And the gardener's much the
same.</p>

<p>"Barnes is an ex-sergeant of the Downshires. Intelligent man.
Since his discharge accepted several posts as butler and valet. His
wife does the housekeeping and cooking. Superior, reliable people,
both of 'em. They've only been with Hurst two months&mdash;since he
came here. Answered an advertisement in the Morning Post for a
married couple to live in; address, Office of the paper. Hurst
replied, writing from the Queen's Hotel, Leeds. Barnes kept the
letter. Here it is, sir."</p>

<p>And he handed it to Kinch, who read:</p>

<blockquote>"James Barnes,<br>
<br>
"I am in receipt of your answer to my advertisement. I shall be in
London on Thursday next and would like to interview you. I am
lunching at the Savoy Restaurant. Kindly call there at 2 o'clock
and ask the Commissionaire at the door for me. I will leave word
for him. Bring testimonials.<br>
<br>
"Yours faithfully,<br>
JASPER HURST."</blockquote>

<p>"Well?" said the Superintendent. Mentmore went on:</p>

<p>"Barnes kept the appointment. Hurst was satisfied and engaged
him and his wife. Said he had just taken a house at Frimley, near
Chiltonbury, and wanted Barnes and his wife to go there to get
ready for him. Explained all arrangements. They came here on May
the eleventh, same day as the furniture arrived&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where from?"</p>

<p>"Felter's&mdash;Tottenham Court Road. All new. They got it in.
Hurst came three days later&mdash;sending a wire first. Came in his
car. New car, too. One of the conditions was that Barnes was to act
as chauffeur when required. And that's all Barnes knows about him,
sir."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;he's been here two months. Surely&mdash;</p>

<p>"I asked that, naturally. Occasional visitors&mdash;to lunch.
Never stayed night. Two gentlemen&mdash;Barnes met the London train
and ran them out. One came twice, the other once. He didn't know
their names. Sir Harry Lynwood called&mdash;and the Vicar, locally.
That seems about all."</p>

<p>"Couldn't tell you of any relatives?"</p>

<p>"No. Hurst never mentioned any."</p>

<p>"How about correspondence?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Mentmore, "I shouldn't say Barnes or his wife
are the kind to read other people's letters. I asked, of course.
Very little actual correspondence, I gathered. And they knew
nothing about it."</p>

<p>"They told you what sort of a man he was&mdash;habits and so
on?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Here's the summary. A gentleman. Knew what's what,
Barnes put it. Quiet and retiring. Read a fair amount. Evidently in
good circumstances. Went to London occasionally. Fond of walking,
but, apparently, not a sports-man. Methodical, in the
house&mdash;you know what a woman like Mrs. Barnes would
say&mdash;'gave no trouble.' And that's about all."</p>

<p>The Superintendent nodded.</p>

<p>"Find anything?" he asked, curtly.</p>

<p>"Nothing much. Searched his writing-desk, and so on, of course.
Seems to have destroyed all letters&mdash;if he had any. Not even
an envelope with a postmark lying about. Only tradesmen's bills,
circulars, and what-not. Here's his cheque-book. London and Western
Bank, Fleet Street branch. Enquiries to be made there. And this may
be of use&mdash;though there isn't much in it."</p>

<p>"This" was a small address-book, evidently new, lettered
alphabetically at the edges. The Superintendent consulted it with
interest and began turning over the leaves. "A" was blank. "B" had
the addresses of a baker and a butcher in Chiltonbury. "C" produced
a local chemist, and underneath the word "Carnations" was evidently
a florist's address.</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Kinch, as he turned to "D."</p>

<p>"This may be worth looking up."</p>

<p>What was written on the "D" page was "Doctor. P. H. Sefton,
M.D., 58a Harley Street."</p>

<p>"E" was blank. "F" detained the Superintendent for a moment. It
contained this entry:</p>

<p>"F. Wisteria, 71 Hampden Road, St. John's Wood, N.W.8."</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "<i>that</i>'ll have to be noted. First private
address, apparently, I've seen."</p>

<p>"And the only one," said Mentmore; "all the rest are tradesmen
or the like. And this may only turn out to be something of the
kind. 'Faith-healer'&mdash;'Fortune-teller'&mdash;'Face
massage'&mdash;Most likely a frost," he added, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Well," said Kinch, "we must find out how he took the
house&mdash;references, and so on. I haven't had time to ask Sir
Harry yet."</p>

<p>"I have. Saw him just now as I came in. He'd put The Gables in
the hands of Aston &amp; Newman, 113 Piccadilly&mdash;auctioneers
and house agents, and advertised it in the <i>Times</i>. Hurst saw
the advertisement, called on the agents. They arranged the let. He
gave them his bankers as a reference, and they thought it good
enough."</p>

<p>"I see. Now then, photos?" he asked, tersely.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Here's one. Recently taken, Barnes thinks."</p>

<p>"Good! The Press will be swarming about here in no time. Get it
published&mdash;they'll be glad to have it. And a full description,
of course. That may bring something. I've got to interview these
folks now. But, look here, Mentmore&mdash;ring up that Harley
Street doctor&mdash;there's a London telephone directory in the
hall. Got the address? Right. Ask him to tell you anything he knows
of Hurst. And then, I want you to go to the Vicarage. There may be
nothing in it, but take this scarf with you. The Vicar's been round
with a story. His nephew took that car of his last
night&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good Lord, sir! That's some news!"</p>

<p>"I hope so. He'll give you details. Interview his housekeeper.
See if she knows anything about the scarf. Careful, mind. Don't
thrust it at her. You'll understand."</p>

<p>"Right, sir."</p>

<p>"Come back here and report. Then I shall want to run in to
Chiltonbury."</p>

<p>Kinch thereupon settled down to the task of interviewing. Sir
Harry came in first. His contribution consisted mainly of brief
notes concerning the guests and servants.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we shall have a lot of trouble," the Superintendent
confided, "in finding out about Hurst. At present he's a dark
horse."</p>

<p>"Do you think," asked the Baronet, "that
he&mdash;well&mdash;that he took Mrs. Cresswell's pearls? Slipped
back into the house after my son had gone into the tent?"</p>

<p>"Candidly, I don't know <i>what</i> to think about that yet, Sir
Harry. That he was mixed up with the theft is pretty obvious. But
<i>how</i> he was mixed up is a puzzle at present. And now, please,
I'll see your eldest son&mdash;and then Miss Lynwood."</p>

<p>Harry Lynwood's visit to the library was a brief one. He had
nothing to add to what Kinch knew already. His sister followed him.
"You have saved me a lot of trouble, Miss Lynwood," began Kinch,
"by checking those costumes. They were hired, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Most of them were."</p>

<p>"Well, I want to see them all before they go back. Are they
still in the tent?"</p>

<p>"Yes. We have a few in the house. Do you want to see them as
well?"</p>

<p>"Please. Also hired?"</p>

<p>"Not all. We made some."</p>

<p>"Well, let me have a look at them, too. Now, tell me. You didn't
hear anything in the night?"</p>

<p>"Not a sound. You see, I was fast asleep."</p>

<p>"Your room opens on the main corridor?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I might have been anywhere. I was frightfully tired,
and went to sleep at once."</p>

<p>"I see. Tell me about Mrs. Cresswell. I suppose you arranged for
her to come here long before the pageant took place?"</p>

<p>"Of course. And Sonia Fullinger too. They live near one another
in London."</p>

<p>"Yes. And&mdash;er&mdash;well, I suppose Mrs. Cresswell rather
enjoyed showing off that necklace? If I may say so, she seems that
sort, eh?" Anstice smiled.</p>

<p>"She did: very much. I was only saying yesterday I thought it
rather silly of her, with all those people about."</p>

<p>"She was likely to talk about it beforehand?"</p>

<p>"Beforehand?"</p>

<p>"Before she came here, I mean."</p>

<p>"I expect she was. I don't want to be nasty, Superintendent, but
we all know how Mrs. Cresswell loves the opportunity of parading
her jewelry. Poor thing! she's in rather a state about it
now&mdash;I don't mean only losing her pearls, but her husband will
be so frightfully angry. She's telephoned to him&mdash;and he's
coming down today."</p>

<p>"Well," said Kinch, "we must try to find them for her. Thank you
very much. I'll see Mr. Singleton now,"&mdash;he glanced at his
list. "A barrister, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll ask him to come in."</p>

<p>There entered one of the guests, a tall, middle-aged man, his
profession clearly stamped on his clear-cut, intellectual face.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mr. Singleton. I'll get to the point at once. Can
you throw any light on this case?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could, Superintendent," replied Singleton. "My
particular line happens to be criminology, so I'm intensely
interested. But I know nothing. I slept soundly, and it was only
when I came down to breakfast that I heard what had happened."</p>

<p>"Well, let's go back a bit before that, sir. Sir Harry tells me
that this poor devil Hurst went upstairs with some of you gentlemen
before dinner. Were you one?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. He and young Underwood and I went into one of the
bathrooms for a wash and brush-up."</p>

<p>"Yes, I see. Now, if you can remember, tell me what happened."
Singleton looked at him, keenly.</p>

<p>"Let me see," he said. "Yes&mdash;I can do that. Hurst washed
his hands and brushed his hair. I was talking to him at the time.
Then he went out&mdash;into the corridor. Underwood and I must have
remained in the bathroom for four or five minutes. But when I came
out Hurst had not gone downstairs. He was still in the
corridor."</p>

<p>"Oh!" The Superintendent leaned forward. "What was he
doing?"</p>

<p>"Looking out of the window&mdash;at the end of the
corridor."</p>

<p>"And he'd been there several minutes?"</p>

<p>"Must have been."</p>

<p>The Superintendent was thinking quickly. This would have given
Hurst plenty of time to slip into Mrs. Cresswell's bedroom and get
the duplicate key off the bunch. The weak link in the chain of
reasoning was, of course, the fact that Sir Harry had told him that
Hurst was only invited to the house at the last moment.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said. "I think that's all, Mr. Singleton."</p>

<p>"You won't want me any more? I had arranged to take a morning
train back to London&mdash;I'm rather busy."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, sir. You won't object to Inspector
Hughes&mdash;he ought to be here now&mdash;in plain
clothes&mdash;taking a look at your things before you go? I've got,
as a matter of form, to have a search. It's a job I hate,
though."</p>

<p>"Certainly," laughed Singleton, "though I don't think you'll
find that necklace in the house."</p>

<p>"Sure I shan't. Will you ask Mr. Underwood to come in?"</p>

<p>Frank Underwood, a young Cambridge undergraduate, had nothing of
importance to tell Kinch. He, too, had slept soundly through the
night. He had not noticed Hurst when he came out of the bathroom.
He, too, was returning that day, and, as there was no reason for
detaining him, the Superintendent told him he might do so.</p>

<p>The next on the list was Mrs. Cresswell, but as Kinch had
already seen her, and as Anstice Lynwood had told him that she was
remaining in the house&mdash;at all events till her husband
came&mdash;he passed her over and asked for Sonia Fullinger.</p>

<p>He looked up as she came into the room. A pretty, vivacious
girl, with dark shingled hair and brown eyes, quick in her
movements. He also noticed her firm chin and rather compressed
lips. To him these meant more than her piquant beauty, for they
were an indication of a decided character.</p>

<p>He had, of course, asked Singleton and Underwood what were their
respective addresses, and he began in the same manner with Sonia
Fullinger.</p>

<p>"Ah! Miss Fullinger, I believe. Do sit down. And will you,
please, give me your home address?"</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, her eyes rounding a little.</p>

<p>"Well, you see," he said, urbanely, "I'm asking all the guests
to let me know where they live&mdash;it's a matter of routine."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;very well, then. St. John's Wood..." He looked,
enquiringly, "Hampden Road, St. John's Wood," she completed it.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and the number?" he asked, with pencil poised over
his notebook.</p>

<p>"Seventy-one."</p>

<p>There was the slightest flicker in his eyes, otherwise he
betrayed no particular interest. Kinch was a master of outward
expression. Apparently quite casually he reached for the other
notebook which was lying on the table, the address-book Mentmore
had brought from The Gables, opened it nonchalantly at the letter
"F."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," he said, smiling. "Is there any particular name to
the house&mdash;besides the number?"</p>

<p>"Wisteria."</p>

<p>Kinch closed the address-book and put it back on the table. Not
by a single gesture or facial expression did he betray his intense
interest. On the contrary, the bland, encouraging smile broadened
on his refined, pleasant-looking face. He looked innocent and
fatherly.</p>

<p>"You live there with your parents?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"And your father? May I ask what is his profession?"</p>

<p>"My father? Oh, he's on the Stock Exchange."</p>

<p>A rapid succession of thoughts flashed through the keen brain of
the Superintendent. This address in Hurst's little book might mean
no more than that Mr. Fullinger was his broker&mdash;it harmonized
with all the other addresses in the book. And yet, one does not
generally enter the private address of one's broker in lists of
this kind. His next question, seemingly quite casual, was a clever
one.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Thank you. Jobber or broker?"</p>

<p>The girl's eyes rounded in surprise.</p>

<p>"I don't see why you want to know all this," she replied; "but
he's a jobber."</p>

<p>That rather settled it. The public do not deal direct with
jobbers on the Stock Exchange. At the same time, he was aware that
he had aroused a feeling of antagonism in the girl with these
seemingly irrelevant questions. He would have to proceed warily.
And his instinct and experience told him that blunt, direct methods
would be out of place. Besides, he was anxious not to arouse the
slightest suspicion in her mind.</p>

<p>"This is a very serious crime, Miss Fullinger," he said; "a
double crime. And I am trying to get all the information I can
about it. Of course I want to know about this unfortunate Mr.
Hurst, and I thought, perhaps, you could give me some
information."</p>

<p>"I!" she exclaimed. "Oh, but why should you ask me that?"</p>

<p>"Well, I gathered that you knew him."</p>

<p>"I never saw him before yesterday," she replied.</p>

<p>"Oh? Nor knew anything of him?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. I'm frightfully sorry for what has happened, but
I can't help you."</p>

<p>"He never came to your house, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"To our house? Certainly not."</p>

<p>There was a gathering resentment in her tone of voice. And Kinch
knew that a defiant witness is of little use.</p>

<p>"Well, now, tell me&mdash;you saw him yesterday, didn't you? And
he dined here, I understand."</p>

<p>"Yes. I was sitting next to him."</p>

<p>"Oh! And he talked to you, naturally. Was there anything in his
conversation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all," she broke in. "He only spoke to me two or three
times&mdash;about the pageant, and so on."</p>

<p>"Mention Mrs. Cresswell's pearls?"</p>

<p>"Did he?&mdash;er&mdash;yes, as a matter of fact, he did. But it
was nothing particular."</p>

<p>"Still," said the Superintendent, blandly, "sometimes a chance
word helps. What did he say about the pearls?"</p>

<p>"Let me see"&mdash;she paused a little&mdash;"Oh, yes, I think I
remember. I was telling him I was going to run Mrs. Cresswell to
London this morning in my two-seater, and he wanted to know how we
managed about her luggage. I told him our maids took that&mdash;by
train. And then he asked if Mrs. Cresswell would take her pearls
with her, or send them by her maid. And I said I really didn't
know."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>He was trying to piece things together. If what she was telling
him was true, there could be no doubt that Jasper Hurst had been
showing rather an inquisitive interest in those pearls. On the
other hand, there was that marked coincidence in her home address
being entered in Hurst's book&mdash;and under the letter
"F"&mdash;Fullinger. He had a half a mind to ask her what it
meant&mdash;but his intuitive caution got the better of him. If she
had lied about the matter of knowing Hurst she would equally
prevaricate on the question of the address. And there were other
methods.</p>

<p>"Nothing more?" he asked.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Well, let me ask you something else." He looked at his
notebook. "Sir Harry tells me you went up to your room last night
rather earlier than the others. And Mrs. Cresswell says she tapped
at your door later on&mdash;before she retired for the night."</p>

<p>"Did she?" asked the girl. "I didn't hear her, then."</p>

<p>"I see. I suppose you must have been asleep. And you heard
nothing in the night?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;nothing at all."</p>

<p>"Umph! Well&mdash;I think that's all. Thank you very much, Miss
Fullinger. Are you leaving today?"</p>

<p>Sonia shot a glance at him&mdash;half-mischievous.</p>

<p>"If I may be allowed to do so," she said.</p>

<p>"Certainly. I shan't want you at the inquest. By the way, I must
see your maid. You have one, I understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Been with you long?"</p>

<p>Unconsciously he had relapsed into an official attitude, and was
rapping out his questions. That gleam of defiance came once more
into Sonia's eyes.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you all about her, Superintendent," she retorted,
"without troubling you to cross-examine me. Her name is Bates. I
fancy her Christian names are Phyllis Aurelia&mdash;but I call her
Bates. She has been with me for about a month&mdash;straight from
her last place, which was with Lady Challington, to whom she was
lady's-maid for four years or more. Excellent testimonials. Height
about five feet two, clear complexion&mdash;when it's natural,
which it often isn't&mdash;fair hair, grey eyes. And she doesn't
squint, and she hasn't, so far as I know, got a strawberry-mark on
her left shoulder. Will that do?"</p>

<p>Superintendent Kinch replied with perfect gravity, and with just
the vestige of a twinkle in his eyes:</p>

<p>"An excellent description, Miss Fullinger. Thank you very much.
And now, please, I will see Phyllis Aurelia Bates, if you will very
kindly send her to me."</p>

<p>Sonia Fullinger nodded, got up and walked out of the room, Kinch
looking after her, a puzzled expression on his face. In a minute or
two the maid, Bates, came in. She was a young woman of about
twenty-three years of age, wearing a plain black frock, very neat;
almost prim in the severity of her appearance. A good-looking young
woman, but with rather a "baby" type of countenance, marked by the
slightly open mouth and a half-wondering look in her grey eyes.
Pretty fair hair, bobbed and very carefully brushed. And her
mistress was right as to her complexion; she had powdered her nose
rather apparently, and her cheeks were tinted by art in exclusion
to nature.</p>

<p>"Ah," said the Superintendent, "Miss Fullinger tells me you have
only been a short time in her service."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Just about four weeks. My late mistress was leaving
for India, and I didn't want to go abroad."</p>

<p>"Lady Challington?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I've got the testimonial she gave me, here, if you'd
like to see it."</p>

<p>Kinch took and read it. It was quite an ordinary testimonial.
Bates had been with Lady Challington for four years&mdash;was
perfectly honest and of good moral character&mdash;understood her
duties thoroughly&mdash;a good needlewoman...Lady Challington could
confidently recommend her as an efficient lady's-maid.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Kinch. "And you heard or saw nothing last
night?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Nothing. I sleep soundly, and my room was in another
wing of the house&mdash;at the back."</p>

<p>"I see. And what do you know about Mr. Hurst&mdash;the gentleman
who was murdered?" He shot the question at her, suddenly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hurst, sir? I'd never heard of him before."</p>

<p>"Never heard Miss Fullinger&mdash;or any of her
people&mdash;mention him?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Not till this morning."</p>

<p>"I see. Now, tell me, please. I suppose you went into your
mistress's room last night&mdash;when she went to bed?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course I did, sir. It's part of my duties. I always go
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know. She went to bed early, didn't she?"</p>

<p>"She&mdash;she went up to her room early, sir."</p>

<p>"Eh?" He looked up from his notebook sharply. "I
mean&mdash;well&mdash;she was <i>in</i> bed early?"</p>

<p>The girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"I couldn't say, sir," she replied. "You see, she hadn't gone to
bed when I left her room."</p>

<p>Kinch was interested.</p>

<p>"What time was that?"</p>

<p>"I didn't notice, sir."</p>

<p>"Come, try to remember. Was it, for example, before or after
eleven?"</p>

<p>Bates puckered her forehead.</p>

<p>"I can't be certain, sir. But I think it must have been after
eleven though it might have been a few minutes before."</p>

<p>"Tell me exactly what happened&mdash;when you went up to her
room. She rang for you, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and I went straight up."</p>

<p>"And she?"</p>

<p>"She was sitting down, sir,&mdash;smoking a cigarette."</p>

<p>"You're sure she wasn't in bed?"</p>

<p>"Of course she wasn't sir. She hadn't begun to undress. She was
still wearing her acting clothes."</p>

<p>"I see. Well, and what then?"</p>

<p>"I packed her large suitcase, sir,&mdash;ready for going away
this morning. And then she told me I might go. That was all."</p>

<p>The Superintendent leaned back in his chair and looked at Bates,
thoughtfully. He was puzzled. If Sonia Fullinger was still up and
dressed about eleven o'clock, why, then, she must have been pretty
quick in undressing, getting into bed, and falling asleep before
Mrs. Cresswell tapped at her door. But <i>was</i> there anything in
it? He knew quite well that, in a case of this kind, an open mind
had to be kept, and he knew, also, that it was fatal to centre
suspicions on a particular person from slender reasons. Rapidly he
debated in his mind whether he should see Sonia Fullinger again
before she left, ask her to explain why she was so long undressing,
and whether she was really asleep when Mrs. Cresswell tapped at her
door. Immediately, however, he saw the futility of such a question.
Whether there was anything in it or not, her reply was sure to be
that, whatever time Mrs. Cresswell knocked, she had not heard it.
There was no real evidence of anything that mattered.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, after a pause, "I think that's all. You are
returning to town with your mistress, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I was to have gone by train, but now Mrs. Cresswell
isn't coming, Miss Fullinger is going to take me and the luggage in
her car."</p>

<p>"Very well. I want to see Mrs. Cresswell's maid now. You can
tell her, please."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cresswell's maid, Crane by name, was a self-possessed young
woman of about thirty, her rather plain face giving the impression
of sound common-sense. She looked shrewd and capable. The
Superintendent summed her up quickly.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "there are a few questions I want to ask you,
please. You went up to Mrs. Cresswell's room last night?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you see the necklace then?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. My mistress had locked it up in her dressing-case
before she rang for me, I suppose. At any rate, she was not wearing
it." Kinch nodded. This tallied with Mrs. Cresswell's story. "There
was nothing out of the way?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You knew Mrs. Cresswell kept the key of the dressing-case in
that left-hand drawer?"</p>

<p>The woman smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I knew that very well. It was her fixed habit. I've
taken those keys out of her drawer hundreds of times&mdash;to
unlock something for her. I sometimes thought it wasn't quite wise
always to keep them in the same place."</p>

<p>"I suppose others knew as well?"</p>

<p>Crane shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not as far as I'm concerned," she replied. "I mean, I never
told any of the other servants."</p>

<p>"Quite sensible of you. But&mdash;well, say Mrs. Cresswell's
friends. Do you think any of them knew where she kept those
keys?"</p>

<p>"I should think they must have done&mdash;some of them. You see,
sir, ladies often take their friends up to their rooms to show them
their dresses, and so on."</p>

<p>Kinch smiled. Being a married man, he was well aware of this.
"Yes, I see," he said; "her <i>intimate</i> friends, of
course,&mdash;such as Miss Lynwood here&mdash;or Miss
Fullinger?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Miss Fullinger is often in our house. She lives quite
near." The Superintendent followed it up.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said with a laugh, "Mrs. Cresswell tried on that
Queen Anne costume she was wearing yesterday, and showed it to her
friends, didn't she?"</p>

<p>The maid laughed in return.</p>

<p>"That's a fact," she replied. "Before dinner here&mdash;the
evening before last. The ladies were all going into each other's
rooms."</p>

<p>"And she'd show then the pearls as well?"</p>

<p>Again she laughed.</p>

<p>"I can't imagine her <i>not</i> doing so," she said, dryly.</p>

<p>"Well," went on Kinch, as though he had been digressing, "I
mustn't waste time talking about the ladies showing off their
dresses. Let's get back to the point. Everybody except Captain
Bristow and Mr. Charles seems to have slept very soundly last
night. Did you?"</p>

<p>"I did, sir. It had been a busy day, and I was late going to
bed. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How late?"</p>

<p>"Nearly twelve o'clock, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh. And you heard nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at all. I didn't know anything had happened till I came
down into the servants' hall this morning. The butler told me,
then, about the murder&mdash;and a few minutes later my mistress
rang for me and I found her distracted over the loss of her
pearls."</p>

<p>He asked her a few more questions, and then dismissed her.
Methodically, but as briefly as possible, he proceeded to interview
the house servants, but not one scrap of information could he get
from them. He closed his notebook and looked at his watch. It was
time to get back to Chiltonbury, but he had to wait until Mentmore
returned from the Vicarage before he started.</p>

<p>He left the library and went into the hall. Its only occupant
was Captain Bristow, who was sitting in an arm-chair, pipe in
mouth, quietly reading the morning paper. He looked up.</p>

<p>"Finished your interviews, Superintendent?"</p>

<p>"I've seen everyone who was in the house last night, yes,
sir."</p>

<p>"Ah!" replied Bristow, tersely.</p>

<p>The two men looked at one another for a moment or two.</p>

<p>"Of course there's you, sir," said Kinch. "I didn't ask you to
come into the library. But you've told me all you know, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I think I've told you every fact, Superintendent."</p>

<p>"Queer case, sir."</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>It may have been that each man was wondering, not about facts,
but about any theories the other might have. But, if this was so,
neither of them asked a question or volunteered a remark. And, just
then, Mentmore came in.</p>

<p>The detective-sergeant was just about to speak to his superior
officer when he caught sight of Captain Bristow&mdash;and
hesitated. But Kinch said, with a quick glance at Bristow
first:</p>

<p>"All right, Mentmore. You've been to the Vicarage?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Kinch turned to Captain Bristow.</p>

<p>"We found a scarf in the marquee," he said, "which didn't belong
to any of the costumes&mdash;Ah&mdash;that's it," for Mentmore had
taken the scarf out of his pocket. "Well," he went on to the
detective-sergeant, "how about it?"</p>

<p>Bristow laid down his paper and eyed Mentmore with interest.</p>

<p>"I saw the Vicar's housekeeper, sir. She told me all about the
visit of young Mr. Curtis last night. I produced this scarf, and
she recognised it before I'd time to ask her any questions about
it. She says Mr. Curtis was wearing it when he called at the
Vicarage. It was hanging up in the hall with his light overcoat all
the time he was in the house."</p>

<p>"By George!" exclaimed the Superintendent. "No getting away from
<i>that</i>, Captain Bristow."</p>

<p>"May I ask your sergeant a question?" was Bristow's reply. "By
all means."</p>

<p>Bristow turned to Mentmore.</p>

<p>"When the Vicar told us about his nephew a little while ago, he
said his housekeeper was not quite sure of the time when Mr. Curtis
took the car out of the garage; she thought it may have been about
half-past ten or nearer eleven. You didn't happen to find out the
exact time he started the car, by any chance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did, sir. The maid knew. She didn't <i>see</i> the car,
but she heard it drive off. And she struck a match and looked at
her alarm clock. The housekeeper was a bit out&mdash;it was five
minutes past eleven."</p>

<p>"Oh! Thank you."</p>

<p>He took a little notebook from his pocket, looked up a page of
it, replaced it, and started filling his pipe. For the first time,
the Superintendent's curiosity got the better of his
taciturnity.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, sir?" he blurted out.</p>

<p>Bristow had struck a match and was lighting his pipe.</p>

<p>"I think"&mdash;puff-puff&mdash;"that the padre's
nephew"&mdash;puff-puff&mdash;"must have been in a deuce of a
hurry. And, on his uncle's showing, he's a careless young man, you
know."</p>

<p>The Superintendent looked at him, but forbore asking further
questions.</p>

<p>"I'm running back to Chiltonbury in my car now," he went on, to
the sergeant. "Just a word with you first," and he walked towards
the front door, inviting Mentmore, with a gesture, to follow
him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say," said Bristow, "do you mind running me in with you?
I want some tobacco&mdash;and a walk as well. I'll walk out."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir&mdash;in two minutes. My car's outside."</p>

<p>In a couple of minutes Bristow strolled out. Kinch was seated in
the car, ready. Mentmore was making towards the marquee. And what
the Superintendent had said to the sergeant in those two minutes
was:</p>

<p>"Look here, I found this shred of gold lace on the floor of Mrs.
Cresswell's room, close to the door&mdash;torn, you see. And the
metal finger-plate of the door, inside, was a bit loose and had a
sharp corner&mdash;must have caught it. Also, there wasn't any gold
lace on Mrs. Cresswell's costume. I want you to go through all
those costumes in the tent&mdash;and there's some in the house as
well&mdash;Miss Lynwood will show you&mdash;and see if it came off
any of them. Understand?"</p>

<p>The detective-sergeant nodded.</p>

<p>"Not bad, that, sir," he remarked.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6</h2>

<p>Twenty miles or so distant from Frimley was a lonely spot
beneath the downs known as Hawley Vale. At least, so it was marked
in the ordnance map, but in local parlance it was usually spoken of
as "Yew Tree Bottom." It was a large, horseshoe-shaped valley lying
between the spurs jutting out from the downs, and backed by the
downs themselves.</p>

<p>The only access to it for vehicles was at the open mouth of the
valley, reached by a by-road, or rather a lane, which branched off
from the main road, and ended on the turf itself at the mouth of
the valley. But then it was seldom that any vehicles found their
way into Yew Tree Bottom, unless a picnic-party had a mind to drive
their car right away from the haunts of men for their meal.</p>

<p>Yew Tree Bottom was quite destitute of human habitation. It was
rather an eerie place. Dark juniper bushes grew on the slopes of
the downs, and in the very centre of the secluded valley was a
group of giant and venerable yew-trees. Tradition said that they
had once found a Druidical grove in which mysterious rites were
celebrated. Certain it was that there was something awe-inspiring
in the place. Beneath the cluster of yew-trees one found oneself in
a sort of cathedral, formed by nature: gnarled trunks for pillars,
and overhead a thick roof of dark, intertwined foliage.</p>

<p>It was doubtful, however, whether the man who came slowly down
the slope of the hills into the valley was troubled with any
feelings inspiring awe, though, evidently, he was a cautious man.
Every now and again his dark, piercing eyes gazed around the great
sweep of country very watchfully. Every now and then, too, he
stooped down, and when he rose again he had something in his hand,
pegs of wood and a noose of fine string&mdash;sometimes something
more substantial, in the shape of a rabbit&mdash;once, and he
chuckled as he took it from the snare, a very respectably-sized
hare. This, and the rabbits, were disposed of in the capacious
pockets of an old, loose coat he was wearing.</p>

<p>The man himself was worthy of notice, tall and dark, swarthy of
complexion, long, hatchet-shaped face, clean-shaven except for
small, black side-whiskers, eyes rather close together on either
side of a thin nose, humorous curl at the corners of his mouth.
Anyone in the neighbourhood&mdash;the village policeman,
especially&mdash;would have told you that he was Joe Cyster, that
his particular bent of sport was perfectly well known, but that it
was an exceedingly hard matter either to catch him in the act or to
find, on searching him, that he carried any proof of his nefarious
occupation, in the way of snares or spoils. Joe Cyster was a very
astute man&mdash;and he knew it.</p>

<p>It was about eight o'clock in the morning that he reached the
bottom of the valley. He had been out most of the night, and had a
keen appetite for breakfast. Nor was he going to wait for that meal
until he reached his cottage&mdash;two miles away, in the nearest
village. Before he made for home he meant to dispose of the
contents of his pockets&mdash;a hare, and four rabbits. The poacher
has his "fence" as well as the burglar, and the "fence," in this
particular instance, was Bill Alder, a mixture of village publican,
market-gardener and dealer, who made a journey three times a week
with his old pony-cart into the market town, and knew how to
dispose of sundry birds and rabbits where no questions would be
asked.</p>

<p>But Joe Cyster was not worrying about his breakfast. For the
simple reason that it was close at hand, where he had deposited it
on starting his rounds. Making his way into the recesses of the
grove of yews, he came to his hiding-place, and took, from the
hollow trunk of one of the trees, first a workman's basket, then
the square top of an old biscuit-tin, and, finally, a tin can.</p>

<p>And a very good breakfast he had, too: collecting dried sticks,
he soon had a fire, boiled water in the tin can, throwing
in&mdash;from a screw of paper&mdash;some tea, put the biscuit-tin
lid on the fire embers, produced a dab of butter and a couple of
rashers of bacon from his basket, and fried them carefully in that
old square of tin. A hunch of bread completed the
meal&mdash;followed by that most delightful of all smokes&mdash;the
after-breakfast pipe.</p>

<p>He sat, his back against the old tree-trunk, if not exactly at
peace with the world&mdash;so far as it contained men in blue and
gamekeepers&mdash;at all events quite at peace with himself. And
yet all the time, he was on the alert. His ear was quick to detect
the slightest sound.</p>

<p>One such sound drew his attention. He heard the soft fluttering
of a bird's wings&mdash;then silence&mdash;then the cooing of a
wild pigeon. He turned his head slightly, peering in the direction
of the sound, through the foliage. Pigeons had attractions for him,
but he had left at home a certain handy little rook and rabbit
rifle which could be detached into two parts and put into one of
his deep pockets. As he looked, his gaze strayed lower, through the
undergrowth.</p>

<p>Here and there the rays of the ascending sun penetrated gaps in
the foliage, and he saw something very bright and shining through
the masses of green. At once he got up and made his way to the
spot, to find, in a moment or two, that the light shone reflected
from nickel silver plating on the radiator of a motor-car.</p>

<p>The car stood in a small, open clearing in the midst of the
grove of yews. And stood quite by itself. There was no sign of
anyone there.</p>

<p>Joe Cyster, knew, perfectly well, that occasionally cars made
their way into Yew Tree Bottom for picnic purposes, but he had
never known one there at such an early hour in the morning. And he
was curious.</p>

<p>Detective-Sergeant Mentmore, had he been present, would have
been interested, from a professional point of view, in the
poacher's movements. Joe Cyster laid his hand on the car's bonnet.
It was cold. Then he noted its tracks&mdash;how it had been driven
in under the trees from the open sward outside&mdash;he could see
the marks of the wheels on the turf&mdash;driven straight in and
left there.</p>

<p>The poacher, by virtue of his calling, might now have given
points to Mentmore. He was an expert in all matters relating to the
open. It did not take him long to find that whoever had driven the
car there had walked away from it through the wood. Rank grass,
trodden, and brushed in one direction, a freshly-broken
bramble-branch showed him this. He followed the track unerringly to
the edge of the grove. Dew had fallen in the night, and, outside,
the grass was still damp&mdash;especially where it was in the
shade.</p>

<p>A single set of footsteps on the grass&mdash;going away from the
wood. Out in the open, where the sun had dried the dew, he could
trace them no further. Hastily he skirted the wood, where the dew
was still lying, on either side of the outgoing tracks. But there
were no returning footsteps.</p>

<p>Whoever he was who had left his tracks on the grass, he had not
returned to the car. Moreover, he was not in sight. And, further,
when he had come down the hill a short time ago, he knew full well
that no one was in that valley&mdash;or on the slopes of the downs
around it.</p>

<p>It was not idle curiosity which prompted Joe Cyster to take
these observations and then to make his way back to the deserted
car. Joe Cyster's ideas of "meum and tuum" were fairly
lax&mdash;when opportunity served. He had no thoughts of running
off with the car itself&mdash;he couldn't have driven it to save
his life and he wouldn't have known what to have done with it if he
<i>could</i> have driven it&mdash;but a previous experience, when
he had come across a car standing on the roadside, its occupants
engaged in picking bluebells in a neighbouring wood, had taught him
that sometimes people leave in a car portable property that is
worth having.</p>

<p>In this particular case, however, there was not very much to be
found. A couple of rugs lay on the back seat, but they were old and
worn and not worth taking. He looked on the front seat. On the
extreme left of it, half hidden, for it had worked its way between
the edge of the cushion and the side of the car, was a patch of
white. A small pocket-handkerchief. He promptly annexed
this&mdash;small value, but it would come in handy for his
wife.</p>

<p>Then he found the receptacle for tools&mdash;and examined the
tools. Ah&mdash;that hammer would be useful&mdash;and the two
screwdrivers&mdash;also the screw spanner. He pocketed them. The
jack and the rest of the tools he left. A couple of sparking-plugs
he took. He knew what they were for, and he might sell them for the
price of a few pints of beer to young Willie Penfold, who had a
motor-bike. But it wasn't much of a haul.</p>

<p>On the two front doors were pockets. He felt in them. Three or
four maps, an "A.A." handbook, some rags, and&mdash;what was
this?</p>

<p>A flat, oval case covered with dark red leather. He opened it.
Lined with blue velvet, but empty. He gave an exclamation of
disgust, snapped the case shut again, and pitched it away, with a
vicious gesture. It went hurtling through leaves and branches, and
he heard it fall somewhere in the underwood.</p>

<p>Having collected and pocketed all the portable property that he
considered worth having, Joe Cyster made his preparations for the
homeward tramp. The biscuit-tin top, the tea tin, and a choice
collection of snares he put in the cache in the old tree-trunk. He
stamped out the still smouldering embers of the fire and kicked the
ashes, scattering them about. Then he took a final look at the car.
Among other things he read the registration number, casually
enough. The thing was no longer any concern of his, and he
certainly was not likely to talk to anyone about it.</p>

<p>Along the grass, as he walked away, he could trace the tracks of
the car, till the turf merged into the by-road. Even then there
were impressions, where dust lay. Finally, he reached the tarred
high-road, where all distinctive marks soon ceased.</p>

<p>A small public-house stood by the roadside a couple of hundred
yards or so outside the village, in strategic position to catch the
thirsty wayfarer or motorist before he came to a larger and more
attractive inn a little further on, in the village. It bore the
sign of the "Blue Lion." Before he came to it, Joe Cyster stopped,
looked carefully around, climbed a gate by the side of the road,
and, hidden behind the hedge, emptied his capacious pockets of the
four rabbits and the hare, putting them in an old, broken
culvert.</p>

<p>When he passed the "Blue Lion," Bill Alder, the landlord, was
standing at the door in his shirt-sleeves, hands in pockets, pipe
in mouth. He nodded to the poacher.</p>

<p>"Mornin', Joe," he ejaculated, without moving, and with no
apparent interest.</p>

<p>"Mornin'," replied Joe, tersely, passing on without stopping,
but jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the direction whence he
had just come. Whereupon Bill Alder winked, and, subsequently,
strolled along to that gate with an empty sack on his arm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Joe Cyster went on, reached his cottage, exchanged a
brief sentence or two with his wife, went straight to the bedroom,
took the tools, the sparking-plugs and the handkerchief out of
various pockets, and put them in a drawer; divested himself of
coat, waistcoat, boots and trousers, and incontinently got into bed
and was asleep in a few minutes. Be it remembered that he had been
up all night, and that dishonest toil earns repose quite as much as
honest work does.</p>

<p>Because of the variety of Joe Cyster's hours of work, the times
of the meals in his cottage varied also, and were not regular as
other men's. The breakfast he had eaten in Yew Tree Bottom was the
equivalent of "supper"; the meal to which he came downstairs later
on, about five o'clock, was a nondescript one. It was an excellent
meal, too&mdash;a nice juicy rump-steak with well-cooked
vegetables, followed by an appetising pudding and bread and cheese.
Mrs. Cyster was a good cook, and, often, they could afford to live
better than many of their neighbours whose work was of a more
honest variety.</p>

<p>The meal, however, was incomplete, and Joe glanced with interest
at the clock. It wanted malt liquor to wash it down, and malt
liquor, owing to the stern law of the realm, was not to be bought
before the happy hour of six. Like many working-men&mdash;for Joe
Cyster <i>did</i> work, after all&mdash;he preferred drinking his
beer as a separate course, and drinking it in the companionship of
his fellow-men in the place which was designed for the drinking of
it&mdash;the "Blue Lion." Thitherward, therefore, he bent his
steps, a few minutes before the clock struck the hour.</p>

<p>Destiny, however, was not going to permit Joe Cyster to order
his pint of beer at one minute after six that evening. He had
scarcely stepped outside his cottage when he met Price, the village
policeman; and the policeman stopped him.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Joe," he said; "I was just coming to see you."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Joe, with an air of injured innocence. "I
ain't done nothin'."</p>

<p>"Not so sure of that," retorted Price, with a broad grin. "You
were out all night, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"Can't a man take a stroll to get a breath o' fresh air without
you pokin' your nose into his business?"</p>

<p>"Fresh <i>air</i>," replied Price, "the sort of <i>air</i> you
were after had an 'h' in front of it, I reckon! But I don't want to
know anything about that&mdash;this time. I want to ask you a
question about something else, Joe."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The parson over at Frimley, near Chiltonbury, has had his
motorcar stolen in the night. There's a warning been issued to all
of us to make enquiries. Now, you didn't happen to see a car
anywhere&mdash;before it was light this morning?"</p>

<p>Joe Cyster thought swiftly.</p>

<p>"This here parson offering a reward, then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Pretty certain to give the fellow who traces his car something
for his trouble," replied the policeman. As yet he knew nothing
about the murder. His orders were simply to look out for a car,
number QV 5277, belonging to the Vicar of Frimley, containing two
men, and to detain anyone he might find with it.</p>

<p>"What sort of a car?" asked the wary Joe.</p>

<p>"Morris Oxford. Four-seater. Dark blue. Number QV 5277," he
replied, refreshing his memory from his notebook.</p>

<p>"QV," repeated Joe. "I forget the rest. But I reckon I do know
where a car is wi' those letters, a blue 'un, too. Look here, if I
tells you, will you see as I gets the credit of it&mdash;and no
questions asked as to how I come to be where it is?"</p>

<p>"You've got to tell me, anyway, now, Joe," said Price, sharply.
"All right," he went on, with a grin, "you needn't get the wind up
about yourself. I won't ask you any questions about that. Where did
you see the car? In which direction was it going?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't goin' nowhere," replied Joe Cyster; "leastways, not
when I saw it last&mdash;'bout half-past nine this mornin'. 'Twas
standin' still in the middle o' the old wood down at Yew Tree
Bottom."</p>

<p>"Anyone with it?"</p>

<p>"Didn't see no one."</p>

<p>"And you left it there?"</p>

<p>"Well, it warn't mine, was it? O' course I left it there."</p>

<p>"Then I'll get my bike out and go and have a look. I'll 'phone
first to Chiltonbury, though. I wish you'd spotted who was in her,
Joe."</p>

<p>"He'd made off, seemin'ly."</p>

<p>"He?" repeated the policeman. "How do you know there weren't
more?"</p>

<p>Joe Cyster laughed, a short little laugh, and looked pityingly
at the policeman.</p>

<p>"How do I know there was only one of 'em? Why, I got eyes, ain't
I? I saw the tracks he made a-goin' out o' the wood. And there was
only one set of 'em."</p>

<p>"In which direction?"</p>

<p>"He was headin' straight for Bow Hill when he left the wood. But
there warn't no tracks as soon as he got on the dry grass, and the
Lord knows if he kep' on in the same direction."</p>

<p>"If he did&mdash;Bow Hill, you say? Why, that would take him
into Linderton."</p>

<p>"Ah, that's right&mdash;if he kept straight on. Well, that's all
I knows about it, and I wants to get a glass at the Blue Lion now.
You won't forget to tell this parson as how I found the
car&mdash;if 'tis his?"</p>

<p>"That'll be all right," said Price, turning on his heel and
heading for the village Post Office, where he rang up the
police-station at Chiltonbury. The reply, from the sergeant in
charge, was terse, but to the point.</p>

<p>"Very well, Price. Get your bicycle and run out to that car,
sharp. And stay there till we send someone. Don't touch it, and if
anyone comes along, keep 'em away from it. Linderton, you say? I'll
ring up the station there. Off you go!"</p>

<p>In about an hour Detective-Sergeant Mentmore arrived at Yew Tree
Bottom in the police-car, a man with a camera seated beside him.
They found Price on guard, a little tired of his lonely vigil. But
when Mentmore told him there was something more in the case than a
stolen and abandoned car, he became keen enough.</p>

<p>The photographer carefully dusted, with a light powder, the
steering-wheel, handles of brake and clutch lever, door-handles,
starting-crank, and bonnet. Only on the latter, however, were there
any finger-prints, and he proceeded to photograph them. Meanwhile,
the detective-sergeant asked Price:</p>

<p>"This poacher chap who found the car&mdash;he didn't take
anything out of her?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of."</p>

<p>"Didn't you ask him?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;sergeant&mdash;I didn't think of it."</p>

<p>"You should have. But I'll see him myself. Now let's have a
look." Very carefully he examined the interior of the car, going
over every part. But found nothing of interest. He turned to Price
again. "You say this poacher&mdash;what's his name?"</p>

<p>"Cyster."</p>

<p>"Cyster. Yes. He told you he found tracks going out of the wood
in the direction of Bow Hill. Let's see if we can find 'em."</p>

<p>Sharp-eyed as he was, he found it none too easy to mark the
tracks which Cyster, with his knowledge of woodcraft, had seen so
plainly. By this time, of course, outside the wood the turf was
quite dry. There were one or two heel-marks. That was all.</p>

<p>"You're sure Cyster said only one person seemed to have gone out
of the wood?"</p>

<p>"That's right, sergeant."</p>

<p>"It's queer, too. There were two men in the car when she started
from Frimley Manor."</p>

<p>Price essayed to show his sagacity.</p>

<p>"Seems to me," he said, "one of 'em must have got out before the
other ran the car in here."</p>

<p>"Regular Sherlock Holmes, aren't you?" bantered Mentmore.
"You'll be one of the Big Five at Scotland Yard one day, Price.
Now, look here. They&mdash;or he&mdash;would leave Frimley shortly
before two. Give him an hour&mdash;or an hour and a half to get
here&mdash;say half-past three. You know the country better than I
do. Tell me what you think?"</p>

<p>Price tilted his helmet back on his head.</p>

<p>"Well, sergeant, I should think he knew the country about here,
too,&mdash;or he'd never have driven in here."</p>

<p>"Brilliant!" snapped Mentmore. "Absolutely brilliant! But go
on."</p>

<p>"In that case, sergeant, if he was making for Linderton, he'd go
straight across yonder, and up the side of Bow Hill. Half-way up
there's a grass track that winds over the hill and down the other
side till it joins the road from Heathdean to Linderton. Take him,
at a fair rate, a matter of an hour and a quarter, or more."</p>

<p>"That's better," said Mentmore. "Getting daylight by then. Well,
I hope Linderton may get a line on the beggar. It's a chance. Now,
before we go, we'll have a thorough look round the car: you take
that side, Price&mdash;I'll try this."</p>

<p>It was Price who found the jewel-case. Mentmore examined it.</p>

<p>"Answers to the description," he said. "Well, that clinches the
connection of the two crimes. Empty, of course. It would be! Shows
we're on the right track. Finished with those photos?"</p>

<p>"There's only one&mdash;the prints on the bonnet," said the man
with the camera. "Yes, I've done now."</p>

<p>"That's probably Joe Cyster's hand," said Price. "He said he
felt the bonnet to see if it was warm."</p>

<p>"Damn!" exclaimed Mentmore. "All the trouble for nothing, I
expect. I'll take his prints and compare them. Now," he went on to
the photographer, "you get away back to Chiltonbury in our car and
make your report to the Super. Take that jewel-case. I'll drive the
Morris to Frimley Vicarage and settle the question of
identification with the Vicar&mdash;then I'll get into Chiltonbury
as soon as I can&mdash;by 'bus, if there's no one to run me in.
Now, Price, hoist that bicycle of yours into the back of the Morris
and I'll drive you home. I want a word with Cyster."</p>

<p>Joe Cyster was engaged, in the innocent occupation of gardening,
in front of his cottage. Mentmore proceeded to put him through a
catechism. But he never wavered. He had come across that
car&mdash;accidentally. Had he touched it? Yes&mdash;as he had told
Price, he had felt it to see if it was warm. It wasn't. Nothing
else? Of course not. Not taken anything out of it? Certainly not.
He was an honest man, he hoped.</p>

<p>Price, who was standing by, chortled. Mentmore said sharply:
"Very well. Now I want to take your finger-prints, my man." Cyster
shot a furtive glance at the detective-sergeant out of those dark
eyes of his.</p>

<p>"What the...what for, guv'nor?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't get the wind up. I only want to make sure it
was your marks we found on the bonnet."</p>

<p>Cyster submitted, sullenly, to the operation. He was not fond of
over-close dealings with the police. In the back of his mind he had
a hazy suspicion that the possession of those finger-prints of his
might be used as evidence against him some time or other. He even
suggested something of the kind.</p>

<p>Mentmore laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, we know <i>you</i>, my friend&mdash;without any need of
records. So long as you keep your hands off non-perishable goods,
<i>this</i> won't make any difference."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Cyster, as Mentmore prepared to depart, "ain't
I go get nothin' out o' this job? This here parson&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, all right. You've been a bit useful to us, I admit,
and I'll let the parson know you found his car. Anything else is a
matter between you and him, but the best reward he could give you
would be a sermon on keeping the Tenth Commandment. It goes
something like this&mdash;'Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's
hares, nor his rabbits, nor his pheasants.' Good evening, Cyster. I
daresay we may meet again!"</p>

<p>Mentmore ran the Morris back to Frimley and saw the Vicar, who
recognised his car at once. His satisfaction in getting it back,
however, was marred by his anxiety about his nephew.</p>

<p>"You say you found the case in which Mrs. Cresswell kept the
pearls?" he asked the detective-sergeant. "Close by?"</p>

<p>"We did, sir."</p>

<p>The Vicar shook his head.</p>

<p>"I <i>can't</i> think my nephew could have had anything to do
with it." Mentmore shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he said, "I can venture no opinion. But we've got
to try and find him."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," replied the Vicar sadly. "But, on thinking it
over, an idea has come into my head. Don't you think my nephew may
have been kidnapped&mdash;or that he was stopped, and the car taken
away from him?"</p>

<p>The sergeant smiled.</p>

<p>"That is an idea, sir," he said, in a non-committal tone of
voice. "Well, we shall see. Anyhow, we've got your Morris&mdash;and
none the worse for being run away with, I hope. And now I must get
into Chiltonbury. Here's the name and address of the man who found
your car."</p>

<p>Detective-Sergeant Mentmore was very tired and very sleepy when
he reported to the Superintendent that evening, but, before doing
so, he satisfied himself by comparing Cyster's finger-prints with a
recently-developed photograph of the prints on the bonnet of the
car, that they were the same. No clue there!</p>

<p>The Superintendent was also tired. Both men had had a long
day.</p>

<p>But they conferred together at some length, nevertheless. Kinch
wanted to know the result of the examination of the costumes.</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir. Two of 'em had gold lace on 'em&mdash;but
untorn."</p>

<p>"And those in the house?"</p>

<p>"Same result, sir. Only there's one costume I didn't see."</p>

<p>"Whose?"</p>

<p>The sergeant had his open notebook in his hand.</p>

<p>"Miss Fullinger's."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"A man's clothes, sir. She was acting as King Edward the Sixth
in the pageant. She brought the costume with her, and, you see, I
didn't know anything about it at first."</p>

<p>"And she's taken it back?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Before I could get hold of it."</p>

<p>"That's a pity."</p>

<p>"It's quite all right, sir. Miss Lynwood told me she'd hired it
from Sparkson's&mdash;the theatrical people. I 'phoned them. I
thought that was the best thing to do. They'll keep it back for us
to have a look when Miss Fullinger returns it&mdash;without
unpacking it."</p>

<p>"Good. Now, there's another queer thing come to light. We
carried out the Major's suggestion&mdash;I told you, you know?"</p>

<p>Mentmore nodded.</p>

<p>"Well, he was right. Both number-plates of that derelict car at
Drifford have come in. They were found on the railway embankment,
by the down-track, about a mile this side of Drifford. SB 1852 was
the number."</p>

<p>"You've enquired, sir?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. But it doesn't help us. SB 1852 is owned by a doctor
in Chichester."</p>

<p>"Missing?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. The car&mdash;a Hillman&mdash;was in the
doctor's garage when they made enquiries there. That's what the
Chichester Super 'phoned me."</p>

<p>"Faked number, of course," said Mentmore. "And not so much of a
coincidence as it looks. If you take a two-letter four-figure
registration, you'll as likely as not hit on the identical
combination of somebody else's car. It's already being said there
won't be enough combinations to go round with increasing output.
But, of course, it shows&mdash;?" And he raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Exactly," and Kinch tapped a Bradshaw on his desk. "There's
only one down-train from Drifford to Chiltonbury after
eleven-thirty&mdash;stops at Drifford at 12:54 and gets here at
1:13. They must have been thrown out of that train. The snag is
that if the beggar had anything to do with the case, he couldn't
have walked out to Frimley in time. And I know he didn't hire a
car. I've seen to that."</p>

<p>"And the station?"</p>

<p>"I went there myself. When the 1:13 came in there was only one
porter on duty, and the ticket-collector. Neither of them noticed
anything. The ticket-collector says about a dozen people came out
of the station, but he was very vague about them. There was
something else I found out at the station."</p>

<p>"What was that, sir?"</p>

<p>"Captain Bristow was nosing around there this
morning&mdash;after I'd run him in."</p>

<p>Mentmore whistled.</p>

<p>"Did <i>he</i> want to know about the passengers of that last
down-train, sir?"</p>

<p>"He did <i>not</i>. He was asking about the last train
up&mdash;the 11:23 from here."</p>

<p>"What did he ask?"</p>

<p>"If the train ran to time&mdash;and how many minutes before its
arrival it was signalled from the previous block."</p>

<p>Mentmore laughed, shortly.</p>

<p>"A dark horse, sir...in more ways than one, maybe," he added,
slowly.</p>

<p>"How do you make that out?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, we've only got his word for the way he discovered
things last night. It isn't corroborated in any way. How do we know
he went to his room when Mr. Charles Lynwood and the other two left
the house?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I don't know, Mentmore. There&mdash;I can't say. But I
do think he's worth observing, especially if he's trying to ferret
out things on his own."</p>

<p>And then Mentmore, who had been smoking his pipe thoughtfully
for a few seconds, suddenly said:</p>

<p>"You say this fellow&mdash;whoever he was&mdash;who might have
got off the train here at 1:13 this morning hadn't time to get out
to Frimley but suppose the Vicar's nephew had run in here and taken
him out in his uncle's car, sir?"</p>

<p>"I know," replied Kinch, nodding his head, slowly. "I'd thought
of that. But, again, there's a snag. How could Mr. Curtis, the
Vicar's nephew, tell the other had broken down in his car?"</p>

<p>"Telephone?"</p>

<p>"No. I've made enquiries at the Exchange. No one was put through
to Frimley Vicarage last night."</p>

<p>"Good Lord, sir&mdash;my head's getting in a maze. I'll be off
and turn in."</p>

<p>"One moment," said Kinch. "You're going out to Frimley
tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Not quite sure yet."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway,&mdash;see if the Vicar sets his speedometer when
he garages his car. We might find out how far that Morris ran last
night, and whether the mileage tallies with the distance to Yew
Tree Bottom&mdash;and your run back. Good night."</p>

<h2>Chapter 7</h2>

<p>The dinner at Frimley Manor that evening was rather a contrast
to the hilarious meal of the night before. Murder and robbery had
cast a gloom over the depleted household. Mrs. Cresswell was much
subdued. Her husband, who was staying the night at the Manor, had
arrived in the afternoon, and had evidently talked to his wife
seriously. He looked as if he was able to do this. He was a
massive, slow-moving man, with iron-grey hair and small moustache,
keen, rather hard, grey eyes, and determined-looking mouth, one of
those men who can be exceedingly masterful in a quiet, deliberate
way.</p>

<p>The Lynwoods knew perfectly well that he had always taken
exception to his wife's rather careless methods where valuable
jewelry was concerned, and that he would not have sanctioned her
flaunting those pearls at the pageant. In fact, she had told them
she was glad her husband had not been present, as he would probably
have made a fuss about it. The necklace had, originally, belonged
to his mother, and although he had given it to his wife, he was
very particular about the occasions when she wore it.</p>

<p>Exactly what he had said to Mrs. Cresswell none of the Lynwood
family knew. If he had delivered a lecture, he had done so in
privacy. But, anyhow, Mrs. Cresswell had lost that gay, sprightly
manner of the evening before. No wonder. The theft of her pearls,
followed by what her husband had to say about it, was enough to
damp any woman's vivacity.</p>

<p>Not that, at dinner, Mr. Cresswell had anything to say about the
necklace. He, for the most part, talked politics and finance with
Sir Harry. In fact, very little allusion was made, at the meal,
either to the robbery or the murder. By tacit consent, these
subjects were avoided.</p>

<p>Charles Lynwood had come back from London, arriving only just in
time to change for dinner. A gloom seemed to have settled upon him,
as well as upon Mrs. Cresswell, for he hardly spoke, and, when he
did so, it was only to answer others in a few brief sentences. More
than once Bristow glanced at him, keenly, across the table.</p>

<p>After Anstice Lynwood and Mrs. Cresswell had left the room, the
men lingered for a short time over port and coffee. Mr. Cresswell
moved up to his host, and continued their discussion over the
political situation and its effects on finance&mdash;Mr. Cresswell
was a prominent City man, and talked with authority. Harry Lynwood
came round the table to be near Bristow, and golf formed the staple
subject of their conversation. Charles sat, silent for the most
part, fidgeting with his wine-glass and smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>Presently a move was made, and the five men strolled into the
hall. It was still daylight, a warm, still evening. The hall door
stood wide open and the women's voices could be heard outside.
Anstice, who was seated on the terrace just in front of the door,
looked over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"We're out here, daddy. There are plenty of chairs&mdash;it's
much too stuffy indoors."</p>

<p>"Come along, then," said Sir Harry to Mr. Cresswell and Bristow.
"We'll go outside."</p>

<p>As they moved out Bristow glanced at the sedan-chair. It had
been replaced in its old position in a corner of the hall, its
carrying-poles withdrawn, and leaning against the wall. To
Bristow's mind the beautiful antique had become sinister. Two men
had given up their lives, seated in that old chair. And there was a
mystery over the second of the two. If the chair could only give
evidence&mdash;!</p>

<p>The sinister appearance of the sedan-chair must have struck
Charles Lynwood as well. He, too, looked at it as he made his way
to the door, frowned slightly, and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Outside, garden chairs were on the stone terrace. One by one the
men seated themselves. Sir Harry moved a chair close to Mrs.
Cresswell, and began talking to her. Anstice motioned Charles to
come near her. Mr. Cresswell stood, cigar in mouth, apparently
admiring the view. Captain Bristow strolled a little way along the
terrace, and took a chair slightly apart from the rest. As soon as
he had done so Mr. Cresswell promptly joined him, bringing a chair
close to his.</p>

<p>"I wanted a word with you," he began, coming straight to the
point at once. "Sir Harry has told me about you, I hear it was
owing to you that the murder was discovered last night?"</p>

<p>"By mere chance&mdash;yes, it was."</p>

<p>"And I also hear that you are a professional, Captain
Bristow."</p>

<p>"A professional?"</p>

<p>"Sir Harry told me you had made a reputation in the Secret
Service."</p>

<p>"Very flattering of him. Oh, but my bit of work there was done
some years ago."</p>

<p>"Quite so. But I don't suppose you have lost your
interest&mdash;well, in criminology?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't suppose I have. But you must get rid of the
notion that I'm a professional any longer."</p>

<p>Mr. Cresswell laughed.</p>

<p>"It isn't likely," he said, "that a man of your experience would
get into touch with a crime like this&mdash;even by
chance&mdash;without his interest being excited. And I've no doubt
you've got some theories&mdash;from your own observation. I should
be interested to know what they are, if I may?"</p>

<p>Bristow paused for a moment, then replied:</p>

<p>"If you think I can suggest any clue to the recovery of your
wife's jewels, Mr. Cresswell, I'm afraid you will be disappointed.
One tries to think things out, naturally, but this affair is in the
hands of the police: not mine. You ought to consult them."</p>

<p>"I shall, of course. But I was wondering if you could give me
any hints."</p>

<p>Bristow lighted his pipe, and turned a little in his chair
towards Mr. Cresswell.</p>

<p>"I take it," he said, "that you are mostly interested in the
recovery of the necklace?"</p>

<p>"Naturally. Those pearls are of extreme value&mdash;not only
intrinsically, but as a family heirloom. What are your views on the
chances of getting them back?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could tell you. There's so little to go upon, as yet.
The police have not taken me into their confidence&mdash;and, of
course, there is no reason why they should."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man is this Superintendent who has charge of the
case?"</p>

<p>"A first-rate man, Mr. Cresswell. I happen to have heard
something about him. You may rest assured that the case couldn't be
in better hands&mdash;even if Scotland Yard were called in.
Superintendent Kinch had a good record before he came to
Chiltonbury. The Chief Constable of the County, Major Bainbridge,
has the knack of getting hold of good men&mdash;and Kinch is
one."</p>

<p>"Humph! I suppose he will be all the more keen to recover my
wife's property because the theft is mixed up with the murder?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," replied Mr. Cresswell, "one must hope for the best,
I suppose. I can't see there is any more that I can do."</p>

<p>"You can offer a reward for the recovery of the necklace. It's
often a very strong incentive, you know. It sometimes means
recovery of valuables quite apart from the efforts of the
police."</p>

<p>Mr. Cresswell puffed thoughtfully at his pipe.</p>

<p>"Of course I'd thought of that," he replied, after a short
pause, "though I much dislike the idea. It always seems to me to be
condoning blackmail. A fellow steals your goods, and you pay him to
get them back."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," said Bristow, with a laugh, "it's a question of
value, isn't it? I should have thought it would pay you to offer a
few hundreds for what is worth thousands to you."</p>

<p>"A few hundreds!" He frowned. "I don't want to throw
away&mdash;Oh, confound it!"</p>

<p>"But it wouldn't be throwing it away if you got the necklace
back, would it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose not," replied Mr. Cresswell, shortly. There was a
pause. Neither man seemed inclined to pursue the subject. Captain
Bristow puffed, lazily, at his pipe. Then he said:</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry for Mrs. Cresswell. It's frightfully rough on
her."</p>

<p>"She ought to have been more careful," replied Mr. Cresswell,
frowning slightly.</p>

<p>"Wasn't she?"</p>

<p>"Never. Unfortunately. I've warned her over and over again about
taking ordinary care of that necklace."</p>

<p>"And you couldn't do anything?"</p>

<p>Mr. Cresswell glanced at him sharply. But Bristow was lounging
lazily, his eyes half closed.</p>

<p>"How could I? You know what women are. My wife's one of the
best, but I never could get her to appreciate the risks she ran."
Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"So you gave it up?"</p>

<p>"I gave it up."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid this will be a severe lesson to her."</p>

<p>"It <i>will</i>!"</p>

<p>And there was almost a gleam of humour in his eyes&mdash;the
satisfaction that comes, even in exasperating circumstances, of
saying, "I told you so."</p>

<p>"Hullo!" exclaimed Harry Lynwood at that moment, raising his
voice. "Here's the Vicar. Anything fresh happened, I wonder."</p>

<p>The Vicar came walking across the lawn, greeting the little
group on the terrace.</p>

<p>"I thought I must come round to let you know," he began. "My car
has been found. The police brought it back to me this evening."</p>

<p>"Oh, where did they find it?"</p>

<p>"Sit down, Vicar, and tell us all about it."</p>

<p>"Was anyone with it?"</p>

<p>"How did they find it?"</p>

<p>The chorus of excited questions died down. They gathered round
the Vicar while he told them the story.</p>

<p>"They found your jewel-case, too, Mrs. Cresswell," he added,
"lying under the trees close to the car. It was empty,
unfortunately."</p>

<p>"Nothing else?"</p>

<p>"No. Nothing. The sergeant who drove the car back to me told me
they searched it carefully, but there was nothing to go upon except
the jewel-case. That proves, of course, that the jewels were taken
away in the car."</p>

<p>"You must be glad to get it back," said Anstice.</p>

<p>"I am, of course. But&mdash;" and he shook his head. "It hasn't
relieved my chief anxiety&mdash;about my nephew."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Charles Lynwood.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot," said Sir Harry, "you'd left this morning before
the Vicar came&mdash;and&mdash;" he paused.</p>

<p>"It's common property," said the Vicar, sadly. "One can't stop
servants gossiping, and it's all over the village by this time that
my nephew was out in my car last night. I can't make it out."</p>

<p>"Your nephew, Vicar?&mdash;what, Curtis?" asked Charles.</p>

<p>The Vicar told him.</p>

<p>"You remember him, of course," he went on, speaking still to
Charles Lynwood. "He was with me for a week last summer, and came
with us to that picnic at Camley Towers."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember," said Anstice. "Sonia was staying with us,
you know, Charlie. And they were absolutely mad; they would climb
up that rackety old ruin."</p>

<p>Charlie frowned.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, to his sister, then turned again to the
Vicar.</p>

<p>"And Leonard Curtis was here&mdash;last night?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so," said the Vicar. "I can't make it out at all."
Charlie did not reply. He lighted a cigarette and began
smoking&mdash;fast. The Vicar went on talking about his car.</p>

<p>"I must send the man who found it a small reward," he remarked.
"The police tell me he's a poacher and was probably engaged in his
lawless pursuits at the time. I own I feel inclined to condone with
him. For he's done me a good turn."</p>

<p>"The car wasn't damaged in any way?" asked Bristow.</p>

<p>"Not a bit. The only thing is that some of the tools are
missing, and I fancy a couple of new sparking-plugs should have
been there&mdash;but they were not."</p>

<p>"What tools?" asked Bristow.</p>

<p>"A hammer, two screwdrivers and a screw-spanner&mdash;a useful
tool I valued."</p>

<p>"Oh!" replied Bristow, thoughtfully. "Did you tell the
detective-sergeant?"</p>

<p>"No. It was after he had gone that I found out. He did say that
he'd asked Cyster&mdash;the poacher fellow&mdash;if he had taken
anything out of the car. But the man declared he hadn't. Well, I
must be going. We shall meet at the inquest tomorrow, Sir Harry.
Good night."</p>

<p>Captain Bristow got up from his chair, but, instead of saying
good night to the Vicar, began walking with him away from the
house, across the lawn.</p>

<p>"You've roused my interest, Vicar," he said. "I wonder whether
you'll mind my suggesting something?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course not."</p>

<p>"You said you were going to give this man Cyster a reward?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I&mdash;er&mdash;suppose two or three pounds would be
enough?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;ample. I'd rather like to see him&mdash;and this
place, Yew Tree Bottom. If I can borrow a car here directly after
breakfast tomorrow, I'll run over&mdash;you say it's only twenty
miles. And, if you like, I'd take your gift to Cyster. Save you the
trouble of sending it."</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you. But why not have my car, Bristow? I
shan't be using it tomorrow morning."</p>

<p>"Thanks very much. I'll take it, then&mdash;about nine. Good
night, Vicar."</p>

<p>"Good night."</p>

<p>When Bristow returned to the terrace, the others were just
preparing to go indoors. The little party broke up. Anstice went
with Mrs. Cresswell into the drawing-room, while the latter's
husband was taken off by Harry Lynwood to the billiard-room. Sir
Harry said he had letters to write, and went into the library.
Bristow and Charles Lynwood sought the smoking-room.</p>

<p>For the first few minutes Charlie, who appeared to be a little
ill-at-ease, skipped from one subject of conversation to
another&mdash;cricket scores in the evening paper&mdash;his London
club&mdash;the matine, a revue, he had been to see that
day&mdash;the chances of birds in the autumn&mdash;anything,
Bristow noticed, except the pageant, the murder, and the theft of
Mrs. Cresswell's jewels. Nor did Bristow help him out at all in
giving a lead, but sat quietly smoking, leaning back in his chair
with half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>But, as time went on, and the younger man made no attempt to
leave him, he felt sure that, sooner or later, Charlie would blurt
out something he wanted to say all the time. He had followed
Bristow to the smoking-room&mdash;it was his own choice.</p>

<p>Bristow waited patiently. After a somewhat lengthy silence,
Charlie suddenly fired a question at him.</p>

<p>"Look here, Roger, I suppose you're helping the police over this
beastly business?"</p>

<p>"Now, what makes you say that?" asked Bristow, very quietly.
"Well, you're more or less a policeman yourself."</p>

<p>"I <i>was</i>&mdash;in a way," assented Bristow.</p>

<p>"Well, of course they know that, and I suppose they've been
pretty thick with you&mdash;trying to use your brains, and all that
sort of thing."</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, Charlie, you're quite wrong. They haven't
taken me into their confidence, in the least, or told me more than
they've told the others here. I shouldn't even wonder if Kinch is
inclined to look upon me as a possibly suspicious person."</p>

<p>"You!" exclaimed Charlie, leaning forward. "What on earth makes
you think that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's quite reasonable," replied Bristow, with a laugh.
"They've only my own word for what I told them took place, to begin
with, and they have to keep an open mind. Come to think of it,
Charlie, I might easily have done it."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>Bristow shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll tell you. I had every opportunity of slipping into
Mrs. Cresswell's room and taking the key off the ring&mdash;you've
heard about that? And then, when you went out last night, I could
have got the pearls and, after your return, taken them out to that
nephew of the Vicar's&mdash;with whom I had previously made an
arrangement."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but the murder?"</p>

<p>"Quite simple. Hurst might have seen young Curtis lurking about
outside, and stayed to watch him&mdash;seen me come out, and
interfered, thinking something fishy was taking place. Then one of
us knocks him on the head and we stage that bit about finding him
in the sedan chair&mdash;to make more of a mystery of it. Off goes
young Curtis with the necklace, and I go back to the house and give
the alarm to deceive the police. The very fact that I said
<i>two</i> men went off in the car would only heighten
suspicion&mdash;only <i>one</i> man got out of her, so this poacher
fellow says."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" cried Charlie. "Why, at that rate, any of us might
come under suspicion?"</p>

<p>"Quite true," replied Bristow, calmly, "and probably have done
so."</p>

<p>"Even I?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;certainly <i>you</i>." retorted Bristow, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Captain Bristow turned in his chair and looked at Charlie. "Do
you want me to tell you?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I don't know&mdash;yes&mdash;if you like."</p>

<p>And he looked a little uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"All right, I will. Well, <i>you</i> were the last
person&mdash;except the Vicar&mdash;seen with Hurst, and the Vicar
went out at the side gate, leaving you two in the grounds. You
might have met young Curtis&mdash;by appointment&mdash;and knocked
Hurst on the head, between you. Then you might have slipped back
into the house and got the pearls&mdash;there was plenty of time
before I came down&mdash;and taken them out to Curtis. And you may
be sure that Kinch has noted the fact that you left the front door
unlocked&mdash;your explanation was a bit clumsy, you
know&mdash;and he might easily conjecture that you came back into
the house after I had gone out&mdash;and left the door unlocked
because you'd seen me and knew I should come in again. And this
morning you suddenly run away to London. We all know you had no
intention of doing so last night. Don't you think Kinch noted
<i>that</i>? I wouldn't mind betting you a fiver he had you
shadowed."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Charlie, his face paling a little. "Anything
else?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Something I don't think Kinch knows; but <i>I</i> do. You
hadn't undressed when I came into your room after the murder."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?&mdash;I was in bed."</p>

<p>"I know you were. But you took good care not to get out of it
while I was in the room. And when you came downstairs a few seconds
later, you'd got those white trousers strapped round your shoes.
You couldn't have put them on and done that in the time."</p>

<p>There was silence for a few moments. Charlie was staring at
Bristow. At last he said:</p>

<p>"After all, there was no harm in not taking off my clothes
directly I got in."</p>

<p>"Of course not. But the queer thing about it is that you didn't
want me to know you hadn't done so."</p>

<p>Then Charlie said:</p>

<p>"Are you going to tell the police this?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say I should, did I? But, you see, they know enough
already to make them keep their eye on you&mdash;the unlocked door,
and the running up to London, suddenly."</p>

<p>Charlie laid down his half-finished cigarette in an ash-tray. He
was still looking hard at Bristow.</p>

<p>"You don't mean you think I had anything to do with the damned
affair?"</p>

<p>Bristow looked at him sharply, shrugged his shoulders slightly,
and said:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I do think, Charlie."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That you know a dashed sight more about it than you've told the
police&mdash;or anyone else."</p>

<p>Charlie was playing nervously with a fresh cigarette he had
taken from his case.</p>

<p>"I'd nothing to do with it," he growled, after a slight
pause.</p>

<p>"I didn't say you had, but I can't help noticing
things&mdash;it's a habit born of experience. Of course, I've no
right to ask you any questions, but I can jolly well see you're
precious uncomfortable about something or other."</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;well, I'm a bit bothered," admitted Charlie.</p>

<p>Bristow waited. There was another short silence. Then Charlie
said: "I suppose if I told you you'd only say I ought to see the
police about it."</p>

<p>"Even if I did," answered Bristow, "that might be better by a
long shot than for them to find out&mdash;well, whatever it is, and
to know that you had been keeping it from them; better for you,
very likely, and certainly for any innocent person mixed up in
it."</p>

<p>"That's just it," Charlie blurted out. "And I'm perfectly
certain&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short. Captain Bristow waited.</p>

<p>"Look here, Roger. Can I trust you?"</p>

<p>"I hope I'm your friend."</p>

<p>"You won't tell this damned Superintendent&mdash;or any of his
men?" Bristow took one or two puffs at his pipe.</p>

<p>"You mustn't ask me to condone murder, Charlie," he said,
gravely, "but I certainly should not tell them unless I thought
justice demanded it. Even then, I should ask <i>you</i> to tell
them. My experience is that it isn't always wise to keep the police
in ignorance. They are the last people to wish to get any innocent
person into trouble. You must remember that even your damned
Superintendent is human."</p>

<p>"All right," answered Charlie. "I've simply <i>got</i> to tell
someone I can trust, and I know you're a sensible chap. I can't
tell any of my people, and I simply <i>won't</i> tell the police,
if I can help it. That's really the reason why I ran off today. I
was afraid Kinch or that detective-sergeant would start
cross-questioning me and pump it out of me. And I wanted to be
alone."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Bristow.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, it concerns someone&mdash;well, I may as well
say it&mdash;that I'm a bit keen on. And that's the trouble."</p>

<p>Bristow nodded.</p>

<p>"Better begin at the beginning&mdash;when you went out last
night to get your cigarettes," he said.</p>

<p>"Very well. You saw me go out with the Vicar and Hurst. The
Vicar said good night immediately, and turned off to the left to go
out through the back gate in the stable-yard. Hurst and I walked on
together for thirty or forty yards, and then he went off to the
right&mdash;down the carriage-drive. Before he said good
night&mdash;oh, but that doesn't matter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everything matters," interrupted Bristow. "Give me the smallest
details."</p>

<p>"Well, he tore off the moustache and small beard he was wearing,
and put them in his pocket."</p>

<p>"Did he say anything?"</p>

<p>"Only that he'd been wanting to get rid of them all the
evening&mdash;they were so frightfully hot and uncomfortable."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Bristow had taken out a notebook and was making pencilled
jottings in it. "Was that all?"</p>

<p>"Yes. So he went off. I walked on to the tent. You remember
there was a small table in the corner of it? I thought I'd left my
silver box of cigarettes on it, but it wasn't there. It was rather
dark inside, you know&mdash;not quite, for there was a little
moonlight. It must have taken me several minutes to find the
cigarettes, and I finally did so on the table in the ladies'
dressing-room part of it. The girls must have collared them."</p>

<p>"Did you strike a match?"</p>

<p>"Not then. I was going to, but found I'd only one left&mdash;and
I wanted a smoke. That's what kept me so long. I had to blunder
about in the semi-darkness. When I did find the box I used up my
one match&mdash;there and then&mdash;in lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Well, I came out of the tent, but I wasn't in a hurry. I'd had
a bit of a headache, and I was enjoying the fresh air. So I
strolled about."</p>

<p>"Where? Towards the bridge?"</p>

<p>"No. In the other direction&mdash;towards the stable-yard. I
noticed the double gates leading into the yard were open&mdash;the
Vicar had gone that way, you know. Dad is a bit particular about
having them kept shut at night, so I thought I'd close
them&mdash;for want of anything better to do.</p>

<p>"I reached the gates&mdash;it must have been quite a little
while after I had left the tent; I'd been strolling in a
round-about way, you see. Anyhow, I'd about finished my cigarette,
and I chucked the stump away. I happened to turn round just then.
And the moon had half broken through the clouds, so that you could
see things quite plainly. And I saw someone coming from the house
and crossing the lawn. I want you to understand that, at that
moment, I was just inside the stable-yard, and saw this over the
wall. The wall's about five feet high. So that all that was visible
of me was my head."</p>

<p>"Did you see who it was?"</p>

<p>"Not for a moment or two. Then I did. The moonlight brightened
still more. Roger, it was&mdash;Sonia Fullinger!"</p>

<p>"<i>Sonia!</i>"</p>

<p>Charlie nodded.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;I wasn't mistaken. I wish I had been. It was
Sonia right enough, still wearing that Edward the Sixth's
dress&mdash;cap and all. Why, I could even see the gold lace on her
little cape shining in the moonlight&mdash;you remember it? She'd
got something in her hand&mdash;but I couldn't see what it was. I
was some little distance away, you know."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course I was a bit dithered. Anyone would have been,
seeing a girl coming out of the house in the dead of night. Then
the idea took hold of me that perhaps she was walking in her sleep.
I think that must have kept me from calling out. Doesn't do
suddenly to alarm a sleep-walker, you know. Anyhow, I <i>didn't</i>
shout, and I was just coming out of the stable-yard to make for
her, when she stopped, and waved a handkerchief."</p>

<p>"Waved a handkerchief!"</p>

<p>"Well, at all events it was something white. You couldn't
mistake it.</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Things got still queerer. Some fellow came along&mdash;he must
have been waiting by the bridge, for he came up the drive and
across the lawn. Pretty fast, too."</p>

<p>Captain Bristow whistled.</p>

<p>"By George!" he said. "What did you do?"</p>

<p>"I was a damned fool, Roger. I did nothing. Only kept behind the
wall and acted the spy. I was in a blinking rage&mdash;that was
what was the matter with me. Sonia and I were pals, you
see&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;I was going to ask her to be
something more than a pal to me, and here she was, meeting some
damn fellow at half-past one in the morning&mdash;meeting him by
appointment, too. Can't you understand what I felt? I was just mad
with jealousy, I suppose. Something more than jealousy, too. Pretty
thick to see the girl you love go out to meet a man in the middle
of the night when she's staying in your own house. I was sort of
choking&mdash;and it wasn't all jealousy, Roger. It was something a
bit stronger than that."</p>

<p>"Poor old Charlie!" murmured Bristow, sympathetically. "Tell me.
What happened, next?"</p>

<p>"They went into the tent together&mdash;that's what happened.
And that's all I saw. I'd had enough of it, old man. I thought,
anyhow, she shouldn't see me sleuthing her&mdash;and I didn't want
to sleuth her, either. I slipped along behind those shrubs on the
left of the house, got on the terrace, and made for the front door.
Then I let myself in, as quietly as possible. I noticed the light
in the hall was out. I suppose she put it out when she came
downstairs&mdash;thought someone had left it on by mistake. And, of
course, I didn't lock the front door&mdash;I couldn't lock her out,
could I? Now you know why I didn't go to bed. When you knocked on
my door, I thought it was someone come to tell me Sonia was
missing, or something of that kind, and I didn't want anyone to
think that I knew anything about it. I told you, too, that I ran up
to London to get away from the police&mdash;but it wasn't only
that. I didn't want to see Sonia again, and I knew she would be
going home today, so I made a bolt of it early to keep out of her
way."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, old man."</p>

<p>"Pretty rotten, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Bristow nodded.</p>

<p>"It is."</p>

<p>"And there's something more, Roger. Something I never thought of
till Anstice dropped a remark on the terrace just now. Something
that fits in with the rest of the wretched affair. That's Leonard
Curtis, the damned young swine. You heard Anstice say that he was
with us on that picnic last summer&mdash;and Sonia, too. And that
they climbed those ruins? That wasn't all. They went off together,
for a couple of hours or so. I was beastly jealous at the time. I'd
had a bit of a tiff with Sonia in the morning&mdash;and that didn't
make me feel better. You can see it now, can't you? They've been
palling up together&mdash;and that's why he came here last night. I
wouldn't even mind that so much&mdash;but that ass of a woman's
damned pearls&mdash;and poor Hurst. What are we to do, Roger?"</p>

<p>Bristow blew a cloud of smoke, shook his head, and said,
slowly:</p>

<p>"Wait a bit, my boy. It doesn't fit in so closely as you say.
How about the <i>two</i> men who went off in the car? Besides, I've
other notions about young Curtis. And <i>they</i> don't fit in.
No&mdash;I'm not going to tell you what they are. Pure conjecture
at present. But look here, Charlie. The whole thing looks pretty
black, I know. But do you remember what we were talking about last
night with the Vicar and that poor devil, Hurst&mdash;the perfect
criminal and the infallible detective? Well, you've also got to
test your <i>clues</i> and find if <i>they</i> are perfect or
infallible. I want to ask you a plain question. I know Sonia
Fullinger a bit, and you know her pretty well. Granting that she
was out there last night, do you believe that she connived, first
at robbery, and then at murder?"</p>

<p>"I'm damned if I want to believe it."</p>

<p>"Of course you don't."</p>

<p>"But the worst of it is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know. But it's fatal to jump to conclusions without
all the evidence. I haven't thought it over yet, of course, but, on
the spur of the moment I could give you an explanation that almost
exonerates Sonia&mdash;though not quite."</p>

<p>Charlie looked at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"I'm not saying there is anything in it," went on Bristow. "I'm
only giving you an instance to show we must be certain of our
facts. Well, it's this. Mrs. Cresswell is a pretty rash
bridge-player, isn't she? And likes high points. And she let out at
luncheon yesterday that she dabbles on the Stock Exchange and hopes
her husband doesn't know. Women who do these things often get into
a nasty fix and want a good round sum to get out of it. And that
sometimes means having to sell their jewelry. But Mrs. Cresswell
daren't sell that necklace in the ordinary way. Even if she kept
the transaction dark for a time, her husband would be sure, sooner
or later, to find out they were missing, and you can see she's a
bit afraid of him. So she plans a fake robbery. She is really
selling the pearls, but she wants to make it appear they have been
stolen. She takes Sonia into her confidence&mdash;they are pretty
intimate, you know,&mdash;and they come down here together. It's a
splendid opportunity&mdash;flaunting the pearls about in public,
and, all the time, arranging for some agent to run down and receive
them under cover.</p>

<p>"Sonia takes him out the pearls and goes back to the house.
After all, it isn't exactly a <i>crime</i>. Mrs. Cresswell is
selling what belongs to her. But something goes wrong. Hurst
appears on the scene. Why, or how, we can't tell yet, but, for all
we know, <i>he</i> may have been a genuine crook and have had his
own plans with regard to that necklace. He gets knocked on the
head&mdash;anyway. And they try to take him off the scene in the
car, probably to get him out of the way for the time being. They
would. Remember, he wasn't dead when they started with him. In the
morning Mrs. Cresswell raises the hullabaloo, and plays the part of
injured innocence&mdash;another little bit of acting. <i>Voil
tout</i>!"</p>

<p>"Gad!" exclaimed the younger man. "I shouldn't wonder if you've
hit it, Roger. Why not follow it up, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There you go!" broke in the other, with a laugh. "One plausible
theory, and centering everything on it. No, my boy, that's not the
way to investigate. Have your theories, if you like, but put your
facts first, otherwise your theories are pretty well bound to
distort those facts. I only wanted to show you how easy it is, in a
case of this kind, to jump to conclusions&mdash;just as you were so
ready to link up Sonia with young Curtis. If you'd studied some of
the facts, you might not have done that. But&mdash;to come back to
the said facts, and to leave theories alone for a while. Things
look ugly, I admit. You saw Sonia come out of the house, carrying
something in her hand&mdash;presumably the jewel-case, and meet
some man who went with her into the tent. You've confided this to
me&mdash;as a friend. Very well. I'll do my best to investigate
it&mdash;as a friend&mdash;if you want me to."</p>

<p>"It's frightfully decent of you, Roger."</p>

<p>"Only,"&mdash;and he held up a warning hand&mdash;"you must be
prepared to submit to any consequences&mdash;and they may be
precious nasty."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I see. I think I'd rather do that than have all this
uncertainty."</p>

<p>"And there's another thing. You've got to give evidence tomorrow
at the inquest. What are you going to tell the Coroner,
Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord! yes. I know. That's been bothering me, too. What the
deuce am I to do if the Coroner asks me leading questions?"</p>

<p>"You must answer them, my friend,&mdash;I'm afraid. But let me
think for a minute."</p>

<p>He smoked silently, his brows knit. Charlie Lynwood watched him
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Charlie," he said, presently. "Withholding
evidence is a very serious matter. But I'm willing to take the
risk."</p>

<p>"You?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I. I've got some sort of a reputation, I suppose, and if
it comes to a push, I can tell the Coroner that you were acting on
my advice. It's frequently done by the police when they confer with
the Coroner beforehand. They often want certain evidence kept back
till a later stage in the enquiry. It's quite certain that the
proceedings tomorrow will only be formal&mdash;enough to justify an
adjournment and to make out the Order for Burial. The <i>real</i>
reason for the adjournment is to give the police time to make
further enquiries, and they won't want much evidence just yet. They
don't know enough. Why, they don't even know who Hurst was. I'll
tell you what to do."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The Coroner will probably ask you to make a statement. Just say
that, after parting from Hurst, you found your cigarettes and went
back to the house. That's quite true. You might also volunteer the
information that you saw no one in the tent. That's true, too. If
he presses you with questions&mdash;why&mdash;you must answer him.
But I don't think he will."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"Because I fancy the police have an eye on you, my boy. And if
they have, they'll want to watch you a bit and catch you tripping.
I should, if I were Kinch. I shouldn't let on that I suspected you
in any way, and I should explain matters first to the Coroner. I
may be wrong, of course, but if Kinch is as wily as I imagine he
is, that's what he'll do. Yes!"</p>

<p>James came in with whisky, tumblers and a siphon&mdash;followed
by Harry Lynwood and Mr. Cresswell. Bristow glanced at Charlie
warningly. The men helped themselves to drinks; pipes and cigars
were lighted; and the conversation became general. Bristow was the
first to say good night. But, when he reached his room, he made no
attempt to undress. For over an hour he sat in an arm-chair,
notebook in hand. And, from time to time, he made entries. At
length he yawned.</p>

<p>"Can't see a way out, I admit," he said to himself; "but I have
found a few tacks to go upon&mdash;anyway."</p>

<p>And then he went to bed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 8</h2>

<p>Captain Bristow finished his breakfast early the next morning,
and made his way to the Vicarage. He found the Vicar in a state of
excitement.</p>

<p>"I've heard from Leonard&mdash;my nephew!" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>have</i> you? That's interesting. And what does he
say?"</p>

<p>"Not very much. Certainly not enough to relieve my anxiety. Only
a line on a postcard: here it is."</p>

<p>There was no address on the postcard. It read:</p>

<blockquote>"Sorry about your car, but I had to take her. Hope you
got her all right. Will write soon. In great haste.<br>
<br>
"Yrs,<br>
<br>
"LEONARD."</blockquote>

<p>Bristow turned the card over. The postmark was a London one:
"S.W. 1." district. He smiled.</p>

<p>"Not over-communicative, is he, Vicar?"</p>

<p>The Vicar shook his head.</p>

<p>"He never is&mdash;on paper. He dislikes letter-writing
exceedingly. What do you think of it, Bristow?"</p>

<p>Again Bristow smiled.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't worry too much, Vicar. Really, I shouldn't. But you
must show this to the police, you know."</p>

<p>The Vicar sighed.</p>

<p>"I suppose I must." He took two or three notes out of his
pocket-case. "Well, here you are, Bristow. Give this man Cyster
what you think is fair. It's extremely kind of you to take the
trouble to see him."</p>

<p>"Not at all. I'll be off, I think, now."</p>

<p>"Very well. We'll go to the garage."</p>

<p>Before he started the car Bristow looked at the dial of the
speedometer.</p>

<p>"Had you set it?" he asked the Vicar, "Before your nephew
collared the car, I mean?"</p>

<p>"No, I hadn't...let's see...Oh, there ought to be plenty of
petrol in her&mdash;I filled her up the day before yesterday." He
looked at the petrol-gauge. "Oh, yes. Just over three-and-a-half
gallons."</p>

<p>"How much does she hold?"</p>

<p>"Five gallons."</p>

<p>"And you say you filled her two days ago.&mdash;Used her
since?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"How many miles does she do to the gallon?"</p>

<p>"Not so much as she used to. I get about thirty-two out of
her&mdash;I had to fit a bigger jet this summer."</p>

<p>Bristow made a rapid calculation. He was just about to start the
car, when a voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Good morning, gentlemen."</p>

<p>They turned. Detective-Sergeant Mentmore was standing at the
entrance of the garage, in plain clothes.</p>

<p>"I called at your house, sir," he said to the Vicar, "and they
told me you were here. Are you taking your car out?"</p>

<p>"No. But Captain Bristow is. You've no objection, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least, sir." He glanced quickly at Bristow. "But I'm
glad I happened to come along first. Just a question. Did you set
the speedometer before&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"It's all right, sergeant," he said. "I was after that, too.
Curiosity, you know. The speedometer was not set, but the Vicar has
been telling me he filled the petrol-tank the day before yesterday.
She's used nearly one-and-a-half gallons, and she does thirty-two
to the gallon. That's roughly speaking, a little under forty-eight
miles. I've been looking at Yew Tree Bottom on the map. It's a
matter of twenty-miles&mdash;forty there and back," he went on,
dryly. "Got it now, sergeant?"</p>

<p>The sergeant had taken out his notebook, and was jotting the
figures down.</p>

<p>"That's quite all right, Captain Bristow," he said, also dryly.
"A useful bit of information. What do you deduce from it, sir?"
Bristow smiled affably.</p>

<p>"Probably the same as you," he retorted, "though there is more
than one way of looking at it. Possibly&mdash;later on&mdash;we may
compare notes. You don't want anything else&mdash;with the car,
now?"</p>

<p>"You're not going far, sir? You'll be back for the
inquest&mdash;at eleven-thirty?"</p>

<p>"I'll be there. Meanwhile the Vicar has something rather
interesting to show you, Sergeant."</p>

<p>Bristow ran the car out and was soon speeding along the
high-road. It did not take him long to arrive at the village where
Cyster resided, and to find his cottage. The poacher was at home.
At first he eyed the Captain with some uneasiness, for Cyster
lived, more or less, in an atmosphere of suspicion. But Bristow
quickly disarmed him. He explained that he was a friend of the
Vicar of Frimley, and had come over to thank him for finding the
car.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Cyster, suspicion giving way to greed. "I'd been
hoping the parson wouldn't forget me. I'm only a poor man, sir,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Quite so. Poor and deserving, I suppose. 'Honest' is also a
quality sometimes attached to poverty&mdash;not necessarily in
<i>your</i> case, my friend."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you means, sir," growled Cyster. "I works
hard for my living&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. Interesting work, too, I understand. But about
what you were saying. The Vicar is extremely obliged to you for
finding his car, and he wishes to show it. That is why I've run
over."</p>

<p>And he produced the one-pound notes.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'm very much obliged to him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, wait a bit, my man. I haven't given them to you yet. You
see, the Vicar has got his car back&mdash;but there are those tools
and things, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tools, sir? I don't know nothin' about that."</p>

<p>"Yes, a hammer and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never see no hammer, sir."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it with the other tools?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;so you <i>did</i> have a look in the box?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;well, sir,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, Cyster. We won't argue. You give me the hammer and
the screwdrivers and the other things&mdash;<i>all</i> of 'em,
mind,&mdash;and there's three pounds for you. If not&mdash;well,
you won't get 'em."</p>

<p>"But I never took&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bristow saw the furtive look in the man's eyes.</p>

<p>"That's enough," he said. "Take it or leave it. If you prefer to
leave it, why, I shall advise the Vicar to put the police on the
trail of those tools&mdash;and you won't get a halfpenny. You know
you wouldn't be able to sell them for three quid. Better give 'em
up&mdash;and then the matter is at an end."</p>

<p>Cyster eyed the notes and thought rapidly. Was it worth while?
"Supposin' I did find some tools&mdash;and took care of 'em, like,"
he growled, "likely as not if I was to give 'em to yer you'd tell
the police all the same."</p>

<p>"You can take my word I won't, my friend. Hand them
over&mdash;and the three pounds are yours. And a fourth, too, very
likely."</p>

<p>Cyster looked at him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"You ain't a bloody policeman yourself, eh? One of those
detective blokes?"</p>

<p>"I'm not. Now, get me those tools&mdash;sharp!"</p>

<p>Cyster rose from his seat. The stairs opened on to the room. He
began mounting them. In the bedroom he opened a drawer and took out
the hammer and the screwdriver.</p>

<p>"<i>Everything</i>, mind!"</p>

<p>He wheeled round. Bristow stood at the door.</p>

<p>"Blimey, guv'nor! You give me a turn."</p>

<p>"There were two sparking-plugs."</p>

<p>"All right, guv'nor&mdash;here they are."</p>

<p>Bristow risked it. He had been working up to the chance of there
being something more.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;come&mdash;you know!"</p>

<p>"There ain't nothin' more&mdash;only this here
handkerchief."</p>

<p>"<i>Sure</i>?"</p>

<p>"I'll take my oath on it, sir."</p>

<p>Bristow took the tools, and the handkerchief, and put them in
his pockets without examining them.</p>

<p>"Here's the three pounds, then. And I'll give you another if
you'll come with me in the car and show me just where you found
her."</p>

<p>"I'll do that, guv'nor&mdash;willingly."</p>

<p>Before they got into the Morris, Bristow said:</p>

<p>"Now, show me exactly where that handkerchief was."</p>

<p>The man did so. Bristow made no comment. He ran the car to Yew
Tree Bottom, and Cyster pointed out the spot where he had found
her. Bristow asked him a string of questions, particularly about
there having been the tracks of only one person.</p>

<p>"That's right enough, guv'nor. Here's where he came
along&mdash;there's some o' his traces still, but the bobbies has
been tramplin' the place down since. Here's where he come out o'
the wood."</p>

<p>Bristow took a glance over the broad expanse of downland.</p>

<p>"And you say he was making in the direction of&mdash;what's the
name of the place?"</p>

<p>"Linderton, sir. But, Lord bless 'ee! he might ha' been makin'
for <i>anywhere</i>, once he got athert they downs."</p>

<p>Bristow had unfolded a map, and was studying it carefully.
Presently he said:</p>

<p>"Look here, Cyster, I expect you know a few dodges about getting
out of people's way when they're after you, eh?"</p>

<p>The man grinned.</p>

<p>"Well, now. Suppose you'd done something worse than
poaching&mdash;this is murder, you know&mdash;and you wanted to
save your skin. What would you have done if you had been the fellow
who got out of the car here?"</p>

<p>Cyster thought for a few moments.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he said, "I reckon I could hide myself for a month
round about here wi'out bein' found. But I see what you mean,
guv'nor. The only thing would ha' been to get right away. Where
d'ye think this bloke wanted to get to?"</p>

<p>"Well, say London."</p>

<p>"Then I wouldn't ha' made for Linderton. 'Tis on the end of a
single line o' railway and you have to change at Chiltonbury to get
to London. Too much chance o' bein' spotted. I'd ha' kept along the
downs, yonder," and he stretched out his hand, "and made westward,
till I struck the main London road from the north. There's lorries
comin' along that road to London all night, and I'd ha' got a lift
on one of 'em. That's what I'd ha' done, sir."</p>

<p>Bristow nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I believe you're right," he said. "And now I'll run you home
and get back to Frimley."</p>

<p>It was not till after he had dropped Cyster at his cottage that
Captain Bristow took the handkerchief out of his pocket and
examined it, stopping for a minute to do so. He whistled softly to
himself. In the corner of the handkerchief, in marking-ink, was the
name: "S. FULLINGER."</p>

<p>By the time Bristow reached Frimley, preparations were afoot for
the inquest. At first this was to have been held in the hall of the
Manor, but afterwards it was decided to make use of the Village
Hall, which stood near to The Gables, the home of the murdered man.
It was as well that this had been done, for the building was
packed.</p>

<p>Curiosity in the neighbourhood was rife, and the number of
reporters alone, London and local, formed quite a fair-sized group.
Major Bainbridge was there with Superintendent Kinch and
Detective-Sergeant Mentmore.</p>

<p>The modern Coroner's jury consists of not less than seven and
not more than eleven jurors, the number being at the discretion of
the Coroner. In this instance Mr. Lancefield, the Coroner, a
shrewd, middle-aged lawyer of Chiltonbury, had summoned the maximum
number and the eleven jurymen took the oath and elected their
foreman. The modern jury also differs from the old one in that its
members are not necessarily called upon to view the body of the
deceased. The Coroner, who had previously done this, opened the
proceedings briefly.</p>

<p>"You are met together," he told the jury, "to enquire into the
circumstances of the death of Jasper Hurst, a tenant of Sir Harry
Lynwood, occupying the house in Frimley known as The Gables.
Unfortunately, at the present moment, very scant information
concerning the identity of the deceased is obtainable. Partly for
this reason, and partly for others&mdash;equally
important&mdash;the proceedings this morning will be of the nature
of a preliminary enquiry, and I must warn you that you must be
prepared for an adjournment. I also wish to warn you of something
else. You are on oath to find out the cause of death strictly in
accordance with the evidence which will be given here, and on no
other basis; and as that evidence may lead to serious charges
against some person or persons, you must use every effort to keep
your minds unbiased with regard to any gossip or theories which may
be flying about. For this reason it is my duty to charge you not to
discuss the case with anyone except yourselves during the interval
which must necessarily elapse before we meet again. I hope you
realise the importance of this?"</p>

<p>He paused. There was a murmur of assent among the jury.</p>

<p>"Very well, then. The evidence I shall call this morning will be
more or less of a formal character. The witnesses will please
understand that they will probably be wanted again at a later stage
of the enquiry."</p>

<p>Bristow glanced at Charlie Lynwood, who met his gaze with a look
of understanding. The first witness called was Sir Harry. After
giving his name and address, the Coroner asked him:</p>

<p>"Jasper Hurst was a tenant of yours, Sir Harry?"</p>

<p>"He was."</p>

<p>"For how long?"</p>

<p>"Just over two months."</p>

<p>"You did not know him before he became your tenant?"</p>

<p>"I did not."</p>

<p>"You were satisfied, though, that he was a desirable
tenant&mdash;I mean, financially?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"Will you tell us why?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>He explained how he had let the house through agents, that Hurst
had given his Bankers as a reference, and that the reply from the
Bank had been quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Now, Sir Harry, you would describe Hurst&mdash;well,
as a gentleman?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"One, for example, you could ask to your house?"</p>

<p>"That is so."</p>

<p>"And you asked him, at the conclusion of the pageant which took
place in your grounds the day before last, to come in to dinner
with you?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"He had no idea beforehand that you were going to ask him?"</p>

<p>"None. It was at the very last moment."</p>

<p>"I see. Was there anything strange or suspicious with regard to
him, while he was in your house?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"What time did he leave?"</p>

<p>"That I cannot say. I went up to bed, leaving him with some of
the others in the smoking-room."</p>

<p>A juror began to interpose here. The Coroner interrupted
him.</p>

<p>"We shall hear, presently, the time Hurst left the Manor," he
said. "Thank you, Sir Harry. That will do, I think. James
Barnes!"</p>

<p>Barnes, butler and chauffeur at The Gables, briefly stated what
he knew of Hurst, which was very little. The Coroner asked him a
few questions, and he stood down.</p>

<p>"Mr. Charles Lynwood!"</p>

<p>The young man seated himself in the witness-chair. Kinch looked
up. He was seated, with the Chief Constable and the
detective-sergeant, just on the right of the Coroner. The latter
consulted his notes for a few moments.</p>

<p>"Suppose you tell us, Mr. Lynwood, to begin with, just what
happened the other night when, as I understand, you left the house
with Hurst. I will ask you any questions as you go on."</p>

<p>Bristow recognised the method. Sometimes, when a witness is
asked to tell his own story, he makes slips which are useful in
cross-examination afterwards. Charlie's story, however, was plain
and straightforward. He told of the three men and himself in the
smoking-room, of the Vicar and Hurst getting up to go, of how he
had left his cigarettes in the marquee and went out to get them, of
the Vicar saying good night, and of Hurst starting off down the
drive. Then the Coroner began:</p>

<p>"Was Hurst out of sight when you went into the marquee?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;to me he was. When I got to the marquee I could no
longer see down the drive."</p>

<p>"But he might not have kept walking on?"</p>

<p>"That is true. But I couldn't see."</p>

<p>"Well, you went into the tent. Did you find your
cigarettes?"</p>

<p>"Not at once. Someone had moved them."</p>

<p>"And you looked for them?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That would take a little time?"</p>

<p>"It did."</p>

<p>Again the Coroner looked at his notes.</p>

<p>"There were three compartments in the tent?"</p>

<p>"There were."</p>

<p>"Did you go into each of them?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Oh! Did you see anyone in the tent&mdash;in either compartment,
Mr. Lynwood?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>At that moment Kinch leaned over and whispered to the Coroner.
The latter nodded, and turned to Charlie again.</p>

<p>"I want to put this to you," he said. "Do you think it would
have been possible, while you were in one of the inner compartments
of the tent, for Hurst to have come back, enter the
tent&mdash;thinking you were no longer there&mdash;and to have
hidden himself in the other compartment?"</p>

<p>Charlie thought.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, slowly, "I suppose it might have been. But, if
he did, I didn't see him in the tent&mdash;nor anyone else."</p>

<p>"Very well. Go on, please."</p>

<p>"After I had found the cigarettes I came back into the house and
went to my room. I was in bed when Captain Bristow came, later on,
to tell me what had happened."</p>

<p>The Coroner looked at his notes again, and then, for a moment at
the Superintendent. The latter shook his head&mdash;almost
imperceptibly.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Lynwood; that will do. I shall probably want you
again&mdash;subsequently," he added, as the young man got up from
the witness-chair.</p>

<p>The next witness was the Vicar. The Coroner only kept him a
couple of minutes, simply getting him to corroborate the fact of
the three men leaving the house together. The Vicar, who had
expected more than this, hesitated.</p>

<p>"There was the question of my car&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"I know," broke in the Coroner. "At another stage of the
enquiry, Mr. Ashley-Smith. I won't trouble you any further
now."</p>

<p>One could distinguish a little thrill of excitement when Captain
Bristow stepped forward, took the oath, and sat down in the
witness-chair. Everyone knew, of course, that he had been the first
to make the gruesome discovery, even before Hurst had breathed his
last. Major Bainbridge looked at him with special interest. He knew
the Captain's reputation. Kinch, too, watched his face. Mentmore
had just a glimmer of scepticism in his eye. The astute
detective-sergeant had, perhaps, more than an open mind about
Bristow. He was by no means satisfied.</p>

<p>Bristow gave his evidence clearly, with no attempt at
embellishment. He stated that, as he went up to bed, it was exactly
half-past one&mdash;the clock struck the half-hour as he passed it.
The Coroner asked him few questions till he had finished, and then
began:</p>

<p>"Mr. Charles Lynwood did not leave the smoking-room when you
were all there?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He was quick to recognise the point of this question. So far, no
mention of Mrs. Cresswell's pearls had been made in the enquiry. He
saw, however, that the question meant the possibility of Charlie
having gone into her room to get them. And added:</p>

<p>"He was with us all the time&mdash;I mean from the time we went
in to dinner till he left the house with the Vicar and Mr.
Hurst."</p>

<p>A flicker of a smile passed over the face of the Superintendent.
He, too, knew the meaning of that question. In fact, he had
suggested it beforehand to the Coroner.</p>

<p>"I see. And Hurst was still alive when you discovered him in the
sedan-chair?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I am informed that he said something. What was it, Captain
Bristow?"</p>

<p>"He was very incoherent and could only whisper. I caught two
words&mdash;that was all. They sounded like 'the line.'"</p>

<p>"Have you any idea what he meant?"</p>

<p>"None whatever."</p>

<p>"About these two men, who were carrying the chair. Could you
distinguish anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I never got near enough, and it was only partially
moonlight. The only thing about them I could make out was that one
was taller than the other."</p>

<p>"You came closer to them, though, when they reached the
car&mdash;and got in."</p>

<p>"Yes. But then I could only see the backs of their heads, till
one of them, not the driver, turned round as I flashed my torch on
the number-plate. I would not swear it, but I fancy he was
clean-shaven. I was concentrating on the number-plate, you
see."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, we won't go into the matter of the car this morning
except&mdash;they drove straight away, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but they stopped for a few seconds&mdash;I could
hear. I suppose it was&mdash;to&mdash;open the gate leading from
the drive&mdash;to the road&mdash;outside."</p>

<p>Bristow had become slow in his speech. A sudden thought had
struck him&mdash;a point he had not thought of before. Why was the
gate shut? Surely they would have left it open when they brought
the car in&mdash;ready to get away quickly. Kinch, who was watching
him narrowly, made a note in his book. Which ran:</p>

<p>"The gate&mdash;from drive to highway&mdash;was it open or
shut?"</p>

<p>"Now, Captain Bristow"&mdash;the Coroner's clear, incisive voice
brought him away from his thoughts&mdash;"tell us what you did
next, please."</p>

<p>"As soon as I had satisfied myself that Hurst was dead, and that
I could do no more, I ran back to the house and roused, first Sir
Harry, and then Mr. Charles Lynwood."</p>

<p>"They were both in bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Asleep?"</p>

<p>"Sir Harry was. I'm not sure about Mr. Charles Lynwood."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"I telephoned for the police. Sir Harry and Mr. Harry Lynwood,
whom he had called, came down&mdash;and Mr. Charles Lynwood. Mr.
Harry went to fetch Dr. Forbes, and the constable who is stationed
here."</p>

<p>The Coroner glanced at his notes, and at his watch, which was
lying on the table.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Captain Bristow," he said. "I think that is
all&mdash;at present. And now," he went on, speaking to the jury,
"I propose only to call medical evidence, and then we will settle a
date for adjournment. The police do not wish to say anything at
this juncture&mdash;and I am in agreement with them. Will you take
the oath, please, Dr. Forbes."</p>

<p>Dr. Forbes was brief, cautious, and professional. He stated that
he had examined Hurst merely with a view to ascertaining whether
life was extinct or not. It was extinct. Had only been extinct for
a very short time. Yes, there was a contused wound on the left
temple. Enough to cause death? He was not prepared to say. That
matter was in other hands.</p>

<p>Dr. Burton, the police surgeon, was called next. He stated that
he had made a cursory examination of the body when he had first
been called to the scene of the tragedy, and corroborated the other
medical man with regard to the wound on the temple, which had
evidently been caused by some hard object.</p>

<p>"Did you arrive at any conclusion, then?" asked the Coroner. "I
did not."</p>

<p>"But you carried out a post-mortem on the body afterwards?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Will you kindly tell the jury the result of your
examination?"</p>

<p>"I found that deceased had been suffering from <i>arterio
sclerosis</i> probably for some little time before he met with his
death."</p>

<p>"Would you mind explaining what that means?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It means that the arteries supplying the wall of the
heart&mdash;er&mdash;that is the muscle of the heart&mdash;were
diseased. They were not working properly," he added, for the
benefit of the jury.</p>

<p>"And the cause of death?"</p>

<p>"Cerebral hemorrhage, caused by arterial failure."</p>

<p>"But the blow on the forehead?" ejaculated the foreman of the
jury. "Didn't that kill him?"</p>

<p>"As a secondary cause, yes. But the direct cause was what I have
stated&mdash;arterial failure."</p>

<p>"I suppose, Dr. Burton," said the Coroner, who was quick to
observe that one or two of the jury looked a little puzzled, "that
the blow in question was not sufficient, in itself, to cause the
death of an ordinary healthy man?"</p>

<p>"It <i>might</i> have done so," replied the police surgeon, with
the caution of a professional, "but I should say that, with a
person in normal health, that was not likely."</p>

<p>"It aggravated the disease from which the deceased was
suffering?"</p>

<p>"Just so. It acted in the nature of a shock on the diseased
arteries, accelerating the condition which caused death."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Dr. Burton. There is nothing more you wish to say?"
The doctor had some professional pride&mdash;the sort that asks for
recognition.</p>

<p>"Except that I may mention that my diagnosis is confirmed by the
report of a specialist, whom the deceased consulted some weeks ago.
Superintendent Kinch will confirm this."</p>

<p>"That is quite right," said Kinch. "We can produce the physician
in question if it is necessary," he went on, addressing the
Coroner.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think we need do that. I imagine the jury are quite
satisfied with Dr. Burton's evidence."</p>

<p>There was a murmur of assent. Dr. Burton looked pleased, and
bowed.</p>

<p>"That is all the evidence for this morning," said the Coroner.
"I will make out an Order for Burial, and then we can fix a date to
resume the enquiry.&mdash;Yes?"</p>

<p>He had just begun to fill in the form when there was a slight
confusion at the back of the hall, by the door, which was guarded
by a constable. A man had come in, a tall, well-dressed man of
about sixty, with iron-grey moustache and short, pointed beard. He
was saying something to the policeman in a low tone of voice, and
ended by pencilling something on a visiting-card and handing it to
him. The constable pushed his way through the densely-crowded hall
to the table at which the Coroner was sitting, and passed the card
over. The Coroner looked at it, ejaculated "Oh!" and handed it to
Kinch. That astute official's eyebrows lifted appreciatively.</p>

<p>The Coroner raised his voice, speaking to the man at the back of
the room.</p>

<p>"Will you come here, please, sir?"</p>

<p>Jury, reporters and spectators stared at the stranger as he
slowly made his way to the Coroner. Was a sensation about to be
sprung on the Court?</p>

<p>The stranger came up beside the Coroner and conferred with him
for two or three minutes in a low tone of voice. Then the Coroner
turned to the jury.</p>

<p>"I must keep you a short time longer," he said. "This
gentleman,"&mdash;indicating the stranger,&mdash;"is of opinion
that the deceased is a relative of his. I have asked him to
accompany Superintendent Kinch to The Gables, in order that he may
view the body. We will await his return, please."</p>

<p>The stranger left the hall with Kinch, and the Coroner went on
filling in the "Order for Burial." Then he leaned back in his
chair, waiting. A buzz of conversation began to arise in the
crowded court.</p>

<p>Presently the stranger came back. Superintendent Kinch conferred
for a moment or two in whispers with the Coroner. Then the oath was
administered.</p>

<p>He glanced at the visiting-card again, and then began:</p>

<p>"Your name is Stephen Westerham?" he queried.</p>

<p>The witness bowed.</p>

<p>"Your address, please?"</p>

<p>"The Red House, Tewkesbury."</p>

<p>"Your occupation?"</p>

<p>"I am a barrister, but I have not practised for some years,
now."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Westerham. You have just seen the body on which
this inquest is being held?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"Did you recognise the deceased?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"Will you tell us, please, what you know about
him&mdash;concerning his identity?"</p>

<p>"He is Jasper Hurst. My half-brother."</p>

<p>"You are certain of this?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>A flutter of excitement went round the court. Reporters were
scribbling hard. One of them was making a rapid pen-and-ink sketch
of Stephen Westerham.</p>

<p>"We are grateful to you for telling us this, Mr. Westerham,"
went on the Coroner. "Up to the present moment, no information
concerning your half-brother has been available. You will
understand that, in the nature of this inquiry, the police will
wish to consult with you before I can ask you to give any evidence
at length?"</p>

<p>The witness bowed.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, there are a few more questions I wish to put to you
now. Will you tell us when you first heard of your half-brother's
death?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Only this morning, Mr. Coroner, I read the account
of what had happened in Frimley in my morning paper, at breakfast.
Jasper's&mdash;my half-brother's portrait was in the paper.
Naturally I wished to place myself at your disposal without delay.
The paper stated that the inquest was being held here this morning,
and I lost no time. I motored straight here in my car."</p>

<p>"We are greatly obliged to you. You knew the deceased was living
at Frimley?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"When did you see him last?"</p>

<p>"Monday in last week. I was spending the week-end in London, and
he ran up and lunched with me at my club."</p>

<p>"Are there any other relatives?"</p>

<p>"Not in England. I have a married sister living in Canada. And
there are cousins&mdash;but all of them are abroad."</p>

<p>"So you are the legal representative?"</p>

<p>"I am. And one of his executors. The other executor is his bank.
I believe his will is deposited there."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much, Mr. Westerham. Your arrival here has
simplified certain matters exceedingly. I will not go into any
further details now, but, before I close the Court, I am sure the
jury will join with me in an expression of sympathy for your
bereavement&mdash;and the very sudden and tragic circumstances
under which it has taken place."</p>

<p>The jury whispered together&mdash;the foreman got up, and said
to Mr. Westerham, who bowed his acknowledgments:</p>

<p>"We are all very sorry for you, sir. And we hope the result of
our being here may help to throw a light on what has happened."</p>

<p>The Coroner rose.</p>

<p>"The enquiry is adjourned," he said, "until this day week. We
will meet here, at the same time&mdash;half-past eleven."</p>

<p>A little group remained in the hall after the rest had left. Sir
Harry, who was always hospitable, went up to Mr. Westerham.</p>

<p>"I must introduce myself," he said. "I am your unfortunate
brother's landlord. It was at my place, you know, that the affair
happened. What are your plans?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the other, "I shall stay here for a few days, at my
brother's house, I suppose. I packed a suitcase before I started.
Of course there will be the funeral to see to&mdash;and other
things."</p>

<p>"Let me offer you some luncheon now, at all events."</p>

<p>"It's very kind of you."</p>

<p>"Not at all. Major, won't you lunch with us, too?"</p>

<p>The Chief Constable accepted. Kinch came up, and spoke to Mr.
Westerham.</p>

<p>"There's a lot I want to ask you, sir."</p>

<p>"You shall see Mr. Westerham after luncheon, Superintendent,"
said the Baronet. "Come to my house at half-past two&mdash;the
library is at your disposal."</p>

<p>Sir Harry and his party started to walk to the Manor. Charles
Lynwood dropped behind, with Bristow.</p>

<p>"You were right about my evidence, Roger," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes. I thought the Coroner wouldn't press you this
morning."</p>

<p>"Have you done anything?" went on the young man. "Found out
anything that will buck me up a bit?"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to tell you anything yet, Charlie. I'm still
extremely puzzled. But I haven't been idle."</p>

<p>When they reached the Manor Mr. and Mrs. Cresswell, who were
still there, were sitting on the terrace.</p>

<p>She began at once:</p>

<p>"Oh, Sir Harry,&mdash;what is the result of the
inquest?&mdash;Did they discover who murdered Mr. Hurst?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid they didn't get as far as that, Mrs. Cresswell. They
are going to meet again&mdash;next week."</p>

<p>"What did they say about my necklace? Have they found out
anything about it?"</p>

<p>Sir Harry shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't know what the police have done," he replied, "but the
matter of your necklace didn't come before the enquiry this
morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" sighed Mrs. Cresswell. "I do hope they will trace
it?"</p>

<p>"You have only yourself to blame if they don't, my dear," put in
her husband, sardonically. Bristow, who was watching him, thought
he detected a slight twitching of the man's lips.</p>

<p>In the hall they waited a few minutes till Hudson announced that
luncheon was ready. Major Bainbridge lounged up to Bristow. "Queer
case," he said, laconically.</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are interested?"</p>

<p>"Extremely."</p>

<p>The Major nodded, a confidential, understanding little nod.</p>

<p>"I thought you would be," he said. "I know something of your
reputation, Captain Bristow. You're really more of a policeman than
I am," and he laughed. "I know my limitations, and I keep in the
official background in a case like this. But my Superintendent is a
capable fellow&mdash;and a sensible one," he added, slowly. "He's
never above welcoming help&mdash;from anyone who can give it to
him. Ah! Luncheon is ready."</p>

<p>Bristow smiled as he went into the dining-room. He understood
perfectly well that the Chief Constable had thrown out an
invitation.</p>

<h2>Chapter 9</h2>

<p>Superintendent Kinch raised no objection as to the presence of
others when he came, after luncheon, to interrogate Westerham.
There was no reason why he should. Sir Harry, Captain Bristow, the
Chief Constable, Westerham and Kinch went into the library.</p>

<p>"Now, sir," said Kinch to Westerham, "we want to know all you
can tell us about your unfortunate brother. It often happens that
the history of a person helps us considerably in tracing a crime.
Sometimes it is impossible to find a motive until we know all about
the persons concerned."</p>

<p>"I am as anxious as you are, Superintendent," replied Westerham,
"that justice shall be done. I will place all I know of my
half-brother at your disposal, and I hope it will assist you."</p>

<p>Kinch nodded. Westerham went on:</p>

<p>"Jasper was considerably younger than I. My mother, who was left
a widow when I was a boy, married again, and Jasper was the only
child of this second marriage. As a matter of fact, although he was
my half-brother, I have really seen very little of him in the
course of my life. When I left Oxford he was a small boy at school.
Then my mother died. By my father's will I was left fairly well
off, and preferred&mdash;well&mdash;to be independent. I mean," he
added, "that I no longer made my home with my stepfather."</p>

<p>"But you kept in touch with your half-brother?" asked Kinch.
"Oh, yes. I saw him occasionally. We were always very good friends.
We have met several times lately. He wanted my advice."</p>

<p>"What was your brother by profession?" asked Kinch. Westerham
smiled.</p>

<p>"He retired about six months ago. As to his
profession,&mdash;well, have you ever heard of Dewsbury &amp;
Hemmingford, Superintendent?" Kinch looked up from his notebook
with interest.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I have," he replied. "I don't know that I ever came
across them&mdash;but we know of them, of course. Dewsbury &amp;
Hemmingford, Private Enquiry Agents. Do you mean them?"</p>

<p>Westerham nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "I thought you would know of them."</p>

<p>"I've heard of them," said Captain Bristow. "Didn't they recover
the Ashworth jewels&mdash;after the police had given up the case?"
he added, dryly, with a glance at the Superintendent.</p>

<p>"Ah!" put in the Chief Constable. "I remember. But it wasn't my
men who failed, you know. Another county, Captain
Bristow&mdash;another county."</p>

<p>"It was a smart job, I admit," said Kinch. "And this firm, sir?"
he went on, to Westerham.</p>

<p>"Well," said the latter, "my brother Jasper was Hemmingford,
Superintendent. He took that name for professional purposes when he
went into partnership with Dewsbury. He really began life as an
architect, but he always had a <i>penchant</i> for detective work.
As a matter of face, he solved one or two rather delicate problems
as an amateur while he was in business as an architect. That's how
he met Dewsbury, and it led to his giving up his business and going
into partnership with him. Dewsbury died about a year ago. He was a
bachelor, with no near relatives, and he left his share in the
agency to Jasper. But Jasper's health was failing. An opportunity
arose of selling the agency, and he took it. He had means enough to
retire upon. That's why he came here."</p>

<p>"A detective, eh?" said Sir Harry, who had been intensely
interested in Westerham's recital.</p>

<p>"In a way, he was," replied Westerham, "but the cases he handled
were often delicate matters which do not come into the category of
police work. The firm, I believe, had a good reputation."</p>

<p>"Excellent," said Bristow. "I was never actually in touch with
them. But I know they were sometimes consulted by the powers that
be.</p>

<p>"This is very interesting, Mr. Westerham," said the
Superintendent. "It may even help us to throw some light upon what
has occurred here. I suppose, now,"&mdash;he was thinking
rapidly&mdash;"that Mr. Hurst made enemies in the course of his
work?"</p>

<p>"It is possible," replied Westerham, "but he never mentioned any
to me. Indeed, he never spoke of the details of his work&mdash;or
of persons connected with it."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I see," said Kinch. "Now, can you tell me anything
about his private life which might be useful?"</p>

<p>"Not very much. Except that he has not had a happy life for the
last few years. I suppose I shall be breaking no confidence in
telling you?"</p>

<p>"I think you can rely upon our discretion, Mr. Westerham," said
Sir Harry, "but if you prefer to entrust your confidences to the
representatives of the police only, Captain Bristow and I
will&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," broke in Westerham. "That is not necessary. I would
really like you to know. Well, then, about four years ago poor
Jasper did a very foolish thing. He became infatuated with a woman
considerably younger than himself&mdash;and married her. I only
knew of this afterwards. As I said, we seldom met. He seems, from
what he told me some months ago, to have met this woman when he was
spending a short holiday at Annecy, in Haute Savoie. Anyhow, he
married her within a few weeks. I believe things were fairly right
for a couple of years&mdash;and then he made a very painful
discovery. He told me that, in the course of some investigations he
was carrying out&mdash;a robbery, I think,&mdash;that, almost by
accident, he found that his wife, before he married her, had been
mixed up with a gang of thieves&mdash;in fact, that she was an
adventuress. But this was not all. He began to suspect that she was
still associated with crooks. The irony of it all was pretty
terrible, for Jasper was a man of great integrity. Well, he charged
her with it. He was still fond of her, and told her this discovery
should make no difference, if she would promise, once for all, to
break from her old associates. For a time she appeared to have done
so. Then, to make a long story short, the climax came. She left
him&mdash;ran off with a man who was a thorough bad
lot&mdash;Jasper never told me who he was, but he knew about him.
Then she wrote to him and asked him to divorce her, so that she
could marry this other man. He came to consult me about it."</p>

<p>"What did you advise?" asked Kinch.</p>

<p>"Naturally, that he should divorce her and get rid of her
altogether. But he wouldn't. He was still infatuated with her, so
much so that he seemed to have the notion that as long as she was
his wife she might come back to him in a state of
penitence&mdash;and he would forgive her. My poor brother was a
strangely chivalrous man where women were concerned. In spite of my
advice, he actually wrote and told her this. And, so far as I know,
he never heard of her since. But it helped to break him. And he
told me that the chief reason why he gave up his work was not
really that of failing health, but the fear that haunted him that
in the course of some criminal investigation he might find himself
on the track of his own wife. It was a tragedy."</p>

<p>"Poor chap!" exclaimed Sir Harry. "I'm sorry for him."</p>

<p>"You will understand," went on Westerham, "that I have no wish
to make all this public. My evidence at the adjourned
inquest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That ought to be all right, sir," broke in Kinch, glancing at
the Chief Constable, who nodded in acquiescence. "I don't think
there will be any need to enter into Mr. Hurst's private life at
the inquest, though, if all this has any bearing on the crime, it
will have to come out. I'm greatly obliged for your information. It
throws a new light on matters."</p>

<p>"May we ask how?" said Sir Harry.</p>

<p>Kinch thought for a moment or two, and then said:</p>

<p>"I don't see any reason why I should not tell you. In fact, it's
obvious. Well, I mean that from what Mr. Westerham has told us of
his brother's character, it does not seem probable that he was
after those pearls."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" exclaimed Westerham. "You never suspected
<i>that</i>, I hope?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know, sir," replied Kinch, consulting his
notebook. "There were certain points to be considered. Your brother
was hanging about in the corridor upstairs, close to Mrs.
Cresswell's bedroom, for some little time before he came down to
dinner the night before last. And, at dinner, he questioned Miss
Fullinger&mdash;who was to have driven Mrs. Cresswell back to
London yesterday&mdash;about the necklace. He asked if Mrs.
Cresswell would be taking it with her in the car. There were other
things," he added, looking again at his notebook, "but I prefer not
to mention them now&mdash;except that what you have told me about
Mr. Hurst having been a private detective throws a light upon them.
Thank you very much, Mr. Westerham. I think that's all, for the
present."</p>

<p>Westerham then took himself off to The Gables, saying that he
should be making arrangements for the funeral and should be staying
in Frimley until the adjourned inquest, at all events. The Chief
Constable ran Kinch back to Chiltonbury in his car, and went with
the Superintendent into the latter's private office.</p>

<p>"Now, Kinch," he said, "tell me what you think of the
case&mdash;as far as you've gone into it. It's pretty
complicated&mdash;and it's deeply interesting."</p>

<p>"It is that," replied Kinch, "but I fancy what we've just heard
this afternoon about Hurst explains some of the points in it."</p>

<p>"I'd like to hear."</p>

<p>"Well, sir, we've got to remember that Hurst was connected with
this firm&mdash;Dewsbury &amp; Hemmingford. He <i>was</i>
Hemmingford. I daresay you know the kind of work Dewsbury &amp;
Hemmingford undertook?"</p>

<p>"I've heard something about them&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"They were a high-class firm of private enquiry agents. People
in a good position consulted them on delicate matters which are
either outside our province, or because they didn't want to call in
the police. Cases of evidence for divorce, blackmail, missing
valuables&mdash;<i>you</i> know, sir. And Hurst must have had a
pretty deep knowledge of the private affairs of lots of
people&mdash;society folks, and so on. Some of it, you may be sure,
<i>criminal</i> knowledge. It's <i>our</i> business, of course, to
bring every criminal case we know of before the law. But Hurst's
profession was different. In many instances he would be employed in
keeping matters private&mdash;not letting them get into a court of
justice. You can't blame him. We are the servants of the public. He
was employed in a purely private capacity. I've no doubt he could
have told us of people whom we should never have suspected of being
criminals&mdash;crimes which never saw the light of day. There are
any amount of them about."</p>

<p>Major Bainbridge nodded.</p>

<p>"I follow you," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, now, sir, Hurst retires. He is living a quiet life in a
small village. He has given up his work, but he's still got his
knowledge. He is asked to take part in this pageant. I've
ascertained that there were a number of rehearsals&mdash;when of
course, costumes were not worn and they didn't make up their faces.
But none of the members of Sir Harry's house-party were present at
these rehearsals. They all came down the day before and took part
in one <i>dress</i> rehearsal. I've ascertained, further, that
Hurst, like many of the others, dressed and made himself up at
home&mdash;before he came to the Manor grounds. And his make-up
would disguise him&mdash;he wore a moustache and beard. And he was
called <i>Hurst</i>&mdash;not Hemmingford."</p>

<p>"Ah!&mdash;I see what you mean, Kinch," said the Chief
Constable. "You mean that anyone who had known him as Hemmingford,
the private detective, would not have recognised him as Hurst, a
Puritan of the sixteenth century?"</p>

<p>"Exactly, sir. None of the house-party would have done so,
either at the rehearsal or at the actual pageant. Now, of that
house-party, we can eliminate all except Mrs. Cresswell and Miss
Fullinger. Of those two, he had Miss Fullinger's address written in
his notebook. Why? It's been puzzling me all the time, sir, till
our interview with Mr. Westerham just now. Hurst, you may depend
upon it, knew something about the girl Fullinger&mdash;at least,
it's a fair inference that he did. Possibly something not exactly
to her credit."</p>

<p>"Oh, but&mdash;" Major Bainbridge began. And then stopped
short.</p>

<p>"Wait a bit, sir. It's only an inference, I admit. But it fits
in. At the pageant he notices two things. First, this Fullinger
girl. Secondly, the foolish way in which Mrs. Cresswell was asking
for trouble by flaunting those pearls about. For all we know, that
necklace may have been familiar to him. I had a chat about it with
Mr. Cresswell, and he told me that, once or twice, he had employed
a private detective to keep watch when his wife had worn the thing
in public. And I shall ask him if he ever went to Dewsbury &amp;
Hemmingford for a man. Well, Hurst's interest is aroused. He
accepts Sir Harry's invitation to dinner. When he goes upstairs to
wash, he reconnoitres that corridor. He's on the look-out for
something. He sits next to Miss Fullinger at dinner and asks
leading questions about that necklace. And he takes care not to
remove his moustache and beard till he gets outside the house. He
didn't want to be recognised by someone inside the house."</p>

<p>"You think he suspected theft&mdash;and that he wanted to
frustrate it?"</p>

<p>Kinch shook his head.</p>

<p>"That I can't say, sir. I only go so far as to suggest that his
interest was aroused."</p>

<p>"But how does this bear on what happened after he left the
house&mdash;the murder, and so on?"</p>

<p>"Possibly we shall never know that&mdash;even if we find the
culprit, sir. But, following out this theory: Hurst leaves the
house, probably with nothing more in his mind than that certain
circumstances were peculiar, perhaps that Mrs. Cresswell was in
danger of being robbed. And then, accidentally, he runs into the
thief. If young Curtis, and whoever was with him, had that car
waiting round the bend of the drive, Hurst would stumble upon it
just after he had crossed the bridge. And then we don't know
exactly what did happen, though it's plausible to suppose that he
didn't interfere then. Probably hid and watched. He got that blow
from the knuckle-duster inside the tent. At least, it seems so.
Captain Bristow saw the sedan-chair carried out of the
tent&mdash;and Hurst was in it. And they got the pearls right
enough. The empty case in Yew Tree Bottom proves that!"</p>

<p>The Chief Constable nodded his head, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, slowly. "There's a lot in what you say. If I
might offer a suggestion, though, Kinch, the jigsaw puzzle doesn't
all fit in. What do you make of that wrecked car at Drifford? Do
you think it has any bearing on the case?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir," replied Kinch, "from one point of view it looks
like it. We have to remember that there are two men to be accounted
for who were not members of the house-party&mdash;the two whom
Captain Bristow saw carrying the sedan-chair and then making off in
the car. One of them was the Vicar's nephew&mdash;young Curtis. He
took the car out of his uncle's garage."</p>

<p>Major Bainbridge frowned a little.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said. "Who was the other, then?"</p>

<p>"We know, pretty well, that whoever was driving the wrecked car
came on to Chiltonbury by train. The finding of the number-plates
on the line proves that. And there's another thing. Sergeant
Mentmore discovered this morning&mdash;the amount of petrol
consumed proves this&mdash;that the Vicar's car ran more than the
twenty miles to Yew Tree Bottom that night&mdash;eight or nine
miles more, sir."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"If it were driven from Frimley to Chiltonbury and back first,
that would just account for those eight miles. Suppose young Curtis
drove in here and fetched the other man out?"</p>

<p>The Chief Constable frowned again.</p>

<p>"Plausible. But there are difficulties. How could young Curtis
know that the other fellow had broken down?"</p>

<p>"It must have been arranged that the other man should only run
as far as Chiltonbury in his car, sir,&mdash;and Curtis was to pick
him up there."</p>

<p>Major Bainbridge shook his head.</p>

<p>"I don't like it, Kinch. That's a fact. The difficulty to my
mind is that this nephew of the Vicar's was far too open and
above-board in what we know he did&mdash;his calling at the
Vicarage and waiting there for his uncle. But go on. Follow out
this theory a little further. Suppose it did happen as you put it.
What then? The two men make off in the car with the jewels. Whoever
they were&mdash;whether Curtis was one of them or not&mdash;they
separated. Only one man ran the car into Yew Tree Bottom, according
to that poaching fellow. He took the pearls, of course. Pocketed
them, I suppose, and left the case behind. But how about the other
man? Where did he leave the car?"</p>

<p>Kinch laughed.</p>

<p>"I think I've found that out, sir&mdash;at the inquest, this
morning."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I ought to have thought of it before. It was when Captain
Bristow was giving his evidence. He told me, previously, what he
told the Coroner&mdash;that the car stopped for a moment or two,
apparently at the gate leading from the drive to the main road. And
I noticed that he hesitated, as if a sudden thought had struck him.
It struck me, too. Was it likely that, when they drove the car in
from the road they would have left the gate shut? And, if it was
open, why did they stop? After the inquest&mdash;before I came to
the Manor to interview Mr. Westerham&mdash;I made enquiries. As
luck would have it, I came across a man who had been out late and
was returning by the main road a little before midnight. And he was
ready to swear that the gate was open. He noticed it as he passed.
That's why the car stopped, sir,&mdash;to put down one of the two,
<i>there!</i>"</p>

<p>"Oho!" exclaimed the Chief Constable. "You think that, do you?
What have you done about it? It's important, if it's true. It means
that this fellow, whoever he was, may be still in the
neighbourhood&mdash;unless he walked into Chiltonbury and got off
by train."</p>

<p>"Couldn't have done it&mdash;the last train, up or down, had
left long before. Oh, I've taken measures, sir. Mentmore is on the
job, making enquiries to find if any man was seen in the
neighbourhood."</p>

<p>"I see. No news of young Curtis&mdash;the Vicar's
nephew,&mdash;I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Stevens is on that job&mdash;in London. The
Metropolitan Police are helping him&mdash;enquiries at night-clubs,
and so on. We ought to get on his track."</p>

<p>The Chief Constable got up.</p>

<p>"I must be off," he said. "I'll drop in tomorrow morning." He
hesitated. "May I offer you a suggestion, Kinch?"</p>

<p>Kinch knew the phrase, and that there was generally something in
it when Major Bainbridge made use of it.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. I'll be glad to have it."</p>

<p>"I always think it's worth while trying to pick a fellow's
brains if his brains are in good order, you know."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"I imagine Captain Bristow's brains come under that category. I
don't want to interfere, Kinch, but it might be useful to try to
find out what he thinks of things."</p>

<p>"I rather agree with you, sir. But he's a bit of an oyster,
isn't he?" Major Bainbridge laughed.</p>

<p>"Part of our business to open oysters&mdash;diplomatically," he
said. "I don't suggest that you should hunt in couples, but I do
fancy he's sniffed a little of the scent&mdash;maybe a whiff or two
that you haven't nosed yourself, and if you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, sir."</p>

<p>The telephone-bell had rung. Kinch took up the receiver.</p>

<p>"Hullo...yes... yes. Superintendent Kinch of
Frattenbury...that's right...Yes...Oh...Splendid...good
business...Yes, by all means, bring him along...No, you can't help
that, of course...Yes&mdash;merely detention at
present...Right!...I see...Yes. My man, Stevens, is in
London...I'll try to get through to him presently and tell him to
meet you&mdash;what time?...Yes...Eight-thirty-three at Charing
Cross. And if he's not there, you'll come straight on here
yourself? Right. Thank you very much!"</p>

<p>He replaced the receiver and turned to his superior officer
triumphantly.</p>

<p>"That's the best bit of news we've had today, sir. Trunk call
from Dover. They've got him right enough."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Young Curtis, sir. The Vicar's nephew. Making off by the
Boulogne boat."</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>"They're bringing him up to London by the next
train&mdash;arrives at Charing Cross at eight-thirty-three. He'll
be here tonight, sir. I think the train gets in about half-past
ten." He looked at his watch. "I ought to get on to
Stevens&mdash;he was to ring up about six. I want him to meet
Curtis at Charing Cross and bring him down. <i>Now</i> we ought to
get a bit ahead, sir," and he rubbed his hands briskly.</p>

<p>"I shall be anxious to hear what Curtis has to say."</p>

<p>"Ah! I wonder! I suppose I ought to let his uncle
know&mdash;poor old chap! I'll get through to Frimley
presently."</p>

<p>The Chief Constable still lingered.</p>

<p>"You won't charge him?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, I think, sir,...only, that scarf of his, you know.
<i>In the tent</i> it was. I should be justified."</p>

<p>"I know," replied Major Bainbridge, thoughtfully. "I'd forgotten
that scarf, for the moment."</p>

<p>"I hadn't," replied Kinch, grimly. "And whatever yarn he spins,
it will take him all his time to explain <i>that!</i>"</p>

<h2>Chapter 10</h2>

<p>Captain Bristow had found a secluded spot in the grounds of
Frimley Manor, a small summer-house, and there he sat, by himself,
working out in his mind the problem he had set himself to try to
solve. The Chief Constable was right when he hinted to Kinch that
Bristow had ideas with regard to the double crime which might be
worth ascertaining. He had. But he was by no means sure of the
veracity of most of them, and it was doubtful whether, in the
present state of his mind, he would have been willing to open out
had Kinch endeavoured to pump him just then.</p>

<p>When in the Secret Service he had always been adverse to taking
any action until he had satisfied himself as to the stability of
the grounds for doing so, and, until he had reached his conclusion,
was, as Kinch had remarked, as secretive as the proverbial oyster.
He was blessed with a singularly clear and logical brain, a brain
that took in not only the facts of any cases he had investigated,
but the psychology of any persons who were concerned in it. And he
had always been more wont to devote himself to severe and
thoughtful analysis, than to spend all his time on the actual
spade-work of an investigation.</p>

<p>Once he had told a friend, when speaking of his methods, that
there were two ways of solving a jigsaw puzzle.</p>

<p>"The first," he had said, "is to work on the shapes of the
pieces, fitting them together irrespective of the picture. The
other is to get hold of a bit of the picture to begin with, and
build the thing up from colour and design rather than from shapes.
Personally, I prefer the latter, because, in a way, the thing
shapes itself. Besides, it's more true to type. In a crime you
rarely have all the pieces to begin with, but you generally have
enough to start a picture."</p>

<p>The particular bit of the picture that was engaging his mind
centred around Sonia Fullinger. He had said nothing to Charlie
about the discovery of Sonia's handkerchief in the Vicar's car; he
did not want to upset the young man. For the finding of the
handkerchief corroborated what Charlie had seen. There could be
little doubt that Sonia was mixed up in things pretty deeply.</p>

<p>And yet, to use the simile of the jigsaw puzzle, though the
pieces in this particular part of it seemed to fit, the "colour
scheme" was not exactly harmonious. Somehow or other, knowing the
girl fairly well, as he did, he could not associate her with
barefaced robbery and participation in a murder&mdash;it seemed so
preposterous. On the other hand, however, it was evident that the
greater crime was unpremeditated, and rested, so it appeared to
Bristow, on chance all along. For it was only by chance that Hurst
had been invited to dinner that night&mdash;only by chance that he
left the house at that late hour. Yet, even to connect Sonia with a
robbery seemed preposterous. Unless&mdash;and it entered his mind
more than once&mdash;his own suggestion to Charlie was true, that
Sonia was really helping Mrs. Cresswell to dispose of those pearls
under the semblance of a robbery.</p>

<p>The two pieces of evidence against her, too, seemed so damning.
Charlie was certain that he saw her come out of the house that
night, and then there was her handkerchief&mdash;found in the
Vicar's car.</p>

<p>Then, in the conflict in his mind between psychology and facts,
he allowed, for the sake of argument, psychology to predominate,
and looked at the problem from the point of view that Sonia was
innocent. That would, of course, entail another explanation of the
facts&mdash;for they <i>had</i> to be explained. Sonia, though
innocent, meeting a man by that tent at half-past one in the
morning, and Sonia's handkerchief being found in the Vicar's car.
<i>What</i> could be the explanation? He took out a notebook, wrote
in it a list of all the persons in the house that night, and
studied it carefully.</p>

<p>An interruption came, however. Footsteps sounded on the gravel
path. Anstice Lynwood was coming slowly along it. He got up and
went to meet her.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Roger," she said, glancing at the notebook he was still
holding. "I hope I didn't disturb you. You look as if you were
composing poetry with that notebook&mdash;and your rather solemn
expression."</p>

<p>"Never wrote verse in my life, Anstice," he replied with a
laugh, "but I <i>was</i> trying to compose something, all the
same."</p>

<p>"What? Is it allowed to ask?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I was trying to figure out the problem of this
tragedy."</p>

<p>"Ah! I'm not surprised at that, Roger. Are you trying to
emulate&mdash;or to rival&mdash;the good Superintendent
Kinch?&mdash;For I rather like him."</p>

<p>"Not exactly. But I'm naturally interested, you know. To a
certain extent it's in my line."</p>

<p>"I felt sure you were, Roger. I couldn't help noticing how
you've been watching the police enquiries. Are you going to help
them?"</p>

<p>"They haven't asked me. No, I'm puzzling over a few ideas of my
own. And I want you to tell me something."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about it, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"I know. But, look here, Anstice. You're a bit observant; you
made a list of the hired costumes and properties for this
Superintendent fellow. Did he do anything about it?"</p>

<p>"<i>He</i> didn't, but his sergeant,&mdash;Mentmore is his name,
I think&mdash;examined the lot, in the tent, after I'd sorted them.
He did that yesterday morning&mdash;when you went into Chiltonbury
with the Superintendent."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;did he? Were you there, Anstice?"</p>

<p>"No, but he saw me afterwards. He wanted to know something."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"He asked me whether there were any other
costumes&mdash;belonging to us or the house-party. I showed him
mine, and daddy's and the rest&mdash;Paul Singleton's and Frank
Underwood's, you know. They were in the house. Then he asked where
Sonia's was. I told him she'd hired it herself and taken it back
with her."</p>

<p>"Oh! Did he want to know where she'd hired it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Rather funny of him, I thought."</p>

<p>"Did you tell him?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She got it from Sparkson's, you know."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>They were strolling slowly along a garden path. For a minute or
two he was silent. Then he said:</p>

<p>"I'm going to ask you rather a curious question, Anstice. And
please don't think that I am suspecting anyone. Can you tell me
whether either of the maids here went into Sonia Fullinger's room,
to call her, on the morning after the pageant?"</p>

<p>Anstice looked surprised.</p>

<p>"Why, no, I don't suppose either of them did. It would be her
own maid,&mdash;yes, of course it was. I remember now. She was
coming out of Sonia's room when I went in."</p>

<p>Roger Bristow stopped short, and turned towards her.</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's capital," he said. "You can tell me just what I
wanted to know. <i>You</i> went into her room, did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You see, I was up early. I meant to have had a canter. And
I just went in to wish her good morning."</p>

<p>"Excellent. Was she awake?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. She was sitting up in bed and drinking her early cup
of tea. I suppose her maid had brought it up."</p>

<p>"And did she say anything about what had happened in the
night&mdash;or did you?"</p>

<p>"Neither of us knew about it then. I didn't hear of it till I
came downstairs, so of course we never spoke of it."</p>

<p>"And she was quite normal&mdash;not flurried, or anything like
that?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course she wasn't, Roger. Whatever are you driving at?"
He ignored the question.</p>

<p>"Now, can you remember," he went on, "whether that Edward the
Sixth's costume she had been wearing the day before was lying about
the room? Did you see it, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did&mdash;part of it, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>damn!</i>" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"You've done me! Never mind. Go on, please, Anstice. You say you
saw <i>part</i> of the costume?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I expect it was all there. Her box was at the foot of
the bed and was open. The costume lay on the top of the things,
folded up. So of course I only saw the bit of it that was
visible."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was all there, right enough. Yes, I see. I've got to
think things out again. They don't fit, somehow. Frightfully decent
of you to tell me all this, Anstice."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to know, Roger? Is&mdash;is there anything
wrong about Sonia?&mdash;no, I don't mean that, of course&mdash;but
do you think that detective-man had something in his
mind&mdash;when he asked me about her costume?"</p>

<p>Again he stopped&mdash;and looked at her gravely.</p>

<p>"I do think so," he said, "and I'm going to take you into my
confidence, because I think, perhaps, you can help me later
on&mdash;when I've thought things over a bit. I may?"</p>

<p>"You can trust me, Roger," replied the girl.</p>

<p>"I know. You mustn't ask me how I know, but I've found
out"&mdash;he was alluding to the handkerchief, and not to
Charlie's story&mdash;"that Sonia Fullinger is in great
danger."</p>

<p>"Roger! She <i>couldn't</i>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't say she <i>did</i>," he interrupted. "You mustn't drop
a hint of this to anyone&mdash;least of all to Charlie."</p>

<p>"Charlie! Poor boy&mdash;yes, I see. Of course I won't."</p>

<p>"Well, if the police knew as much as I do, they'd have no
choice. They would be bound to arrest her, or at any rate to detain
her or keep her under strict observation. I should myself, if I
were a policeman. As it is, I suppose I'm not justified in keeping
what I know from them, but I'm taking the risk."</p>

<p>"But this is simply terrible, Roger!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry. I'm going to do my best to put things
right&mdash;if they can be put right. But the point is that it
seems to me the police have their suspicions. What you've told me
about Mentmore being after that Edward the Sixth costume has made
me think a bit. And this Superintendent fellow is a mighty cute
chap. Well&mdash;I'm going to run up to London tomorrow and see
Sonia Fullinger."</p>

<p>"To warn her?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. I want to ask her one or two questions. And then I
may ask your help. I don't want anyone here to imagine I am making
enquiries."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll do anything I can to help Sonia&mdash;but what
can I do?"</p>

<p>"We'll see. It won't be anything very difficult. Keep this to
yourself, please, Anstice. I must go and use the telephone now. By
the way, when are the Cresswells leaving?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow. But Mrs. Cresswell will have to come down again next
week&mdash;they've told her she will be wanted at the adjourned
inquest."</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought she would."</p>

<p>They were nearing the house now. Out of the front door came
Detective-Sergeant Mentmore.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Bristow, "I'll have a word or two with this fellow."
Anstice went into the house, and Bristow stopped Mentmore. "Still
on the job, sergeant?"</p>

<p>Mentmore looked at him a trifle suspiciously. He still had not
fathomed this ex-Secret Service man.</p>

<p>"By the way," went on Bristow, pleasantly, "we both got a notion
over the amount of petrol used in the Vicar's Morris, this morning,
didn't we? You wanted to know what I thought about it. Well, I'll
tell you. The distance over and above the run to Yew Tree Bottom
would have been&mdash;well&mdash;to Chiltonbury and back, eh?"</p>

<p>Mentmore was cautious. "A very good guess, sir," he replied.</p>

<p>"I expect that applies to both of us, sergeant, eh?"</p>

<p>"Very likely, sir."</p>

<p>Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"And you infer from this that young Curtis drove her into
Chiltonbury and brought the other blackguard out, eh?"</p>

<p>Mentmore was nonplussed. That was his inference, of course, but
he hesitated to admit it. He meant to be cautious with Bristow.</p>

<p>"It might have happened," he admitted.</p>

<p>Again Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he said, "let's suppose it did. Now, may I ask you a
question, sergeant?"</p>

<p>"I don't promise to answer it, sir."</p>

<p>"Quite so. But I'll ask it, all the same. Only one man drove
that car into Yew Tree Bottom. Which do you think it was&mdash;the
Vicar's nephew or the other fellow?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind telling you that I'm hanged if I know what to
think about that, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I wouldn't mind betting a fiver that it wasn't young
Curtis. And I'll go on to say that the key to the puzzle lies in
the personality of the other fellow. May I give you a hint,
sergeant?"</p>

<p>"I'm always grateful for information, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, where did this fellow make for after he abandoned the
car? Isn't it just possible that instead of making for a railway he
may have cut over the downs to the main London road and got a lift
on a lorry or something?"</p>

<p>In reply, Detective-Sergeant Mentmore laughed.</p>

<p>"We're not all fools, sir," he said. "Give us credit for a
little sense. It's a big job, but we're trying to make a list of
vehicles running along that road from three o'clock the other
morning onwards. Don't suppose we shall get 'em all, but a couple
of dozen drivers have been interviewed already."</p>

<p>"Good business!" said Bristow. "I beg your pardon for mentioning
it, sergeant."</p>

<p>"That's all right, sir," replied Mentmore, relaxing a little.
"It was smart of you to think of it, if I may say so."</p>

<p>Bristow wished him good day and passed on. In a few minutes he
was in the hall of Frimley Manor, making a trunk call on the
telephone.</p>

<p>"Hullo&mdash;Are you Sparkson's?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Captain Bristow speaking. I want a word with Mr. Sparkson, if
he's in."</p>

<p>"Hold on, sir, please."</p>

<p>In a few moments Sparkson himself spoke.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Captain Bristow? Yes, sir. What can I do for you?"</p>

<p>"You supplied me with costumes for the pageant here&mdash;I'm
speaking from Frimley Manor&mdash;near Chiltonbury."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That's right."</p>

<p>"I believe some of the actors hired their own costumes from you,
Sparkson?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think they did."</p>

<p>"There was a Miss Fullinger&mdash;she had a male Tudor
dress&mdash;she played King Edward the Sixth."</p>

<p>There was a slight pause. Then Mr. Sparkson said:</p>

<p>"Oh!...Yes."</p>

<p>"Has she sent it back?"</p>

<p>Another slight pause...then the answer:</p>

<p>"It came in this morning."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you'd reserve it for me, Sparkson. I may be
wanting it. I shall be in London tomorrow, and I'll call."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure, sir,...whether I can let you have it. I'll
see."</p>

<p>"It isn't hired, is it?"</p>

<p>"N-no. Not exactly."</p>

<p>Bristow smiled. He guessed pretty shrewdly what was in
Sparkson's mind. Kinch <i>was</i> after that costume, then.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," he said. "I'll call tomorrow, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I've another Tudor dress&mdash;same size&mdash;" began
Sparkson, but Bristow interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Never mind now&mdash;see you tomorrow. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Now," said Bristow, to himself, "who is going to be the first
to see that costume? Kinch's man or I? It doesn't much matter,
though. I don't suppose Kinch is after what's in <i>my</i> mind. I
wonder what he <i>is</i> after!"</p>

<p>It was after dinner that night that the Vicar called. He asked
Sir Harry if he might speak to him privately. He also asked if
Captain Bristow might be present. The three men went into the
library.</p>

<p>"I've come to tell you something," said the Vicar, when they
were alone. "I've had a message from Superintendent Kinch. My
nephew has been found."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Sir Harry. "Where?"</p>

<p>The Vicar shook his head, sadly.</p>

<p>"From what Kinch tells me I don't like it at all," he replied.
"He was on his way to the Continent&mdash;just about to embark on
the afternoon boat from Folkestone to Boulogne."</p>

<p>"Ah," remarked Bristow. "Of course they'd be looking out for him
at all the ports. That's a foregone conclusion. I suppose Kinch
told you he'd be brought to Chiltonbury?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He expects him here late tonight, by the train arriving at
ten-forty."</p>

<p>"Have they arrested him?" asked Sir Harry.</p>

<p>"Kinch didn't use that word. He said they were bound to detain
him."</p>

<p>"That means," explained Bristow, "that they have made no formal
charge against him as yet. They'll question him, of course. And you
mustn't be surprised if they arrest him. It all depends upon
whether he can give an account of himself and prove an alibi, if he
was not here at the time poor Hurst was done in. Of course you'll
be allowed to see him, Vicar."</p>

<p>"Yes. Kinch told me that. I've come round to ask your advice. Do
you think I ought to go to Chiltonbury tonight and see him?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ashley-Smith turned instinctively to Captain Bristow as he
asked the question.</p>

<p>"I should wait till tomorrow. He won't be here till late
tonight, and Kinch will want to put him through a catechism. Better
see him after that has happened."</p>

<p>"I suppose you wouldn't go in with me, Bristow? It would be kind
of you."</p>

<p>"I'll do that with pleasure&mdash;providing you don't mind going
in early&mdash;directly after breakfast. I want to catch the
ten-twenty to London."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Vicar. "I'll run you in. I'll call for you
here at nine o'clock. It is exceedingly good of you."</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Bristow, with a smile. "I'm very curious
to see your nephew and to hear what he has to say for himself. I've
been formulating my own ideas about him, and I want to see if I'm
anyway right."</p>

<p>"Looks rather nasty, though," said Sir Harry, "trying to get
away by the Channel boat, eh?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," said Bristow. "Hundreds of people cross the
Channel every day without anything against them. Anyhow, Vicar," he
went on to Mr. Ashley-Smith, "I shouldn't worry too much. Wait and
hear what sort of an explanation he has to give."</p>

<p>"Well, there's one thing about Leonard," said the Vicar, getting
up to go. "He's given me a deal of trouble, but I've never known
him tell a lie."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Sir Harry, "why not telephone to the
police-station now to tell them you'll be there early
tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Thanks very much. I will."</p>

<p>Kinch replied.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," he said; "that will suit quite nicely. I'd
like to be here when you come&mdash;and I have to catch the
ten-twenty train. I'll expect you a little after nine."</p>

<p>"I'm bringing Captain Bristow with me," went on the Vicar. There
was a little chuckle in reply, and then Kinch said:</p>

<p>"I thought probably you would. Good night, sir.&mdash;I'm very
sorry to cause you all this trouble, but I've got my duty to
do."</p>

<p>The Vicar replaced the receiver and turned to Bristow.</p>

<p>"That's settled," he said. "An early interview suits
Superintendent Kinch. <i>He</i> wants to catch the ten-twenty
train, it appears."</p>

<p>Bristow smiled.</p>

<p>"Oh, he does, does he? We may be bound for the same
destination."</p>

<p>"Why, of course you will be," said Sir Harry. "The ten-twenty's
an express&mdash;to London. Doesn't stop anywhere."</p>

<p>Captain Bristow lingered in the smoking-room with Charles
Lynwood that night after the others had retired. He did not tell
Charlie of his discovery about Sonia Fullinger's handkerchief, but
he questioned the young man minutely about his seeing Sonia outside
the Manor House on the night of the tragedy. He seemed particularly
anxious to know if she was wearing the cap belonging to the Tudor
costume, as well as the rest of it. Charlie said she was. He begged
Bristow to tell him whether he had found out anything that would
help. But all that Bristow would say was:</p>

<p>"I haven't made much progress, Charlie, but I've got an idea.
Mind you, it's a <i>very</i> hazy one&mdash;and may come to
nothing. It's far-fetched&mdash;but there's a chance in a thousand
that it may help, and I'm going to see if the chance exists. It's
something that happened years ago in an investigation with which I
was concerned&mdash;a bit of detective work which a colleague of
mine carried through, so it's not original. I chanced to remember
it, and I'm going to put it to the test. Apart from that, I'm more
than ever puzzled concerning what you've told me about Sonia."<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>Someone else was sitting up late that night, to wit, Major
Bainbridge, the Chief Constable. His wife had gone to bed, leaving
him poring over a particularly stiff crossword puzzle. He was fond
of crosswords, and hated being baulked by them. With the help of a
big dictionary he had just solved the last two clues, and gave a
sigh of satisfaction as he pencilled in the words, leaned back in
his chair, and re-lighted his pipe.</p>

<p>Then he opened a drawer of the knee-hole table at which he was
seated, and produced a notebook. Had Kinch, or any other
subordinate officer of the County police, seen that notebook, they
would probably have been a little surprised. In his dealings with
them the Major was always so diffident, so self-effacing in the
matter of investigation of criminal or other cases. He so often
said he was not a "policeman," and that it was their work to probe
the mysteries of their craft.</p>

<p>And yet, in that fat, carefully-written notebook, were records
of a hundred and one cases; and Kinch and others, had they read
them, might have found the bases of some of those "suggestions"
which the Chief Constable sometimes threw out so unobtrusively,
"suggestions" which, somehow or other, were generally worth
following out.</p>

<p>Certainly Kinch would have been surprised had he seen what was
freshly written under the heading of "Frimley Manor&mdash;Murder
and Robbery." There was the case meticulously tabulated in every
detail that had come under his notice from the Superintendent's
notes or his own observation.</p>

<p>Every person who had been connected with the drama was
tabulated, with remarks against each, many of them having only a
brief word or two, such as "Knows nothing," "Stupid ass,"
"Nonentity," and so forth.</p>

<p>Against Bristow was written:</p>

<p>"Fellow who solved the Roumanian Treaty theft. Also the
disappearance of Paul Koravitch. Very clever. Evidently is working
quietly and has theories. Ought to be taken into confidence at the
right moment. Have suggested this to Kinch."</p>

<p>Charles Lynwood did not come out of it quite satisfactorily.</p>

<p>"Believe he is sweet on Sonia Fullinger. Remember noticing when
dining at Frimley Manor last Christmas, when both of them were
staying there. He doesn't seem comfortable about something. Would
shield the Fullinger girl if he suspected anything about her.</p>

<p>"Sonia Fullinger. Kinch has got his knife into her. Suspicious.
Not much to go upon yet. Possible developments."</p>

<p>Mrs. Cresswell would not have cared to have seen the note
against her name.</p>

<p>"Silly female. Serve her damn well right."</p>

<p>Major Bainbridge proceeded to add to his notes a prcis of the
Inquest that morning. Also the account which Westerham had given of
Hurst. He read them over. Then wrote:</p>

<p>"Suggestion. Try to find Hurst's wife. She might be induced to
throw some light on matters."</p>

<p>He was about to close the book and go to bed, when, glancing at
it once more, he took up his fountain-pen again and made a further
note:</p>

<p>"Hurst's last words&mdash;'the line.' What did they mean? A
point which seems to have been overlooked by all of us, so far.
Worth considering, though."</p>

<p>He leaned back in his chair: his glance fell on the nine bulky
volumes of the "Century Dictionary," in their own little book-case.
He was constantly using the Dictionary in solving those abstruse
crosswords which were his hobby. He picked out one of the volumes,
opened it, and turned to the word "Line." There were six long
columns devoted to this little word, containing every possible
meaning and combination. "A cord&mdash;a rope&mdash;a lot or
portion&mdash;a limit&mdash;a short letter&mdash;a row&mdash;a
service...a line of shipping&mdash;a railroad&mdash;a
telegraph-wire. Line of direction&mdash;line of health&mdash;line
of life...To draw the line&mdash;to drop a line." All kinds of
phrases in which the word "line" occurred, with its various
meanings.</p>

<p>There was nothing to help him. Then he tried "Lime..." The sound
of an "m" might easily have been mistaken for that of an "n" in
that faint whisper made by a dying man.
"Lime-burner&mdash;Lime-flower&mdash;Lime-hound&mdash;Lime-juice&mdash;Lime-kiln&mdash;<i>Lime-tree</i>!"
Ah! Here was a possible clue to its meaning. There were plenty of
trees about that marquee. He would find out if one of them was a
lime. Even then it was all very vague.</p>

<p>But it was as good, if not better than a crossword puzzle.</p>

<p>"I'll get to the bottom of it <i>somehow</i>," he said,
half-aloud. Then he put the volume of the dictionary back in the
book-case, and took himself off to bed.</p>

<h2>Chapter 11</h2>

<p>Superintendent Kinch received Mr. Ashley-Smith and Captain
Bristow in his office the following morning.</p>

<p>"You'll find your nephew in my house, sir," he said to the
Vicar. "I'll take you to him at once, but I'd like a word with you
afterwards. I've made him as comfortable as I could," he added.</p>

<p>"You haven't arrested him?" asked Bristow.</p>

<p>"I have not, Captain Bristow,&mdash;so far; though I think I
should be justified in doing so."</p>

<p>"Hasn't he given an explanation?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes,&mdash;he's got a story. Told me it last night. Of
course, if it's true..." and he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Don't you believe him, then?" asked the Vicar.</p>

<p>Kinch laughed.</p>

<p>"We have to be skeptical, Mr. Ashley-Smith, in our profession.
Still&mdash;I admit there is something in his favour." He turned to
Captain Bristow, and went on, dryly:</p>

<p>"I believe you were making enquiries at the railway-station here
the other morning about the signalling of the train, Captain
Bristow?"</p>

<p>"Ah," replied Bristow, "you found that out, did you? Well, had
it anything to do with Curtis' story?"</p>

<p>"You go with the Vicar and hear what he's got to say, sir.
Anyhow, I can compliment you on a shrewd guess as to possibilities.
Come along, gentlemen, please."</p>

<p>He led the way from his office into the part of the building
which was his private residence. In a small room, overlooking a
courtyard, sat a young man, reading a newspaper and smoking a
cigarette; a young man with fair, curly hair, fresh complexion and
blue eyes, who sprang up from his seat as they entered.</p>

<p>"Hullo, uncle! I say, this is frightfully decent of you to come
and see me after all the bother I seem to have caused you;
especially as the Superintendent here thinks I've done a man
in."</p>

<p>"Now, now, Mr. Curtis," said Kinch, "I never said that, you
know."</p>

<p>"You never <i>said</i> it, but you implied it. He put me through
the third degree last night, uncle. And I'm expecting him any
moment now&mdash;after he's got all he can out of me&mdash;to
arrest me and warn me that anything I say may be taken down and
used in evidence&mdash;that's the right formula, isn't it,
Superintendent?"</p>

<p>At last his uncle got a word in.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry to see you here, Leonard. I hope with all my
heart that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not guilty, uncle! Not guilty! The foreman of the jury added
that he wished to say that his colleagues were of opinion, however,
that the prisoner was a bally fool&mdash;so the learned judge
discharged him with a caution."</p>

<p>Kinch shook his head.</p>

<p>"I hope you may be able to prove that, Mr. Curtis, but I warn
you that you are in a very serious position&mdash;and now," he
added, "I'll leave you for a little while."</p>

<p>"He's really quite a decent chap," said the imperturbable young
man, when Kinch had gone out of the room. "Gave me a stunning
breakfast. I'm frightfully sorry about it all, uncle, but,
honestly, I haven't done anything really wrong."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to hear you say that, Leonard. And now, let me
introduce you to Captain Bristow. He is staying at Frimley Manor,
and I think I may say you can rely upon him to help you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say," said Curtis, shaking hands with Bristow, "I've just
been reading about you. You're the chap that discovered the thing,
aren't you? And saw me driving my uncle's car down the drive?"</p>

<p>"I never said so," replied Bristow, smiling in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>"No, but it <i>did</i> look like it, didn't it? I should have
thought it was me&mdash;excuse bad grammar&mdash;if I'd seen it.
You know, uncle," he went on, "until a fellow in plain clothes gave
me a start by clapping his hand on my shoulder at Folkestone
yesterday afternoon, I'd never even heard of this affair at Frimley
Manor."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;surely you saw it in the papers?" asked Bristow.
Curtis shook his head.</p>

<p>"Never read 'em," he replied, "except the sporting page. And for
the last three or four days I haven't even bothered about that.
Till the Superintendent brought me in all these papers with my
breakfast I'd never read a word about the case. I say, though, I
<i>have</i> been and gone and done it! No wonder they were after
me!"</p>

<p>"Now, Leonard, I want you to tell me all about it," said the
Vicar. "I've been terribly worried&mdash;more than I can say. I
want your explanation first, and then we'll see what is best to be
done. And I know Captain Bristow will advise us."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, uncle," replied the young man. "I'll tell you
the whole thing from the beginning. I know," he went on, with a
more serious tone in his voice, "that I'm in a nasty hole&mdash;and
that it's my own fault I'm there. So I'll be glad of any help to
get out of it. Let's see: I'll begin at the beginning."</p>

<p>"Go on," said his uncle.</p>

<p>"Well, you know last time I was down with you, you gave me a
hectic discourse on my degenerate life, and ended up by saying
you'd have nothing more to do with me till I turned over the
proverbial new leaf and qualified for sainthood."</p>

<p>"You deserved all I said, Leonard."</p>

<p>"I agree&mdash;entirely. Frightfully bad hat and all that sort
of thing, wasn't I? Stern uncle&mdash;ungrateful nephew. Quite all
right. But, you know, that lurid lecture of yours touched me on the
raw, somehow. And I went away with the heroic determination to turn
over that new leaf. Worst of it was, the leaf itself wasn't so easy
to find&mdash;you can't get 'em at Woolworth's for
six-pence&mdash;and it was a long time before one put in its
appearance. When it did, I began the turning process."</p>

<p>"You aren't very explicit, Leonard."</p>

<p>"Well, it was like this. I met a johnny connected with the wine
trade&mdash;a sort of sleeping partner in a vineyard near Bordeaux.
He lives at Exeter, but has an office in London&mdash;imports wine,
you know. His brother-in-law, the actual partner, is a
Frenchman&mdash;at Bordeaux&mdash;and he wrote and asked for an
English clerk to go over to the business there&mdash;one who could
speak and write French fluently. And that's one of my few
accomplishments. The end of it was that Hazell&mdash;that's the
Exeter johnny&mdash;offered me the post, but I was to go in a deuce
of a hurry&mdash;yesterday, in fact. It meant a frightful rush,
getting a passport, and so on, and I had to run down to Exeter the
day before I left to get final instructions.</p>

<p>"Well, the day all this caboodle happened at Frimley I suddenly
made up my mind I'd run down and see you&mdash;repentant prodigal
and all that sort of thing. And I won't deny I was going to touch
you for a tenner&mdash;I was desperately hard up. I acted on the
impulse of the moment, took the next train to Chiltonbury, and
walked out to your Vicarage. That rummy old housekeeper of
yours&mdash;Mrs. Ayres&mdash;told me you were playing the giddy
goat up at the Manor."</p>

<p>"Oh, come," broke in the Vicar, "she hardly put it like
that!"</p>

<p>"Well, she said you were acting in a pageant, but that she
expected you home to dinner. It wasn't much use trying to see you
while you were&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Playing the giddy goat?" suggested Bristow.</p>

<p>"Exactly! So I thought I'd wait. Mrs. Ayres got me some dinner.
She said she was sure you'd be in soon, and as I never knew you as
a dissipated night-bird, I went on waiting&mdash;even after Mrs.
Ayres and the maid went to bed, about ten. Then I began to be a bit
anxious&mdash;you see, I had to get back to London that night
because of starting off to Exeter early the next morning. And the
last train left Chiltonbury at eleven-twenty-three. It got towards
that time&mdash;I still hung on. I thought if you <i>did</i> come
back, you'd run me into the station."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the Vicar. "You did, did you?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's always up to a parson to act the Good Samaritan.
Then&mdash;I'd had a busy day&mdash;I suppose I must have dropped
off to sleep for a few minutes&mdash;in that comfortable arm-chair
of yours. I woke with a start and looked at the clock on the
mantelpiece. And I saw I could only catch that train by the skin of
my teeth."</p>

<p>"Rather a mixed metaphor," remarked the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Isn't it? But it explains. I couldn't rouse Mrs. Ayres to give
her a message&mdash;not decent. There was not time to write one. I
made a rush for your garage and got your old 'bus out."</p>

<p>"Would you mind telling me what you meant to do with her?" asked
the Vicar, dryly.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was all right. I thought I should have time, before
catching the train, to run her into the yard of the King's Arms,
ask them to garage her for the night and either drive her out to
you in the morning or send for you to come in for her. But there
wasn't time. As I ran over the railway bridge I saw I should have
to drive like the devil."</p>

<p>Bristow interrupted.</p>

<p>"You mean you saw the train was signalled?"</p>

<p>"You've hit it, sir. There's a signal-post just by the bridge,
and the green light was showing for the up-train. I ran her through
Chiltonbury to the station at about forty&mdash;not so bad for your
old 'bus, uncle. And the train had come into the station as I
pulled up outside. There wasn't any time to see anyone. I just left
her standing there, dashed on to the platform, and caught the train
while she was moving off."</p>

<p>"And what did you suppose was going to happen to my car, I
should like to know?" asked his uncle.</p>

<p>The young man lighted a fresh cigarette, shrugged his shoulders,
and replied:</p>

<p>"What do you suppose? I knew no one was likely to steal a
dilapidated five-year-old Morris. And it was a perfectly fine
night. I thought, of course, that someone would find it standing
there&mdash;the police, very likely,&mdash;and, of course, they'd
soon discover, by her number, whose she was. It didn't seem to me
there was anything to bother about. I say, though," he went on,
turning to Captain Bristow, "it seems someone <i>did</i> run off
with her, though?"</p>

<p>"Just what I suspected all along," replied Bristow, "and that's
the trouble, my young friend!"</p>

<p>"But you believe me?" asked Curtis.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. You see, putting two and two
together&mdash;especially what your uncle here told me about the
sort of chap you are&mdash;I'd formed the conclusion that something
of the kind had happened."</p>

<p>"You've told all this to the Superintendent, I suppose?" asked
the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Rather. But he's skeptical. Besides&mdash;there's another
thing. That scarf of mine."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Bristow, "Kinch has tackled you about that scarf, has
he? What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Told me it was found in a tent at the Manor, and asked me if I
could account for it."</p>

<p>"And you said?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't. I missed it after I'd got into the train. I
remember taking it with my overcoat from the hall in the Vicarage,
but I didn't put it on. Whether I dropped it in the garage in my
hurry or left it in the car, I don't know."</p>

<p>"No doubt about that," said Bristow. "You left it in the car, of
course."</p>

<p>"But," exclaimed the Vicar, "surely you can prove all this,
Leonard? And that ought to convince the Superintendent."</p>

<p>"Unfortunately I can't," replied his nephew.</p>

<p>"Better finish your story," said Bristow. "What happened
later?"</p>

<p>"As soon as I reached London I took a 'bus along the Harrow
Road. A pal of mine had lent me a tiny flat for a week&mdash;while
he was away. There was absolutely no one else in the place when I
got there; otherwise, of course, I could prove an alibi."</p>

<p>"Oh, but there are other ways of doing that," said Bristow.
"Naturally an alibi next morning wouldn't do, but wasn't there
anyone you spoke to&mdash;in the train, for instance?"</p>

<p>"There was. A testy old fool, who lectured me when I scrambled
into the compartment. Unfortunately, I told him to go to blazes, so
he's not likely to be much help."</p>

<p>Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," he said, "he'd remember you all the more.
We've got to get hold of him, somehow, if we can. Have you told
Kinch about him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes,&mdash;of course I have. But he didn't seem to take
much notice. Look here, sir,&mdash;what do you think is going to
happen? I ought to be on my way to Bordeaux, you know. I don't want
to lose that job. How long are they likely to keep me here?"</p>

<p>"That I can't tell you," replied Bristow. "The Superintendent
can only <i>detain</i> you for a limited time, and even if he lets
you go, it's pretty certain he'll want you for the adjourned
inquest&mdash;and that he'll keep you under observation meanwhile.
But he may go further than that&mdash;he may charge you formally,
and then it's a question of a magistrate's court, at least. You'll
admit you've been foolish?"</p>

<p>"I know I have. But&mdash;suppose I'm arrested?"</p>

<p>"We must do our best, Leonard," said his uncle. "You may be sure
I'll do all I can. Do you think," he went on, speaking to Bristow,
"that I'd better consult a lawyer?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't do that yet, Vicar. Wait and see what happens.
There'll be time enough to call in legal aid when Kinch charges
him&mdash;if he does. But, somehow, I don't think the
Superintendent is quite so sure of things as he was, and you must
remember that the police are not stupid&mdash;they never want to
bring a charge unless they think they can prove it. Kinch may not
have said as much to you," he went on, to the young man, "but I
shall be very much surprised if he hasn't already taken steps to
see if there is any truth in what you have told him. And I shall
ask him presently."</p>

<p>"It's frightfully good of you to help me, sir; isn't it,
uncle?"</p>

<p>"More than you know, Leonard. Captain Bristow is accustomed to
probing criminal cases. I may tell you he made a
reputation&mdash;when he was in the Secret Service."</p>

<p>Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," he said, "this particular case interests
me&mdash;more so than ever now, because one bit of my theory has
proved correct&mdash;Yes?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, gentlemen," said Kinch, who had come into the room, "but
I shall have to ask you to leave now. I shall see you this evening,
Mr. Curtis," he added, to the young man. "I'm afraid you must
remain here, but I've given orders to make you comfortable. Would
you like some books to read?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Curtis. "I'd like a good detective story&mdash;about
some poor devil who gets arrested for what he hasn't done by a
Superintendent who repents his folly in sackcloth and ashes later
on, when Captain Sherlock Holmes Bristow solves the crime."</p>

<p>Kinch laughed.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind a bit if he did," he replied. "All right. You
shall have something to read."</p>

<p>"The Chief Constable is in my office," he went on, to the Vicar,
as they left the room. "He'd like to have a word with you, sir."
Major Bainbridge greeted them.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry for your trouble, Vicar,&mdash;about your
nephew."</p>

<p>"Kinch has told you&mdash;" began the Vicar.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. I've just read the young man's statement. I'm not
going to comment on it just now, but you may be sure, if there's
anything in it, we shall do our best. But I just want to ask you
something, Vicar. You know the grounds of Frimley Manor pretty
well, don't you?"</p>

<p>"I ought to, Major. I've been Vicar of Frimley for over fifteen
years."</p>

<p>"I know. Well, can you tell me&mdash;Has Sir Harry got any
lime-trees&mdash;near where that marquee stood?"</p>

<p>Captain Bristow looked at the Chief Constable curiously. It
sounded such a strange question.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I can tell you that," replied the Vicar. "There isn't
a single lime-tree in the grounds of Frimley Manor."</p>

<p>"Oh!" ejaculated Major Bainbridge. "You're quite sure?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely."</p>

<p>"You'll excuse, me, sir," broke in Kinch, speaking to his Chief,
"but I have a train to catch."</p>

<p>"I know, Kinch. See you later. Don't go yet, Vicar,&mdash;or
you, Captain Bristow."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;but I have a train to catch, too," said Bristow. He
turned to Kinch, who was in plain clothes. "We might travel
together, Superintendent, if you're going to London?"</p>

<p>"Good," muttered the Chief Constable, beneath his breath.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are going to London?" said Bristow to the
Superintendent as the two went out to the street.</p>

<p>"Well, yes. As a matter of fact, I am. Glad of your company,
sir," he added, with a swift glance at his companion.</p>

<p>Bristow talked about ordinary topics on their way to the
station. At the booking-office he asked for two first-class return
tickets.</p>

<p>"All right," he exclaimed, as the other expostulated, "we are
more likely to be alone if we go first&mdash;and there are one or
two things I want to ask you."</p>

<p>As soon as the train moved off, Bristow began:</p>

<p>"I haven't said much to you about this Frimley case,
Superintendent," he said, "and I don't want to interfere with you
in any way&mdash;I know you're doing smart work. Also, I'm not
trying to get anything out of you, but I just wanted to say a word
about this young Curtis."</p>

<p>"Right, sir," replied the Superintendent. "I suppose he told you
his story?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What do you think of it?"</p>

<p>Kinch smiled.</p>

<p>"In a serious case like this we have to be cautious, Captain
Bristow. And I like to have things verified before I express an
opinion. What do you think of it, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well, to begin with, I think every effort should be made, from
pure justice, to try to get corroboration&mdash;if it's possible.
That old gentleman in the train, for instance,&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kinch interrupted with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Give me a little credit, sir," he said. "I'm doing my best. The
evening papers will have a note of that&mdash;asking for the old
gentleman in question. Reporters are a bit useful sometimes. The
ticket-collector on duty at Chiltonbury that night will be seen
presently, and asked if anyone rushed by him to catch the train as
it moved off. The guard of the train will be questioned. I've
already 'phoned the divisional superintendent of the district in
which that flat off the Harrow Road is situated, and asked him to
enquire if anyone saw Mr. Curtis enter it late that night. And
we're in communication with this fellow at Exeter, who&mdash;so
Curtis says&mdash;was sending him to Bordeaux. I tell you, sir, I
don't want to charge a man with participation in a serious crime
unless I honestly have good reason to believe he is implicated. You
know that."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" exclaimed Bristow. "You're thorough!"</p>

<p>Kinch smiled with pleasure at the well-deserved compliment.
"Now, perhaps, you'll tell me what you think, Captain Bristow?"</p>

<p>"I will. I believe young Curtis' story in every detail, because
it is the only one which fits in with the facts of the case. I
daresay if I could read your mind I should see that you've a pretty
strong leaning to that opinion yourself. Look at what took place.
Curtis comes down to Frimley Vicarage in an unpremeditated
way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We don't know that, sir."</p>

<p>"Not absolutely. But he evidently wanted to see his uncle."</p>

<p>"He might not. He might have known beforehand that the Vicar
would be at the pageant."</p>

<p>"Granted. But he didn't know the Vicar would be staying so late
at the Manor, did he?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I suppose not."</p>

<p>"Very well. Then imagine that his uncle had returned while he
was there&mdash;wouldn't that have put the lid on any nefarious
plan?"</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. He could have left the Vicarage in
time&mdash;to keep an appointment."</p>

<p>"With whom?"</p>

<p>"The other man&mdash;whoever he was."</p>

<p>"But this other man was wrecked in the car, on his way down to
Chiltonbury. And Curtis couldn't have known that."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but the arrangement might have been for Curtis to
meet him with a car, at Chiltonbury&mdash;and drive him out."</p>

<p>"But, in that case, with the Vicar at home, he'd hardly have
taken his uncle's car from the garage."</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;perhaps not."</p>

<p>"I tell you, Superintendent, that, from the first, I never
suspected young Curtis of complicity. I asked myself the simple
question, Why did he want the car, and <i>what time</i> did he take
her out of the garage? There were several answers to that question,
I admit, but the most obvious one was that he wanted to catch the
last train from Chiltonbury to London. It was the only answer to
the fitting-in of the times. Now then?"</p>

<p>Kinch looked at Bristow, a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>"I thought that was your theory, Captain Bristow."</p>

<p>"Why? I never said anything."</p>

<p>"No, but you made enquiries about that train&mdash;and when she
was signalled."</p>

<p>Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"One to you," he said.</p>

<p>"And I <i>may</i> say, sir," Kinch went on slowly, "that it is
one of the theories I formed myself. I express no further opinion
at the moment. But go on, Captain Bristow. Put this young man on
one side, then. Is it too much to ask you what you think really
took place?"</p>

<p>"No. Especially as, up to a point, I believe we shall be in
agreement. Don't tell me anything you had rather not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You may be sure I shan't do that, sir," broke in Kinch,
dryly.</p>

<p>"Quite so. But&mdash;as far as you choose&mdash;let's see where
we are in agreement. In the first place, then, you probably admit
that this was a premeditated crime?"</p>

<p>"The robbery of the necklace was&mdash;most decidedly. The
murder, though,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Exactly. I quite agree. Well, then, you'll probably go on to
admit there was someone on the spot beforehand who was in
collusion?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think so?" asked Kinch, cautiously.</p>

<p>"Certainly I do."</p>

<p>"And I believe," went on Bristow, with a twinkle in his eye,
"that you have a theory as to who that person was."</p>

<p>"I may have," retorted Kinch.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll agree to leave that alone."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;but, excuse me, sir,&mdash;have you got a theory?"</p>

<p>"I may have." Bristow answered him in his own phrase, and
laughed.</p>

<p>"So we agree again, then, sir."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. But to go on. Then there was the actual person
who was to come and take the jewels away. He starts in a car
bearing a false registration-mark. On the way down it is wrecked.
He has just time to take the last train from Drifford on to
Chiltonbury, having first removed the registration-plates, which he
throws out of the window. An artful fellow, this, Superintendent.
And a dangerous one. He is prepared for all emergencies, and seems
to have carried a very useful little weapon&mdash;that
knuckle-duster. A professional, this chap,&mdash;don't you think
so?"</p>

<p>Kinch nodded.</p>

<p>"Go on," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, he has to get out to Frimley Manor by a certain
hour&mdash;that was arranged with that person whom neither of us
will mention. He would probably have done so if he had sprinted on
foot, and possibly meant to do this. It would be dangerous to hire
a car at Chiltonbury that time of night. But, on coming out into
the yard outside the station, he sees the Vicar's Morris standing
there, unattended. He looks about. The few passengers off the train
disappear. So he gets into that car and runs out to Frimley,
entering the Manor grounds from the main road&mdash;through the
gateway. The gate, by the way, was open."</p>

<p>"How do you know that, sir?"</p>

<p>"By the same means you know it, Superintendent. I made
enquiries."</p>

<p>Kinch slapped his knee. "By George, you're a deep one, sir!
Well, what then?"</p>

<p>"He runs the car part of the way along the drive, gets out, and
leaves her there, having reversed her first. Now, what exactly took
place after that is not so easy to surmise. But I can't help
thinking that, in some way or other, Jasper Hurst had had his
suspicions aroused. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"Well, there's no harm telling you. I <i>know</i> he had!"</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought so. Recognised someone&mdash;at the pageant, eh?"
Kinch nodded.</p>

<p>"And, being disguised by a false beard and moustache, was not
recognised himself?"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;well," remarked the Superintendent, "quite possible.
But now that we know who he was, it is also possible that the
person he recognised never even knew him. He was in our profession,
so to speak. A private inquiry agent knows many individuals with
something shady about them, without it being necessary that they
even know him by sight."</p>

<p>"Somehow I thought you'd have that sort of theory," said
Bristow. "Why?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I may be wrong. But to return to our reconstruction.
Let us suppose that Hurst, on his way down the drive, sees this
other fellow, without being seen by him, shadows him, and, finally,
when Mrs. Cresswell's pearls are brought out to him, suddenly
attacks, with the hope of rescuing them&mdash;with the fatal result
we know. He wasn't dead, and they never meant to kill him. But he
knew too much, and they daren't leave him there to recover his
senses and split on them. The sedan-chair was the easiest way to
carry him to the car. At that stage it was kidnapping, not murder.
Don't you agree?"</p>

<p>Kinch nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, slowly, "I think there's a lot in what you say,
sir. Only you've made one mistake all along."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"You kept on talking about one man who came down in the car. But
there were two of 'em, Captain Bristow."</p>

<p>Bristow put on an air of puzzled innocence.</p>

<p>"Were there?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, you said two men&mdash;to begin with."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Why, when you telephoned that night&mdash;and when I came out
to the scene of the crime&mdash;and in your evidence at the
inquest. You said you distinctly saw two persons getting away in
the car."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. So I did."</p>

<p>"Well, <i>didn't</i> you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, then,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Superintendent," said Bristow, "what I said was
perfectly correct. But I fancy the solution to the riddle lies in
the fact that the gate leading into the high-road was open. Think
it over&mdash;I'm not going to say anything more about it now.
Anyhow, only <i>one</i> man ran the car into Yew Tree
Bottom&mdash;and got away from there with the pearls&mdash;leaving
the empty case behind. And that's the beggar you want."</p>

<p>"I wish to the Lord I could get him, sir. I believe, however,
I've heard of him since."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"My sergeant&mdash;Mentmore&mdash;came in to report this
morning. He's a good man, that. Last evening he got hold of the
driver of a lorry&mdash;from Birmingham to Oxford, on the night of
the murder, or, rather, in the early morning. He says he gave a man
a lift from Dinworth to London&mdash;or, rather, as far as Ealing,
where he got off. And Dinworth is only three miles, across the
downs, from Yew Tree Bottom."</p>

<p>"Could he describe the man?"</p>

<p>"No, worse luck. There was no room by the driver's seat, and the
fellow scrambled up behind. The only thing he noticed about him was
that he spoke with a peculiar accent. Might have been a foreigner,
he says. He had his hat drawn over his face, and the lorry-driver
didn't get a good look at him."</p>

<p>"Interesting. Done anything about it?"</p>

<p>Kinch shrugged his shoulders, but made no reply. The train was
running through tunnels and nearing the terminus. Kinch looked at
his notebook for a minute or two, replaced it, and said:</p>

<p>"Well, I've enjoyed the run, sir. As a matter of fact, I knew of
your reputation, and I wondered, more than once, what your ideas
about things were. Once or twice I was on the point of asking you.
There's nothing else you'd like to tell me, I suppose?"</p>

<p>In reply Bristow said:</p>

<p>"Has Mr. Cresswell offered a reward for those pearls?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Cresswell? No, sir. Not that I know of...Well, I'll be
wishing you good morning, sir..." for the train was drawing up at
the platform.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Bristow nonchalantly, "is it worth while to engage
two taxis when one will do? Won't you share mine?"</p>

<p>"It's very kind of you, Captain Bristow, but&mdash;er&mdash;I
won't bother you to go out of your way."</p>

<p>"I shan't be going out of my way," retorted Bristow, with a
laugh. "At least, I don't suppose so. I expect we're both bound for
the same destination, aren't we?"</p>

<p>"Where's that, sir?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;Sparkson's."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned!" ejaculated Superintendent Kinch.</p>

<h2>Chapter 12</h2>

<p>Superintendent Kinch suffered himself to be led by Captain
Bristow to a waiting taxi, and got in with him. Bristow gave the
destination to the driver, and they moved off. Then Kinch
began:</p>

<p>"Look here, sir," he said, "I don't mind accepting your offer of
a lift, but I do want to know how we stand."</p>

<p>"Fire away, Superintendent," replied Bristow. "You're quite
justified in asking. We're on the same quest, so to speak, only
whereas it is your chief desire to secure the guilty, I'm only
acting in a purely private capacity out of consideration to the
innocent. My primary desire is to exonerate my personal
friends."</p>

<p>"Well, then, how do you know I am going to Sparkson's, Captain
Bristow?"</p>

<p>Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"That's very simple. I happened to be on the same track, and
your traces turned up. You see, I class you as a smart man,
Superintendent, and I know you don't do things without a very good
motive. Your sergeant, Mentmore, examined those costumes in the
tent pretty closely&mdash;as well as those in the house. It was
evident to me that you were after <i>something</i> in connection
with one of the costumes, though I give you my word I haven't
guessed what it is. But it wasn't <i>there</i>&mdash;at Frimley
Manor. Then Mentmore asked where Miss Fullinger had hired her
Edward the Sixth's dress. That was significant, wasn't it? Now I
had a reason for wanting to see that particular costume&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?" snapped Kinch.</p>

<p>"I'll leave you to guess for the present&mdash;no, it isn't my
intention to withhold information, but I'm acting on a surmise I
want to put to the test&mdash;though it may very likely come to
nothing. Well, I 'phoned through to Sparkson, asking him to reserve
that Tudor costume for me&mdash;first finding out from him that it
had been returned&mdash;I pretended I wanted to hire it. His answer
was evasive, but, anyhow, Sparkson wasn't going to let me have that
costume just yet. The inference was obvious. He had been already
asked to keep it back pending a visit from you or Mentmore. Am I
right?"</p>

<p>Kinch nodded.</p>

<p>"My congratulations," he replied. "A very pretty little bit of
work. And I may tell you, Captain Bristow, that I intend to handle
that costume before anyone else gets a chance of doing so."</p>

<p>"Of course you do. I haven't come up with any idea of
interfering with you or frustrating you. I'll stay outside in the
taxi while you go in to Sparkson's and make your examination, if
you like. I only want to see the thing after you've done with
it."</p>

<p>Kinch looked at him, shrewdly, for a moment.</p>

<p>"I don't know that there's any need for that, sir," he replied.
"I wish, though, that I knew exactly how far I can go with you.
You'll excuse my saying so, but, although you declare you're not
withholding information, it looks very much like it, and I can't be
a respecter of persons&mdash;even with you, Captain Bristow. It's
up to me to tell you that it is your duty, if you know anything
bearing on the case, to tell me. And if you refuse&mdash;well, you
wouldn't come very well out of a cross-examination in court. Excuse
my saying this."</p>

<p>"You are quite justified in doing so. And I give you my word,
Kinch, that directly my surmises turn into facts&mdash;or, rather,
that I get very fair proof that they are correct,&mdash;I'll tell
you all, gladly. As it is, if you find anything in connection with
that costume which confirms any suspicions you may have in your
mind, I'm prepared to give you a bit of information which may still
further confirm them. Only&mdash;I was going to say I'd make a
condition in telling you, but of course I can't do that&mdash;I
shall ask you to take my advice, though. May I ask you a
question?"</p>

<p>"I don't promise to answer."</p>

<p>"I know. But I'll ask it. Have you got anyone up here shadowing
Miss Fullinger?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Kinch. "We're much of a mind, it seems. Well, I
shan't tell you that, sir."</p>

<p>"I think you have told me, all the same," replied Bristow,
dryly. "Well, here we are. Shall I stay outside till you've
finished?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered Kinch, with the air of a man who has made up
his mind. "You seem to know so much already that I'll ask you to
come with me."</p>

<p>"That's very good of you."</p>

<p>Kinch asked to see Mr. Sparkson himself, and, when that
individual came, presented his official card. Sparkson looked at
Captain Bristow, with whom he had frequently done business, with a
puzzled air.</p>

<p>"Of course I couldn't tell you&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Bristow. "I quite understand."</p>

<p>"Now," went on Sparkson, turning to Kinch, "you've come about
that Edward the Sixth's costume you 'phoned to me to keep back, I
suppose? I hope there's nothing wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing for you to worry about, Mr. Sparkson," the
Superintendent assured him. "I want to have a look at it, that's
all. Have you unpacked it since Miss Fullinger returned it?"</p>

<p>"No. Directly it came in, I put it, just as I received it, under
lock and key."</p>

<p>"Good. Now this gentleman and I would like to be alone, if we
may?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. You shall go into one of our private
dressing-rooms...This way, please...I'll fetch the parcel for
you."</p>

<p>He showed them into a small room, went out, and returned,
presently, carrying a brown-paper parcel.</p>

<p>"As I told you," he remarked, placing it on the table, "it has
not been opened since I received it. I presume it is complete."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said Kinch, as Sparkson was about to leave the
room. "I should like to know if it is complete. I'll open it, and
you can check the contents, if you will."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sparkson, as Kinch opened the parcel and drew forth
the pieces of the costume, one by one. "A pair of tights&mdash;the
breeches&mdash;doublet&mdash;cape&mdash;cap&mdash;and a pair of
shoes. All are there. I don't know if it's worth while mentioning
it, but this is a made-up costume&mdash;I mean, the cape and
doublet and tights are part of the original one&mdash;the breeches
and cap are new."</p>

<p>Bristow turned to him.</p>

<p>"Do you mean this is the first time the breeches and cap have
been hired?"</p>

<p>"That is so," replied Sparkson. "The old ones were torn and
shabby, and I had them replaced. Well, I'll leave you now."</p>

<p>"Doesn't much matter whether they are old or new," said Kinch,
when he had gone, proceeding to look them over.</p>

<p>"There I differ with you, Superintendent," replied Bristow,
dryly. Kinch glanced at his companion. The latter had sat himself
in a chair and was lighting a cigarette. "Why?"</p>

<p>Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;it helps me to establish my theory&mdash;if there's
anything in it: that's all."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," began Kinch, and then suddenly stopped.
"Ah!" he exclaimed. He was examining the cape now.</p>

<p>"Found anything?" asked Bristow.</p>

<p>"I have," said Kinch, cheerfully. "What I rather expected to
find, too."</p>

<p>Bristow asked no further questions, but went on smoking quietly.
Presently there was another exclamation of triumph on the part of
the Superintendent. He was holding the breeches now.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he remarked again. "They generally bungle somewhere or
other. And this is a bad bungle. What a fool!"</p>

<p>"I doubt it," said Bristow, almost beneath his breath; but the
Superintendent heard him.</p>

<p>"Look here, sir," he said, "there's no reason why I shouldn't
take you into my confidence now. I've got quite sufficient evidence
to go ahead with, and there's no reason for concealment as far as
you are concerned."</p>

<p>Bristow inhaled and blew out a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>"Enough evidence&mdash;against Miss Fullinger, I suppose?" he
said, very quietly.</p>

<p>"That's it, Captain Bristow. Now, tell me&mdash;wasn't it Miss
Fullinger you had in your mind all the time?"</p>

<p>"More or less," admitted Bristow. "What made you suspect her,
though?"</p>

<p>Kinch smiled.</p>

<p>"We have a formula, you know, sir,&mdash;'from information
received'&mdash;that's as far as I'll go now with reference to
others. But I want to show you something," and he held out his
hand. "You see this bit of gold lace, eh? Well, I found it lying on
the floor, by the door, inside Mrs. Cresswell's room, the morning
after the robbery."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" exclaimed Bristow.</p>

<p>"I very soon satisfied myself that Mrs. Cresswell had no costume
with gold lace on it&mdash;nor had the others, or, if they had,
none of it was torn off. That's why I wanted to have a look at
these clothes. You can see for yourself, sir," and he took up the
little cape, "there's where it was torn off&mdash;look, it fits
exactly," and he laid the little bit of lace on the cape.</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Bristow, examining it carefully. "There isn't
much doubt about that."</p>

<p>"Is there? But that's not all. I've just found this in the
pocket of the breeches."</p>

<p>And he held out a small key.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Bristow.</p>

<p>"It's the lost key of Mrs. Cresswell's suit-case&mdash;the
duplicate. Here's the other. I kept it, and had one made for Mrs.
Cresswell to use meanwhile."</p>

<p>"I say," exclaimed Bristow, "you're pretty thorough, Kinch!
Yes&mdash;I see&mdash;there's no doubt about that,
either&mdash;they're a pair right enough. What are you going to do
about it?"</p>

<p>"What do you think, sir? Miss Fullinger will have to give me an
explanation about all this&mdash;and, if she can't&mdash;well!" and
he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I see," answered Bristow, gravely. "And now I'm going to give
you that bit of information I promised you. You will add it to this
evidence, I expect."</p>

<p>He took, out of his pocket, an envelope, opened it, and produced
a small white handkerchief, which he handed to Kinch.</p>

<p>"Read the name in the corner," he said.</p>

<p>"S. Fullinger," read Kinch. "Where did you find this, sir?"</p>

<p>"I didn't find it. Your sergeant, Mentmore, made one little
slip&mdash;quite excusable. Apparently he forgot to ask that
poacher fellow, Cyster, if he had found anything in the Vicar's
car."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, he didn't, Captain Bristow. Cyster stuck to it that he
had found nothing."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, I had other means to prevail upon Cyster to tell the
truth. He'd pocketed some of the Vicar's tools&mdash;<i>and</i>
this handkerchief."</p>

<p>"You mean he found it in the car?"</p>

<p>"That's so."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! That rather clinches things!"</p>

<p>Bristow was in the act of lighting a fresh cigarette. He looked
up, a humorous little twinkle at the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p>"Only you must remember," he said, "<i>I</i> didn't see Miss
Fullinger in the car that night."</p>

<p>"But it's her handkerchief?"</p>

<p>"I think so. And I fancy I can tell you a little more about it,
something I found out from Sir Harry. Miss Fullinger had lost her
handkerchief while she was acting in the pageant, and sent her maid
to the house to get a clean one. The maid brought it out just after
the pageant was over. Sir Harry, who was talking to poor Hurst at
the time, saw her give it to Miss Fullinger."</p>

<p>"Well," said Kinch, "the main thing is it's Miss Fullinger's
handkerchief. When and where she first put it in her pocket doesn't
matter."</p>

<p>"Now, do you know," replied Bristow, "it might matter
considerably&mdash;to my mind."</p>

<p>"Can't see it, sir. The point is it was found in the car, you
say?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But another point is, how did it get there? And,
again&mdash;it may have been the handkerchief she lost earlier in
the evening, eh?"</p>

<p>The Superintendent brought his open hand down on the table with
a smack.</p>

<p>"It seems to me, Captain Bristow," he said, "that you are trying
to confuse the issue."</p>

<p>"Not at all," answered Bristow, "I've given you the handkerchief
for what it's worth, but I want you to see it's only presumptive
evidence against Miss Fullinger, not conclusive. I know perfectly
well you are building up a strong case against her, and I agree
with you that you are justified. But I do suggest that you keep all
the facts in your mind, Superintendent."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm trying to, sir, am I not?"</p>

<p>He spoke a little testily.</p>

<p>"Not quite. You might bear in mind what I told you about Sir
Harry seeing a handkerchief given to Miss Fullinger, while he was
talking with Jasper Hurst&mdash;and that the gate from the drive to
the main road was open that night. I'm not going to explain further
at the moment because, as I told you, I'm only surmising. And now,
if you've quite finished with those togs, it's my turn."</p>

<p>"Here you are, then, Captain Bristow&mdash;take a look at 'em,
by all means. And I'll stay and watch you, if you don't
mind&mdash;you've roused my curiosity. Afterwards," he went on,
grimly, "I'm going to pay a call on Miss Fullinger. Now,
sir,&mdash;which will you have first?&mdash;the breeches?"</p>

<p>"Thanks," replied Bristow, "but I only want to see the cap."</p>

<p>"The <i>cap</i>?"</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"And what do you expect to find there, sir?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure. Ah, pretty little head-dress, isn't it? And
Sparkson tells us it's quite new. That may be fortunate. Have a
cigarette, Kinch, while I take a squint."</p>

<p>Kinch, laughing, accepted the proffered cigarette, lighted it,
and sat watching Bristow. The latter, cap in hand, went to the
window and produced from his pocket a magnifying-glass.</p>

<p>"Sherlock Holmes!" ejaculated the Superintendent.</p>

<p>"Quite&mdash;Dr. Watson," replied Bristow, dryly.</p>

<p>He peered into the interior of the cap, examining it minutely
with his glass. Kinch smoked placidly, the smile still on his face.
Bristow, without a word, went on with his examination, standing,
almost motionless, at the window. Presently he came back to the
table, and laid the cap down on it.</p>

<p>"Finished?" asked the Superintendent, quizzically.</p>

<p>"I think so&mdash;for the present."</p>

<p>His face was inscrutable. If he had discovered anything, he made
no sign.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Kinch, "and what of it?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you won't be wanting to take this away?" said
Bristow, in reply, pointing at the cap.</p>

<p>"No," replied Kinch, "but I shall want this cape, though."</p>

<p>"All right, then. Shall I ask Sparkson to come in? Then we can
get a move on."</p>

<p>"But aren't you going to&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off. Bristow had opened the door and gone out. Kinch
took the cap off the table, looked at it carefully, and shook his
head.</p>

<p>"Now, what the dickens did he mean?" he said to himself. Then
Bristow returned with Sparkson. The latter addressed the
Superintendent.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "have you found what you wanted?"</p>

<p>"I have, Mr. Sparkson. I shall have to take away this cape with
me&mdash;I'll give you a receipt for it, if you want one. And it
may very likely happen that you may be wanted to give evidence
later on."</p>

<p>"Evidence?" exclaimed Sparkson. "What on earth could I give
evidence about?"</p>

<p>"Only to prove that Miss Fullinger hired these clothes&mdash;and
returned them," replied Kinch, wrapping up the cape as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"And I want the cap, Sparkson," said Bristow, "just for a few
days. Get me a cardboard box to put it in, will you, please?"</p>

<p>Outside, the taxi was still waiting. Kinch hesitated.</p>

<p>"This is your taxi, Captain Bristow," he said. "I'm much obliged
to you for the lift. And now, I suppose, I'd better get one for
myself."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are going to see Miss Fullinger, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I am that, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, that's the chief reason why I've come up today, though I
wanted to have a look at that costume before I called on her." He
glanced at his watch. "Now, look here, Superintendent,&mdash;I
didn't mean to have put all my cards on the table this morning, but
now we've begun to understand each other, I think I'd better. I
suggest you come with me to my club and have luncheon with me
before you pay your call on Miss Fullinger. An hour won't make much
difference&mdash;if she's being kept under observation. And I don't
think you'll regret it."</p>

<p>Kinch hesitated, and then said:</p>

<p>"Very well, Captain Bristow. I'll accept your invitation. But I
can't see anything you've got to tell me can make any difference to
my performing rather an unpleasant job afterwards. The evidence
stares one in the face, and, unless Miss Fullinger can give an
explanation, well&mdash;I've no option in the matter."</p>

<p>"At present you haven't, I know. But I'd like to put a
suggestion before you&mdash;when we've lunched."</p>

<p>It was after luncheon that Bristow took Kinch to a quiet corner
of the smoking-room of his club, and began:</p>

<p>"Suppose," he said, "you were able to produce a witness who saw
Sonia Fullinger meet a man outside Frimley Manor that night, after
Mr. Charles Lynwood went out to get his cigarettes, what would you
say?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;obviously&mdash;that she must have been mixed up in
things. Only one more proof of what seems to me now to be a
certainty."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, it isn't a certainty to me, Superintendent. I don't
believe for a moment that Sonia Fullinger had anything to do with
either the robbery or the murder. She was probably fast asleep all
the time&mdash;like most of the others."</p>

<p>"There I think you make a mistake, sir. I have good reason for
believing that, though she went to her room early, she didn't
undress. She was still wearing that Edward the Sixth's costume
after eleven o'clock&mdash;I have that from the last person who saw
her that night."</p>

<p>"May I ask who that was?"</p>

<p>"Her maid."</p>

<p>"I see. That looks very queer, certainly. Now, apart from
this&mdash;and the bit of gold lace, the key and the
handkerchief&mdash;have you any other evidence against her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have. Something that put me on the track to begin with.
There is a notebook belonging to Mr. Hurst&mdash;Mentmore found it
at The Gables. It's an address-book. Well, Miss Fullinger's address
was written in it. How do you explain that, Captain Bristow, if
there was no collusion?"</p>

<p>"Collusion between Hurst and Miss Fullinger?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But you don't suspect Hurst of conspiring&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, but what did I tell you coming up in the train this
morning, sir? I said I <i>knew</i> Hurst had had his suspicions
aroused. Why should he have written down that address otherwise? He
had his eye on Miss Fullinger&mdash;knew something about her to
begin with&mdash;and then, when he saw her at the pageant...well,
there you are!"</p>

<p>"Now, this is most interesting," said Bristow. "I'm very glad
you told me about it. Well, listen to my side of the case. I admit
all the evidence&mdash;the address in Hurst's notebook&mdash;the
torn bit of lace&mdash;the key&mdash;and the handkerchief. I found
out the handkerchief, remember. That&mdash;and something
else&mdash;pointed to Sonia Fullinger. And yet I <i>couldn't</i>,
somehow, associate the girl with such a crime. You see, I've known
her for years."</p>

<p>Kinch grinned.</p>

<p>"I never let sentiment interfere with facts, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Quite so. But sentiment sometimes helps one to establish facts,
or put a new construction upon them. I thought things over, and,
after a bit, it seemed to me that there was just one person, quite
easy to overlook, but to whom the facts&mdash;so far as I knew
them&mdash;could apply."</p>

<p>"Who was that?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you a story before I answer that question. In the
time of the Great War, a colleague of mine, in the Secret Service,
was spy-hunting&mdash;at one of our naval bases. There was a young
military officer, invalided home from the front, who was performing
light duty in the town, and was strongly suspected of treachery. He
was quartered on a family where there was a son who was a
civilian&mdash;medically rejected from service. The reason why the
young officer was suspected was because he had been seen pottering
about in places and among people which rather pointed to the
seeking for information. But my colleague wasn't satisfied. He had
an idea at the back of his mind that someone was impersonating that
young officer, and he put his idea to the test. He was right. The
civilian was the spy&mdash;half-German, it turned out&mdash;and
he'd been wearing the officer's spare uniform."</p>

<p>"What was the test?" asked Kinch.</p>

<p>"Same as I used this morning&mdash;that's where I got the notion
from. Here's that Tudor cap"&mdash;he unpacked it&mdash;"Now, look
at the inside of it through this magnifying-glass...See
anything?"</p>

<p>Kinch looked carefully.</p>

<p>"Bear in mind that Sparkson said it was a new cap," went on
Bristow..."Well?"</p>

<p>"I can't see anything&mdash;except a few hairs," replied
Kinch.</p>

<p>"What colour?...Here, take 'em to the window&mdash;there's more
light there. Now?"</p>

<p>"Looks like three or four dark ones&mdash;and a couple of fair
ones."</p>

<p>"And Miss Fullinger's hair&mdash;dark or fair?"</p>

<p>"By George!" exclaimed the Superintendent. "I see what you mean,
sir. Hers is dark hair, of course. You think someone else?"</p>

<p>"Wore the costume? Exactly. Now then&mdash;who was the
fair-haired individual who had easy access to that costume when
Miss Fullinger took it off that night?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Her maid! She's got fair hair."</p>

<p>"Quite so."</p>

<p>"But..." began Kinch.</p>

<p>"Stop a moment. Let me work it out. The first thing
is&mdash;suppose my theory is correct,&mdash;why did the maid want
to wear the costume? The answer to that lies in the story I've just
told you...in case she was <i>seen</i> she would be mistaken for
Sonia Fullinger. Follow it out. Some time previously&mdash;probably
while the pageant was on&mdash;she goes into Mrs. Cresswell's room
and gets that duplicate key. Later on, when she takes the
handkerchief out to her mistress, Hurst was there, and recognised
her&mdash;that would account for <i>her</i> address&mdash;not
necessarily Miss Fullinger's&mdash;being down in his notebook. He
knew of this woman and had made a record of her whereabouts. Well,
when she went up to her mistress' room that night, she took away
the costume&mdash;possibly saying she was going to pack
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But she told me Miss Fullinger hadn't undressed."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;but never mind what she told you. She'd <i>want</i>
you to think that, wouldn't she? Anyhow, let's go on. She rigs
herself up in those togs&mdash;enters Mrs. Cresswell's room and
gets the jewels&mdash;puts the key back in her pocket&mdash;and
slips out of doors to meet her confederate. Now, here is where
<i>I</i> went wrong to begin with&mdash;and you've gone wrong since
in hunting for <i>two</i> men. There were not two men, Kinch,
depend upon it. I naturally <i>thought</i> I saw two, but suppose
one of them was this woman&mdash;dressed as a man, eh? I was never
near enough to distinguish what their clothes were like in detail,
you know."</p>

<p>"But if that's right, Captain Bristow, then this
woman&mdash;Bates is her name&mdash;must have driven off in the car
when you chased them?"</p>

<p>"Well, doesn't that fit in? It was while I was giving evidence
at the inquest that the significance of the gate leading from the
drive to the main road being open or shut suddenly struck me."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;I saw something was in your mind," exclaimed Kinch,
"by the way you hesitated all at once. And I made a note then and
there to enquire about that gate&mdash;though I couldn't quite see
how it bore on the case."</p>

<p>"But it does, doesn't it? I distinctly heard the car stop when
it must have been close to the gate, and then go on again. If the
gate had been closed, why, they stopped to open it. But it
<i>wasn't</i> closed. Then why did they stop? Don't you think it
was to let down one of the two people in her? Again, it all fits in
with that handkerchief. Miss Fullinger probably left it in the
costume, and Bates may have used it while in the car, and muddled
matters in putting it back."</p>

<p>"Then," said Kinch, "you infer that Bates&mdash;if it was
she&mdash;got out of the car by that gate&mdash;and then?"</p>

<p>"Made her way back to the house. I can't be certain of
details&mdash;but there was plenty of opportunity for her to slip
in afterwards. The front door was undone for some considerable
time. Well, what do you think of it all?"</p>

<p>"I think more than ever," said the Superintendent, "that the
sooner I see Miss Fullinger the better. Your theory is a very
clever one, sir, and I'm not denying that it may be true. But
you've got to remember that every blessed thing you've just told me
fits Miss Fullinger equally well."</p>

<p>"Except those two yellow hairs," said Bristow, dryly.</p>

<p>"I grant you that," replied Kinch. "But it takes a bit of risk
to put two hairs in one scale and a pile of evidence in the other,
doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Superintendent," said Bristow, with a laugh,
"you're too old a hand at the game to be only ready to judge of
evidence by the bulk of it. And, anyhow, you've got to account for
those two hairs as well as the rest. They're a part of the jigsaw
puzzle, and you can't complete the puzzle without them."</p>

<p>Kinch looked at the other for a few moments. Then he said:</p>

<p>"I'm not convinced. But I'll try to put your theory to the test.
Look here, sir,&mdash;will you come with me now to see Miss
Fullinger? Only, if you do, I must ask you to let me do the
questioning."</p>

<p>"Of course. You're in charge of the case, not I. I'll be only
too glad to go with you."</p>

<p>"Right, sir!" And he got up. "Then the sooner we start, the
better."</p>

<h2>Chapter 13</h2>

<p>"Wisteria," the residence of the Fullingers, was a large house,
standing back from the quiet road&mdash;one of those many quite
secluded by-streets in St. John's Wood&mdash;with a garden in front
and a curved carriage-drive leading to the entrance. It was Captain
Bristow who enquired of the butler whether Miss Fullinger was at
home, Kinch considering it preferable that the servants should
remain ignorant of the fact that a police visit was being paid.</p>

<p>They were both shown into a drawing-room and, in a minute or
two, Sonia came in, with her mother, a pleasant-looking,
middle-aged lady, who greeted Captain Bristow as a frequent visitor
to the house&mdash;as, indeed, he was.</p>

<p>"But I thought you were still at Frimley&mdash;" she began, but
stopped. Sonia had recognised the Superintendent. Captain Bristow
explained.</p>

<p>"So I am," he said, "but I've come up today with Superintendent
Kinch&mdash;you've met him, Sonia, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," said the girl, bowing stiffly to Kinch.
"Mother&mdash;this is the policeman who put me through the third
degree&mdash;isn't that what you call it?"</p>

<p>"I hope I was not so bad as that," said Kinch.</p>

<p>"And may I ask&mdash;?" began Mrs. Fullinger, turning to Bristow
for an explanation.</p>

<p>"It's all right, Mrs. Fullinger," said Bristow. "Some more facts
have come to light, and the Superintendent wants to ask Sonia some
further questions."</p>

<p>"But I told you all I knew&mdash;which was very little,"
exclaimed Sonia.</p>

<p>"Ah," replied Kinch, "I know. Still, you may be able to throw a
little more light on matters."</p>

<p>"I think you will, too, Sonia," said Bristow, cheerfully. "Now,
Superintendent, go ahead. I'll not interrupt you."</p>

<p>Kinch, who had been undoing the parcel, produced the velvet
cape. "Is this part of the costume you were wearing at the pageant,
Miss Fullinger?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it," she replied. "What of it?"</p>

<p>"You will observe that a small piece of gold lace is missing
from the edge. Here is the bit. I found it inside Mrs. Cresswell's
room the morning after the robbery. Can you explain how it got
there?"</p>

<p>"Explain? I'm sure I don't know."</p>

<p>"Did you go into her room while you were wearing the cape?"</p>

<p>"I may have done so. But what of it, if I did?"</p>

<p>Kinch did not reply to this question. He produced the key.
"This," he said, "is the key of Mrs. Cresswell's dressing-case, in
which she placed the necklace; missing off her bunch. I found it
this morning."</p>

<p>"That's interesting. Where?"</p>

<p>"In the pocket of the breeches belonging to the costume you were
wearing that night," he replied, slowly, looking straight at her.
For the first time a serious expression stole over her face.</p>

<p>"But," she said, "how on earth did it get there?"</p>

<p>"Ah! Can you explain that, Miss Fullinger?"</p>

<p>"I? Of course not."</p>

<p>"But," interjected her mother, "do you mean to
suggest&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One moment, please." He took the handkerchief out of his
pocket. "Is this yours?" he asked the girl.</p>

<p>She looked at it.</p>

<p>"Certainly it is."</p>

<p>"This handkerchief was found in the car which was driven off
after Mr. Hurst was killed&mdash;the one Captain Bristow saw. Can
you explain <i>that</i>, Miss Fullinger?"</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it in the least."</p>

<p>"Why," broke in her mother, "you were in bed when all this
happened, weren't you, Sonia?"</p>

<p>"Of course I was."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Kinch. "You didn't go outside the house that
night&mdash;about half-past one? You needn't answer, you know, if
you prefer not to.'</p>

<p>"<i>Go outside the house</i>? Certainly not...You...you...don't
mean you think I had anything to do with it?&mdash;No,
mother&mdash;let him go on. But this is all nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Very well," said Kinch, referring to his notebook. "You don't
seem able to give me an explanation about this key and the
handkerchief. I'll go a little further, then. I suggest that you
were acquainted with Mr. Hurst, in some way, before this affair
happened. Is that so?"</p>

<p>"You suggested that before," replied Sonia, "and I told you then
that I knew nothing whatever about him. What makes you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because the name and address of this house were found written
in a notebook belonging to him&mdash;after the letter 'F.' You will
admit that I have a reason for asking."</p>

<p>"This is preposterous," said Mrs. Fullinger. "None of us in this
house knew him. I know my husband didn't."</p>

<p>"Is there anything more?" asked Sonia.</p>

<p>"Yes. I want to ask you about your movements after you went to
your room that night at Frimley Manor. Mrs. Cresswell stated that
she knocked at your door and that you didn't answer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If she did, I was asleep. I told you so."</p>

<p>"I suggest you were not asleep&mdash;not even in bed. That you
were sitting in your room, still wearing your Edward the Sixth
costume, and that you did not undress until much later. What have
you to say to that?"</p>

<p>Sonia, indignant, turned on him.</p>

<p>"That it's a lie!" she exclaimed. "If you want to know, I'll
tell you just what happened. I was in bed by eleven o'clock that
night, just after my maid left the room.&mdash;I heard the clock on
the stairs strike the hour&mdash;and that was the last thing I
remember till I awoke in the morning. As for that costume, not only
was I not wearing it, but it wasn't even in the room."</p>

<p>Bristow leaned forward. At last Sonia had touched on a point
that had puzzled him. For Anstice Lynwood had told him that costume
<i>was</i> in Sonia's room when she had gone in early the next
morning. Kinch looked up from his notebook. He, too, recognised the
importance of this statement.</p>

<p>"Where was it, then?" he asked, sharply.</p>

<p>"My maid had taken it away to fold ready for packing. She
brought it back the next morning, when she called me."</p>

<p>"Ah!" muttered Bristow, beneath his breath. "<i>Now</i> I
understand!"</p>

<p>"Wait a bit," said Kinch, slowly. "Miss Fullinger, tell me,
please. When your maid went to your room that night, were you in
bed?"</p>

<p>"No. I was smoking a cigarette. I undressed while she was with
me. I <i>can't</i> understand why you are asking me all this."</p>

<p>"I've been trying to keep quiet," broke in Mrs. Fullinger. "But
now I must insist upon your telling me&mdash;who gave you this
information about my daughter? I mean, <i>someone</i> must have
been talking about her to you. Who was it?"</p>

<p>Kinch hesitated. He was just going over to Bristow's views. He
did not reply at once to Mrs. Fullinger, but studied the note he
had taken when questioning Sonia's maid. And then it occurred to
him that Bates, with her doll-like innocence of expression, had
made her statement in such a way that two constructions could be
placed on it: the first&mdash;that which had been in his mind all
the time&mdash;that Sonia had <i>remained</i> dressed after Bates
had left her for the night; the second, Sonia's own explanation.
They both fitted. A lie suggested by a half-truth is generally the
most dangerous kind of lie.</p>

<p>He turned to Mrs. Fullinger.</p>

<p>"Who told me?" he said. "Well, apart from the bit of lace, the
key and the handkerchief, I had some information from Miss
Fullinger's maid." He turned again to Sonia. "Your maid told me,"
he went on, "that when she went into your room that night you were
wearing that costume and smoking a cigarette."</p>

<p>"Quite right. I've just told you that. And then?"</p>

<p>"She led me to believe that you were still dressed&mdash;in that
costume&mdash;when she left you for the night."</p>

<p>"Well, I wasn't. I couldn't have been. She took the costume out
of the room when she left."</p>

<p>Bristow nodded at Kinch suggestively.</p>

<p>"Right, sir," said the Superintendent; "it looks now as if it's
one up to you. Now&mdash;before I go any further&mdash;a word or
two about that maid of yours, Miss Fullinger."</p>

<p>"But, surely,&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," interrupted Kinch, "I'm beginning to think so. When I
came up to London this morning, I don't mind telling you that I had
a notion I should have to ask you to come back with me."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed her mother.</p>

<p>"The Superintendent was justified," said Bristow. "Knowing what
he did up to a point, he was bound to be suspicious about
Sonia."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," said Kinch. "But now," he went on to Sonia,
"I'm prepared to accept your explanation."</p>

<p>"But I <i>haven't</i> explained anything," said Sonia, a little
puzzled. "I still haven't the slightest idea about that
key&mdash;or the handkerchief."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;I almost forgot that. Did you leave the handkerchief
in one of the pockets of your costume&mdash;when you took it
off?"</p>

<p>Sonia thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"I believe I must have done so; anyhow, I don't remember taking
it out. But do you really think that Bates&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bates? Yes." He referred to his notes. "I see she came to you
on Lady Challington's recommendation. Did you see her
ladyship&mdash;or have any correspondence with her?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Mrs. Fullinger; "neither. Lady Challington was
abroad. Bates brought her testimonial with her when she applied for
the post, and we engaged her, to a great extent, on the strength of
it."</p>

<p>"Ah! Now tell me, Mrs. Fullinger...she took the place of another
maid here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And did that maid leave rather suddenly?" Bristow nodded,
approvingly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;she did. She even forfeited a month's wages."</p>

<p>"Let me have her name and address, please."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fullinger gave it to him, and he wrote it down.</p>

<p>"And now," he said, closing his notebook with a snap, "I'll see
this woman&mdash;Bates; if you don't mind."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fullinger got up.</p>

<p>"You're only just in time," she said.</p>

<p>"Why, madam?"</p>

<p>He wheeled round sharply, as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Because she is leaving us this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Oh! Wait a minute, please, madam. This is important. When did
she give notice?"</p>

<p>"She didn't," said Sonia. "A telegram came for her today, saying
her mother was desperately ill and was undergoing a serious
operation&mdash;so of course we have to let her go."</p>

<p>"Did she say where she was going?"</p>

<p>"Horsham, wasn't it, mother? Yes&mdash;of course. I helped her
look up a train in Bradshaw&mdash;leaving Victoria at 4:05. And
Perkins&mdash;our butler&mdash;rang up a garage and ordered a taxi
to be here at a quarter past three&mdash;and it's past three
now."</p>

<p>"I'll go and fetch her at once, then," said Mrs. Fullinger,
making for the door.</p>

<p>Kinch sprang up.</p>

<p>"Not on any account, please, madam," he said.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;!" began Bristow, and suddenly stopped.</p>

<p>"Now, madam," went on Kinch, "will you please do exactly what I
tell you? It's most important. Go to her now&mdash;you can make an
excuse to say good-bye to her&mdash;don't arouse her suspicions,
whatever you do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," broke in Sonia, "mayn't <i>I</i> go? I'd love to help, if
she's really the scoundrel you think she is."</p>

<p>"Either of you, then," replied Kinch. "What I want is that she
shouldn't catch sight of me when I leave this house. She probably
knows by this time that Captain Bristow is here, and it's lucky my
name wasn't mentioned when we came in. Just keep her engaged for a
couple of minutes while we step out. You'll like to come with me,
Captain Bristow?"</p>

<p>"I would&mdash;immensely."</p>

<p>"Be quite natural with her, Miss Fullinger," was the
Superintendent's last injunction as the girl left the room. "Now,
sir&mdash;Good afternoon, madam&mdash;and many thanks. We'll let
ourselves out, please."</p>

<p>In two or three minutes Captain Bristow and the Superintendent
were getting into their waiting taxi and driving off.</p>

<p>"Stop!" said Kinch to the driver, when they were halfway along
the quiet street. On the pavement a man was lounging, a
nondescript-looking fellow, smoking a pipe. Kinch opened the
door.</p>

<p>"Hop in, Morgan," he said. "This job's up. But there's another
one coming, unless I'm mistaken. Ah&mdash;look there, sir," he said
to Bristow, as he glanced back, "there's the taxi just gone into
the gate to fetch Bates."</p>

<p>Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"I like your smartness, Kinch," he said. "For just a moment I
was fogged, but, of course, I saw immediately afterwards what your
game was. Give her a bit of rope before you arrest her. Same as in
the war we sometimes caught the big boss in the spy business by
letting one of the little ones make the scent."</p>

<p>"That's right, sir," replied Kinch, grimly. Then he gave the
driver directions.</p>

<p>"Draw up to the kerb there&mdash;on the left-hand side of the
road, with your front wheels turned out ready to swing round. Watch
for that taxi coming away from the house we've just left. If it
comes along here, get a move on, let it pass you, and then follow
it. If it goes in the other direction, swing round and do the
same&mdash;yes&mdash;you can see my card if you want to&mdash;it's
a police job. Now, sir," he turned to Bristow, "she mustn't catch a
glimpse of us, or the game will be up. Lean well back, and bend
your head down&mdash;we must trust to the driver."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the other taxi appeared again in the street,
turned in their direction, and passed them, their driver throwing
in his clutch and following.</p>

<p>The chase led up the Finchley Road, past Lord's Cricket Ground
into Upper Baker Street. The driver followed at a distance of some
twenty yards. At the junction of Baker Street with the Marylebone
Road the traffic was held up for a couple of minutes by the police
on point duty. Kinch said to Morgan:</p>

<p>"Look here, Captain Bristow and I must remain in the background.
She mustn't see us. Now, do you think she knows you, Morgan?"</p>

<p>"I've been mighty careful, sir. Of course I wasn't keeping an
eye on her&mdash;but I don't think she's noticed me. I've only seen
her once."</p>

<p>"Very well. I shall probably depend on you. Miss Fullinger has
told us she said she was going to Horsham, but that remains to be
seen. Anyhow, wherever she goes, you've got to keep in touch with
her. You shall have help as soon as I can manage
it&mdash;ah&mdash;<i>that's</i> not the way to Victoria!"</p>

<p>For the traffic in front, released, was moving forward. But the
taxi they were following, instead of crossing into Lower Baker
Street, swung round to the left into the Marylebone Road. They
followed.</p>

<p>Past Madame; Tussaud's&mdash;the top of Tottenham Court
Road&mdash;straight on&mdash;past the entrance to Euston
station&mdash;past St. Pancras, and then into the entrance of that
very squat-looking station, King's Cross. Kinch had the
speaking-tube in his hand.</p>

<p>"Stop!" he commanded the driver. "Don't go inside&mdash;draw up
by the kerb, here. Off you go, Morgan&mdash;quick, man. If there's
time, run back and report&mdash;if not, 'phone or wire destination
to Scotland Yard&mdash;we'll go there and pick it up."</p>

<p>Morgan nodded, and was off. They waited. In a few minutes he was
back.</p>

<p>"Just time," he said. "She's booked to Letcham&mdash;so have I.
Train starts in five minutes."</p>

<p>"Right!" ejaculated Kinch. "Get on with it. I'll 'phone
Letcham." He waited for a few minutes, and then went into the
station. On his return, he said to Bristow:</p>

<p>"I got onto the Inspector at Letcham; man I know, too. He'll
have the train met, so Bates&mdash;or whatever her real name may
be&mdash;will be kept in sight. Something ought to come of it. What
do you think, sir?"</p>

<p>"I agree with you," replied Bristow. "The only question, to my
mind, is whether it wouldn't be better for us to follow on to
Letcham."</p>

<p>"Morgan is a smart man, sir,&mdash;and so is the Inspector
there. I don't think there is any fear of her giving them the
slip."</p>

<p>"I'm not doubting them, Kinch, for a moment. It's my curiosity
that's at work. I confess I'm interested in the lady's
movements&mdash;and where they may lead."</p>

<p>Kinch thought for a moment. Then he said:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Captain Bristow. There's no reason why you
shouldn't take the next train to Letcham. After all, it's due to
you that we've got a line on Bates. I'll write you an introduction
to the inspector, and you can give him full particulars.
Only...well, I can trust you not to barge in and spoil the game,
can't I, sir?"</p>

<p>Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"I see what you mean," he said. "Of course, if she caught sight
of me, there, it would rouse her suspicions. I'll be careful. But
what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall drop in for a few minutes at Scotland Yard. It's
just as well to let them know there what is
happening&mdash;especially as the Metropolitan area has come into
the case. Then I want to get back to Chiltonbury."&mdash;He
laughed. "I expect young Curtis won't be sorry to see me."</p>

<p>"Ah," replied Bristow, dryly, "I don't suppose you'll want to
keep him any longer. Well&mdash;give me that note, Kinch, and I'll
see about the next train."</p>

<p>Kinch tore a leaf from his pocketbook, scribbled the
introduction, and handed it to Bristow, who, at once, made for the
station.</p>

<p>"Scotland Yard," said Kinch to his chauffeur, and the taxi
started off. When he arrived at his destination the Superintendent
asked if Chief Inspector Hadley was in, and, if so, could he see
him.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector was in, and was willing to see Kinch. He
rose from the table at which he was sitting as Kinch came into his
room, a thin, delicate-looking man, with refined features, hair
worn rather long, and soft, silky moustache. He looked far more
like an artist than the astute criminologist. He welcomed Kinch,
whom he knew, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "quite a pretty little drama you've been having
out Chiltonbury way, I understand, Kinch! I was wondering only this
morning whether we might be invited to take part in it."</p>

<p>"I don't think you will, Hadley," replied Kinch, grinning. "I
fancy we're on the scent&mdash;and may, with luck, be in at the
death."</p>

<p>"I congratulate you," answered Hadley. "Queer business, isn't
it?&mdash;carrying off that poor chap Hurst in a sedan-chair."</p>

<p>"Did you know him?"</p>

<p>Hadley lighted a cigarette, and leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes,&mdash;slightly. Ran across him once or twice. Clever
fellow. Ought to have been here, really. And you think you know who
did him in, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't&mdash;yet. But I hope to get him&mdash;through a
woman."</p>

<p>"Ah! I've always taken the line of concentrating on a woman if
there's one in a case we're investigating. May I ask who she
is?"</p>

<p>"There, again,&mdash;I don't know&mdash;yet. It's what I've
called about. Shall I tell you what's happened, so far?"</p>

<p>"I'd like to hear."</p>

<p>Kinch told him. Hadley smiled once or twice during the recital,
and, when it was finished, remarked:</p>

<p>"Captain Bristow, eh? Quite a good man, that. Lucky for you he
happened to be on the spot, old man."</p>

<p>"I admit it."</p>

<p>"And now&mdash;what do you want of me? I take it you haven't
simply blown in for a friendly chat?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't. I want to have a look at your collection of
portraits."</p>

<p>"Ah! To see if this woman, Bates, is among them?"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>Hadley took up the telephone-receiver and gave an order. In a
few minutes a clerk brought in a couple of bulky volumes.</p>

<p>"You see," said Kinch, "it's perfectly obvious now why Hurst
jotted down the Fullingers' address in his notebook. He knew this
woman was there. And he spotted her at the pageant and she roused
his suspicions. Now let's have a look."</p>

<p>He searched through the array of photographs and reproductions.
And finally shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "I can't find her here."</p>

<p>"Very likely," replied Hadley. "Hurst, I know, had a line on
some folks who are not in our records. Well," he went on, as Kinch
got up to go, "I wish you luck&mdash;if there's anything I can do,
let me know."</p>

<p>Kinch went out to his waiting taxi and caught the next train
back to Chiltonbury. When he arrived he found that, during his
absence, information had come in with regard to young Curtis. The
ticket-collector on duty at Chiltonbury station on the night in
question remembered a young man dashing past him and only just
catching the train; the guard had seen him getting into the
compartment; a wire had come from Exeter confirming his statement
about going to Bordeaux. Finally, after Kinch had arrived, an
elderly gentleman, a well-known resident of Chiltonbury, called at
the police-station and asked to see the Superintendent.</p>

<p>"Good evening," said Kinch. "What can I do for you, Mr.
Hemmingway?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Hemmingway, "I read the evening paper on my way
down from town, and the question seems to be what can I do for you,
Mr. Kinch? You are advertising for an elderly gentleman who
travelled up to London by the last train on Monday, and who saw a
young fool scramble into his carriage at the risk of committing
suicide. So I thought I'd better call in."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Kinch "it was <i>you</i>, was it, Mr. Hemmingway? All
right. You're sure it was Monday night&mdash;and the last
train?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. My niece met with an accident that night in London,
and I was telephoned for late. That's why I happened to be going
up. As a matter of fact, I've been staying in town till she was out
of danger, and have only just returned."</p>

<p>"I'm glad to see you. I won't keep you five minutes. I only want
to see if you can identify the young man who got into your carriage
that night."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that all? Yes, I think I can do that."</p>

<p>"Just wait a few moments&mdash;and I'll have him paraded. Excuse
me," and he left the room. After a short interval he came back, and
led Mr. Hemmingway to a corridor in which half-a-dozen men were
standing side by side, Leonard Curtis among them. Mr. Hemmingway
went straight up to him.</p>

<p>"This is he," he said to the Superintendent. "I'm not likely to
have forgotten&mdash;I don't often, at my age, experience being
told to go to blazes. Ah&mdash;I see you remember, young man?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir," said Curtis; "though, in a way, it seems to
have helped matters&mdash;it made you remember me, anyway."</p>

<p>"H'm!" Hemmingway turned to Kinch. "Cheeky still, I see. May I
ask what he'd done, Mr. Kinch?" he went on, as the Superintendent
led him away. "I suppose he was escaping from justice?"</p>

<p>Kinch laughed.</p>

<p>"I'm able to say now, sir&mdash;after you have identified
him&mdash;that he's done nothing. You've proved his alibi, and, in
a few minutes, I shall set him at liberty and send him out to his
uncle, the Vicar of Frimley. I know he was cheeky"&mdash;Kinch
laughed&mdash;"but you've helped to clear him from a worse charge
than that."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Murder," replied Kinch, dryly.</p>

<p>"God bless my soul! I'm very glad&mdash;very glad. You may tell
him I forgive his impudence. Good night!"</p>

<h2>Chapter 14</h2>

<p>Captain Bristow, as soon as he reached Letcham, made for the
police-station and presented Kinch's scribbled introduction to the
Inspector. The latter, a rather stout, good-natured-looking
individual, but with a certain penetration in the glance of his
brown eyes, which betokened another side of his character,
said:</p>

<p>"I'm pleased to see you, Captain Bristow. Any friend of Kinch
would be welcome, for I worked with him in past years&mdash;you
especially, sir, for I happen to have heard of your reputation.
Before we go any further&mdash;where are you staying here?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know," laughed Bristow. "I came here on the spur
of the moment, and may have to ask your sponsorship for an
hotel&mdash;being luggageless."</p>

<p>"I'll do better than that, if you'll allow me, sir. I've got a
spare room in my house, and shall be only too pleased to put you
up, and," he added, with a laugh, "I think you'll be able to get
into a spare suit of my pyjamas."</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you, Inspector, and I accept, gratefully,
if I have to stay the night. It is pure curiosity which has brought
me here. I'd like to be present if there's an interesting
<i>dnouement</i>. Otherwise, please remember I'm only an outsider
so far as this case is concerned."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I don't know so much about that! Kinch put me wise to
a certain extent when he 'phoned. Now, sir! You'd like to know
what's happened since then?"</p>

<p>"I should, very much."</p>

<p>"Well, one of my men and I met that train&mdash;a couple of
hours ago. And I very soon spotted the quarry when she got
off."</p>

<p>"This woman Bates? The dickens you did! Did you know her,
then?"</p>

<p>"Not by that name, Captain Bristow. And not much about her by
any other name. But we do happen to have a little information. You
see, she's been living here for a short time&mdash;she and her
husband. Name of Charlier, partly French, so I imagine. About two
months ago, they moved into a small house here&mdash;Weston View is
the name of it. Charlier seems, from what I've had time to make
out, to have been going up to town most days. Of course we've
scores of men living here who are 'something in the City.' Quiet,
respectable folks, no children, and a charwoman going in for the
day. Mrs. Charlier, though, has, apparently, been away from home
for a month or more."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>The Inspector smiled.</p>

<p>"Fits in, eh? Well, Charlier stayed on&mdash;by himself. At
least, that seems to have been so, but you'll understand, of
course, that, having no line upon them, they haven't been under
observation in any way&mdash;only I like to know something about
residents here. There are queer fish in this garden city of ours at
times. Since I met that train and spotted the woman I've had a few
enquiries made, and a preliminary report has come in. Charlier, as
I say, has been living there alone during his wife's absence, but,
three or four times, he's been visited by a woman. He was away from
home Monday and Tuesday nights last&mdash;yes&mdash;I see the
significance of that&mdash;he came back on Wednesday, bringing this
woman with him. I can't be sure, but possibly she stayed there.</p>

<p>"Well, to make a long story short, when Mrs. Charlier arrived
this afternoon she made straight for the house, and let herself in
with a key. Kinch's man, Morgan, and one of my men here followed,
of course. They've got the place under observation. It's an easy
house to watch; stands by itself, and has a few trees about the
garden. Also, there's a telephone-booth at the end of the road, and
that's handy. My man has 'phoned me from it already. He says Mrs.
Charlier is alone&mdash;the charwoman had left before she came. And
that's as far as we've got, sir.</p>

<p>"What do you propose to do?"</p>

<p>"Well, we've got to be careful. From what Kinch said, he'd
enough information to justify an arrest. Isn't that so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, quite. But you don't want&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course not," broke in the other. "Not just yet. And, so far,
you've got nothing against the man, have you?"</p>

<p>"Didn't even know who he was."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Besides, there's another thing. That pearl necklace. I
take it Kinch would like to get hold of that, if it's possible.
Anyhow, I've made up my mind, as a precautionary measure, to have a
search-warrant ready. I was just going round to a magistrate to get
one when you came in. And I think I'll do so now, sir.&mdash;You
let my missus get you a cup of tea, and I'll be back soon. Anyhow,
we can't make any move till Charlier turns up. And his wife won't
get away before then&mdash;you bet!"</p>

<p>"I'll be glad of the tea. May I use your telephone,
Inspector?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>Bristow got on to Frimley Manor. Anstice answered his call. He
told her he should not be returning that night, and asked if
Charles Lynwood was in. In another minute Charlie spoke.</p>

<p>"What's up, Roger?" he asked.</p>

<p>Bristow laughed.</p>

<p>"Too long a story to tell you, Charlie. Except one thing. I
thought I'd like to put you out of your misery, old chap."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That you needn't worry any more about what you told me. It
wasn't Sonia Fullinger you saw that night&mdash;outside the
house."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! But&mdash;but&mdash;I <i>did</i> see her."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't. You can take that as a certainty, my boy!"</p>

<p>"Who was it, then?"</p>

<p>Bristow chuckled.</p>

<p>"Ask Sonia," he replied. "She knows. And I think it's due to her
that you should explain why you ran away the day after the
murder."</p>

<p>"You're not joking, Roger?"</p>

<p>"Never was more serious."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" A pause, and then:</p>

<p>"I'll get out the two-seater and run up and see her this
evening."</p>

<p>"Good."</p>

<p>And he rang off, smiling to himself.</p>

<p>It was later on that evening that the telephone-bell rang. The
Inspector took up the receiver and listened. Then he turned to
Bristow, and said:</p>

<p>"That was from my man. He says Charlier has just returned and
gone into the house. There was a woman with him. I think I'll go
there at once."</p>

<p>"I'll come with you."</p>

<p>The Inspector hesitated.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;it won't do for you to be seen, sir. They&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know. I'll keep in the background. I presume you'll go
in&mdash;with your search-warrant?"</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "It's only a few minutes' walk."</p>

<p>Weston View was a picturesque villa situated in a quiet street
of similar houses, mostly detached. It stood well back from the
road in its own grounds. The next-door house was unoccupied.</p>

<p>Lounging about the road, at a little distance from the house,
was a nondescript-looking man, smoking a pipe. The Inspector
stopped to speak to him.</p>

<p>"It's all right, sir," he said. "The three of them are in the
house. Morgan is in the next-door garden. There's a good view from
there of one of the rooms, and plenty of cover. A low fence divides
the two gardens."</p>

<p>"Right!" said the Inspector. "You join him, Simmonds. You can go
with him, Captain Bristow, only please keep out of sight to begin
with. Can you and Morgan," he went on to Simmonds, "manage to get
over that fence into their garden without being seen?"</p>

<p>"Quite easy, sir,&mdash;at the further end."</p>

<p>"Very well. Do that&mdash;both of you. I'm going to have a look
round first, and then I'll call&mdash;at the front door. Watch for
me. As soon as I'm inside the house, you two are to see to it that
none of them make a get-away by the back door or the windows. Got
that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"All right, then. Off you go."</p>

<p>Bristow followed Simmonds into the next-door garden. Morgan was
crouching there behind a tree, peering through a knothole in the
dividing fence. He looked round at their approach, and a look of
surprise passed over his face as he saw Bristow.</p>

<p>"Is Superintendent Kinch here?" he asked, in a low voice.
Bristow shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "But I've come to have a look&mdash;as a
spectator." Morgan grinned.</p>

<p>"You'll get a fair view through that hole, sir. You can see
right into the room where the three of them are. They seem to be
rather excited."</p>

<p>Simmonds briefly repeated to Morgan the Inspector's orders, and
the two men, crouching low so as not to be seen over the low fence,
made their way to the bottom of the garden. Bristow watched them
climb the fence. Then he put his eye to the knothole.</p>

<p>Morgan was right. He could see into the room opposite through a
French window. It was, evidently, a dining-room. Seated, facing the
window, on the further side of a table, he could make out a man,
apparently young, and wearing a black moustache. On his left, also
seated, was a young woman, in hat and coat, her elbows on the
table, her chin in her hands, motionless, looking straight in front
of her.</p>

<p>Looking at "Bates." And it was upon "Bates" that Bristow
concentrated his gaze, after a brief glance at the other two. For
the ex-lady's-maid appeared to be "holding the stage." She stood,
on the other side of the table, her shingled golden hair rather
dishevelled, excited, talking volubly. Bristow could even hear her
raised voice, though he caught no words. Every now and then her arm
shot out&mdash;towards the man&mdash;or the other woman&mdash;as if
she were denouncing them. Every now and then she brought her hand
down on the table, emphasising her remarks. Not for a moment was
she still. Once or twice the man leaned forward and spoke. Each
time he did so, "Bates" turned on him like a virago.</p>

<p>Bristow cautiously shifted his position, got behind the tree,
stood up, and, keeping the tree between him and the window
opposite, glanced over the fence. From where he stood he could just
see the front gate. The Inspector, in uniform, was coming in
through it. The psychological moment was arriving.</p>

<p>Stooping once more, Bristow put his eye to the knothole again.
The man had risen from his chair, come round the table, and was
standing by the window. He unhasped it, and threw it open. Then
turned towards the interior. And Bristow heard him say:</p>

<p>"Look here, you little devil! I've had enough of it. You've
bungled the whole thing, and I'm sick of you. The sooner you clear
out the better I shall like it."</p>

<p>"Clear out!" Bates's voice rose into a shriek. "You thought you
were going to clear out, with that strumpet of yours, before I
found out anything, didn't you? That's why you told me to stay on
where I was, eh? You wouldn't have cared a damn if the cops had
traced me. But I guessed you were hiding something from me, and I
came down here and found I was right. Oh, yes! I'll clear out!
Only&mdash;before I go&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was standing at the back of the room now, and Bristow could
not see her plainly. But he could make out that, suddenly, her arm
went up&mdash;there was a flash of red fire&mdash;a
report&mdash;and the man at the window spun round and pitched,
headlong, onto the gravelled path outside. There followed a
piercing scream, another stab of flame, and then Bristow vaulted
over the fence just as the two policemen came tearing up the
garden.</p>

<p>Bristow bounded across to the window, over the prostrate body of
the man, into the room, which reeked with an acrid smell, through
the door into the hall, and then&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bates" was in the hall, cramming her hat on. She opened the
front door, and then started back, with a cry. The big Inspector
stood in the doorway, blocking her path. She ran
back&mdash;straight into Bristow's arms, and he seized hold of her
wrists. She looked at him.</p>

<p>"<i>You!</i>" she shouted. "Damn you! I ought to have
known&mdash;Ah!&mdash;"</p>

<p>She wrenched her hands free, struggled&mdash;bit&mdash;kicked.
It was two or three minutes before the Inspector had the handcuffs
on her and was holding her down on a chair in the hall. As he said
afterwards, a really vicious woman gives more trouble than a
prize-fighter.</p>

<p>Panting, half-sobbing, she turned to Bristow again.</p>

<p>"Tracked me down, have you?" she cried. "But I don't care if I
swing for it. I mean for what I've just done now. I'd have given
myself up rather than he should have got away with that minx. I
hope I've killed them both. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here!" said the Inspector. "Just keep quiet, will you?" She
looked up at him."</p>

<p>"I won't keep quiet&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's for your good I'm telling you," he said, firmly. "You're
under arrest for being concerned in the murder of Jasper Hurst and
the robbery of Mrs. Cresswell's pearls," he went on, formally. "And
I warn you that anything you say&mdash;"</p>

<p>She laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>"You won't stop me saying what I choose," she cried, "and it
doesn't matter now what I say. Only&mdash;"</p>

<p>Impatiently the Inspector took her by the arm and led her back
into the dining-room, Bristow following them. Lying in an arm-chair
was the other woman, Simmonds bending over her. Outside the window
Morgan was kneeling beside Charlier, who was stretched on the
ground.</p>

<p>"Get a move on, quick," ordered the Inspector. "Is she dead,
Simmonds?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Not even hit, I fancy. Looks like a faint."</p>

<p>"Right. See if there's a telephone in the house&mdash;if not,
use the one at the street corner. Call up Dr. Leslie and tell him
to hurry. Then call the ambulance and a taxi. Mind this woman, will
you, please, sir?"</p>

<p>Bristow came over to Bates and stood beside her. The Inspector
went outside. Morgan looked up.</p>

<p>"I don't think he's dead, sir," he said. "The bullet seems to
have struck him behind the ear&mdash;and glanced off."</p>

<p>"Humph! Can't tell till the doctor comes. We'll carry him
indoors, though. Lucky that next-door house is vacant, or we'd have
had half the street in by now...Yes&mdash;lay him on the floor. Put
that cushion under his head."</p>

<p>He slipped his hand under the man's waistcoat.</p>

<p>"You may be right," he said to Morgan. "I believe his heart's
beating."</p>

<p>The Inspector turned to "Bates." She was sitting in a chair,
silently looking on, pale of face and breathing heavily. But her
rage seemed to have subsided.</p>

<p>"Now," said the Inspector to her, "I've got a taxi coming for
you. Are you going to give me any more trouble, or will you go
quietly if I send you to the police-station with one of my men
here?"</p>

<p>She looked at him, half-defiantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't worry about me," she replied. "I've come to the
end of things now and there's nothing more to be done. I wish I'd
killed them both, though!" she added, her eyes blazing for a
moment.</p>

<p>"I should have thought that being charged with one murder was
enough," said the Inspector, dryly.</p>

<p>"There you are wrong," she retorted. "I never killed Jasper.
And, what's more, you say I'm charged with being concerned in the
robbery of that pearl necklace. Well," and she pointed with her
manacled hands at the man who was stretched on the floor, "if
there's any truth in <i>his</i> story, the necklace never left
Frimley. But I want to make a statement: I want to tell you the
whole..."</p>

<p>"Look here," broke in the Inspector, sternly. "I've warned you
once, for your own good, about saying anything. If you choose to do
so, you must take the risk yourself. Only, I'm not going to hear
you now. That sounds like the taxi&mdash;yes&mdash;Take her away,
Simmonds," he stepped outside the French window and looked towards
the gate&mdash;"ah, and here's the doctor, too."</p>

<p>The doctor, after a brief question or two, made very short work
of his two patients. The woman, who was already recovering, he
pronounced to be in no danger&mdash;merely suffering from the
results of shock&mdash;and the Inspector made arrangements for
having her taken to the police-station to be detained pending
enquiries. A swift examination of Charlier, who was still bleeding
from a wound behind the ear, confirmed Morgan's suspicions that the
bullet had not penetrated his brain.</p>

<p>"Concussion," he said, "but I don't think he's in any danger.
I'll just fix a bandage on his head, and then we'll have him taken
to the hospital&mdash;you say you've 'phoned for the ambulance?
Good. He ought to regain consciousness after a bit. May one ask
what it's all about, Inspector?"</p>

<p>The Inspector laughed, shortly.</p>

<p>"I don't know, yet," he replied, "except that it's a case of
attempted murder, to say nothing of an actual one. We've got to put
the jigsaw together a bit before we can make a clear picture. What
do you think, sir?" he added, turning to Bristow.</p>

<p>"I think," said Bristow, dryly, "that it won't be very long
before that picture stands out, and that Bates&mdash;or Mrs.
Charlier&mdash;or whatever her name is, will put the pieces
together. Jealousy acts on a woman very much as, according to the
old proverb, '<i>In vino veritas</i>,' alcohol acts on a man. And I
fancy you'll find, in this case, that she'll tell the whole truth,
whatever it costs her. She's out for revenge&mdash;especially as
she failed to get it&mdash;with <i>that!</i>"</p>

<p>And he pointed to a small revolver which the Inspector had
picked up from the floor, and which now lay on the table.</p>

<p>"And how about that search-warrant?" he went on.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Inspector, "as soon as we've got these people
away, we'll have a look over the house. Though I don't expect to
find those pearls here&mdash;after what she said."</p>

<p>Nor did he. Neither did he find anything incriminating. Finally
he and Bristow went back to the police-station.</p>

<p>It was late that night, and the two men were smoking a pipe in
the Inspector's sanctum. The latter had visited Charlier in the
hospital. Charlier had, as the doctor foretold, recovered
consciousness, but had refused to answer the few questions the
Inspector had put to him. The latter left a policeman on duty by
the patient's bed. He had also interviewed the woman whom Charlier
had brought with him to Weston View, but she, too, had refused
either to disclose her identity or to give any information, except
that she protested against being detained and declared that there
was no possible charge against her.</p>

<p>A knock came at the door, and, in answer to the Inspector's
"Come in," a policeman entered.</p>

<p>"It's about this woman&mdash;Charlier, sir," he said. "She's
asking if she can see you and Captain Bristow tonight."</p>

<p>"Oh! How is she now?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly calm, sir. She's eaten her supper. Mrs. Rose, who is
seeing to her, says she is giving no trouble."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well. Shall we go and see her, Captain Bristow?"
Bristow nodded.</p>

<p>"It might be as well," he replied.</p>

<p>The policeman was right. "Bates" was sitting on her bed in the
cell, all traces of rage and excitement departed. Still dressed in
the plain black frock she had worn in Sonia Fullinger's service,
she looked more like a demure lady's-maid than a potential
murderess. Her fair hair was carefully brushed and she had powdered
her face and touched up her lips.</p>

<p>She looked up as the door opened and the two men stood in the
entrance of the cell.</p>

<p>"Thank you for coming," she said, in even tones. "No," she went
on, as the Inspector was about to speak. "I know you have to
caution me&mdash;and you've done so already. I'm perfectly aware of
my position, and you are welcome to make any use you like of what I
may say&mdash;though it won't be much now. I suppose," she went on,
to Bristow, "I have to thank <i>you</i> for tracking me down?"</p>

<p>Bristow shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I am not a policeman," he said, "but I may have helped the
police&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"I thought so. Jules warned me to be on the look-out for
you."</p>

<p>"Jules?"</p>

<p>"Jules Charlier. The man I shot this evening."</p>

<p>She made the statement coolly and evenly, as though the shooting
of Jules Charlier was the most casual thing in the world.</p>

<p>"Your husband?" said the Inspector.</p>

<p>"No. Not my husband."</p>

<p>"But you were living with him here?"</p>

<p>"That may be. You have him under arrest?"</p>

<p>The Inspector hesitated.</p>

<p>"I have detained him," he replied.</p>

<p>"Ah! You want a definite charge, I suppose? I can give it to
you, Inspector. Jules Charlier killed Jasper Hurst&mdash;I daresay
you have guessed that already?" she asked Bristow.</p>

<p>The latter nodded.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to make a statement to that effect?" said the
Inspector. "You are not obliged to do so, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I'll make a statement&mdash;enough for you to charge
him. I'm not going to spare him. But, what I want to know is this:
Can I give evidence at the adjourned inquest?"</p>

<p>"You can if you wish to," replied the Inspector; "but it is my
duty to warn you, for your own interests, that anything you say
then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know," she interrupted. "But I don't care what I
say. I want to make sure that the truth is known. You give me pen
and paper now, please, and I'll write out what you ought to know up
to the present. And the rest I'll make plain at the inquest."</p>

<p>"You may not be wise," put in Bristow.</p>

<p>She laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"I'm past the time when it's a question of wisdom or folly,
Captain Bristow. I'm a woman who only wants&mdash;revenge!"</p>

<p>And her eyes flashed.</p>

<p>There was, if anything, more excitement about the adjourned
sitting at the Coroner's Court than when it had first opened. The
hall was crowded, and a buzz of anticipation sounded over the room
as those present waited for the Coroner to come in. Sir Harry and
his two sons were there, Charlie seated next to Sonia Fullinger.
Mr. and Mrs. Cresswell were present, and so was the Chief
Constable.</p>

<p>The Coroner came in, took his seat, and the roll of the eleven
jurymen was called. The Coroner addressed them, gravely.</p>

<p>"Since the last time we met, gentlemen," he said, "certain
extremely important events have arisen which will materially assist
you in arriving at your verdict. I have no doubt that some of those
events are known to you through the public press, but I want you to
keep your minds clear of all that, so far as this enquiry is
concerned. The functions of a Coroner and his Court have, recently,
been severely criticised in certain instances, in some cases,
perhaps, with a measure of justice, but I, for one, while strictly
guarding the prerogatives of this court, should be sorry if, in any
way, it merited similar criticisms. I wish you, therefore, to
understand that your and my sole duty is to record the manner in
which the deceased, Jasper Hurst, met with his death. I understand
that the police have further objects in view, but those objects do
not concern this court. The evidence that you are asked to hear,
therefore, will be strictly confined to the purpose of this
enquiry. Events which have transpired since you last met have
affected the course of this enquiry, and it will be, I think,
unnecessary to call certain witnesses I had in my mind.</p>

<p>"I should also like to add," he went on, consulting his notes,
"that there is one witness whom I cannot compel to give evidence in
this Court, but who, I am told, wishes to do so. In order that her
evidence, when given, may be properly judged as to its worth and
reliability, I shall call certain other witnesses first. Rose
Ellington, please."</p>

<p>There came forward a young woman of about thirty years of age,
plain of face, and quietly dressed. She took the oath.</p>

<p>"Your name?"</p>

<p>"Rose Ellington, sir."</p>

<p>"Your home?"</p>

<p>"My home is at Pinner, sir. But I am not living there. I am
employed in the service of Mrs. Andrews, of Tudor House, Elm
Avenue, Amersham."</p>

<p>"Quite so. As lady's-maid, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Before then, however, you occupied the same position in Miss
Fullinger's service?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir,&mdash;I did."</p>

<p>"And left very suddenly."</p>

<p>The girl reddened.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Will you tell the jury why?"</p>

<p>"I had&mdash;an inducement to do so, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! In what way?"</p>

<p>"An offer of money."</p>

<p>"Yes? How much?"</p>

<p>"Fifty pounds, sir."</p>

<p>"And who made you this offer?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"You don't know? Well, tell us how it came about."</p>

<p>"It began with a letter&mdash;asking me to meet the
writer&mdash;under the clock at Charing Cross station&mdash;and
saying it meant something to my advantage. So I went. There was a
woman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You would know her again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"She offered me fifty pounds if I would leave my
place&mdash;somehow&mdash;I don't know how&mdash;she seemed to know
I was badly in want of money...I was in debt...She gave me half the
sum then and there, and I made an excuse to leave Miss
Fullinger&mdash;and the other half came by post."</p>

<p>"That is all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well. Stand down, please. I shall want you again later on.
Miss Fullinger!"</p>

<p>Sonia came forward, smiling at something Charlie had whispered
to her. All eyes were directed towards her, for a whisper had gone
forth that she was closely connected with the case. She gave her
name and address, and then the Coroner asked her:</p>

<p>"When you were staying at Frimley Manor for the pageant, you had
your maid with you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Her name?"</p>

<p>"She called herself Phyllis Aurelia Bates."</p>

<p>Some of those present exchanged significant glances, foreseeing
a mystery.</p>

<p>"You engaged her when your late maid, Ellington, left your
service?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"She called, saying that a Registry Office had given her my
name."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;and her testimonials?"</p>

<p>"She produced a written one from Lady Challington, with whom she
had been&mdash;so the testimonial said&mdash;four years."</p>

<p>"And you engaged her on the strength of this?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Now, Miss Fullinger, you were acting in the pageant.
Tell us what costume you were wearing?"</p>

<p>The girl did so. The Coroner went on:</p>

<p>"When you retired for the night, you were still wearing this
dress?"</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"When you had taken it off, did it remain in your room that
night?"</p>

<p>"No. My maid took it away to fold ready for packing."</p>

<p>"What time was that?"</p>

<p>"Just after eleven."</p>

<p>"When did you see the costume again?"</p>

<p>"My maid brought it back in the morning, and packed it in my
room."</p>

<p>"Thank you. That will do, Miss Fullinger. Mr. Charles Lynwood,
please."</p>

<p>"I believe," went on the Coroner, dryly, when Charlie had taken
his place, "that you have something to add to the evidence you have
previously given. Will you tell the jury what that is?"</p>

<p>Slowly and deliberately Charlie unfolded the story he had told
in the first instance to Captain Bristow. Quite an audible gasp of
astonishment burst from the listeners as he calmly recounted how he
had seen someone in that Edward the Sixth's costume emerge from the
house and meet an unknown man at the entrance to the marquee.</p>

<p>"And you believed her to be Miss Fullinger?" asked the
Coroner.</p>

<p>"Naturally," replied Charlie, with great coolness. There was
another gasp of astonishment. Several of the jury turned and looked
at Sonia. She was actually smiling. The Coroner leaned forward and
said, a little severely:</p>

<p>"Why did you not tell us this last time, Mr. Lynwood?"</p>

<p>"You did not ask me," answered Charlie.</p>

<p>"I hardly think that was the reason," snapped the Coroner. "But
I will say nothing about that, except that I am bound to observe
that no excuse suffices for withholding evidence. However, we are
glad, now, to have heard what you have told us. That will do, Mr.
Lynwood."</p>

<p>Charlie, quite unabashed by this rebuke, resumed his seat next
to Sonia. The Coroner looked at his notes for a few moments, and
then called Superintendent Kinch.</p>

<p>"Just one question, Superintendent. Miss Fullinger has told us
she engaged Bates, her maid, on the strength of a testimonial from
Lady Challington. Have you anything to say on this matter?"</p>

<p>"I have, sir," replied Kinch, tersely. "I ascertained that Lady
Challington is in India; I obtained her address and cabled to her
for verification. This is her reply."</p>

<p>He produced a cablegram and read:</p>

<p>"Have no knowledge of Bates. Did not give testimonial."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the Coroner. "That is all."</p>

<p>Again he consulted his notes. Then he leaned back in his chair
and spoke to the jury, in his somewhat sententious manner:</p>

<p>"The evidence you have just heard," he said, "may perhaps appear
irrelevant. But I assure you it is not. It has been given mainly
for the purpose of preparing you for a witness I have already
mentioned, and who, as I told you, cannot be compelled to give
evidence, for the reason that she is under arrest on a serious
charge connected with this case. I understand, however, that it is
her wish to make a statement, and, that being so, I shall, of
course, allow her to give evidence. I wish, before doing so, to
point out to you that, in connection with the death of Jasper Hurst
a robbery appears to have taken place. The investigation of that
robbery, however, is not the business of this court. I mention
this, in case any of you might feel disposed to put questions
concerning the matter. Such questions I shall disallow.
Yes"&mdash;he nodded to Kinch&mdash;"you may bring her in."</p>

<p>Kinch stepped to a door at the back of the hall which opened
into a dressing-room. All eyes were fixed on it. Jarvis, the local
policeman, emerged, escorting a woman dressed in black, a
fair-haired, pretty woman, whose complexion owed something to art
as well as nature. But her prettiness was marred by the hard,
steely look in her blue eyes, and the little downward curves at the
corners of her tightly-compressed mouth.</p>

<p>The Chief Constable, who had watched her intently as she came
forward, turned and whispered to Bristow:</p>

<p>"By gad, Bristow, I shouldn't like to be up against that woman!
Devilish fierce, eh?"</p>

<p>"She is," retorted Bristow, "suffering from the worst passion a
woman ever falls under&mdash;jealousy. She's a bad lot, anyhow,
but&mdash;as you say&mdash;she's a regular devil now. She's tried
murder, and failed. <i>Now</i> she means to invoke the
hangman."</p>

<p>The Coroner spoke to her, gravely.</p>

<p>"I have to warn you," he said, "that you are not compelled to
give evidence in this Court. If you determine to do so, you must
take the risks. You had better consider carefully before the oath
is administered."</p>

<p>"I have considered," she replied, in a firm, even voice. "I
understand perfectly that I am here to speak of my own will and
accord. And I wish to do so."</p>

<p>"Very well," and he nodded to the Clerk, who administered the
oath.</p>

<p>"Your name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Francia Hurst."</p>

<p>"We are inquiring into the cause of the death of Jasper Hurst.
Are you related to him?"</p>

<p>"He was my husband."</p>

<p>"Ah-h!" A long-drawn sigh went forth from the spectators. She
never moved, but stood there, her eyes fixed on the Coroner.</p>

<p>"You were not living with him?"</p>

<p>"Not for the last two years."</p>

<p>"And can you throw any light upon his death?"</p>

<p>"I can tell you everything," she replied, quietly. "The only
question I wish to ask is, need I give my reasons for doing
so?"</p>

<p>"Not if you don't want to," said the Coroner. "The facts will be
sufficient. And I think I will ask you to tell us in your own way.
I have already warned you, and I have no wish to make the position
in which you have voluntarily placed yourself more difficult by
pressing you with questions. Go on, please."</p>

<p>She paused, just for a moment, and then, from time to time
glancing at a paper she held in her hand, in a low, but perfectly
modulated voice, made her statement amid a strained and intense
silence.</p>

<p>"I first met my late husband in Annecy&mdash;in France&mdash;and
we were married a very short time afterwards. He made few enquiries
about me, but knew that I was an orphan, born of English parents.
But what he did not know was&mdash;well&mdash;my associates, and,
as I had purposed to put them from me on my marriage, I told him
nothing. Resolutions, however, are sometimes difficult to carry
out, and&mdash;well&mdash;these associates of whom I have
spoken&mdash;would not altogether allow me to put them out of my
life."</p>

<p>"One moment," interrupted the Coroner. "Will
you&mdash;er&mdash;tell us the nature of these associates?"</p>

<p>She regarded him steadily.</p>

<p>"They were crooks," she replied. "Some French and some
English."</p>

<p>The Coroner nodded.</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"Jasper Hurst's profession was that of a private enquiry agent.
I did not know exactly what he was until some little time after our
marriage. Then, from hints which he dropped, I got to know that he
had discovered something about my past. But more followed. He began
to suspect that I had not entirely dissociated myself from the
past&mdash;which was true. And then&mdash;well, he spoke to me
about it. He was, I suppose, justified in doing so, and I bear him
no ill-will&mdash;but it began an estrangement, which widened. I
take the blame. Women dislike to be ordered to do
things&mdash;and&mdash;well, I resented it. He didn't understand
me. He forced me more and more to go back to my old
companions&mdash;and&mdash;and..." she faltered a little now,
"there was one of them who&mdash;before I married&mdash;had been
more than a companion&mdash;and&mdash;well, I left my husband, and
went to him. I asked my husband to divorce me. But he would not.
I&mdash;I&mdash;think he must have cared for me still. And I knew
he kept himself aware of my movements. I had proof of it."</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, and looked at the Coroner, as if,
almost, she was asking him to help her along. But he remained
silent. Then she went on:</p>

<p>"Jules Charlier&mdash;the man I have told you of&mdash;" A hard
look came into her eyes as she spoke his name&mdash;"was a clever
jewel thief, so clever that he had never been detected, though I
knew that my husband suspected&mdash;what was the truth&mdash;that
he took the Countess of Chelmsford's diamonds. My husband was
engaged on the case. Well, to make a long story short, Jules
Charlier knew about Mrs. Cresswell's pearl necklace&mdash;and
he&mdash;<i>we</i>"&mdash;and she emphasised the word&mdash;"were
determined to get it. Jules was clever, and he laid his plans
carefully. We got to know about the pageant that was to be acted
here. Mrs. Cresswell was foolish enough to talk to her friends
about her part and how she was going to wear her pearls. And we
also got to know that Miss Fullinger would be staying with her
here. I bribed Miss Fullinger's maid to leave her at a moment's
notice, and secured her place by a forged testimonial. Everything
was arranged. Jules was to motor down from London the night after
this pageant, and I was to get the necklace and take it out to him
between half-past one and two. I very soon found out Mrs.
Cresswell's habits&mdash;I had every opportunity in the two or
three days here before the pageant&mdash;and I knew she kept the
necklace in a case in her dressing-case and her bunch of keys in
her left-hand drawer. I also found she had duplicate keys to the
dressing-case, and I took one of them off the ring.</p>

<p>"That night Miss Fullinger went to bed rather earlier than the
others. She rang for me. I helped her to undress, as she was not
feeling well. Among other things, she asked me to take the costume
she had been wearing and fold it ready for packing. That gave me
the idea. I went to my room and changed into the costume. It was
partly a precaution, because, if I were seen, I should be mistaken
for Miss Fullinger, and, in any case, a male costume was easier in
which to move about quietly.</p>

<p>"It was something after one o'clock that I went into Mrs.
Cresswell's room, unlocked her dressing-case, and took out the
pearls. It was quite simple, and hardly took a minute. When I came
out on the corridor I heard men's voices downstairs. I
waited&mdash;listening. Then I heard them saying good night in the
hall&mdash;and the front door shut&mdash;and someone came up the
stairs. I slipped into the lavatory at the end of the corridor, and
waited till all was quiet. Then I went downstairs. The hall light
was still burning, and I imagined they had forgotten to turn it
out, so I switched it off myself. Then I went out of the
house."</p>

<p>"By the front door?" put in the Coroner.</p>

<p>"No. I was afraid of making a noise by unlocking it&mdash;and I
did not know, then, that it was already unfastened. I went into the
library and opened one of the French windows, at the side of the
house."</p>

<p>Jarvis, who was listening, suddenly started. Something seemed to
have occurred to him. The witness went on:</p>

<p>"I went out on the lawn. I suddenly remembered that I was to
wave my handkerchief as a signal, but, in changing into the
costume, I had forgotten to bring one. I felt in the pockets in
case there was one there. There was. It was Miss Fullinger's, of
course. So I waved it. Then I saw Jules coming from behind some
trees&mdash;at least, I supposed it was Jules, though I couldn't
see his face as he came up&mdash;he had a muffler round the lower
part of it and his hat was pulled down over his eyes. But, when he
spoke, I recognised his voice. He said, 'Have you got it?' and I
replied, 'Yes.' Then he whispered, 'Come inside that
tent&mdash;there's too much light here, and we might be seen from
the house. I want a word with you.' I handed him the jewel-case,
and we went inside the tent. Then he told me he had had a breakdown
with the car, and had begun to fear he wouldn't get here in time.
He said he had come on by train to Chiltonbury, where he had found
a car outside the station, and had taken it. This, he said, had
altered his plans, as he dare not drive back in it to London. I was
to have met him the next evening at Letcham, where we had taken a
house, but he told me to remain with Miss Fullinger till he let me
know&mdash;I didn't understand then," she went on, bitterly, "but I
did afterwards. As he talked he was holding the jewel-case in his
hand. He took off the muffler. 'Found it in the car,' he said, 'but
it's frightfully hot.' Just then he gave a start, dropped the
scarf, and gripped my arm. I turned. Standing at the tent door was
the black silhouette of a man. Before we had time to think he had
bounded forward and seized the jewel-case. Then he made for the
entrance of the tent, but Jules was too quick for him&mdash;he put
out his leg and tripped him. He was up in a moment, but by this
time Jules had his back to the opening, and I saw, as the moon
shone in, something shining on his clenched hand. The other man had
retreated to the back of the tent. Then, as far as I was concerned,
it was all confusion. Jules went for him&mdash;he seemed to dodge
him&mdash;then they met face to face&mdash;and the other struck
out. But Jules is a clever boxer&mdash;I saw him parry the blow
with one hand while the other shot forward&mdash;there was a
crash&mdash;and the man fell to the ground.</p>

<p>"'Oh!' I said. 'What has happened?'</p>

<p>"'Keep quiet,' whispered Jules&mdash;flashing a small electric
torch&mdash;'at any rate I've got the pearls'&mdash;and he picked
up the case, which was lying on the ground, and put it in his
pocket. Then he turned the light on the face of the man who lay
there&mdash;and I saw. It was my husband."</p>

<p>There was a thrill of intense excitement in the Court. Perhaps,
of all there, Francia Hurst was the most detached. She was telling
her story in such a calm, lucid manner, as though she had not been
one of the principal characters in its action. But there were those
there, Captain Bristow among them, who realised that it was strong
passion&mdash;the passion of jealousy and revenge&mdash;raging in
her heart which really produced that calm demeanour.</p>

<p>She went on:</p>

<p>"He was dressed in a black velvet suit&mdash;and then I knew. I
had seen him among the performers in the pageant, and had noticed
something familiar. But he was wearing a beard then, and I suppose
that is why I did not recognise him.</p>

<p>"I was terribly frightened. I had no quarrel with my husband: he
had always treated me well...only...well, I suppose I never really
loved him&mdash;and so I had left him. I thought he was dead. But
Jules stooped down and laid his hand on his heart&mdash;and
then&mdash;my husband moved slightly, and tried to speak. 'He
brought it on himself,' said Jules. 'I had to knock him
out&mdash;but now&mdash;we mustn't leave him here. If he comes to,
he'll give the alarm.'</p>

<p>"Then he made up his mind. We did not know he was living in the
village here. Nor did we think, then, that he was so seriously
hurt. Jules' only thought was how to get him out of the way while
he made his escape. Finally he said we must get him to the
car&mdash;which Jules had left in the drive. Then Jules would drive
the car away to some quiet spot he knew of, and leave him there. He
said he was sure to be found...and...well, I was so frightened that
I agreed to everything.</p>

<p>"The sedan-chair was my idea. I saw that, once we got him
inside, we could carry him much more easily. So we lifted him in,
seating him there. He tried to speak&mdash;even then. Then we
started, carrying him off. We had reached the bridge when we heard
something behind us&mdash;and we looked round and saw someone
running from the house. Jules was always quick of action&mdash;and
he didn't hesitate for an instant. 'Run for the car,' he whispered,
and we set down the chair and took to our heels&mdash;just in time.
I looked round as Jules started her, and saw our pursuer had almost
overtaken us. I couldn't make out who he was, for he was flashing
an electric torch.</p>

<p>"At the gate, Jules stopped the car for a moment, and told me to
get back to the house as well as I could. I asked him to take me
with him&mdash;but he wouldn't. I know <i>why</i> now!"</p>

<p>As she spoke, Bristow, who was watching her closely, saw, for a
moment, a change spread over her set face. Her eyes
flashed&mdash;and she caught her breath. Then she went on:</p>

<p>"He said it would allay suspicion if I returned, and give him a
better chance to get away. But&mdash;but&mdash;<i>that</i> wasn't
his reason."</p>

<p>The Coroner, at this point, interrupted her, saying, dryly:</p>

<p>"You remember you said you were only going to give us
facts&mdash;not reasons, Mrs. Hurst?"</p>

<p>She turned on him. She was losing her self-possession a little
now. "I shall tell my story how I choose!"</p>

<p>"By all means. I only reminded you."</p>

<p>Captain Bristow whispered to the Chief Constable:</p>

<p>"She'll break down before she's finished&mdash;getting to the
end of her tether."</p>

<p>And the Chief Constable nodded in reply.</p>

<p>"I did get back to the house&mdash;after a time," she went on.
"But I saw what was happening first&mdash;I was behind some trees.
And I guessed&mdash;my husband was dead. I was afraid to move into
the open till they had all gone&mdash;back to the house. Then I
made my way round the grounds, and let myself in by the
window&mdash;which was still unfastened."</p>

<p>At this point Jarvis turned to Detective-Sergeant Mentmore, who
was standing beside him, and whispered:</p>

<p>"I <i>told</i> you I saw that French window flash in the
moonlight!"</p>

<p>There was a pause. Francia Hurst put one hand to her throat, the
other grasped the back of a chair&mdash;and Bristow noticed the
chair began to shake slightly.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" asked the Coroner.</p>

<p>"No!" Her voice rang out, but sank as she went on. "It isn't
all. My God, it isn't all! Jules Charlier killed my husband, but
even then I would have stood by him. I <i>did!</i> You and your
policemen"&mdash;she suddenly turned towards Kinch and pointed at
him&mdash;"found nothing from <i>me</i>, did you? Oh, I knew how to
put you off the scent! But&mdash;but&mdash;I waited. And Jules
never wrote&mdash;or wired&mdash;as he said he would&mdash;and I
went to him at last&mdash;I guessed where I should find
him&mdash;and I <i>did</i>. And <i>you</i>," she turned now to
Captain Bristow, "know what happened then&mdash;and <i>why!</i>
I'd&mdash;I'd only been a catspaw! But he didn't get the
necklace&mdash;oh, I'm <i>glad</i> he didn't get it. The case was
empty when Jules opened it&mdash;and he said that was all the more
reason why he'd done with me&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;he killed my
husband&mdash;and&mdash;he&mdash;threw me over...he&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was Kinch who caught her as she shrieked and sank to the
ground, and Kinch and Jarvis who lifted her between them and
carried her out of the hall. And, when order was restored, and the
Superintendent had come back, the Coroner said:</p>

<p>"I propose to call no more witnesses. But before I ask the jury
for their verdict, the police have a statement to make."</p>

<p>And Kinch said, briefly:</p>

<p>"In the ordinary course of events, sir, the man, Jules Charlier,
would have been present at this enquiry&mdash;I mean, of course, in
custody. But he is lying in hospital, suffering from an injury. He
is, I may say, under arrest."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the Coroner, and then proceeded, but not at
any length, to charge the jury.</p>

<p>The verdict, after such evidence, was a foregone conclusion. The
jury, however, before giving it, asked a question, by their
foreman, of the Coroner. They were satisfied that Jules Charlier
had caused the death of the deceased, they said, but as,
apparently, he did not mean to kill him, would it be in order to
leave out the expression "wilful murder" and simply state that
Jasper Hurst died from heart-failure&mdash;they had remembered the
medical evidence&mdash;brought on by a blow given by Jules
Charlier?</p>

<p>"As you please," snapped the Coroner. And that was their
verdict. "All the same," said Kinch, to Mentmore, as they came out,
"our charge will be murder, I think!"<br>
<br>
<br></p>

<p>The company of relatives and friends were gathered in the hall
at Frimley Manor, waiting for the butler to announce luncheon. Mr.
and Mrs. Cresswell, Sonia, Captain Bristow, the Vicar and Major
Bainbridge were all there, with Sir Harry and his two sons and
Anstice. The sedan-chair stood in the corner of the hall&mdash;in
its usual place.</p>

<p>And the Chief Constable had detached himself from the others and
was standing, his hands in his pockets, regarding that chair
intently. Presently he glanced over his shoulders. They were all
talking. Very quietly he opened the door of the chair and stooped
over the interior. Then he shut the door again, a little smile on
his face. Bristow came up to him at that moment.</p>

<p>"What's amusing you, Major?"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;just an inspiration. I say&mdash;Sir Harry!"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>There was a sudden silence&mdash;for the Chief Constable had
raised his voice.</p>

<p>"I'm not <i>really</i> a policeman, or a sleuth, you know," he
said, "but a suggestion came into my mind this morning. Something
that wretched woman said at the inquest set me thinking. The
question is, what became of those pearls, if Jules Charlier never
had them?" Mrs. Cresswell burst out:</p>

<p>"Oh, Major Bainbridge, if only you could find them!"</p>

<p>The Chief Constable smiled.</p>

<p>"What was it poor Hurst said to you&mdash;just before he died?"
he asked Captain Bristow.</p>

<p>"Why, I never could make it out. What he seemed to say was, 'The
line.' But I can't, for the life of me, imagine what he meant."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I can," replied the Chief Constable, with a
smile. "I think he was telling you where to find that necklace.
Suppose I try to prove that. Wasn't it Sherlock Holmes who said
that when you've struck out all that's impossible, what remains
must be true&mdash;or something to that effect? Well, figure it
out. The pearls were in their case when you locked it up, weren't
they, Mrs. Cresswell?"</p>

<p>"But, of course. I can swear to that."</p>

<p>"Very well. This woman we have been listening to took the
case&mdash;with the necklace inside it&mdash;handed it to Jules
Charlier&mdash;necklace still inside. Hurst took it from
him&mdash;necklace still inside. Jules got it
back&mdash;<i>but</i>&mdash;was the necklace still inside? When he
opened the case afterwards, it wasn't there!"</p>

<p>"Where was it, then?" chorused the group.</p>

<p>"It could only have got out of the case when Hurst had it. You
remember she told us he went to the back of the tent? His object,
we all agree, I suppose, was to prevent his wife being implicated
in the robbery. He discovered she was staying here, and that roused
his suspicions. As he went down the drive he must have seen Jules
Charlier, and that car. He had, you remember, discussed Mrs.
Cresswell's necklace with Miss Fullinger while he was at dinner
here. All his suspicions were confirmed, and he followed up Jules
with the intention of getting back the necklace and restoring it.
When he found himself in a tight corner in the tent, he slipped the
pearls out of the case."</p>

<p>"But what did he do with them?" asked Sir Harry.</p>

<p>"The obvious thing. He put them in his pocket."</p>

<p>"But they weren't there!" chorused the group.</p>

<p>"Ah!" retorted the Chief Constable, "I never said he <i>kept</i>
the necklace in his pocket. Remember, when they put him in the
sedan-chair he was semi-conscious&mdash;so he was when you found
him, Bristow."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Bristow, "was it&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Chief Constable stopped him.</p>

<p>"He <i>told</i> you where it was," he said. "It was, really,
quite simple, all the time&mdash;if we'd only thought to study that
chair carefully, as I was doing just now. Look!"</p>

<p>He opened the door of the sedan-chair and pointed within. They
all crowded round.</p>

<p>"Now, then," he went on, "'the line'&mdash;Wasn't what he was
trying to say 'the <i>lining</i>'?"</p>

<p>Inside, the old chair was lined with faded blue silk. And in one
place, on the side of the chair, the lining was torn&mdash;there
was quite a big hole.</p>

<p>Major Bainbridge plunged his hand into this hole and reached
down, behind the lining, to the bottom of the chair. The next
moment he drew out the pearl necklace.</p>

<p>"There!" he said. "My reputation is saved. Allow me, Mrs.
Cresswell. I <i>am</i>, I suppose, a policeman in the official
sense of the word, and it's always a pleasure to the police to be
able to restore stolen property. Will you give me the reward of
wearing it?"</p>

<p>And, with great courtesy, he undid the clasp&mdash;and then
fastened the string of pearls round the neck of the delighted lady,
while the audience clapped approval.</p>

<p>"Gad!" exclaimed Sir Harry. "You're too modest, Bainbridge. No
policeman, eh? You're a super-sleuth! But, suppose the pearls
<i>hadn't</i> been there? It was a bit of a risk, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the Chief Constable, with a smile. "You see,
I have to confess that I satisfied myself that they were there
before I produced them. I plead guilty if I was melodramatic."</p>

<p>"Luncheon is served, Sir Harry."</p>

<p>The butler, staid and impassive, had come into the hall. They
trooped into the dining-room. Captain Bristow, who had been
watching Mr. Cresswell, a little smile on his face, took him by the
arm and managed to keep him back for a moment.</p>

<p>"Cresswell," he said, "are you going to let your wife wear those
pearls at the next pageant?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" He looked at Bristow. "I fancy she will be more
careful in future."</p>

<p>"And if they were stolen again&mdash;would the thief make much
out of them? Am I right in supposing&mdash;well&mdash;that great
things can be done with paste&mdash;and that your bank keeps not
only documentary securities for you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Cresswell stopped, and, in his turn, grasped Bristow's arm.
There was a twinkle in his eyes as he said, in a low tone of
voice:</p>

<p>"I wondered if you had guessed&mdash;something you said the
other day made me wonder&mdash;but, my dear fellow, for heaven's
sake don't tell my wife!"</p>

<p>"Not I," replied Bristow. "Or anyone else, either. I think
you're a wise man, Cresswell."</p>

<p>Any they went in to luncheon.</p>
