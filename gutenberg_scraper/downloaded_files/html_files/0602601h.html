<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I&mdash;A NIGHT ON THE
VELUWE</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>A moonless night upon the sandy waste&mdash;the sky a canopy of
stars, twinkling with super-radiance through the frosty atmosphere;
the gently undulating ground like a billowy sea of silence and
desolation, with scarce a stain upon the smooth surface of the
snow; the mantle of night enveloping every landmark upon the
horizon beyond the hills in folds of deep, dark indigo, levelling
every chance hillock and clump of rough shrub or grass,
obliterating road and wayside ditch, which in the broad light of
day would have marred the perfect evenness of the wintry pall.</p>

<p>It was a bitterly cold night of mid-March in that cruel winter
of 1624, which lent so efficient a hand to the ghouls of war and of
disease in taking toll of human lives.</p>

<p>Not a sound broke the hushed majesty of this forgotten corner of
God's earth, save perhaps at intervals the distant, melancholy call
of the curlew, or from time to time the sigh of a straying breeze,
which came lingering and plaintive from across the Zuyder Zee. Then
for awhile countless particles of snow, fanned by unseen breaths,
would arise from their rest, whirl and dance a mad fandango in the
air, gyrate and skip in a glistening whirlpool lit by mysterious
rays of steel-blue light, and then sink back again, like tired
butterflies, to sleep once more upon the illimitable bosom of the
wild. After which Silence and Lifelessness would resume their
ghostlike sway.</p>

<p>To right and left, and north and south, not half a dozen leagues
away, humanity teemed and fought, toiled and suffered, unfurled the
banner of Liberty, laid down life and wealth in the cause of
Freedom, conquered and was down-trodden and conquered again; men
died that their children might live, women wept and lovers sighed.
But here, beneath that canopy dotted with myriads of glittering
worlds, intransmutable and sempiternal, the cries of battle and
quarrels of men, the wail of widows and the laughter of children
appeared futile and remote.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>But to an eye trained to the dreary monotony of winter upon the
Veluwe, there were a few faint indications of the tracks, which
here and there intersect the arid waste and link up the hamlets and
cities which lie along its boundaries. There were lines&mdash;mere
shadows upon the even sheet of snow&mdash;and tiny white hillocks
that suggested a bordering of rough scrub along the edges of the
roads.</p>

<p>That same trained eye could then proceed to trace those shadowy
lines along their erratic way 'twixt Amersfoort and the Neder Rhyn,
or else from Barneveld as far as Apeldoorn, or yet again 'twixt
Utrecht and Ede, and thence as far as the Ijssel, from the further
shores of which the armies of the Archduchess, under the command of
Count Henri de Berg, were even then threatening Gelderland.</p>

<p>It was upon this last, scarcely visible track that a horse and
rider came slowly ambling along in the small hours of the morning,
on this bitterly cold night in March. The rider had much ado to
keep a tight hold on the reins with one hand, whilst striving to
keep his mantle closely fastened round his shoulders with the
other.</p>

<p>The horse, only half-trusting his master, suspicious and with
nerves a-quiver, ready to shy and swerve at every shadow that
loomed out of the darkness, or at every unexpected sound that
disturbed the silence of the night, would more than once have
thrown his rider but for the latter's firm hand upon the curb.</p>

<p>The rider's keen eyes were searching the gloom around him. From
time to time a forcible ejaculation, indicative of impatience or
anxiety, escaped his lips, numb with cold, and with unconsidered
vehemence he would dig his spurs into his horse's flanks, with the
result that a fierce and prolonged struggle 'twixt man and beast
would ensue, and, until the quivering animal was brought back to
comparative quietude again, much time was spent in curses and
recriminations.</p>

<p>Anon the rider pulled up sharply at the top of the rising
ground, looked round and about him, muttered a few more emphatic
'<i>Dondersteens</i>' and '<i>verdommts</i>.'</p>

<p>Then he veered his mount right round and started to go back down
hill again&mdash;still at foot-pace&mdash;spied a side-track on his
right, turned to follow it for a while, came to a halt again, and
flung his head back in a futile endeavor to study the stars, about
which he knew nothing.</p>

<p>Then he shook his head dolefully; the time had gone by for
cursing&mdash;praying would have been more useful, had he known how
to set about it&mdash;for in truth he had lost his way upon this
arid waste, and the only prospect before him was that of spending
the night in the saddle, vainly trying by persistent movement to
keep the frost out of his limbs.</p>

<p>For the nonce, he had no idea in which direction lay Amersfoort,
which happened to be his objective. Apparently he had taken the
wrong road when first he came out of Ede, and might now be tending
toward the Rhyn, or have left both Barneveld and even Assel
considerably behind.</p>

<p>The unfortunate wayfarer did not of a surety know which to rail
most bitterly against: his want of accurate knowledge as to the
disposal of the stars upon a moonless firmament, so that he could
not have told you, gaze on them how he might, which way lay the
Zuyder Zee, the Ijssel, or the Rhyn; or that last mug of steaming
ale of which he had partaken ere he finally turned his back on the
hospitable doors of the "Crow's Nest" at Ede.</p>

<p>It was that very mug of the delicious spiced liquor&mdash;and
even in this hour of acute misery, the poor man contrived to smack
his half-frozen lips in retrospective enjoyment&mdash;which had
somehow obscured his vision when first he found himself outside the
city gates, confronted by the <i>verfloekte</i> waste, through
which even a cat could not have picked its way on a night like
this.</p>

<p>And now, here he was, hopelessly stranded, without drink or
shelter, upon the most desolate portion of the Veluwe. In no
direction could the lights of any habitation be seen.</p>

<p>"<i>Dondersteen!</i>" he muttered to himself finally, in
despair. "But I must get somewhere in time, if I keep following my
nose long enough!"</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>In truth, no more lonely spot could be imagined in a civilized
land than that wherein the stranded traveler now found himself.
Even by day the horizon seems limitless, with neither tower nor
city nor homestead in sight. By night the silence is so absolute
that imagination will conjure up strange and impossible sounds,
such as that of the earth whistling through space, or of ceaseless
rolls of drums and trampings of myriads of feet thousands of
leagues away.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, however, once upon a time, in the far long ago
and the early days of windmills, a hermit-miller&mdash;he must have
been a hermit in very truth&mdash;did build one here upon the
highest point of the Veluwe, close to the junction of the road
which runs eastward from Amersfoort and Barneveld, with the one
which tends southward from Assel, and distant from each a quarter
of a league or so. Why that windmill was erected just there, far
from the home of any peasant or farmer who might desire to have his
corn ground, or who that hermit-miller was who dwelt in it before
flocks of wild geese alone made it their trysting-place, it were
impossible to say.</p>

<p>No trace of it remains these days, nor were there any traces of
it left a year after the events which this veracious chronicle will
presently unfold, for reasons which will soon appear obvious to
anyone who reads. But there it stood in this year of grace 1624, on
that cold night in March, when a solitary horseman lost his way
upon the Veluwe, with serious consequences, not only to himself,
but to no less a person than Maurice, Prince of Nassau, Stadtholder
of the United Provinces of the Netherlands, and mayhap to the
entire future history of that sorely tried country.</p>

<p>On a winter's night such as this, the mill looked peculiarly
weird and ghost-like looming out of the darkness against the
background of a star-studded firmament, and rising, sombre and
dense, from out the carpet of glabrous snow, majestic in its
isolation, towering above the immensity of the waste, its domed
roof decked in virgin white like the mother-bosom of the wild.
Built of weather-worn timber throughout, it had a fenced-in
platform supported by heavy rafters all around it, like a girdle,
at a height of twenty feet and more from the ground: and the gaunt,
skeleton wings were stretched out to the skies, scarred, broken,
and motionless, as if in piteous appeal for protection against the
disfiguring ravages of time.</p>

<p>There were two small windows close under the roof on the south
side of the building, and a large, narrow one midway up the same
side. The disposal of these windows, taken in conjunction with the
door down below, was so quaint that, viewed from a certain angle,
they looked for all the world like the eyes, nose, and pursed-up
mouth of a gargantuan, grinning face.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>If a stranger travelling through Gelderland these days had
thought it fit to inquire from a native whether that particular
<i>molen</i> upon the Veluwe was doing work or was inhabited, he
would of a certainty have been told that the only possible
inhabitants of the <i>molen</i> were gnomes and sprites, and that
if any corn was ground there it could only be in order to bake
bread for the devil's dinner.</p>

<p>The mill was disused and uninhabited, had been for many
years&mdash;a quarter of a century or more probably&mdash;so any
and every native of Gelderland and Utrecht would have emphatically
averred. Nevertheless, on this same memorable night in March, 1624,
there were evident signs of life&mdash;human life&mdash;about that
solitary and archaic <i>molen</i> on the Veluwe. Tiny slits of
light showed clearly from certain angles through the chinks of the
wooden structure; there were vague sounds of life and movement in
and about the place; the weather-worn boards creaked and the timber
groaned under more tangible pressure than that of the winds. Nay,
what's more two horses were tethered down below, under the shelter
afforded by the overhanging platform. These horses were saddled;
they had nosebags attached to their bridles, and blankets thrown
across their withers; all of which signs denoted clearly, methinks,
that for once the mill was inhabited by something more material
than ghosts.</p>

<p>More ponderous, too, than ghoulish footsteps were the sounds of
slow pacing up and down the floor of the millhouse, and of two
voices, now raised to loud argument, now sunk to a mere cautious
whisper.</p>

<p>Two men were, in effect, inside the millhouse at this hour. One
of them&mdash;tall, lean, dark in well-worn, almost ragged, black
doublet and cloak, his feet and legs encased in huge boots of
untanned leather which reached midway up his long thighs, his black
bonnet pushed back from his tall, narrow forehead and grizzled
hair&mdash;was sitting upon the steps of the steep, ladder-like
stairs which led to the floor above; the other&mdash;shorter,
substantially, even richly clad, and wearing a plumed hat and
fur-lined cloak, was the one who paced up and down the dust-covered
floor. He was younger than his friend, had fair, curly hair, and a
silken, fair moustache, which hid the somewhat weak lines of his
mouth.</p>

<p>An old, battered lanthorn, hanging to a nail in the wall, threw
a weird, flickering light upon the scene, vaguely illumined the
gaunt figure of the man upon the steps, his large hooked nose and
ill-shaven chin, and long thin hands that looked like the talons of
some bird of prey.</p>

<p>"You cannot stay on here forever, my good Stoutenburg," the
younger of the two men said, with some impatience. "Sooner or later
you will be discovered, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, and the other gave a grim laugh.</p>

<p>"And there is a price of two thousand guilders upon my head, you
mean, my dear Heemskerk?" he said dryly.</p>

<p>"Well, I did mean that," rejoined Heemskerk, with a shrug of the
shoulders. "The people round about here are very poor. They might
hold your father's memory in veneration, but there is not one who
would not sell you to the Stadtholder if he found you out."</p>

<p>Again Stoutenburg laughed. He seemed addicted to the habit of
this mirthless, almost impish laugh.</p>

<p>"I was not under the impression, believe me, my friend," he
said, "that Christian charity or loyalty to my father's memory
would actuate a worthy Dutch peasant into respecting my sanctuary.
But I am not satisfied with what I have learned. I must know more.
I have promised De Berg," he concluded firmly.</p>

<p>"And De Berg counts on you," Heemskerk rejoined. "But," he
added, with a shrug of the shoulders, "you know what he is. One of
those men who, so long as they gain their ambitious ends, count
every life cheap but their own."</p>

<p>"Well," answered Stoutenburg, "'tis not I, in truth, who would
place a high price on mine."</p>

<p>"Easy, easy, my good man," quoth the other, with a smile. "Hath
it, perchance, not occurred to you that your obstinacy in leading
this owl-like life here is putting a severe strain on the devotion
of your friends?"</p>

<p>"I make no appeal to the devotion of my friends," answered
Stoutenburg curtly. "They had best leave me alone."</p>

<p>"We cannot leave you to suffer cold and hunger, mayhap to perish
of want in this God-forsaken eyrie."</p>

<p>"I'm not starving," was Stoutenburg's ungracious answer to the
young man's kindly solicitude; "and have plenty of inner fire to
keep me warm."</p>

<p>He paused, and a dark scowl contracted his gaunt features, gave
him an expression that in the dim and flickering light appeared
almost diabolical.</p>

<p>"I know," said Heemskerk, with a comprehending not. "Still those
thoughts of revenge?"</p>

<p>"Always!" replied the other, with sombre calm.</p>

<p>"Twice you have failed."</p>

<p>"The third time I shall succeed," Stoutenburg affirmed with
fierce emphasis. "Maurice of Nassau sent my father to the
scaffold&mdash;my father, to whom he owed everything: money, power,
success. The day that Olden Barneveldt died at the hands of that
accursed ingrate I, his son, swore that the Stadtholder should
perish by mine. As you say, I have twice failed in my attempt.</p>

<p>"My brother Groeneveld has gone the way of my father. I am an
outlaw with a price upon my head, and my poor mother has three of
us to weep for now, instead of one. But I have not forgotten mine
oath, nor yet my revenge. I'll be even with Maurice of Nassau yet.
All this fighting is but foolery. He is firmly established as
Stadtholder of the United Provinces&mdash;the sort of man who sees
others die for him. He may lose a town here, gain a city there, but
he is the sovereign lord of an independent State, and his sacred
person is better guarded than was that of his worthier father.</p>

<p>"But it is his life that I want," Stoutenburg went on fiercely,
and his thin, claw-like hand clutched in imaginary dagger and
struck out through the air as if against the breast of the hated
foe. "For this I'll scheme and strive. Nay, I'll never rest until I
have him at my mercy as Gérard in his day held William the Silent
at his."</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed Heemskerk hotly. "You would not emulate that
abominable assassin!"</p>

<p>"Why not call me a justiciary?" Stoutenburg retorted dryly. "The
Archduchess would load me with gifts. Spain would proclaim me a
hero. Assassin or executioner&mdash;it only depends on the
political point of view. But doubt me not for a single instant,
Heemskerk. Maurice of Nassau will die by my hand."</p>

<p>"That is why you intend to remain here?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Until I have found out his every future plan."</p>

<p>"But how can you do it? You dare not show yourself abroad."</p>

<p>"That is my business," replied Stoutenburg quietly, "and my
secret."</p>

<p>"I respect your secret," answered Heemskerk, with a shrug of the
shoulders. "It was only my anxiety for your personal safety and for
your comfort that brought me hither to-night."</p>

<p>"And De Berg's desire to learn what I have spied," Stoutenburg
retorted, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"De Berg is ready to cross the Ijssel, and Isembourg to start
from Kleve. De Berg proposes to attack Arnheim. He wishes to know
what forces are inside the city and how they are disposed, and if
the Stadtholder hath an army wherewith to come to their relief or
to offer us battle, with any chance of success."</p>

<p>"You can tell De Berg to send you or another back to me here
when the crescent moon is forty-eight hours older. I shall have all
the information then that he wants."</p>

<p>"That will be good news for him and for Isembourg. There has
been too much time wasted as it is."</p>

<p>"Time has not been wasted. The frosts have in the meanwhile made
the Veluwe a perfect track for men and cannon."</p>

<p>"For Nassau's men and Nassau's cannon, as well as for our own,"
Heemskerk rejoined dryly.</p>

<p>"A week hence, if all's well, Maurice of Nassau will be too sick
to lead his armies across the Veluwe or elsewhere," said
Stoutenburg quietly, and looked up with such a strange, fanatical
glitter in his deep-sunk eyes that the younger man gave an
involuntary gasp of horror.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" he ejaculated under his breath; and
instinctively drawing back some paces away from his friend, stared
at him with wide, uncomprehending eyes.</p>

<p>"I mean," Stoutenburg went on slowly and deliberately, "that De
Berg had best wait patiently a little while longer. Maurice of
Nassau will be a dying man ere long."</p>

<p>His harsh voice, sunk to a strange, impressive whisper, died
away in a long-drawn-out sigh, half of impatience, wholly of
satisfaction. Heemskerk remained for a moment or two absolutely
motionless, still staring at the man before him as if the latter
were some kind of malevolent and fiend-like wraith, conjured up by
devilish magic to scare the souls of men. Nor did Stoutenburg add
anything to his last cold-blooded pronouncement. He seemed to be
deriving a grim satisfaction in watching the play of horror and of
fear upon Heemskerk's usually placid features.</p>

<p>Thus for a space of a few moments the old <i>molen</i> appeared
to sink back to its habitual ghost-haunted silence, whilst the
hovering spirits of Revenge and Hate called up by the sorcery of a
man's evil passions held undisputed sway.</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;" reiterated Heemskerk after awhile, vaguely,
stupidly, babbling like a child.</p>

<p>"I mean," Stoutenburg gave impatient answer, "that you should
know me well enough by now, my good Heemskerk, to realize that I am
no swearer of futile oaths. Last year, when I was over in Madrid, I
cultivated the friendship of one Francis Borgia. You have heard of
him, no doubt; they call him the Prince of Poets over there. He is
a direct descendant of the illustrious Cesare, and I soon
discovered that most of the secrets possessed by his far-famed
ancestor were known to my friend the poet."</p>

<p>"Poisons!" Heemskerk murmured, under his breath.</p>

<p>"Poisons!" the other assented dryly. "And other things."</p>

<p>With finger and thumb of his right hand, he extracted a couple
of tiny packets from a secret pocket of his doublet, toyed with
them for awhile, undid the packets and gazed meditatively on their
contents. Then he called to his friend. "They'll not hurt you," he
said sardonically. "Look at this powder, now. Is it not innocent in
appearance? Yet it is of incalculable value to the man who doth not
happen to possess a straight eye or a steady hand with firearms.
For add but a pinch of it to the charge in your pistol, them aim at
your enemy's head, and if you miss killing him, or if he hold you
at his mercy, you very soon have him at yours. The fumes from the
detonation will cause instant and total blindness."</p>

<p>Despite his horror of the whole thing, Heemskerk had
instinctively drawn nearer to his friend. Now, at these words, he
stepped back again quickly, as if he had trodden upon an adder.
Stoutenburg, with his wonted cynicism, only shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<p>"Have I not said that it would not hurt you?" he said, with a
sneer. "In itself it is harmless enough, and only attains its
useful properties when fired in connection with gunpowder. But when
used as I have explained it to you, it is deadly and unerring. I
saw it at work once or twice in Spain. The Prince of Poets prides
himself on its invention. He gave me some of the precious powder,
and I was glad of it. It may prove useful one day."</p>

<p>He carefully closed the first packet and slipped it back into
the secret receptacle of his doublet; then he fell to contemplating
the contents of the second packet&mdash;half a dozen tiny pillules,
which he kept rolling about in the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>"These," he mused, "are of more proved value for my purpose.
Have not De Berg," he added, with a sardonic grin, as he looked
once more on his friend, "and the Archduchess, too, heard it noised
abroad that Maurice of Nassau hath of late suffered from a
mysterious complaint which already threatens to cut him off in his
prime, and which up to now hath baffled those learned leeches who
were brought over specially from England to look after the health
of the exalted patient? Have not you and your friends, my good
Heemskerk, heard the rumour too?"</p>

<p>The young man nodded in reply. His parched tongue seemed to
cleave to the roof of his mouth; he could not utter a word.
Stoutenburg laughed.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said, with a nod of understanding. "I see that the tale
did reach your ears. You understand, therefore, that I must remain
here for awhile longer."</p>

<p>And with absolute calm and a perfectly steady hand, he folded up
the pillules in the paper screw and put them back in his
pocket.</p>

<p>"I could not leave my work unfinished," he said simply.</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;" Heemskerk contrived to stammer at last; and his
voice to his own ears sounded hoarse and toneless, like a voice out
of the grave.</p>

<p>"How do I contrive to convey these pillules into the
Stadtholder's stomach?" retorted Stoutenburg, with a coarse
chuckle. "Well, my friend, that is still my secret. But De Berg and
the others must trust me a while longer&mdash;trust me and then
thank me when the time comes. The Stadtholder once out of the way,
the resistance of the United Provinces must of itself collapse like
a house of cards. There need be no more bloodshed after
that&mdash;no more sanguinary conflicts. Indeed, I shall be
acclaimed as a public benefactor&mdash;when I succeed."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then you are determined to&mdash;to remain here?"
Heemskerk murmured, feeling all the while that anything he said was
futile and irrelevant.</p>

<p>But how can a man speak when he is confronted with a hideous
spectre that mocks him, even whilst it terrifies?</p>

<p>"I shall remain here for the present," Stoutenburg replied, with
perfect coolness.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I'd best go, then," the other suggested vaguely.</p>

<p>"You had best wait until the daylight. 'Tis easy to lose one's
way on the Veluwe."</p>

<p>The young man waited for a moment, irresolute. Clearly he was
longing to get away, to put behind him this ghoul-infested
<i>molen</i>, with its presiding genii of hatred and of crime. Nay,
men like Heemskerk, cultivated and gently nurtured, understood the
former easily enough. Men and women knew how to hate fiercely these
days, and there were few sensations more thoroughly satisfying than
that of holding an enemy at the sword's point.</p>

<p>But poison! The slow, insidious weapon that worked like a
reptile, stealthily and in the dark! Bah! Heemskerk felt a
dizziness overcome him; sheer physical nausea threatened to rob him
of his faculties.</p>

<p>But there was undoubted danger in venturing out on the arid
wild, in the darkness and with nought but instinct and a few
half-obliterated footmarks to guide one along the track. The young
man went to the door and pulled it open. A gust of ice-laden air
blew into the great, empty place, and almost knocked the old
lanthorn off its peg. Heemskerk stepped out into the night. He felt
literally frightened, and, like a nervous child, had the sensation
of someone or something standing close behind him and on the point
of putting a spectral hand upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>But Stoutenburg had remained sitting on the steps, apparently
quite unmoved. No doubt he was accustomed to look his abominable
project straight in the face. He even shrugged his shoulders in
derision when he caught sight of Heemskerk's white face and
horror-filled eyes.</p>

<p>"You cannot start while this blind man's holiday lasts," he said
lightly. "Can I induce you to partake of some of the refreshment
you were good enough to bring for me?"</p>

<p>But Heemskerk gave him no answer. He was trying to make up his
mind what to do; and Stoutenburg, with another careless laugh, rose
from his seat and strode across the great barn-like space. There,
in a remote corner, where sacks of uncrushed grain were wont to be
stacked, stood a basket containing a few simple provisions; a hunk
of stale bread, a piece of cheese and two or three bottles of wine.
Stoutenburg stooped and picked one of these up. He was whistling a
careless tune. Then suddenly he paused, his long back still bent,
his arm with the hand that held the bottle resting across his knee,
his face, alert and hawk-like, turned in an instant toward the
door.</p>

<p>"What was that?" he queried hurriedly.</p>

<p>Heemskerk, just as swiftly, had already stepped back into the
barn and closed the door again noiselessly.</p>

<p>"Useless!" commented Stoutenburg curtly. "The horses are
outside."</p>

<p>"Where is Jan?" he added after an imperceptible pause, during
which Heemskerk felt as if his very heart-beats had become
audible.</p>

<p>"On the watch, outside," replied the young man.</p>

<p>Even whilst he spoke the door was cautiously opened from the
outside, and a grizzled head wrapped in a fur bonnet was thrust in
through the orifice.</p>

<p>"What is it, Jan?" the two men queried simultaneously.</p>

<p>"A man and horse," Jan replied in a rapid whisper.</p>

<p>"Coming from over Amersfoort way. He must have caught sight of
the <i>molen</i>, for he has left the track and is heading straight
for us."</p>

<p>"Some wretched traveler lost on this God-forsaken waste,"
Stoutenburg said, with a careless shrug of the shoulders. "I have
seen them come this way before."</p>

<p>"But not at this hour of the night?" murmured Heemskerk.</p>

<p>"Mostly at night. It is easier to follow the track by day."</p>

<p>"What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. Let the man come. We'll soon see if he is dangerous.
Are we not three to one?"</p>

<p>The taunt struck home. Heemskerk looked abashed. Jan remained
standing in the doorway, waiting for further orders. Stoutenburg
went on quietly collecting the scanty provisions. He found a couple
of mugs, and with a perfectly steady hand filled the first one and
then the other with the wine.</p>

<p>"Drink this Heemskerk," he said lightly; and held out the two
mugs at arm's length. "It will calm your nerves. You too, Jan."</p>

<p>Jan took the mug and drank with avidity, but Heemskerk appeared
to hesitate.</p>

<p>"Afraid of the poison?" Stoutenburg queried with a sneer. Then,
as the other, half-ashamed, took the mug and drank at a draught, he
added coolly: "You need not be afraid. I could not afford to waste
such precious stuff on you."</p>

<p>Then he turned to Jan.</p>

<p>"Remain outside," he commanded; "well wrapped in your blanket,
and when the traveler hails you pretend to be wakened from pleasant
dreams. Then leave the rest to chance."</p>

<p>Jan at once obeyed. He went out of the <i>molen</i>, closing the
door carefully behind him.</p>

<p>Five minutes later, the hapless traveler had put his horse to a
trot. He had perceived the <i>molen</i> looming at the top of the
rising ground, dense and dark against the sky, and looking upon it
as a veritable God-sent haven of refuge for wearied tramps, was
making good haste to reach it, fearing lest he himself dropped from
sheer exhaustion out of his saddle ere he came to his happy
goal.</p>

<p>That terrible contingency, however, did not occur, and presently
he was able to draw rein and to drop gently if somewhat painfully
to the ground without further mishap. Then he looked about him. The
mill in truth appeared to be uninhabited, which was a vast pity,
seeing that a glass of spiced ale would&mdash;but no matter, 'twas
best not to dwell on such blissful thoughts! A roof over one's head
for the night was the most urgent need.</p>

<p>He led his horse by the bridle, and tethered him to a heavy,
supporting rafter under the overhanging platform; was on the point
of ministering to the poor, half-frozen beast, when his ear caught
a sound which caused him instantly to pause first and then start on
a tour around the <i>molen</i>. He had not far to go. The very next
moment he came upon a couple of horses tethered like his own, and
upon Jan, who was snoring lustily, curled up in a horse-blanket in
the angle of the porch.</p>

<p>To hail the sleeper with lusty shouts at first, and then with a
vigorous kick, was but the work of a few seconds; after which Jan's
snores were merged in a series of comprehensive curses against the
disturber of his happy dreams.</p>

<p>"<i>Dondersteen!</i>" he murmured, still apparently half asleep.
"And who is this <i>verfloekte plepshurk</i> who ventures a weary
traveler from his sleep?"</p>

<p>"Another weary traveler, <i>verfloekte plepshurk</i> yourself,"
the other cried aloud. Nor were it possible to render with any
degree of accuracy the language which he subsequently used when Jan
persistently refused to move.</p>

<p>"Then, <i>dondersteen</i>," retorted Jan thickly, "do as I
do&mdash;wrap yourself up in a blanket and go to sleep."</p>

<p>"Not until I have discovered how it comes that one wearied
traveler happens to be abroad with two equally wearied and saddled
horses. And I am not mistaken, <i>plepshurk</i>, thou are but a
varlet left on guard outside, whilst thy master feasts and sleeps
within."</p>

<p>Whereupon, without further parley, he strode across Jan's
outstretched body and, with a vigorous kick of his heavy boot,
thrust open the door which gave on the interior of the mill.</p>

<p>Here he paused, just beneath the lintel, took off his hat, and
stood at respectful attention; for he had realized at once that he
was in the presence of his betters&mdash;of two gentlemen, in fact,
one of whom had a mug of wine in his hand and the other a bottle.
These were the two points which, as it were, jumped most directly
to the eye of the weary, frozen, and thirsty traveler: two
gentlemen who haply were now satiated, and would spare a drop even
to a humble varlet if he stood before them in his full, pitiable
plight.</p>

<p>"Who are you man? And what do you want?" one of these gentlemen
queried peremptorily. It was the one who had a bottle of
wine&mdash;a whole bottle&mdash;in his hand; but he looked
peculiarly stern and forbidding, with his close-cropped, grizzled
head and hard, bird-like features.</p>

<p>"Only a poor tramp, my lord," replied the unfortunate wayfarer,
in high-pitched, flute-like tones, "who hath lost his way, and has
been wandering on this <i>verdommte</i> plain since midnight."</p>

<p>"What do you want?" reiterated Stoutenburg sternly.</p>

<p>"Only shelter for the rest of the night, my lord,
and&mdash;and&mdash;a little drink&mdash;a very little
drink&mdash;for I am mightily weary, and my throat is dry as
tinder."</p>

<p>"What is your name?"</p>

<p>At this very simple question the man's round, florid face with
the tiny, upturned nose, slightly tinged with pink, and the small,
round eyes, bright and shiny like new crowns, took on an expression
of comical puzzlement. He scratched his head, pursed up his lips,
emitted a prolonged and dubious whistle.</p>

<p>"I haven't a name, so please your lordship," he said, after a
while. "That is, not a name such as other people have. I have a
name, in truth, a name by which I am known to my friends; a
name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thy name, <i>plepshurk</i>," command Stoutenburg roughly, "ere
I throw thee out again into the night."</p>

<p>"'So please your lordship." replied the man, "I am called
Pythagoras&mdash;a name which I believe belongs by right to a
philosopher of ancient times, but to which I will always answer, so
please your High and Mightiness."</p>

<p>But this time his High and Mightiness did not break in upon the
worthy philosopher's volubility. Indeed, at the sound of that
highly ludicrous name&mdash;ludicrous, that is, when applied to its
present bearer&mdash;he had deliberately put mug and bottle down,
and then become strangely self-absorbed, even whilst his friend had
given an involuntary start.</p>

<p>"H'm! Pythagoras!" his lordship resumed, after a while. "Have I
ever seen thine ugly face before?"</p>

<p>"Not to my knowledge, my lord," replied the other, marvelling
when it would please these noble gentlemen to give him something
wherewith to moisten his gullet.</p>

<p>"Ah! Methought I had once met another who bore an equally
strange name. Was it Demosthenes, or Euripides, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Diogenes, no doubt, my lord," replied the thirsty philosopher
glibly. "The most gallant gentleman in the whole wide world, one
who honours me with his friendship, was pleased at one time to
answer to that name."</p>

<p>Now, when Pythagoras made his announcement he felt quite sure
that lavish hospitality would promptly follow. These gentlemen had
no doubt heard of Diogenes, his comrade in arms, the faithful and
gallant friend for whom he&mdash;Pythagoras&mdash;would go through
fire and water and the driest of deserts. They would immediately
accord a welcome to one who had declared himself honoured by the
friendship of so noble a cavalier. Great was the unfortunate man's
disappointment, therefore, when his glib speech was received in
absolute silence; and he himself was still left standing upon the
lintel of the door, with an icy cold draught playing upon him from
behind.</p>

<p>It was only after a considerable time that my lord deigned to
resume his questionings again.</p>

<p>"Where dost come from, fellow?" he asked.</p>

<p>"From Ede, so please your lordship," Pythagoras replied
dolefully, "where I partook&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And whither art going?" Stoutenburg broke in curtly.</p>

<p>"I was going to Amersfoort, my lord, when I lost my way."</p>

<p>"To Amersfoort?"</p>

<p>"'Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"Mynheer Beresteyn hath a house at Amersfoort," Stoutenburg
said, as if to himself.</p>

<p>"It was to Mynheer Beresteyn's house that I was bound, my lord,
when I unfortunately lost my way."</p>

<p>"Ah!" commented my lord dryly. "Thou was on thy way to the house
of Mynheer Beresteyn in Amersfoort?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

<p>"With a message?"</p>

<p>"No, my lord. Not with a message; I was just going there for the
wedding."</p>

<p>"The wedding?" ejaculated Stoutenburg, and it seemed to
Pythagoras as if my lord's haggard face took on suddenly an almost
cadaverous hue. "Whose wedding fellow?" he added more calmly.</p>

<p>"That of my friend Diogenes, so please your lordship, with the
<i>jongejuffrouw</i> Beresteyn, he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take care, man, take care!" came with an involuntary call of
alarm from Heemskerk; for Stoutenburg, uttering a hoarse cry like
that of a wounded beast, had raised his arm and now strode on the
unfortunate philosopher with clenched fist and a look in his hollow
eyes which boded no good to the harbinger of those simple
tidings.</p>

<p>At sound of his friend's voice, Stoutenburg dropped his arm. He
turned on his heel, ashamed no doubt that this stranger-varlet
should see his face distorted as it was with passion.</p>

<p>This paroxysm of uncontrolled fury did not, however, last longer
than a moment or two; the next instant the lord of Stoutenburg,
outwardly calm and cynical as before had resumed his haughty
questionings, looked the awe-struck philosopher up and down; and
he, somewhat scared by the danger which he only appeared to have
escaped through the timely intervention of the other gentleman, was
marvelling indeed if he had better not take to his heels at once
and run, and trust his safety and his life to the inhospitable
wild, rather than in the company of this irascible noble lord.</p>

<p>I think, if fact, that he would have fled the very next moment,
but that my lord with one word kept him rooted to the spot.</p>

<p>"So," resumed Stoutenburg coolly after awhile, "thou, fellow,
art a bidden guest at the marriage feast, which it seems is to be
solemnized 'twixt the <i>jongejuffrouw</i> Beresteyn and another
<i>plepshurk</i> as low as thyself. Truly doth democracy tread hard
on the heels of such tyranny as the United Provinces have witnessed
of late. Dost owe allegiance, sirrah, to the Stadtholder?"</p>

<p>"Where Diogenes leads, my lord," replied Pythagoras, with a
degree of earnestness which sat whimsically upon his rotund person,
"there do Socrates and I follow unquestioningly."</p>

<p>"Which means that ye are three rascals, ready to sell your skins
to the highest bidder. Were ye not in the pay of the lord of
Stoutenburg during the last conspiracy against the Stadtholder's
life?"</p>

<p>"We may have been, your honour," the man replied naively;
"although, to my knowledge, I have never set eyes on the lord of
Stoutenburg."</p>

<p>"'Twere lucky for thee knave, if thou didst," rejoined
Stoutenburg with a harsh laugh, "for there's a price of two
thousand guilders upon his head, and I doubt not but thy scurrilous
friend Diogenes would add another two thousand to that
guerdon."</p>

<p>Then, as Pythagoras, almost dropping with fatigue, was swaying
upon his short, fat legs, he jerked his thumb in the direction
where the tantalizing bottles and mugs were faintly discernible in
the gloom. My lord continued curtly:</p>

<p>"There! Drink thy fill! Amersfoort is not far. My man will put
thee on thy way when thou hast quenched thy thirst!"</p>

<p>Quench his thirst! Where was that cellar which could have worked
this magic trick? In the corner to which my lord was pointing so
casually there was but one bottle, which my lord had put down a
while ago, and that, after all, was only half full.</p>

<p>Still, half a bottle of wine was better than no wine at all, and
my lord, having granted his gracious leave, took no more notice of
the philosopher and his unquenchable thirst, turned to his friend,
and together the two gentlemen retired to a distant corner of the
place and there whispered eagerly with one another.</p>

<p>Pythagoras tiptoed up to the spot where unexpected bliss awaited
him. There was another bottle of wine there beside the half-empty
one&mdash;a bottle that was full up to the neck, and the shape of
which proclaimed that it came from Spain. Good, strong, heady
Spanish wine!</p>

<p>And my lord had said "Drink thy fill!" Pythagoras did not
hesitate, save for one brief second, while he marvelled whether he
had accidentally wandered into Elysian fields, or whether he was
only dreaming. Then he poured out for himself a mugful of wine.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, the last drop of the second bottle of
strong, heady Spanish wine had trickled down the worthy Pythagoras'
throat. He was in a state of perfect bliss, babbling words of
supreme contentment, and seeing pleasing visions of gorgeous feasts
in the murky angles of the old millhouse.</p>

<p>"'Tis time the <i>plepshurk</i> got to horse," Stoutenburg said
at last.</p>

<p>He strode across to where Pythagoras, leaning against the
raftered wall, his round head on one side, his sugar-loaf hat set
at the back of his head, was gazing dreamily into his empty
mug.</p>

<p>"To horse, fellow!" he commanded curtly. "'Tis but a league to
Amersfoort, and thy friend will be waiting thee."</p>

<p>The old instinct of deference and good behaviour before a noble
lord lent some semblance of steadiness to Pythagoras' legs. He
struggled to his feet, vainly endeavored to keep an upright and
dignified position&mdash;an attempt which, however, proved utterly
futile.</p>

<p>Whereupon my lord called peremptorily to Jan, who appeared so
suddenly in the doorway that, to Pythagoras' blurred vision, it
seemed as if he had been put there by some kind of witchery. He
approached his master, and there ensued a brief, whispered colloquy
between those two&mdash;a colloquy in which Heemskerk took no part.
After which, the lord of Stoutenburg said aloud:</p>

<p>"Set this worthy fellow on his horse, my good Jan, and put him
on the track which leads to Amersfoort. He has had a rest and a
good warm drink. He is not like to lose his way again."</p>

<p>Vaguely Pythagoras felt that he wished to protest. He did not
want to be set on his horse, nor yet to go to Amersfoort just yet.
The wedding was not until the morrow&mdash;no, the day after the
morrow&mdash;and for the nonce he wanted to sleep. Yes, sleep!
Curled up in a blanket in any corner big enough and warm enough to
shelter a dog.</p>

<p>Sleep! That was what he wanted; for he was so confoundedly
sleepy, and this <i>verfloekte</i> darkness interfered with his
eyes so that he could not see very clearly in front of him. All
this he explained with grave deliberation to Jan, who had him
tightly by the elbow and was leading him with absolutely
irresistible firmness out through the door into the white,
inhospitable open.</p>

<p>"I don't want to get to horse," the philosopher babbled thickly.
"I want to curl up in a blanket and I want to go to sleep."</p>

<p>But, despite his protestations, he found himself presently in
the saddle. How he got up there, he certainly could not have told
you. Instinct, however, kept him there. Never could it be said that
Pythagoras had tumbled off a horse. Anon he felt that the horse was
moving, and that the air around him was bitterly cold.</p>

<p>The dull, even carpet of snow dazzled him, though it was pitch
dark now both overhead and down below; of darkness that enveloped
one like a mantle, and which felt as if it could have been cut
through with a knife.</p>

<p>The horse went on at a steady trot, and another was trotting by
its side, bearing a cavalier who wore a fur bonnet. Pythagoras
vaguely imagined that this must be Jan. He owed Jan a grudge for
taking him away from that hospitable <i>molen</i>, where
half-bottles of wine were magically transformed into large ones,
filled to overflowing with delicious liquor.</p>

<p>Presently Pythagoras began to feel cold again after the blissful
warmth produced by that super-excellent Spanish wine.</p>

<p>"Is it far to Amersfoort?" he queried drowsily from time to
time.</p>

<p>But he never seemed to get a reply. It appeared to him as if he
had been hours in the saddle since last he felt comfortable and
warm over in that hospitable <i>molen</i>. And he was very sleepy.
His head felt heavy and his eyes would not keep open as hours and
hours went by and the cold grew more and more intense.</p>

<p>"Is it far to Amersfoort?" he questioned whenever his head
rolled forward with a jerk that roused him to momentary
consciousness.</p>

<p>"Less than half a league now," Jan replied presently, and
brought his own horse to a halt. "Follow the track before you and
it will lead you straight to the city gates."</p>

<p>Pythagoras opened his eyes very wide. Straightway in front of
him he perceived one or two tiny lights, which were too low down on
the horizon for stars. The road, too, on which he found himself
appeared straighter and more defined than those upon that
<i>verfloekte</i> waste.</p>

<p>"Are those the lights of Amersfoort?" he murmured vaguely, and
pointed in as straight a direction as his numbed arm would
allow.</p>

<p>He expected an answer from Jan but there came none. The darkness
appeared to have swallowed up horse and rider. Anyway, they had
disappeared. Good old Jan! Pythagoras would have liked to thank him
for his company, even though he did owe him a grudge for taking him
away from the <i>molen</i> where there had been such
wonderful&mdash;</p>

<p>The horse followed the track for a minute or two longer
Pythagoras, left to his own devices, tried to keep awake. Suddenly
the sharp report of a pistol rent the silence of the night. It was
immediately followed by another.</p>

<p>Pythagoras felt a strange, sinking sensation in his stomach, a
dizzy feeling in his head, a feeling which was no longer blissful
like the one he had experienced after the third mugful of Spanish
wine. A moment later, he fell forward on his horse's neck, then
rolled out of the saddle down upon the bed of snow.</p>

<p>And at this spot, where the poor philosopher lay, the white pall
which covered the Veluwe was dyed with a dark crimson stain.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>A grey, dull light suffused the sky in the East when Jan once
more knocked at the door of the old <i>molen</i>.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg's voice bade him enter.</p>

<p>"All well?" my lord queried, at sight of his faithful
servant.</p>

<p>"All quiet, my lord," replied Jan. "That windbag, I'll warrant,
will tell no tales."</p>

<p>"How far did you take him?"</p>

<p>"Nearly as far as Lang Soeren. I had to keep a track for fear of
losing my way. But he lies eight leagues from Amersfoort now and
six from Ede. His friends, I imagine, won't look for him thus
far."</p>

<p>"And his horse?"</p>

<p>"It did not follow me. No doubt it will get picked up by some
one in the morning."</p>

<p>Heemskerk shivered. It was certainly very cold inside this
great, barn-like place at this hour just before sunrise; and the
passing wayfarer had consumed the last measure of wine. The young
man looked grimy, too, and untidy, covered with dust from the
floor, where he had lain stretched out for the past three hours,
trying to get a wink of sleep; whilst Stoutenburg, restless and
alert, had kept his ears open and his nerves on the stretch for the
first sound of Jan's return.</p>

<p>"You have been a long time getting to Lang Soeren and back," the
latter remarked further to Jan.</p>

<p>"I was guiding a drunken man on a wearied horse," the man
replied curtly. "And I myself had been in the saddle all day."</p>

<p>"Then get another hour's rest now," Stoutenburg rejoined. "You
will accompany my lord of Heemskerk back to Doesburg as soon as the
sun is up."</p>

<p>Jan made no reply. He was accustomed to curt commands and to
unquestioning obedience. Tired, saddle-sore and wearied, he would
be ready to ride again, go anywhere until he dropped. So he turned
on his heel and went out into the cold once more, in order to
snatch that brief hour's rest which had been graciously accorded
him.</p>

<p>Heemskerk gave an impatient sigh.</p>

<p>"I would the dawn were quicker in coming!" he murmured under his
breath.</p>

<p>"The atmosphere of the Veluwe is getting oppressive for your
fastidious taste," Stoutenburg retorted with a sneer. Then, as his
friend made no other comment, he continued lightly: "Dead men tell
no tales. I could not risk that blabbering fool going back to
Amersfoort and speaking of what he saw. Even your unwonted
squeamishness, my good Heemskerk, would grant me that."</p>

<p>"Or, rather," rejoined the other, almost involuntarily, "did not
the unfortunate man suffer for being the messenger of evil
tidings?"</p>

<p>Stoutenburg shrugged his shoulders with an assumption of
indifference.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," he said. "Though I doubt if the news was wholly
unexpected. Yet I would have deemed Gilda Beresteyn too proud to
wed that <i>plepshurk</i>."</p>

<p>"A man with a future," Heemskerk rejoined. "He is credited with
having saved the Stadtholder's life, when the lord of Stoutenburg
planned to blow up the bridge under his passage."</p>

<p>"And Beresteyn is grateful to him too," added Stoutenburg with a
sarcastic curl of his thin lips, "for having rescued the fair Gilda
from the lord of Stoutenburg's fierce clutches. But Nicolaes might
have told me that his sister was getting married."</p>

<p>"Nicolaes?" ejaculated Heemskerk, with obvious surprise. "You
have seen Nicolaes Beresteyn, then of late?"</p>

<p>For the space of a few seconds&mdash;less
perhaps&mdash;Stoutenburg appeared confused, and the look which he
cast on his friend was both furtive and searching. The next moment,
however, he had recovered his usual cool placidity.</p>

<p>"You mistook, me, my friend," he said blandly. "I did not say
that I had seen Nicolaes Beresteyn of late. I have not seen him, in
fact, since the day of our unfortunate aborted conspiracy. Rumor
reached me that he himself was about to wed the worthy daughter of
some prosperous burgher. I merely wondered how the same rumor made
no mention of the other prospective bride."</p>

<p>Once again the conversation flagged. Heemskerk regarded his
friend with an anxious expression in his pale wearied face. He knew
how passionately, if somewhat intermittently, Stoutenburg had loved
Gilda Beresteyn. He knew of the original girl and boy affection
between them, and of the man's base betrayal of the girl's trust.
Stoutenburg had thrown over the humbler burgher's daughter in order
to wed Walburg de Marnix, whom he promptly neglected, and who had
since set him legally free. Heemskerk knew, too, how Stoutenburg's
passion for the beautiful Gilda Beresteyn had since then burst into
a consuming flame, and how the obscure soldier of fortune who went
by the nick-name of Diogenes had indeed snatched the fair prize
from his grasp.</p>

<p>Nigh on three months had gone by since then. Stoutenburg was
still nurturing thoughts of vengeance and of crime, not only
against the Stadtholder, but also against the girl who had scorned
him. Well, this in truth was none of his friend's business. Hideous
as was the premeditated coup against Maurice of Nassau, it would
undoubtedly, if successful, help the cause of Spain in the
Netherlands, and Heemskerk himself was that unnatural
monster&mdash;a man who would rather see his country ruled by a
stranger than by those of her sons whose political or religious
views differed from his own.</p>

<p>Thus, when an hour later he took leave of Stoutenburg, he did so
almost with cordiality, did not hesitate to grasp the hand of a man
whom he knew to be a scheming and relentless murderer.</p>

<p>"One of us will come out to wait on you in two days' time," he
said at the last. "I go back to camp satisfied that you are not so
lonely as you seem, and that there is some one who sees to it that
you do not fare so ill even in this desolation. May I say this to
De Berg?"</p>

<p>"If you like," Stoutenburg replied. "Anyway, you may assure him,
and through him the Archduchess, that Maurice of Nassau will be in
his grave before I, his judge and executioner, perish of hunger or
of cold."</p>

<p>He accompanied his friend to the door, and stood there while the
latter and Jan were getting to horse. Then, as they went out into
the open, he waved them a last adieu. On the far distant east, the
pale, wintry sun had tinged the mist with a delicate lemon gold.
The vast immensity of the waste lay stretched out as if limitless
before him. As far as the eye could see not a tower or column of
smoke broke the even monotony of the undulating ground. The shadow
of the great <i>molen</i> with its gaunt, mained wings lay, like
patches of vivid blue upon the vast and glistening pall of
snow.</p>

<p>The two riders put their horses to a trot. Soon they appeared
like mere black specks upon a background of golden haze, whilst in
their wake, upon the scarce visible track, the traces of their
horses' hoofs, in stains of darker blue upon the virgin white, were
infinitely multiplied.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg watched them until the mist-laden distance had
completely hidden them from his view. Then, with a sigh of relief,
he went within.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II&mdash;THE DOUBLE
WEDDING</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>It was one of those days when earth and heaven alike appear to
smile. A day almost warm, certainly genial; for the wind had
dropped, the sky was of a vivid blue, and the sun had a genuine
feeling of warmth in its kiss. From the overhanging eaves the snow
dropped down in soft, moist lumps, stained by the thaw, and the
quay, where a goodly crowd had collected, was quickly transformed
under foot into a sea of mud.</p>

<p>It almost seemed as if the little town was out on a holiday.
People came and went, dressed in gay attire, stood about all along
the bank of the river, staring up at the stately gabled house which
looked so wonderfully gay with its decorations of flags and
valuable tapestries and stuffs hanging from the numerous
windows.</p>

<p>That house on the quay&mdash;and it was the finest house in the
town&mdash;was indeed the centre of attraction. It was from there
that the air of holiday-making emanated, and certainly from there
that the gay sounds of music and revelry came wafted on the crisp,
wintry air.</p>

<p>Mynheer Beresteyn had come to his house in Amersfoort, of which
city he was chief civic magistrate, in order to celebrate the
double wedding. No wonder such an event was made an excuse for a
holiday. Burgomaster Beresteyn never did things by halves, and his
hospitality was certain to be lavish. Already doles and largesse
had been poured out at the porch of St. Maria Kerk; a crowd of
beggars more or less indigent, crippled, sick, or merely greedy,
had assembled there very early in the morning. Whoever was there
was sure to get something. And there was plenty to see besides: the
brides and bridegrooms and the wedding party; and of course His
Highness the Stadtholder was a sight in himself. He did not often
go abroad these days, for his health was no longer as good as it
was. He had aged considerably, looked moody and ailing for the most
part. There had been sinister rumours, too. The widowed Archduchess
Isabella, Mistress of Flanders and Brabant, hated him because he
held the United Provinces of the Netherlands free from the bondage
of Spain. And in Spain the arts of poison and of secret
assassination were carried on with as much perfection as they had
ever been in Italy in the days of the Borgias.</p>

<p>However, all such dark thoughts must be put away for the day.
This is a festive occasion for Amersfoort, when every anxiety for
the fate of the poor fatherland&mdash;ever threatened and ever
sore-pressed&mdash;must be laid to rest. Let the brides and
bridegrooms see naught but merry faces&mdash;happy auguries of the
auspicious days to come.</p>

<p>Here they come&mdash;the entire wedding party&mdash;walking down
the narrow streets from the quay to the St. Maria Kerk. Every one
is walking, even the Stadtholder. He is conspicuous by his great
height, and the richness of his attire: embroidered doublet,
slashed sleeves, priceless lace. His face looks thin and drawn, but
he has lost nothing of his martial bearing, nor have his eyes lost
their eagle glance. He had come over the previous afternoon from
Utrecht, where he was in camp, and had deigned to grace Mynheer
Beresteyn's house by sleeping under its roof. It was understood
that he would return to Utrecht after the banquet which was to
follow the religious ceremony, and he, too, for this one day was
obviously making a valiant attempt to cast off the load of anxiety
attendant upon ceaseless campaigning. In truth, the Archduchess
Isabella, not content with the fairest provinces of Belgium, with
Flanders, Brabant, and the Hainault, which her father, King Philip
of Spain, had ceded to her absolutely, was even now striving to
force some of the United Provinces back under the domination of
Spain.</p>

<p>Small wonder then that the Stadtholder, wearied and sick, the
shadow of his former self, was no longer sure of a whole-hearted
welcome when he showed himself abroad. Nor had the people forgiven
him the judicial murder of Olden Barneveldt&mdash;the trusted
councillor in the past, afterwards the bitter opponent of his
master's ambitions&mdash;of his severity towards Barneveldt's sons.
His relentless severity toward those who offended him, his reckless
ambition and stern disciplinarianism, had made him an object of
terror rather than of affection. Nevertheless, he still stood for
the upholder of the liberties of the United Provinces, the finest
captain of his age, who by his endurance, his military skill, and
his unswerving patriotism, kept his country's frontiers free from
the incursions of the most powerful armies of the time. He still
stood as the man who had swept the sacred soil of the Netherlands
free from Spanish foes and Spanish tyranny, who had amplified and
consolidated the work of his father and firmly established the
independence of the Republic. Because of what he had done in the
past, men like Mynheer Beresteyn and those of his kind still looked
upon him with grave respect, as the chosen of God, the prophet sent
to them from Heaven to keep the horrors of a new Spanish invasion
away from their land.</p>

<p>And when Maurice of Nassau came to a small city like Amersfoort,
as he had done today, he was received with veneration, if not with
the old cheers and acclamations. His arbitrary temper was
momentarily forgotten, his restless ambition condoned, in the joy
of beholding the man who had fought for them, never spared himself
until he had won for them all those civil and religious liberties
which they prized above all the treasures of the earth.</p>

<p>All heads, then, were bowed in respectful silence as he walked
by, with the brides one on each side of him. But the loving glances
of the crowd, the jokes and whispered words of cheer and greeting,
were reserved for Mynheer Beresteyn and for his family.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Two brides, and both comely! <i>Jongejuffrouw</i> Katharina van
den Poele, the only child of the wealthy shipowner, member of the
Dutch East India Company, a solid burgher both physically and
financially, and one of the props of his country's overseas
commerce. His daughter, in rich brocade, with stiff stomacher that
vainly strove to compress her ample proportions, splashed through
the mud on her high pattens beside the Stadtholder, her heavily
be-ringed hands clinging to the folds of her gown, so as to save
them from being soiled. Stolid and complacent, she heard with a
satisfied smile the many compliments that rose from out the crowd
on her dazzling complexion, her smoothly brushed hair and
magnificent jewelry. The fair Katharina beamed with good-nature and
looked the picture of happiness, despite the fact that her
bridegroom, who walked immediately behind her, appeared somewhat
moody, considering the occasion.</p>

<p>Nicolaes Beresteyn, the Burgomaster's only son, had in truth, no
reason for surliness. His bride excited universal admiration, his
own private fortune would be more than doubled by the dowry which
the good Kaatje brought him along with her plump person, and all
the disagreements between himself and his father, all the treachery
and the deceit of the past three months, had been amply forgiven.
It was all the more strange, therefore, that on this day his face
alone should appear as a reflection of the Stadtholder's silent
mood, and more than one comment was made thereon as he passed.</p>

<p>Of the other bride and bridegroom it is perhaps more difficult
to speak. We all know the beautiful picture of Gilda Beresteyn
which Frans Hals made of her some three months previously. That
incomparable master of portraiture has rendered that indescribable
air of force, coupled with extreme youthfulness, which was her
greatest charm. Often she hath been called etherial, yet I do not
see how that description could apply to one who was so essentially
alive as Gilda Beresteyn. Her blue eyes always sparkled with
vitality, and whenever she was moved&mdash;which was often
enough&mdash;they became as dark as sloes. Probably the word came
to be applied to her because there was always a little something
mysterious about her&mdash;an enigmatic little smile, which
suggested merriment that came from within rather than in response
to an outside joke. Many have remarked that her smile was the
gentle reflex of her lover's sparkling gaiety.</p>

<p>Him&mdash;that ardent lover, sobered bridegroom now&mdash;you
cannot forget, not whilst Frans Hals' immortal work, whom he hath
called "The Laughing Cavalier," depicts him in all is irrepressible
joyousness, and gladdens the eye with its exhilaration and its
magnificent <i>gaité de coeur</i>&mdash;a veritable nepenthe for
jaded seek-sorrows.</p>

<p>For once in his life, as he walks gravely behind his bride,
there is a look of seriousness not unmixed with impatience in his
laughing eyes. A frown, too, between his brows. The crowd have at
once taken him to its heart&mdash;especially the women. Those who
have no sons wish for one at once, who would grow up just like him:
tall and stately as a young sapling, with an air of breeding seldom
seen in the sons of the Low Countries, and wearing his magnificent
bridal attire as if he had never worn leather jerkin or worsted
doublet in his life. The women admire the richly wrought doublet,
the priceless lace at neck and wrists, the plumed hat that frames a
face alike youthful and determined. But everyone marvels why a
bridegroom should go to church in high riding-boots and spurred at
this hour. Many whispered comments are exchanged as he goes by.</p>

<p>"A stranger, so they say."</p>

<p>"Though he has fought in the Netherlands."</p>

<p>"Ah, but he really comes from England."</p>

<p>"A romantic story. Never knew his father until recently."</p>

<p>Some said the bridegroom's name was really Blakeney, and that
his father was a very rich and very great gentleman over in
England. But there were others who remembered him well when he was
just a penniless soldier of fortune who went by the name of
Diogenes. No one knew him then by any other, and no one but Frans
Hals, the painter over in Haarlem, knew whence he had come and what
was his parentage. In those days his merry laughter would rouse the
echoes of the old city where he and his two boon
companions&mdash;such a quaint pair of loons!&mdash;were wont to
dwell in the intervals of selling their swords to the highest
bidders.</p>

<p>Ay, <i>Jongejuffrouw</i> Beresteyn's stranger bridegroom had
fought in France and in Flanders, in Groningen and Brabant and
'twas said that recently he had saved the life of the Stadtholder
at great risk of his own. Many more tales were whispered about him,
which would take too long to relate, while the crowd stood agape
all down the quay and up the Korte Gracht as far as the St. Maria
Kerk.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>Indeed, Mynheer Beresteyn had not done things by halves. He had
chosen that the happy double event should take place at the old
house at Amersfoort, where his children had been born, and where he
had spent the few happy years of his married life, rather than at
Haarlem, which was his business and official residence. He wished,
for the occasion, to be just a happy father rather than the
distinguished functionary, the head of the Guild of Armourers, one
of the most important burghers of the Province, and second only in
the council chamber to the Stadtholder.</p>

<p>The religious ceremony was over by noon. It was now
mid-afternoon, and the wedding guests had assembled in the stately
home on the quay for a gargantuan feast. The Stadtholder sat at a
magnificently decked-out table at the far end of the panelled room,
on a raised daïs surmounted by a canopy of Flemish tapestry, all
specially erected for the occasion. Around this privileged board
sat the wedding party; Mynheer Beresteyn, grave and sedate, a man
who had seen much of life, had suffered a great deal, and even now
scarcely dared to give his sense of joy full play. He gazed from
time to time on his daughter with something of anxiety as well as
of pride. Then the worthy shipowner, member of the Dutch East India
Company, and <i>mejuroffluw</i>, his wife&mdash;the father and
mother of Nicolaes Beresteyn's bride, pompous and fleshy, and with
an air of prosperous complacence about their persons which
contrasted strangely with Mynheer Beresteyn's anxious earnestness.
Finally, the two bridal couples, of whom more anon.</p>

<p>In the body of the nobly proportioned banqueting-hall, a vast
concourse of guests had assembled around two huge tables, which
were decked out with costly linen and plate, and literally groaned
under the succulent dishes which serving-men repeatedly placed
there for the delectation of the merry party. Roast capons and
geese, fish from the Rhyn and from the sea, pasties made up of
oysters and quails, and, above all, a constant supply of delicious
Rhine or Spanish wines, according as the guests desired light or
heady liquor.</p>

<p>A perpetual buzz of talk, intermingled with many an outburst of
hilarity and an occasional song, filled the somewhat stuffy air of
the room to the exclusion of any individual sound.</p>

<p>The ladies plied their fans vigorously, and some of the men,
warmed by good cheer, had thrown their padded doublets open and
loosened their leather belts. The brides-elect sat one on each side
of the Stadtholder; a strange contrast, in truth. Kaatje van den
Poele, just a young edition of her mother, her well-rounded figure
already showing signs of the inevitable coming stoutness, comely to
look at, with succulent cheeks shining like rosy apples, her face
with the wide-open, prominent eyes, beaming with good-nature and
the vigorous application of cold water. Well-mannered, too, for she
never spoke unless spoken to, but sat munching her food with naive
delight, and whenever her somewhat moody bridegroom hazarded a
laboured compliment or joke, she broke into a pleasant giggle,
jerked her elbow at him, and muttered a "Fie, Klaas!" which put and
end to further conversation.</p>

<p>Gilda Beresteyn, who sat at the Stadtholder's right hand, was
silent, too; demure, not a little prim, but with her, even the most
casual observer became conscious that beneath the formal demeanor
there ran an undercurrent of emotional and pulsating life. The
terrible experience which she had gone through a few brief months
ago had given to her deep blue eyes a glance that was vividly
passionate, yet withal resposeful, and with a curiously childlike
expression of trust within its depth.</p>

<p>The stiff bridal robes which convention decreed that she should
wear gave her an air of dignity, even whilst it enhanced the
youthfulness of her personality. There was all the roundness in her
figure which is the attribute of her race; yet, despite her plump
shoulders and full throat, her little round face and firm bosom,
there remained something ethereal about her, a spirituality and a
strength which inspired reverence, even whilst her beauty provoked
admiring glances.</p>

<p>"Your Highness is not eating," she remarked timidly.</p>

<p>"My head aches," Maurice of Nassau replied moodily. "I cannot
eat. I think I must be over-tired," he went on more pleasantly as
he met the girl's kind blue eyes fixed searchingly upon him. "A
little fresh air will do me good. Don't disturb any one," he
continued hastily, as he rose to his feet and turned to go to the
nearest open window.</p>

<p>Beresteyn quickly followed him. The prince looked faint and ill,
and had to lean on his host's arm as he tottered towards the
window. The little incident was noticed by a few. It caused
consternation and the exchange of portentful glances.</p>

<p>A grave-looking man in sober black velvet doublet and sable hose
quickly rose from the table and joined the Stadtholder and Mynheer
Beresteyn at the window. He was the English physician especially
brought across to watch over the health of the illustrious
sufferer.</p>

<p>Gilda turned to her neighbour. Her eyes had suddenly filled with
tears, but when she met his glance the ghost of a smile immediately
crept around her mouth.</p>

<p>"It seems almost wicked," she said simply "to be so happy
now."</p>

<p>Unseen by the rest of the company, the man next to her took her
tiny hand and raised it to his lips.</p>

<p>"At times, even to-day," she went on softly, "it all seems like
a dream. Your wooing, my dear lord, hath been so tempestuous. Less
than three months ago I did not know of your existence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My wooing hath been over-slow for my taste!" he broke in with a
short, impatient sigh. "Three months, you say? And for me you are
still a shadow, an exquisite sprite that eludes me behind an
impenetrable, a damnable wall of conventions, even though my very
sinews ache with longing to hold you in mine arms for ever and for
aye!"</p>

<p>He looked her straight between the eyes, so straight and with
such a tantalizing glance that a hot blush rose swiftly to her
cheeks; whereupon he laughed again&mdash;a merry, a careless,
infectious laugh it was&mdash;and squeezed her hand so tightly that
he made her gasp.</p>

<p>"You are always ready to laugh, my lord," she murmured
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Always," he riposted. "And now, how can I help it? I must
laugh, or else curse with impatience. It is scarce three o'clock
now, and not before many hours can we be free of this chattering
throng."</p>

<p>Then, as she remained silent, with eyes cast down now and the
warm flush still lingering in her cheeks, he went on, with brusque
impatience, his voice sunk to a quick, penetrating whisper:</p>

<p>"If anything should part me from you now, <i>ma donna</i>, I
verily believe that I should kill someone or myself!"</p>

<p>He paused, almost disconcerted. It had never been his wont to
talk of his feelings. The transient sentiments that in the past had
grazed his senses, without touching his heart, had only led him to
careless protestations, forgotten as soon as made. He himself
marvelled at the depth of his love for this exquisite creature who
had so suddenly come into his life, bringing with her a fragrance
of youth and of purity, and withal of fervid passion, such as he
had never dreamed of through the many vicissitudes of his
adventurous life.</p>

<p>Still she did not speak, and he was content to look on her,
satisfied that she was in truth too completely happy at this hour
to give vent to her feelings in so many words. He loved to watch
the play of emotions in her tell-tale face, the pursed-up little
mouth, so ready to smile, and those violet-tinted eyes, now and
then raised to him in perfect trust and abandonment of self, then
veiled once more demurely under his provoking glance.</p>

<p>He loved to tease her, for then she blushed, and her long lashes
drew a delicately pencilled shadow upon her cheeks. He loved to say
things that frightened her, for then she would look up with a
quick, inquiring glance, search his own with a palpitating
expression that quickly melted again into one of bliss.</p>

<p>"You look so demure, <i>ma donna</i>," he exclaimed whimsically,
"that I vow I'll create a scandal&mdash;leap across the table and
kiss Kaatje, for instance&mdash;just to see if it would make you
laugh!"</p>

<p>"Do not make fun of Kaatje, my lord," Gilda admonished. "She
hath more depth of feeling than you give her credit for."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt her depth of feeling, dear heart," he retorted
with mock earnestness. "But, oh, good St. Bavon help me! Have you
ever seen so solid a yokemate, or," he added, and pointed to
Nicolaes Beresteyn, who sat moody and sullen, toying with his food,
beside his equally silent bride, "so ardent a bridegroom? Verily,
the dear lady reminds me of those succulent fish pasties they make
over in England, white and stodgy, and rather heavy on the stomach,
but, oh, so splendidly nourishing!"</p>

<p>"Fie! Now you are mocking again."</p>

<p>"How can I help it, dear heart, when you persist in looking so
solemn&mdash;so solemn, that, in the midst of all this hilarity, I
am forcibly reminded of all the rude things you said to me that
night at the inn in Leyden, and I am left to marvel how you ever
came to change your opinion of me?"</p>

<p>"I changed my opinion of you," she rejoined earnestly, "when I
learned how you were ready to give your life to save the
Stadtholder from those abominable murderers; and almost lost it,"
she added under her breath, "to save my brother Nicolaes from the
consequence of his own treachery."</p>

<p>"Hush! That is all over and done with now, <i>ma donna</i>," he
retorted lightly. "Nicolaes has become a sober burgher, devoted to
his solid Kaatje and to the cause of the Netherlands; and I have
sold my liberty to the fairest tyrant that ever enslaved a man's
soul."</p>

<p>"Do you regret it," she queried shyly, "already?"</p>

<p>"Already!" he assented gravely. "I am kicking against my bonds,
longing for that freedom which in the past kept my stomach empty
and my head erect."</p>

<p>"Will you never be serious?" she retorted.</p>

<p>"Never, while I live. My journey to England killed my only
attempt at sobriety, for there I found that the stock to which I
belonged was both irreproachable and grave, had been so all the
while that I, the most recent scion of so noble a race, was roaming
about the world, the most shiftless and thriftless vagabond it had
ever seen. But in England"&mdash;he sighed and raised his eyes and
hands in mock solemnity&mdash;"in England the climate is so
atrocious that the people become grim-visaged and square-toed
through constantly watching the rain coming down. Or else," he
added, with another suppressed ripple of that infectious laugh of
his, "the climate in England has become so atrocious because there
are so many square-toed folk about. I was such a very little while
in England," he concluded with utmost gravity, "I had not time to
make up my mind which way it went."</p>

<p>"Methinks you told me," she rejoined, "that your home in England
is beautiful and stately."</p>

<p>"It is both, dear heart," he replied more seriously; "and I
shall learn to love it when you have dwelt therein. I should love
it even now if it had ever been hallowed by the presence of my
mother."</p>

<p>"She never went there?"</p>

<p>"No, never. My father came to Holland in Leicester's train. He
married my mother in Haarlem, then deserted her and left her there
to starve. My friend Frans Hals cared for me after she died. That
is the whole of her history. It does not make for deep, filial
affection, does it?"</p>

<p>"But you have seen your father now. Affection will come in
time."</p>

<p>"Yes; I have seen him, thanks to your father, who brought us
together. I have seen my home in Sussex, where one day, please God,
you'll reign as its mistress."</p>

<p>"I, the wife of an English lord!" she sighed. "I can scarcely
credit it."</p>

<p>"Nor can I, dear heart," he answered lightly; "for that you'll
never be. Let me try and explain to you just how it all is, for, in
truth, English honours are hard to understand. My father is an
English gentleman with no handle to his name. Blake of Blakeney
they call him over there; and I am his only son. It seems that he
rendered signal services to his king of late, who thereupon desired
to confer upon him one of those honours which we over here find it
so difficult to apprise. My father, however, either because he is
advanced in years or because he desired to show me some singular
mark of favour, petitioned King James to bestow the proposed honour
upon his only son. Thus am I Sir Percy Blakeney, it seems, without
any merit on my part. Funny is it not? And I who, for years, was
known by no name save Diogenes, one of three vagabonds, with
perhaps more wits, but certainly no more worth, than my two
compeers!"</p>

<p>"Then I should call you Sir Percy?" she concluded. "Yet I cannot
get used to the name."</p>

<p>"You might even call me Percy," he suggested; "for thus was I
baptized at my dear mother's wish. Though, in truth, I had
forgotten it until my father insisted on it that I could not be
called Diogenes by mine own servants, and that he himself could not
present me to his Majesty the King of England under so fanciful a
name."</p>

<p>"I like best to think of you as Diogenes," she murmured softly.
"Thus I knew you first, and your brother philosophers, Socrates and
Pythagoras&mdash;such a quaint trio, and all of you so unsuited to
your names! I wish," she added with a sigh, "that they were here
now."</p>

<p>"And they should be here," he assented. "I am deeply anxious.
But Pythagoras&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly. Mynheer Beresteyn's voice called to him
from the recess by the open window.</p>

<p>"A goblet of wine!" Mynheer commanded; "for his Highness."</p>

<p>Diogenes was about to comply with the order, but Nicolaes
forestalled him. Already he had poured out the wine.</p>

<p>"Let me take it," he said curtly, took up the goblet and went
with it to the window. He offered it to the Stadtholder, who drank
greedily.</p>

<p>It was but a brief incident. Nicolaes had remained beside the
prince while the latter drank; then he returned, with the empty
goblet in his hand, to take his place once more beside his stolid
and solid bride.</p>

<p>"You were speaking of Pythagoras, sir," Gilda rejoined, as soon
as Diogenes was once more seated beside her. "I never know which is
which of the two dear souls. Is Pythagoras the lean one with the
deep, bass voice?"</p>

<p>"No. He is the fat one, with the round, red nose," Diogenes
replied gravely. "He was at Ede the night before last, and was seen
there, at the tavern of the Crow's Nest, somewhere after midnight,
imbibing copious draughts of hot, spiced ale. After that all traces
of him have vanished. But he must have started to join me here, as
this had been pre-arranged, and I fear me that he lost his way on
that <i>verfloekte</i> waste. I have sent Socrates, my lean
comrade&mdash;to look for poor Pythagoras upon the Veluwe. They
should be here, in truth, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the next word died in his throat. He jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"The Stadtholder!" he exclaimed. "He hath fainted."</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>Indeed, there was quite a commotion now in the window recess,
where Prince Maurice had remained all this while by the open
casement, inhaling the fresh, keen air. The English physician stood
beside him, and Mynheer Beresteyn was gazing with anxious eyes on
the master to whom, in spite of all, he had remained so splendidly
loyal. The dizziness had apparently come on quite suddenly, while
the Stadtholder was acknowledging the acclamations of the crowd who
had seen and cheered him. He tottered and would have fallen but for
the physician's supporting arm.</p>

<p>Not many of the guests had noticed the incident. They were for
the most part too much absorbed in their enjoyment of the feast to
pay attention to what went on in other parts of the room. But
Diogenes had seen it and was already over by the window; and
Nicolaes Beresteyn, too, had jumped to his feet. He looked
wide-eyed and scared, even whilst the stolid Kaatje, flushed with
good cheer, remained perfectly unconcerned, munching some
sweetmeats which seemed to delight her palate.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder, however, had quickly recovered. The faintness
passed off as suddenly as it came, but it left the illustrious
guest more silent and moody than before. His face had become of a
yellowish pallor, and his eyes looked sunken as if consumed with
fever. But he chose to return to his seat under the daïs, and this
time he called to Diogenes to give him the support of his arm.</p>

<p>"'Twas scarce worth while, eh, my friend," he said bitterly, "to
risk your precious young life in order to save this precarious one.
Had Stoutenburg's bomb done the assassin's work, it would only have
anticipated events by less than three months."</p>

<p>"Your Highness is over-tired," Diogenes rejoined simply.
"Complete rest in the midst of your friends would fight this
insidious sickness far better than the wisest of physicians."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" the Stadtholder immediately retorted, his
keen, hawk-like glance searching the soldier's smiling face. "Why
should you say 'in the midst of your friends?" he went on huskily.
"You don't mean&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"What, your Highness?"</p>

<p>"I mean&mdash;you said it so strangely&mdash;as if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I, your Highness?" Diogenes queried, not a little surprised at
the Stadtholder's febrile agitation.</p>

<p>"I myself have oft wondered&mdash;"</p>

<p>Maurice of Nassau paused abruptly, rested his elbows on the
table, and for a moment or two remained quite still, his forehead
buried in his hands. Gilda gazed on him wide-eyed and tearful; even
Kaatje ceased to munch. It seemed terrible to be so great a man,
wielding such power, commanding such obedience, and to be reduced
to a mere babbling sufferer, fearing phantoms and eagerly gleaning
any words of comfort that might come from loyal lips.</p>

<p>Diogenes had remained silent, too; his eyes, usually so full of
light-heartedness and merriment, had a strange, searching glitter
in them now. A minute or two later the prince had pulled himself
together, tried to look unconcerned, and assumed a geniality which
obviously he was far from feeling. But it was to Diogenes that he
spoke once more.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I could not rest yet awhile, my friend," he said with a
sigh; "whilst the Archduchess threatens Gelderland, the De Berg is
making ready to cross the Ijssel."</p>

<p>"Your Highness's armies under your Highness's command," rejoined
the soldier firmly, "can drive the Archduchess's hosts out of
Gelderland, and send Henri de Berg back across the Ijssel. Maurice
of Nassau is still the finest commander in Europe, even&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, and the Stadtholder broke in bitterly:</p>

<p>"Even though he is a dying man, you mean."</p>

<p>"No!" here broke in Gilda, with glowing fervour. "I swear that
nothing was further from my lord's thoughts. Sir," she added, and
turned boldly to her lover, "you spoke with such confidence just
now. A toast, I pray you, so that we may all join in expressions of
loyalty to our guest and sovereign lord, the Stadtholder!"</p>

<p>She poured a goblet full of wine. Diogenes gave her a quick
glance of approval. Then he picked up the goblet, stood upon his
seat, and placed one foot on the table.</p>

<p>"Long life to your Highness!" he cried aloud. "May it please God
to punish your enemies and to give victory unto your cause!"</p>

<p>Then, holding the goblet aloft, he called at the top of his
voice:</p>

<p>"Maurice of Nassau and the cause of Liberty!"</p>

<p>Every one rose, and a rousing cheer went echoing round the room.
It was heard and taken up lustily by the crowd outside, until the
very walls of the ancient city echoed the loyal toast, from the
grim towers of Koppel Poort to the Vrouwetoren of St. Maria Kerk;
from gateway to gateway, and rampart to rampart. And the bells of
St. Joris and St. Maria took up the joyful call and sent peal after
peal of bells resounding gleefully through the keen, wintry
air.</p>

<p>"Maurice of Nassau!" rang the chimes. "Nassau and liberty!"</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>But after this manifestation of joy and enthusiasm, comparative
silence fell upon the wedding assembly. None but those who had
partaken over freely of Mynheer Beresteyn's good cheer could fail
to see that the Stadtholder felt ill, and only kept up a semblance
of gaiety by a mighty effort of his iron will. Thereafter,
conversation became subdued. People talked in whispers, an
atmosphere of constraint born of anxiety reigned there where
light-hearted gaiety had a while ago held undisputed sway. The host
himself did his best to revive the temper of his guests.
Serving-men and maids were ordered to go around more briskly with
the wine. One or two of the younger men hazarded the traditional
jokes which usually obtained at wedding feasts; but those who
laughed did so shamefacedly. It seemed as if a vague terror held
erstwhile chattering tongues in check.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder, leaning back against the cushions of his chair,
spoke very little. His long, nervy fingers played incessantly with
crumbs and pellets of bread. He looked impatient and ill at ease,
like a man who wants to get away yet fears to offend his host. He
had kept Diogenes by his side this time, and Beresteyn was able to
snatch a few last words with his daughter. Once she was married,
her husband would take her to his home in England one day, and the
thought of parting from the child he loved was weighing the
father's spirit down.</p>

<p>"'Tis the first time," he said sadly, "that you will pass out of
my keeping. You were the precious heritage bequeathed to me your
dead mother. Now 'tis to a stranger that I am entrusting my
priceless treasure."</p>

<p>"A stranger, father," riposted Gilda quietly, "who hath proved
himself worthy of the truth. And when we do go to England," she
went on gaily, "there will only be a narrow strip of water between
us, and that is easily crossed."</p>

<p>Beresteyn gave a quickly smothered sigh. He looked across at the
stranger to whom, as he said, he was about to hand over the most
precious gift he possessed. Handsome he was, that erstwhile
penniless soldier of fortune; handsome and brave, frank and loyal,
and with that saving grace of light-hearted gaiety in him which had
helped him through the past terrible crisis in his life, and
brought him to the safe haven of a stately home in England and
wealthy father, eager to make amends for the wrongs committed long
ago.</p>

<p>But still a stranger for all that, a man who had seen more of
the seamy side of the world, who had struggled more, suffered
more&mdash;ay, perhaps sinned more&mdash;than those of his rank in
life usually did at his age. Something of that rough-and-tumble
life of the soldier of fortune, without home or kindred, who sells
his sword to the highest bidder, and knows no master save his own
will, must have left its mark upon the temperament of the man.
Despite the humorous twinkle in the eyes, the bantering curl on the
lip, the man's face bore the impress of the devil-may-care
existence that takes no heed of the morrow. And at times, when it
was in repose, there was a strangely grim look in it of
determination as well as of turbulent passions, not always held in
check.</p>

<p>Beresteyn sighed with inward apprehension. His well-ordered
mind, the mind of a Dutch middle-class burgher, precise and
unemotional, could not quite fathom that of the
Anglo-Saxon&mdash;the most romantic and the most calculating, and
the most impulsive and the most studied, the most sensuous and most
self-repressed temperament that ever set the rest of the world
wondering. He could see the reckless scapegrace, the thoughtless
adventurer, fuming and fretting under the restraint put upon him by
the cut-and-dried conventions attendant upon these wedding
ceremonies could watch him literally writhing under the knowing
looks and time-honoured innuendos which custom deemed allowable on
these occasions. His hands indeed must be itching to come in
contact with the checks of mocking friends and smug relatives, all
eager to give advice or to chaff the young bride, until the hot
blood rushed to her cheeks and tears of annoyance gather in her
eyes.</p>

<p>The whole atmosphere of noise and drinking&mdash;ay, of
good-humour and complacency&mdash;did, in truth, grate upon
Diogenes' nerves. He had not lied to Gilda nor yet exaggerated his
sentiments when he said that his sinews ached with longing to seize
her and carry her away into solitude and quiet, where nought would
come to disturb their love-dream; away upon his horse, her soft
arms encircling his neck her head resting on his shoulder, her dear
face turned up to his gaze, with those heavenly eyes closed in
rapture; the delicate mouth slightly parted, showing a vision of
tiny teeth, a tear mayhap trembling on her lashes, a soft blush
mantling on her cheek. Away! Across the ocean to that stately home
in England, where the spring air was soft with the scent of violets
and of fruit blossom, and where beside the river the reeds murmured
a soft accompaniment to songs of passion and hymns of love. Away
from all save the shrine which he had set up for her in his heart;
from all save the haven of his arms.</p>

<p>To feel that, and then be forced to sit and discuss plans for
the undoing of the Spanish commander or for the relief of Arnheim,
was, in fact, more than Diogenes' restive temperament could stand.
His attention began to wander, his answers became evasive; so much
so that, after a while, the Stadtholder, eyeing him closely,
remarked with the pale ghost of a smile:</p>

<p>"'Tis no use fretting and fuming, my friend. Your English blood
is too mutinous for this sober country and its multitude of stodgy
conventions. One of these demands that your bride shall sit here
till the last of the guests has departed, and only a few fussy and
interfering old <i>tantes</i> are left to unrobe her and
commiserate with her over her future lot&mdash;a slave to a
bullying husband, a handmaid to her exacting lord. Every
middle-aged frump in the Netherlands hath some story to tell that
will bring tears to a young bride's eyes or a blush to her
cheeks."</p>

<p>"Please God," Diogenes ejaculated fervently. "Gilda will be
spared that."</p>

<p>"Impossible, you rogue!" the Stadtholder retorted, amused
despite his moodiness by the soldier's fretful temper. "The
conventions&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Verfloekt</i> will be the conventions as far as we are
concerned," Diogenes rejoined hotly. "And if your Highness would
but help&mdash;" he added impulsively.</p>

<p>"I? What can I do?"</p>

<p>"Give the signal for dispersal," Diogenes entreated; "and
graciously promise to forgive me if, for the first time in my life,
I act with disrespect toward your Highness."</p>

<p>"But, man, how will that help you?" the Stadtholder
demurred.</p>

<p>"I must get away from all this wearying bombast, this jabbering
and scraping and all these puppy-tricks!" Diogenes exclaimed with
comical fierceness. "I must get away ere my wife becomes a doll and
a puppet, tossed into my arms by a lot of irresponsible monkeys! If
I have to stay here much longer, your Highness," he added earnestly
"I vow that I shall flee from it all, leave an angel to weep for my
abominable desertion of what I hold more priceless than all the
world, and an outraged father to curse the day when so reckless and
adventurer crossed his daughter's path. But stand this any longer I
cannot!" he concluded, and, with a quick sweep of the arm, he
pointed to the chattering, buzzing crowd below. "And if your
Highness will not help me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who said I would not help you, you hotheaded rashling?" the
Stadtholder broke in composedly. "You know very well that I can
refuse you nothing, not even the furtherance of one of your madcap
schemes. And as for disrespect&mdash;why, as you say, in the midst
of so much bowing and scraping some of us are eager for disrespect
as an aging spinster for amorous overtures. By way of a change, you
know."</p>

<p>He spoke quite simply and with an undercurrent of genuine
sympathy in his tone, as a man towards his friend. Something of the
old Maurice of Nassau seemed for the moment to have swept aside the
arbitrary tyrant whom men had learned to hate as well as to obey.
Diogenes' irascible mood melted suddenly in the sunshine of the
Stadtholder's indulgent smile, the mocking glance faded out of his
eyes, and he said with unwonted earnestness:</p>

<p>"No wonder that men have gone to death or to glory under your
leadership."</p>

<p>"Would you follow me again if I called?" the prince
retorted.</p>

<p>"Your Highness hath no need of me. The United Provinces are
free, her burghers are free men. 'Tis time to sheathe the sword,
and a man might be allowed, methinks, to dream of happiness."</p>

<p>"Is your happiness bound up with the mad scheme for which you
want my help?"</p>

<p>"Ay, my dear lord!" Diogenes replied. "And, secure in your
gracious promise, I swear that naught can keep me from the scheme
now save mine own demise."</p>

<p>"There are more arbitrary things than death, my friend," the
Stadtholder mused.</p>

<p>"Possibly, your Highness," the soldier answered lightly; "but
not for me to-night."</p>

<p class="cpb">6.</p>

<p>More than one chronicler of the time hath averred that Maurice
of Nassau had in truth a soft corner in his heart for the man who
had saved him from the bomb prepared by the Lord of Stoutenburg,
and would yield to the "Laughing Cavalier" when others, less
privileged, were made to feel the weight of his arbitrary temper.
Be that as it may, he certainly on this occasion was as good as his
word. Wearied with all these endless ceremonials, he was no doubt
glad enough to take his departure, and anon he gave the signal for
a general breaking up of the party by rising, and, in a loud voice,
thanking Mynheer Beresteyn for his lavish hospitality.</p>

<p>"An you will pardon this abrupt departure," he concluded with
unwonted graciousness, "I would fain get to horse. By starting
within the hour, I could reach Utrecht before dark."</p>

<p>All the guests had risen, too, and there was the usual hubbub
and noise attendant on the dispersal of so large a party. That
Stadtholder stepped down from the daïs, Mynheer Beresteyn and the
English physician remaining by his side, while the bridal party
brought up the rear. Room was made for his Highness to walk down
the room, the men standing bareheaded and the women curtseying as
he passed. But he did not speak to any one, only nodded
perfunctorily to those whom he knew personally. Obviously he felt
ill and tired, and his moodiness was, for the most part, commented
on with sympathy.</p>

<p>The brides and bridegrooms, on the other hand, had to withstand
a veritable fusillade of banter, which Nicolaes Beresteyn received
sulkily, and the solid Kaatje with much complacence. Indeed, this
bride was willing enough to be chaffed, had even a saucy reply
handy when she was teased, and ogled her friends slily as she went
by. But Gilda remained silent and demure. I don't think that she
heard a word that was said. She literally seemed to glide across
the room like the veritable sprite her ardent lover had called her.
Her tiny hand, white and slightly fluttering, rested on his arm,
lost in the richly embroidered folds of his magnificent doublet.
She was not fully conscious of her actions, moved along as in a
dream, without the exertion of her will. She was wont to speak
afterwards of this brief progress of hers through the crowded room
with the chattering throng of friends all around, as a walk through
air. Nothing seemed to her to exist. There was no room, no crowd,
no noise. She alone existed, and ethereally. Her lover was there,
however, and she was fully conscious of his will. She knew that
anon she would be a captive in his arms, to be dealt with my him as
he liked; and this caused her to feel that fearful and yet wholly
content.</p>

<p>He, Diogenes, on the other hand, was the picture of fretful
impatience, squeezing his soft felt hat in his hand as if it were
the throat of some deadly enemy. He never once looked at his bride;
probably if he had he would have lost the last shred of
self-control, would have seized her in his arms and carried her
away then and there, regardless of the respect due to the
Stadtholder and to his host.</p>

<p>But the trial, though severe to any ebullient temper, was not of
long duration. Anon the Stadtholder was in the hall, booted once
more and spurred, and surrounded by his equerries and by the bridal
party.</p>

<p>His bodyguard encumbered the hall, their steel bonnets and short
breastplates reflecting the wintry light which came, many-hued,
through the tall, stained glass windows. In the rear the wedding
guests were crowding forward to catch a last glimpse of the
Stadtholder, and of the pageant of his departure. The great hall
door had been thrown open, and through it, framed in the richness
of the heavy oaken jambs, a picture appeared, gay, animated,
brilliant, such as the small city had never before seen.</p>

<p>There was the holiday throng, moving ceaselessly in an ever
flowing and glittering stream. The women in huge, winged hoods and
short kirtles, the men in fur bonnets and sleeved coats, were
strolling up and down the quay. There were the inevitable musicians
with pipes, viols, and sackbuts, pushing their way through the
dense mass of people, with a retinue behind them of young people
and old, and of children, all stepping it to the measure of the
tune. There was the swarthy foreigner with his monkey dressed out
in gaily coloured rags, and the hawker with his tray full of bright
handkerchiefs, of glass beads, chains, and amulets, crying out his
wares. It was, in fact, a holiday crowd, drawn thither by Mynheer
Beresteyn's largesse; the shopkeepers with their wives, who had
been induced to shut down shop for the afternoon, as if some
official function had been in progress; the apprentices getting in
everybody's way, hilarious and full of mischief, trying to steal
the hawkers' wares, or to play impish pranks on their employers;
servant maids and sober apothecaries, out-at-elbow scriveners and
stolid rustics, to-gether with the rag and tag of soldiery, the
paid mercenaries of Maurice of Nassau's army, in their showy
doublets and plumed bonnets, elbowing their way through with the
air of masters.</p>

<p>And all this brilliant gathering was lit by a pale, wintry sun:
and with the sleepy waters of the Eem, and the frowning towers of
the Koppel-poort forming just the right natural-tinted background
to the scene.</p>

<p>"Make way there!" the prince's herald shouted, whilst another
rang a fanfare upon the trumpet. "Make way for his High and
Mightiness, Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange, Stadtholder of the
United Provinces of Holland, Friesland, Utrecht, Gelderland, Over
Yssel, and Groningen! Make way!"</p>

<p>The equerries were bringing the prince's charger, the pikemen
followed in gorgeous padded trunks and slashed hose. To the noise
of the moving throng, the chatter and the laughter, the scraping of
viols and piping of sackbuts, was now added the din of champing
horses, rattle of bits and chains, the shouts of the men who were
bringing the horses along. The crowd receded, leaving an open space
in front of the house, where mounted men assembled so quickly that
they seemed as if they had risen out of the ground.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder was taking final leave of his host listening
with what patience he could master to lengthy, loyal speeches from
the more important guests, and from the other bride and bridegroom.
He had&mdash;deliberately methinks&mdash;turned his back on
Diogenes, who, strangely enough, was booted and spurred too, had
his sword buckled to his belt, and carried a dark cloak on his arm,
presenting not at all the picture of a bridegroom in holiday
attire.</p>

<p>And it all happened so quickly that neither the guests within,
nor the soldiers, nor the crowd outside, had time to realize it or
to take it in. No one understood, in fact, what was happening, save
perhaps the Stadtholder, who guessed; and he engaged the sober
fathers near him in earnest conversation.</p>

<p>A mounted equerry, dressed in rough leather jerkin and leading
another horse by the bridle, had taken up his stand in the
forefront of the crowd. Now at a signal unheard by all save him, he
jumped out of the saddle and stood beside the stirrup leathers of
the second charger. At that same instant Diogenes, with movements
quick as lightning, had thrown the cloak, which he was carrying
round Gilda's shoulders, and before she could utter a scream or
even a gasp, he had stooped and picked her up in his arms as if she
were a weightless doll.</p>

<p>Another second and he was outside the door, at the top of the
steps which led down to the quay. For an instant he stood there,
his keen eyes sweeping over the picture before him. Like a young
lion that hath been caged and now scents liberty once more, he
inhaled the biting air; a superb figure, with head tossed back,
eyes and lips laughing with the joy of deliverance, the inert
figure of the girl lying in his arms.</p>

<p>He felt her clinging more closely to him, and revelled in that
intoxicating sense of power when the one woman yields who holds a
world of happiness in her tiny hand. He felt the tightening of her
hold, watched the look of contentment stealing over her face, saw
her eyes close, her lips smile, and knew that they were ready for a
kiss.</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of his horse, and of the man in the leather
jerkin. He signalled to him to bring the horses near. The crowd
understood his meaning and set up a ringing cheer. Many things had
been seen in Dutch cities before, but never so romantic an
abduction as this. The bridegroom carrying off his bride in the
face of scandalized and protesting wedding guests! The Stadtholder
even was seen to laugh. He could be seen in the background,
reassuring the horrified guests, and trying by kind words and
pressure of hand to appease Mynheer Beresteyn's agonized
surprise.</p>

<p>"I knew of his mad project, and I must say I approved," the
prince whispered to the agitated father. "He is taking her to
Rotterdam to-night. Let the child be, Mynheer; she is safe enough
in his arms."</p>

<p>Beresteyn was one of those men who throughout his life had
always known how to accept the inevitable. Perhaps in his heart he
knew that the Stadtholder was right.</p>

<p>"Give them your blessing, Mynheer," Maurice of Nassau urged.
"English gentleman or soldier of fortune, the man is a man and
deserves it. Your daughter loves him. Let them be."</p>

<p>Diogenes had encountered Beresteyn's reproachful glance. He did
not move from where he stood, only his arms closed tighter still
around Gilda's motionless form. It was an instinctive challenge to
the father&mdash;almost a defiance. What he had would hold, in
spite of all.</p>

<p>Beresteyn hesitated for the mere fraction of a second longer;
then he, too, stepped out through the door and approached the man
and his burden. He said nothing, but, in the face of the crowd, he
stooped and pressed his lips against his daughter's forehead. Then
Mynheer Beresteyn murmured something which sounded like a blessing,
and added solemnly:</p>

<p>"May God's wrath descend upon you, my lord, if you ever cause
her unhappiness."</p>

<p>"Amen to that!" responded Diogenes lightly. "She and I, Mynheer,
will dream together for awhile in England, but I'll bring her back
to you when our orchards are gay with apple-blossom and there is a
taste of summer in the air."</p>

<p>He bowed his head to receive the father's blessing. The crowd
cheered again; sackbuts and viols set up a lively tune. At every
window of the house, along the quay eager faces were peering out,
gazing on the moving spectacle. In the doorway of Mynheer
Beresteyn's house the Stadtholder remained to watch. For the moment
he seemed better and brighter, more like his former self. The rest
of the bridal party was still in the hall, but the wedding guests
had gone back into the banqueting-room, whence they could see
through the open windows what was going on.</p>

<p class="cpb">7.</p>

<p>Then it was that suddenly a curious spectacle presented itself
to view. It was, in truth, so curious an one that those of the
crowd who were in the rear withdrew their consideration from the
romantic scene before them in order to concentrate it on those two
strange-looking cavaliers who had just emerged from under the
Koppel-port, and were slowly forging their way through the
throng.</p>

<p>It was the ringing shout, reiterated twice in succession by one
of these cavaliers, that had at first arrested the attention of the
crowd, and had even caused Diogenes to pause in the very act of
starting for his sentimental adventure. To him the voice that
uttered such peremptory clamour was familiar enough, but what in
St. Bavon's name did it all mean?</p>

<p>"<i>Hola! you verdommte plepshurk</i>!" came for the third time
from the strange cavalier. "Make way there! We are for the house of
Mynheer Beresteyn, where we are bidden as his guests."</p>

<p>A loud burst of hilarity greeted this announcement, and a
mocking voice retorted lustily:</p>

<p>"Hey! Make way there for the honoured guests of Mynheer
Beresteyn!"</p>

<p>In truth, it was small wonder that the aspect of these two
cavaliers caused such wild jollity amongst the people, who at this
precise moment were overready for laughter. One of them, as lean as
a gatepost, sat high on his horse with long shanks covered in high
leathern boots. A tall sugar-loaf hat sat precariously upon his
head, and his hatchet face, with the hooked, prominent nose and
sharp, unshaved chin, looked blue with the cold.</p>

<p>Behind him on a pillion rode&mdash;or rather clung&mdash;his
companion, a short man as rotund as the other was lean, with round
face which no doubt had once been of a healthy ruddy tint, but was
now streaked and blotched with pallor. He, too, wore a sugar-loaf
hat, but it had slid down to the back of his head, and was held in
place by a piece of black tape, which he had in his mouth like a
horse has its bit. He was holding on very tightly with his short,
fat arms to his companion's body, and his feet were tied together
with thick cord beneath the horse's belly. His doublet and hose
were smeared with mud and stained with blood, and altogether he
presented a pitiable spectacle, more especially when he rolled his
small, beady eyes and looked with a scared expression on the
hilarious apprentices who were dancing and screaming around
him.</p>

<p>But the other appeared quite indifferent to the jeers and
mockeries of the crowd. He passed majestically through the gateway
of the Koppel-poort that spans the river, not unlike the figure of
that legendary knight of the rueful countenance of whom the
Se&Ograve;or Cervantes had been writing of late.</p>

<p>Diogenes had remained on the top of the steps, perfectly still.
His keen eyes, frowning now under the straight, square brow,
watched the slow progress of those two quaint figures. Who will
ever attempt to explain the subtle workings of that mysterious
force which men term Intuition? Whence does it come? Where does it
dwell? How doth it come knocking at a man's heart with cold, hard
knuckles that bruise and freeze? Diogenes felt that sudden call.
Gilda was still lying snugly in his arms; she had seen nothing. But
he had become suspicious now, mistrustful of that Fate which had
but a moment ago smiled so encourageingly upon him. All his
exhilaration fell away from him like a discarded mantle, leaving
him chilled to the soul and inert, and with the premonition of
something evil looming from afar on the horizon of his Destiny.</p>

<p>The two quaint companions came nearer. Soon Diogenes could read
every line upon the familiar countenances. He and those men had
fought side by side, shoulder to shoulder, had bled together,
suffered together, starved and triumphed together. There was but
little the one thought that the others could not know. Even now, on
Socrates; lean, lantern-jawed face Diogenes read plainly the
message of some tragedy as yet uncomprehended by the other, but
which Pythagoras' sorry plight had more that suggested. It was a
deeper thing than Intuition; it was Knowledge. Knowledge that the
hour of happiness had gone by, the hour of security and of repose,
and that the relentless finger of Fate pointed once more to paths
beset with sorrow and with thorns, to the path of an adventurer and
of a soldier of fortune, rather than to the easy existence of a
wealthy gentleman.</p>

<p>As Socrates swung himself wearily out of the saddle, Diogenes'
piercing glance darted a mute, quick query toward his friend. The
other replied by a mere nod of the head. They knew; they understood
one another. Put into plain language, question and answer might
have been put thus:</p>

<p>"Are we to go on the warpath again, old compeer?"</p>

<p>"So it seems. There's fighting to be done. Will you be in it,
too?"</p>

<p>And Diogenes gave that quick impatient sigh which was so
characteristic of him, and very slowly, very gently, as if she were
a sheaf of flowers, he allowed his beloved to glide out of his
arms.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE GREAT
INTERRUPTION</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>The next moment Diogenes was down on the quay, in time to help
Socrates to lift his brother philosopher off the pillion.</p>

<p>Gilda, a little scared at first, not understanding, looked
wonderingly around her, blinking in the glare, until she
encountered her father's troubled glance.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she murmured, half-stupidly.</p>

<p>He tried to explain, pointed to the group down below, the funny,
fat man in obvious pain and distress, being lifted off the horse
and received in those same strong arms which had sheltered
her&mdash;Gilda&mdash;but a moment ago.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder, too, was curious, asked many questions, and had
to be waited on deferentially with replies and explanations, which
were still of necessity very vague.</p>

<p>"Attend to his Highness, father," Gilda said more firmly. "I can
look to myself now."</p>

<p>She felt a little strange, a little humiliated perhaps, standing
here alone, as if abandoned by the very man who but a moment ago
had seemed ready to defy every convention for her sake. Just now
she had been the centre of attraction, the pivot round which
revolved excitement, curiosity, interest. Even the Stadtholder had,
for the space of those few minutes, forgotten his cares and his
responsibilities in order to think of her and to plead with her
father for her freedom and her happiness. Now she was all alone,
seemed so for the moment, while her father and Mynheer van den
Poele and the older men crowded around his Highness, and every one
had their eyes fixed on the curious spectacle below.</p>

<p>But that sense of isolation and of disappointment was only
transient. Gilda Beresteyn had recently gone through experiences
far more bitter than this&mdash;experiences that had taught her to
think and to act quickly and on her own initiative. She saw her
lover remounting the steps now. He was carrying his friend in his
arms as if the latter had been a child, his other compeer following
ruefully. The rowdy 'prentices had been silenced; two or three
kindly pairs of hands had proved ready to assist and to care for
the horse, which looked spent. The holiday crowd was silent and
sympathetic. Every one felt that in this sudden interruption of the
gay and romantic adventure there lurked a something mysterious
which might very well prove to be a tragedy.</p>

<p>It was Gilda who led the way into the house, calling Maria to
open a guest-chamber forthwith, one where the bed was spread with
freshly-aired linen. The English physician, at a word from the
Stadtholder, was ready to minister to the sick man, and Mynheer
Beresteyn himself showed the young soldier and his burden up the
stairs, while the crowd of wedding guests and of the prince's
bodyguard made way for them to pass through the hall.</p>

<p>What had been such a merry and excited throng earlier in the day
was now more than ever subdued. The happenings in the house of
Mynheer Beresteyn, which should have been at this hour solely
centred around the Stadtholder and the wedding party, were strange
enough indeed to call forth whispered comments and subdued
murmurings in secluded corners. To begin with, the Stadtholder had
put off his departure for an hour and more, and this apparently at
the instance of Diogenes, who had begged for the assistance of the
prince's English physician to minister to his friend.</p>

<p>People marvelled why the town leech should not have been called
in. Why should a strange <i>plepshurk's</i> sickness interfere with
his Highness's movements? Also the Stadtholder appeared agitated
and fretful since Diogenes had had a word with him. Maurice of
Nassau, acquiescing with unwonted readiness both in his physician
remaining to look after the sick man and in the postponement of his
own departure, had since then retired to a small private room on a
floor above, in the company of Mynheer Beresteyn and several of the
more important guests. The others were left to conjecture and to
gossip, which they did freely, whilst Gilda was no longer to be
seen, and the worthy Kaatje was left pouting and desolate beside
her morose bridegroom. Nicolaes Beresteyn, indeed, appeared more
moody than any one, although the interruption could not in itself
have interfered with his new domestic arrangements. At first he had
thought of following his father and Stadtholder into the private
chamber upstairs, but to this Mynheer Beresteyn had demurred.</p>

<p>"Your place, my son," he said, with a gently mocking smile, "is
beside your Kaatje. His Highness will understand."</p>

<p>And when Nicolaes, trying to insist, followed his father up the
stairs to the very threshold of the council room, Mynheer quite
firmly and unceremoniously closed the door in his face.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Up in the guest-chamber, Diogenes was watching over his sick
friend. The first moment that he was alone with his two old
compeers, he had turned to Socrates and queried anxiously:</p>

<p>"What is it? What hath happened?"</p>

<p>"He'll tell you when he can speak," the other replied. "We found
him lying in the snow outside Lang Soeren with two bullet-wounds in
his back, after we had searched the whole <i>verfloekte</i> Veluwe
for him all day. We took him into Lang Soeren, where there was a
leech, who extracted the one bullet that had lodged under his
shoulder blade; the other had only passed through the flesh along
his ribs, where it made a clean hole but could not otherwise be
found."</p>

<p>"Well, yes&mdash;and&mdash;" Diogenes went on impatiently, for
the other was somewhat slow of speech.</p>

<p>"The leech," Socrates rejoined unperturbed, "said that the
patient must lie still for a few days because of the fever; but
what must this fool do but shout and rave the moment he is
conscious that he must to Amersfoort to see you at once. And so
loudly did he shout and so wildly did he rave, that the leech
himself got scared and ran away. Whereupon I set the
bladder-bellied loon upon the pillion behind me and brought him
hither, thinking the ride would do him less harm than all that wild
screeching and waving of arms. And here we are!" Socrates concluded
blandly, and threw himself into the nearest chair; for he, too,
apparently was exhausted with the fatigue of his perilous journey
across the waste.</p>

<p>Just then the leech returned, and nothing more could be said.
The sick man groaned a good deal under the physician's hands, and
Socrates presently dropped off to sleep.</p>

<p>The noise in the street below had somewhat abated, but there was
still the monotonous hubbub attendant on a huge crowd on the move.
Diogenes went to the window and gazed out upon the throng. Even now
the wintry sun was sinking slowly down in the west in a haze of
purple and rose, licking the towers of St. Maria and Joris with
glistening tongues of fire, and tinting the snow-covered roofs and
gables with a rosy hue. The sluggish waters of the Eem appeared
like liquid flame.</p>

<p>For a few minutes the Koppel-poort, the bridges, the bastions,
the helmets and breastplates of the prince's guard threw back a
thousand rays of multi-coloured lights. For a brief instant the
earth glowed and blushed under this last kiss of her setting lord.
Then all became sombre and dreary, as if a veil had been drawn over
the light that illuminated the little city, leaving but the grey
shadows visible, and the sadness of evening and the expectance of a
long winter's night.</p>

<p>Diogenes gave a moody sigh. His fiery temper chafed under this
delay. Not for a moment would he have thought of leaving his sick
comrade until he had been reassured as to his fate; but if
everything had happened as he had planned and wished, he would be
half-way to Utrecht by now, galloping adown the lonely roads with a
delicious burden upon his saddle-bow, and feeling the cold wintry
wind whistling past his ears as he put the leagues behind him.</p>

<p>He turned away from the window, and tiptoed out of the room. The
groans of the sick man, the measured movements of the leech, the
snoring of Socrates, were grating on his nerves. Closing the door
softly behind him, he strode down the gallery which ran in front of
him along the entire width of the house. Up and down once or twice.
The movement did him good, and he liked the solitude. The house was
still full of a chattering throng; he could hear the murmur of
conversation rising from below. Once he peeped over the carved
balustrade of the gallery and down into the hall. The prince's
bodyguard was still there, and two or three equerries. The clank of
their spurs resounded up the stairs as they moved about on the
flag-covered floor.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>When Diogenes resumed his pacing up and down, he suddenly became
aware of the soft and distant sound of a woman's voice, singing to
the accompaniment of a quaint-toned virginal. He paused and
listened. The voice was Gilda's, and the sentimental ditty which
she sang had just that melancholy strain in it which is to be found
in the songs of all nations that are foredoomed to suffer and to
fight. Chiding himself for a fool, Diogenes, nevertheless, felt for
a moment or two quite unable to move. It seemed as if Gilda's
song&mdash;he could not catch the words&mdash;was tearing at his
heart even whilst it reduced him to a state of silent ecstasy. Much
against his will he felt the hot tears welling to his eyes. With
his wonted impatience he swept them away with the back of his
hand.</p>

<p>"Curse me for a snivelling blockhead!" he muttered; and strode
resolutely in the direction whence had come the sweet sad
sound.</p>

<p>Then it was that he noticed that one of the doors which gave on
the gallery was ajar. It was through this that the intoxicating
sound had come to his ears. After an instant's hesitation he pushed
the door open. It gave on a small panelled room with
deep-embrasured window, through which the grey evening light came
in, shyly peeping. On the window-ledge a couple of pots of early
tulips flaunted their crude colours against the neutral-tinted
background, whilst on the shelves in a corner of the room gleamed
the vivid blue of bright-patterned china plates. But the flowers
and the china and the grey evening light were but momentary
impressions, which did not fix themselves upon the man's
consciousness. All that he retained clearly was the vision of Gilda
sitting at the instrument, her delicate hands resting upon the
keys. She had ceased to play, and was looking straight out before
her, and Diogenes could see her piquant profile silhouetted against
the pale, slivery light. She had changed her stiff bridal robes for
a plain gown of dark-coloured worsted, relieved only by dainty
cuffs and collar of filmy Flemish lace.</p>

<p>At the sound of her husband's footsteps she turned to look on
him, and her whole face became wreathed in smiles. He was still
booted and spurred, ready for the journey, with his long, heavy
sword buckled to his belt; but he had put hat and mantle aside. The
moment he came in Gilda put a finger to her lips.</p>

<p>"Sh-sh-sh!" she whispered. "If you make no noise they'll not
know you are here."</p>

<p>She pointed across the room to where a heavy tapestry apparently
masked another door.</p>

<p>"The Stadtholder is in there," she added naively, "with father
and Mynheer van den Poele and a number of other grave seigneurs.
Kaatje is weeping and complaining somewhere down in
<i>mejuffrouw</i> van den Poele's arms. So I sat down to the
virginal and left the door open, so that you might hear me sing;
for if you heard I thought you would surely come. I was lonely,"
she added simply, "and waiting for you."</p>

<p>Quite enough in truth to make a man who is dizzy with love ten
thousand times more dizzy still. And Diogenes was desperately in
love, more so indeed than he had ever thought himself capable of
being. He quietly unbuckled his sword, which clanged against the
floor when he moved, and deposited in cautiously and noiselessly in
an angle of the room. Then he tiptoed across to the virginal and
knelt beside his beloved.</p>

<p>For a moment or two he rested his head against her cool white
hands.</p>

<p>"To think," he murmured, with a sigh of infinite longing, "that
we might be half-way to Rotterdam by now! But I could not leave my
old Pythagoras till I knew that he was in no danger."</p>

<p>"What saith the physician, my lord?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I am waiting now for his final verdict. But he gives me every
hope. In an hour I shall know."</p>

<p>He paused, trying to read the varying play of emotions upon her
face. From the other side of the tapestry came the low sound of
subdued murmurings.</p>

<p>"It would not be too late," he went on, slightly hesitating,
taking her hands in his and forcing her glance to meet his. "You
knew I meant to take you to England&mdash;to carry you
away&mdash;to-night?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew," she replied. "And I was glad to go."</p>

<p>"Will you be afraid to come presently?" he urged, his voice
quivering with excitement. "In the dark&mdash;I know the road well.
We could make Rotterdam by midnight&mdash;and set sail for England
To-morrow as I had prearranged&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just as you wish, my dear lord," she assented simply.</p>

<p>"I could not wait, <i>ma donna</i>! I had planned it
all&mdash;to ride with you Rotterdam to-night&mdash;and then
to-morrow on the seas&mdash;with you&mdash;and England in sight, I
could not wait!" he reiterated, almost pathetically, so great was
his impatience.</p>

<p>"I am ready to start when you will, my lord," she said again,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"And you'll not be afraid?" he insisted. "It will be
dark&mdash;and cold. We could not reach Rotterdam before
midnight."</p>

<p>"How should I be afraid of the darkness or of anything," she
retorted, "when I am with you. And how should I be cold, when I am
nestling in your arms?"</p>

<p>He had his arms round her in an instant. He would have kissed
her if he dared. But with the kiss all restraint would of a surety
have vanished, as doth the snow in the warm embrace of the sun. He
would have seized her then and there once more and carried her
away. And this time no consideration on earth would have stayed
him. With a muttered exclamation, he jumped to his feet and passed
his slender hand across his forehead.</p>

<p>"Good St. Bavon!" he murmured whimsically. "Why are you so
unkind to me to-night?"</p>

<p>And she, a little disappointed because, in truth, she had been
ready for the kiss, rejoined with a quaint little pout:</p>

<p>"You are always appealing to St. Bavon, my dear lord! Why is
that?"</p>

<p>"Because," he replied very seriously, "St. Bavon is the patron
saint of all men that are weak."</p>

<p>She fixed great, wondering eyes on him. The reply was ambiguous;
she did not quite understand the drift of it.</p>

<p>"But you, my lord, are so strong," she objected.</p>

<p>It was perhaps too dark for her to see the expression in his
face; but even so she felt herself unaccountably blushing under
that gaze which she could not clearly see. Whereupon he uttered an
ejaculation which sounded almost as if he were angered, and
abruptly, without any warning, he turned on his heel and went out
of the room, leaving Gilda alone once more beside the virginal.</p>

<p>But she no longer felt the desire to sing. The happiness which
filled her entire soul was too complete even for song.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>One of the equerries had awhile ago found his way to the
guest-chamber where the sick man was lying, and had informed
Diogenes that the Stadtholder was now ready to start on his way,
but desired his presence that he might take his leave. Then it was
that Diogenes sent an urgent message to his Highness, entreating
him to remain but a little while longer. The sick man was better,
would soon wake out of a refreshing sleep. Diogenes would then
question him. Poor old Pythagoras had something to say, something
that the Stadtholder himself must hear. Of this Diogenes was
absolutely convinced.</p>

<p>"I know it," the young soldier asserted earnestly. "I seem to
feel it in my bones."</p>

<p>Whereupon the Stadtholder had decided to wait, and Diogenes,
after his brief glimpse of Gilda, felt easier in his mind, less
impatient. Already he chided himself for his gloomy forebodings.
Since his beloved was ready to entrust herself to him, the journey
to England would only be put off by a few hours. What need to
repine? Joy would be none the less sweet for this brief delay.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later Pythagoras was awake the physician
out of the room, and Diogenes was sitting on the edge of the bed
holding his faithful comrade's hand, and trying to disentangle some
measure of coherence out of the other's tangled narrative, whilst
Socrates stood by making an occasional comment or just giving an
expressive grunt from time to time. It took both time and patience,
neither of which commodities did Diogenes possess in
super-abundance; but after the first few moments of listening to
the rambling of the sick man, he became very still and attentive.
The busy house, the noisy guests, the waiting Stadtholder down
below, all slipped out from his ken. Holding his comrade's hand, he
was with him on the snow-clad Veluwe, and had found his way with
him into the lonely mill.</p>

<p>"It was the Lord of Stoutenburg," Pythagoras averred, with as
much strength as he could command. "I'd stake my life on't! I knew
him at once. How could I ever forget his ugly countenance, after
all he made you suffer?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;and?" queried Diogenes eagerly.</p>

<p>"I knew the other man too, but could not be sure of his name. He
was one of those who was with Stoutenburg that day at Ryswick, when
you so cleverly put a spoke in their abominable wheel. I knew them
both, I tell you!" the sick man insisted feverishly; "but I had the
good sense not to betray what I knew."</p>

<p>"But Stoutenburg did not know you?" Diogenes insisted.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did," the other replied, sagely nodding his head. "That
is why he ordered his menial to put a bullet into my back. The two
noble gentlemen questioned me first," he went on more coherently;
"then they plied me with wine. They wanted to make me drunk so as
to murder me at their leisure."</p>

<p>"They little know they, eh, thou bottomless barrel?" Diogenes
broke in with a laugh. "The cask hath not been fashioned yet that
would contain enough liquor even to quench thy thirst, what?"</p>

<p>"They plied me with wine," Pythagoras reiterated gravely; "and
then I pretended to get very drunk. For I soon remarked that the
more drunk they thought I was, the more freely they talked."</p>

<p>"Well, and what did they say?"</p>

<p>"They talked of De Berg crossing the Ijssel with ten thousand
men between Doesburg and Bronchorst; and of Isembourg coming up
from Kleve at the same time. I make no doubt that the design is to
seize Arnheim and Nijmegen. They talked a deal about Arnheim, which
they thought was scantily garrisoned and could easily be taken by
surprise and made to surrender. Having got these two cities, the
plan is to march across the Veluwe and offer battle to the
Stadtholder with a force vastly superior to his, if in the
meanwhile&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused. It seemed as if his voice, hoarse with fatigue, was
refusing him service. Diogenes reached for the potion which stood
on a small table beside the bed. The sick man made a wry face.</p>

<p>"Physic?" he ejaculated reproachfully. "From you, old compeer?
Times were when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There will be a time now," retorted the other gruffly, "when
you'll sink back into a raging fever, and will be babbling bibulous
nonsense if you don't do as you are told."</p>

<p>"I'll sink into a raging fever now," the sick man retorted
fretfully, "if I have not something potable to drink ere long."</p>

<p>"You'll drink this physic now, old compeer," Diogenes insisted,
and held the mug to his friend's parched lips, forcing him to
drink. "Then I'll see what can be done for you later on."</p>

<p>He schooled himself to patience and gentleness. At all costs
Pythagoras must complete his narrative. There was just something
more that he wished to say, apparently&mdash;something fateful and
of deadly import, but which for some obscure reason he found
difficult to put into words.</p>

<p>"Now then, old friend, make an effort!" Diogenes urged
insistently. "There is still something on your mind. What is
it?"</p>

<p>Pythagoras' round, beady eyes were rolling in their sockets. He
looked scared, like one who has gazed on what is preternatural and
weird.</p>

<p>"Stoutenburg has a project," he resumed after a while, and sank
his spent voice to the merest whisper. "Listen, my compeer; for the
very walls have ears. Bend yours to me. There! That's better," he
added, as Diogenes bent his long back until his ear was almost on a
level with the sick man's lips. "Stoutenburg hath a project, I tell
you. A damnable project, akin to the one which you caused to abort
three months ago."</p>

<p>"Assassination?" Diogenes queried curtly.</p>

<p>The sick man nodded.</p>

<p>"Do you know the details?"</p>

<p>"Alas, no! But it is aimed at the Stadtholder. What form it is
to take I know not, and they had evidently talked it all over
before. It seemed almost as if the other man&mdash;Stoutenburg's
friend&mdash;was horrified at the project. He tried to argue once
or twice, and once I heard him say quite distinctly: 'Not that,
Stoutenburg! Let us fight him like men; even kill him, like men
kill one another. But not like that.' But my Lord Stoutenburg only
laughed."</p>

<p>Diogenes was silent. He was deep in thought.</p>

<p>"You had no other indication?" he asked reflectively.</p>

<p>"No," Pythagoras replied. "All I saw was that my lord kept the
finger and thumb of his right hand in a hidden pocket of his
doublet, and once he said: 'The Prince of Poets' taught me to
manufacture them; and I supply them to him you know of, wherever he
can find an opportunity to come out here to me. He uses them at his
discretion. But we can judge by results! And then he laughed
because his friend appeared to shudder. I was puzzled," the sick
man went on wearily, "because of it all; and I marvelled who the
Prince of Poets might be, for I am no scholar and I thought that
perhaps&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are quite sure Stoutenburg said 'Prince of Poets'?"
Diogenes insisted, frowning. "Your ears must have been buzzing by
then."</p>

<p>"I am quite sure," Pythagoras asserted. "But I could not see
what he had in his hand."</p>

<p>Diogenes said nothing more, and silence fell upon the stately
chamber, the sombre panelling and heavy tapestries of which
effectually deadened every sound that came from the outside. Only
the monumental clock up against the wall ticked in a loud monotone.
The sick man, wearied with so much talking, fell back against the
pillows. The shades of evening were quickly gathering in now; the
corners of the room were indistinguishable in the gloom. Only the
bed-clothes still gleamed white in the uncertain light. From the
distant tower of St. Maria Kerk a bell chimed the hour of seven. A
few minutes went by. Anon there came a scratching at the door.</p>

<p>In response to Diogenes' loud "Enter!" the physician came in,
preceded by a serving-man carrying two lighted candles in massive
silver sconces.</p>

<p>"His Highness cannot wait any longer," the physician said, as
soon as he had perceived Diogenes, still sitting pensive on the
edge of the bed. "And as I have no anxiety about the patient now, I
will, by your leave, place him in your hands."</p>

<p>Diogenes appeared to wake as if out of a dream. He rose and
looked about him somewhat vaguely. The physician thought he must
have been asleep.</p>

<p>"Will you pay your respects to his Highness?" the latter said.
"I think he desires to see you."</p>

<p>Just for a moment Diogenes remained quite still. The physician
had approached the sick man, and was surveying him with critical
but obviously reassured attention. Socrates was again snoring
somewhere in a far corner of the room, and the serving-man, having
placed the candles on the table, stood waiting at the door.</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll to his Highness," Diogenes said abruptly; and,
beckoning to the serving-man to precede him, he strode out of the
room.</p>

<p>Outside on the landing he paused. Then, with a characteristic,
impulsive gesture, he suddenly beat his forehead with the palm of
his hand.</p>

<p>"The Prince of Poets, of course!" he murmured under his breath.
"Francis Borgia, the true descendant of his infamous ancestors!
Poison! And a slow one at that! Oh, the miserable assassins! Please
God, this knowledge hath not come too late!" he added with earnest
fervor.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later the Stadtholder was in possession of
all the facts as they had been revealed to Diogenes by his comrade
in arms.</p>

<p>"I seem fated," he said to Diogenes kindly, yet not without a
measure of bitterness, "to owe my safety to you and your brother
philosophers."</p>

<p>He was discussing De Berg's surprise plans on Arnheim and
Nijmegen. Of that abominable crime, hatched with the chance aid of
a poison-mongering Borgia, Diogenes had not as yet spoken one word.
Accustomed to swift decisions and prompt action, he had already
made up his mind that he would speak of it first to the English
physician, whose business it would be to see to it that the
insidious poison no longer reached the prince's lips, at the same
time enjoining the strictest secrecy in the matter; for it would
only be by rigid circumspection and ceaseless watching that the
assisin's accomplice could be brought to justice.</p>

<p>Mynheer Beresteyn and some of his older friends were in the room
with his Highness. They all put their grave heads together, for
there was no doubt that the Archduchess's advisers had planned an
invasion of the United Provinces on a grand scale.</p>

<p>"Arnheim is insufficiently defended, of that there's no doubt,"
the Stadtholder said. "It was my intention to reinforce all the
frontier cities, and to keep their garrisons up to the requisite
numbers. If I only had the strength&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused. The feeling of physical weakness consequent on
disease caused him endless and acute bitterness.</p>

<p>"It is not too late to send troops to Arnheim and to Nijmegen,"
Diogenes broke in, in his usual abrupt manner. "Three thousand in
one city, four thousand in the other would be sufficient, if your
Highness can act quickly."</p>

<p>"I cannot detach seven or eight thousand troops from my forces
at the present moment," the prince rejoined. "If Spinola were to
attack from the south I am only just strong enough to defend myself
as it is."</p>

<p>"Marquet is in Overijssel, I believe," urged the soldier. "He
hath three or four thousand troops. Let him push on to Arnheim to
reinforce the garrison."</p>

<p>"And De Keysere is at Wageningen," the prince broke in, fired,
despite himself, by the other's enthusiasm. "He hath three thousand
mercenaries from Switzerland and Germany."</p>

<p>"Excellent fighters and well-seasoned," Diogenes asserted. "And
trained under Maurice of Nassau, the first captain of this or any
epoch!"</p>

<p>"Ay!" sighed Maurice wearily. "But time is against us. Marquet
is at Vorden&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But Arnheim and Nijmegen can hold out for awhile," Diogenes
argued forcefully.</p>

<p>"And would hold out to the last man," Mynheer Beresteyn added,
"if they knew that succor would come in due course."</p>

<p>"'Tis only uncertainty that paralyses the endurance of a
garrison," Diogenes went on with firm emphasis. "Send to Arnheim
and to Nijmegen, your Highness! Bid them hold out against any
attack until you come with ten thousand troops to their aid. In the
meanwhile, send orders to Marquet and to De Keysere to advance
forthwith with reinforcements for these two garrisons. Then raise
your standard once more in Friesland, Drenthe, and Groningen. I'll
warrant you will have twenty thousand men there ready to fight once
more for liberty and for you!"</p>

<p>His sonorous voice rang clear and metallic in the small,
panelled room. His enthusiasm appeared almost like a living thing,
a tangible force that touched the hearts and minds of all the
solemn burghers here, causing their eyes to glow and their fists,
not yet wholly unskilled in the use of the sword, to clench with
inward excitement. The Stadtholder looked up at him with
undisguised admiration.</p>

<p>"Is it the English blood in you, man," he said with a smile,
"that makes you valorous in war and wise in counsel?"</p>

<p>Diogenes shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

<p>"I fought for your Highness before now," he rejoined, with a
quaint, self-deprecating laugh, "when I had nothing to lose save my
skin, and still less to gain. The English blood in me dearly loves
a fight, and all doth hate the Spaniard and all his tyrannies."</p>

<p>"Then I can reckon on you?" the prince riposted quickly.</p>

<p>"On me, your Highness?" the other exclaimed.</p>

<p>"On you, of course. With your mother's blood in your veins, the
United Provinces have a double claim on you. You have fought for us
before, as you say, unknown to us then, an obscure soldier of
fortune with nothing to lose and but little to gain. Join us now,
man, in the field and under the council tent. Get to horse
to-night. You will find Marquet at Vorden, on his way south from
Overijssel. Tell him to push on at once to Arnheim with all the
troops he hath at his command. From thence I would bid you go
straightway to De Keysere, who is at Wageningen, and order him to
reinforce Nijmegen forthwith with three thousand men, if we have
them. Tell both Marquet and De Keysere to fight and hold the towns.
I'll to their aid as soon as may be. Then, man, join my brother
Frederick, and help him to raise my standard in Gelderland and in
Overijssel, and rally ten thousand men to our cause. I feel that
success will attend our arms if we keep you by our side."</p>

<p>Maurice of Nassau had spoken with more vigor and verve than he
had shown for the past three months. Indeed, his deeply anxious
friends could not help but feel that the old fighting spirit of
this peerless commander had not wholly been undermined by disease.
Five pairs of eager eyes had scanned his features while he spoke;
five hearts beat in response to his enthusiasm. Now, when he had
finished speaking, Mynheer Beresteyn and the others turned their
expectant gaze upon the stranger who had been so signally honoured;
but he looked uncertain, gravely perturbed. In the flickering light
of the wax candles his face appeared haggard and drawn, and a set
line had crept around his ever-laughing lips.</p>

<p>"You seem to hesitate, my friend," the Stadtholder remarked,
with that tone of bitterness which had become habitual to him.
"Methought you said that the English blood in you dearly loved a
fight. But in truth, I had forgotten! You have other claims upon
you now&mdash;one, at least, which is paramount. An easy,
untroubled life awaits you. No wonder you hesitate to embark on so
perilous an adventure!" Then, as if loth to give up the thought
that was foremost in his mind, he added, with persuasive
insistence; "If you followed me, you'd have everything to
gain&mdash;nothing to lose save a sentimental pastime."</p>

<p>Just then Diogenes caught Mynheer Beresteyn's eyes fixed
steadily upon him. The old man who knew well enough what was going
on in that wayward, turbulent mind&mdash;the doubts, the fears, the
hideous, horrible disappointment.</p>

<p>Nothing to lose! Ye gods, at the hour when a whole life's
happiness not only beckoned insistently, but was actually there to
hand, like a bunch of ripe and luscious fruit, ready to drop into a
yearning hand! Here was the end of a vagabond life, here was love
and home and peace, and all to be given up as soon as found to the
equally insistent call of honour and of duty!</p>

<p>The others did not speak; perhaps they, too, understood. Men in
those days were used to stern sacrifices. They and there forebears
had given up their all so that their children's children might live
in freedom and security. They only marvelled if this stranger, with
the combative English blood in him, would give up what was so
infinitely dear to him&mdash;the exquisite wife to whom he had
plighted his troth but a few hours ago&mdash;and if he would fight
for them again as he had done in the past.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder remained moody and silent, and the close
atmosphere of the heavily curtained room seemed to become suddenly
still, hushed, as if expectant of the grave decision to come. The
wax candles burned quite steadily, with just a tiny fillet of smoke
rising up towards the low-raftered ceiling, almost like the incense
of silent prayer rising unwaveringly to God.</p>

<p>To many the silence appeared absolute, but not to the man who
stood in the midst of them all beside a table littered with papers
and documents, his slender hand&mdash;the hand of an idealist,
rendered firm and hard by action&mdash;resting lightly upon the
board. A tense look in his eyes. Through the silence he could hear
his beloved in the little room behind the heavy tapestry. He could
hear the soft, insidious sound of the quaint-toned virginal, and
her voice, tender and melancholy as the call of the bird to its
mate, humming the sweet refrain gently under her breath, with every
note she seemed to tear at his heart with an unendurable regret for
what might have been.</p>

<p>Oh, it had been such a perfect dream! Gilda and that stately
home over in England, and the ride through the night in pursuit of
happiness which had proved as elusive as Fata Morgana, as unreal as
the phantoms born in the mind of a rhapsodist.</p>

<p>Then the silence did, indeed, become absolute, even to him.
Gilda had ceased her song. Only his straining ears caught the sound
of her footsteps as she rose from the virginal, then moved swiftly
about the room.</p>

<p>"Well," the Stadtholder reiterated, after awhile, "which is it
to me, my friend? I start for Utrecht within the hour and if we are
to save Arnheim and Nijmegen, you should be on your way to Vorden
with the necessary moneys and my written orders to-night. Of
course, I cannot compel you," he added simply "The decision rests
with you, and if you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words died on his lips, and in an instant all eyes were
turned to that end of the room where a heavy portière divided it
from the room beyond. A faint rustling sound had come from there,
then the grating of metal rings upon the cornice-pole that held the
tapestry. The next moment Gilda appeared in the doorway, shadowy,
wraith-like in her sombre gown that melted into the gloom. Just her
small, white face and delicate hands stood out against the murky
background, and the gossamer lace at her throat and wrists.</p>

<p>For a moment she stood there, one hand still holding back the
heavy portière, quite still, taking in the company at a glance. A
sigh of longing and of renunciation came from an overburdened
heart, and was wafted up to the foot of Him who knows all and
understands all. Then Gilda allowed the tapestry to fall together
behind her, and she came quickly forward. In the other hand she was
holding, firmly clasped, her husband's heavy sword.</p>

<p>She came close to him, and then said simply, with an ingenuous
smile: "I thought you might wonder where you had left it. It was in
the other room. You will be wanting it, my dear lord, if you start
for Vorden within the hour."</p>

<p>With deft fingers she buckled the sword to his belt. This, in
truth, was her decision, and she had acted with scarce a moment's
hesitation, even whilst he marvelled how he could set to work to
break her heart by leaving her this night.</p>

<p>Now, when their glances met, they understood one another. The
power that lay within both their souls had met and, as it were,
clasped hands. They accepted one another's sacrifice. Hers, mayhap,
was the more complete of the two, because for her his absence would
mean weary waiting, the dull heartache so terrible to bear.</p>

<p>For the man, the wrench would be eased by action, danger and
hard fighting; for her there would be nothing to do but wait. But
she acquiesced. No one had seen the struggle which it had cost her,
over there in the little room, all alone with only the dumb
virginal and the dying light to see the tears of rebellion and of
agony which for one brief moment&mdash;for her an
eternity&mdash;had seared her eyes. By the time the full meaning of
what she had overheard from the other side of the portière had
entered into her brain, she had recovered full outward calm, and
had brought him his sword in token of her resolve.</p>

<p>Gilda Beresteyn came of a race that had learned to fight even
from its infancy. She had handled her father's sword at an age when
little maids are content with playthings. Now, when she made the
buckles of her husband's sword secure, she met his glance with
perfect serenity, and said simply and calmly:</p>

<p>"You will find me, as before, in the other room. I will be
waiting there to bid you farewell."</p>

<p>Then she glided out of the room, wraith-like, ethereal, as she
had come. And Diogenes woke as if out of a trance.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder jumped to his feet. "Then you're with us?" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"If your Highness hath need of me," the soldier replied.</p>

<p>"Have I not said so?" the prince retorted. "Henceforth, Sir
Percy Blakeney&mdash;for that is your name, is it
not?&mdash;accompanies us as our Master of the Camp wherever we
go!"</p>

<p>"Nay," the other replied quite firmly and without even a sigh of
regret this time, "my name is Diogenes, as it hath always been. It
is the nameless and homeless adventurer, the son of the poor Dutch
tramp, who once again places his sword at your Highness's disposal.
Sir Percy Blakeney was only a myth, a shade that hath already been
exorcized by the magic of your Highness's call, in the name of our
faith and of liberty."</p>

<p>"Frankly, man," the Stadtholder retorted with a smile, "I could
not picture you in the character of a placid and uxorious country
gentleman, watching with unruffled complacence the life and death
struggles of your friends."</p>

<p>"I should have waxed obese, your Highness," Diogenes assented
whimsically; "and the horror of it would have sent me to my
grave."</p>

<p>"Then, you inveterate mocker, are you ready to start?"</p>

<p>"Booted and spurred, your Highness, and a sword on my hip,"
replied the other lightly. "And my horse hath been waiting for me
these two hours past."</p>

<p>Already Maurice of Nassau was on his feet. He took the
sacrifice, the self-denial, as a matter of course; was unaware of
it, probably. Every other thought was completely merged in that of
the coming struggle&mdash;De Berg crossing the Ijssel, Spinola
threatening from the south, and victory beckoning once more.</p>

<p>The burghers crowded round him, speaking words of loyalty and of
encouragement. He responded with somewhat curt farewells. His
thoughts were no longer here; they were across the Veluwe with
Marquet and De Keysere; inside Arnheim and Nijmegen.</p>

<p>He kept Diogenes by his side, wrote out his orders in
sign-manual, discussed plans, possibilities with the man in whose
luck and resource he had unbounded belief.</p>

<p>It took time to get everything ready. There was the financial
question, too, for some of the troops were mercenaries, who would
be demanding their pay ere they engaged to start on a fresh
expedition. For this the aid of the loyal burghers had again to be
requisitioned. Arrangements had to be made for credits at Zutphen
and Arnheim.</p>

<p>This part of the great adventure the Stadtholder was willing to
leave in the hands of Mynheer Beresteyn and his friends. Money to
him was dross, save as a means of gaining his great ends. For the
nonce he was in a hurry to get away, to get back to his camp at
Utrecht, and to make ready for the coming fight.</p>

<p>Then at last there came a moment when everything appeared
settled. The messenger had his sealed orders, and the credit notes
and the read money upon his person. The Stadtholder was back in the
hall with his equerries around him, ready for departure, giving
brief, decisive orders such as soldiers love to hear.</p>

<p>But Diogenes did not follow him immediately, and Mynheer
Beresteyn remained behind with him. He was the only one who really
understood what the once careless and thoughtless adventurer felt
at this moment, in face of the inevitable farewell. It was an
understanding born in a staunch heart that had known both love and
sorrow.</p>

<p>Beresteyn had idolized his young wife, who had died leaving her
baby-girl in his arms. That deep affection the lonely widower had
thereupon transferred to his motherless daughter, had cherished and
guarded her as his most precious treasure, and had only consented
to relinquish her into the guardianship of another because he knew
that the other was worthy of the trust.</p>

<p>He knew also what hungering passion means; he knew the
bitterness of parting and of a burning disappointment with the
prospect of loneliness through the vista of years. But, with that
infinite tact which is the attribute of a self-less heart, he
offered no words of consolation or even of comment.</p>

<p>"I will leave you to bid farewell to Gilda alone," was all that
he said.</p>

<p>Diogenes nodded in assent. The most terrible moment of this
terrible hour was yet to come, for Gilda, having precipitated his
decision, was now waiting for the last kiss.</p>

<p class="cpb">6.</p>

<p>She was, in truth, waiting for him, submissive and composed.
What she had done, when she with her own act had mutely bidden him
to go, that she did not regret. She had done it not so much perhaps
from a sense of duty or of patriotism, but rather because she knew
that this course was the only one that he would never rue.</p>

<p>Hers was that perfect love that dwells on the other's happiness,
and not on its own. She knew that, though for the time being he
would find bliss and oblivion in her arms, he would soon repine in
inactivity whilst others fought for that which he held sublime.</p>

<p>So now, when he pushed aside the tapestry and once more stood
before her, with the lovelight in his eyes obscured by the shadow
of this coming parting, she met him without a tear. The next moment
he had her in his arms, and his hand rested lightly across her
eyes, lest they should perceived that his were full of tears.</p>

<p>For a long while he could not speak; then he drew her closer to
him and pressed his lips against hers, drinking in all the joy and
rapture which he might never taste again.</p>

<p>"What is it that hath happened, my lord?" she murmured. "I could
not hear everything, and did not wish to be caught prying. All that
I heard was that the Stadtholder needed you, and that in your heart
you knew that your place, whilst there was danger to our land, was
by his side, and not by mine."</p>

<p>"Your father will explain more fully, my beloved," he replied.
"You are right. The Stadtholder hath need of every willing sword.
This unfortunate land is gravely threatened. The Archduchess is
throwing the full force of her armies against the Netherlands. His
Highness thinks that I might help to save the United Provinces from
becoming once more the vassals of Spain. As you say, my place is on
this soil where I and my mother were born. I should be a coward
indeed were I to turn my back now on this land when danger is so
grave. So I am going, my beloved," he continued simply.</p>

<p>"To-night I go to Vorden on his Highness's business, thence on
to Wageningen. I shall go, taking your dear image in my heart, and
with your exquisite face before me always. For I love you with
every fibre of my being, every bone in my body and with every beat
of my heart. Try not to weep, my dear. I shall return one day soon
to take you in my arms, as I shall clasp your spirit only until
then. I shall return, doubt it not. Such love as ours was not
created to remain unfulfilled. Whatever may happen, believe and
trust in me, as I shall believe in you, and keep the remembrance of
me in your heart without sadness and without regret."</p>

<p>He spoke chiefly because he dared not trust to the insidiousness
of silence. He knew that she wept for the first time because of
him. Yet how could it be otherwise? And sorrow made her sacred.
When, overcome with grief, she lay half-swooning in his arms, he
picked her up quite tenderly and laid her back against the cushions
of the chair. Then, as she sat there, pale and wan-looking in the
uncertain light of the wax candles, with those exquisite hands of
hers lying motionless in her lap, he knelt down before her.</p>

<p>For a second or two he rested his head against those soft white
palms, fragrant as the petals of a lily. Then he rose, and, without
looking at her again, he walked firmly out of the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV&mdash;ADDER'S FORK</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Nicolaes Beresteyn accompanied his brother-in-law during the
first part of the journey. He had insisted on this, despite
Diogenes' preference for solitude. There was not much comradeship
lost between the two men. Though the events of that memorable New
Years Day, distant less than three months, were ostensibly
consigned to oblivion, nevertheless, the bitter humiliation which
Nicolaes had suffered at the hands of the then nameless soldier of
fortune still rankled in his heart. Since then so many things had
come to light which, to an impartial observer, more than explained
Gilda Beresteyn's love for the stranger, and Mynheer her father's
acquiescence in an union based on respect for so brave a man.</p>

<p>But Nicolaes had held aloof from the intimacy, and soon his own
courtship of the wealthy Kaatje gave him every reason for
withdrawing more and more from his own family circle. But to-night,
after the tempestuous close of what should have been a merely
conventional day, he sought Diogenes' company in a way he had never
done before.</p>

<p>"Like you," he said, "I am wearied and sick with all this
mummery. A couple of hours on the Veluwe will set me more in tune
with life."</p>

<p>Diogenes chaffed him not a little.</p>

<p>"The lovely Kaatje will pout," he suggested, "and rightly, too.
You have no excuse for absenting yourself from her side at this
hour."</p>

<p>"I'll come with you as far as Barneveld," Nicolaes insisted. "A
matter of less than a couple of hours' ride. It will do me good.
And Kaatje is still closeted with her garrulous mother."</p>

<p>"You think it will do her good to be kept waiting," Diogenes
retorted with good-natured sarcasm. "Well, come, if you have a
mind. But I'll not have your company further than Barneveld. I am
used to the Veluwe, and intend taking a short cut over the upland,
through which I would not care to take a companion less well
acquainted with the waste than I."</p>

<p>Thus it was decided. Already the Stadtholder had gone with his
numerous retinue, with his bodyguard and his pike-men and with his
equerries, and those of the wedding-party who had come in his train
from Utrecht, friends of Mynheer Beresteyn, who had ridden over for
the most part with wife or daughter pillioned behind them, and all
glad to avail themselves of the protection of his Highness's escort
against highway marauders, none too scarce in these parts.
Torch-bearers and linkmen completed the imposing cavalcade, for the
night would be moonless, and the tracks across the moorland none
too clearly defined.</p>

<p>Diogenes had waited with what patience he could muster until the
last of the numerous train had defiled under the Koppel-poort. Then
he, too, got to horse. Despite Socrates' many protestations, he was
not allowed to accompany him.</p>

<p>"You must look after Pythagoras," was Diogenes' final word on
the subject.</p>

<p>"'Tis the first time," the other answered moodily, "that you go
on such an adventure without us. Take care, comrade! The Veluwe is
wide and lonely. That swag-bellied oaf up there hath cause to rue
his solitary wanderings on that <i>verfloekte</i> waste."</p>

<p>"I'll be careful, old compeer," Diogenes retorted with a smile.
"But mine errand is not one on which I desire to draw unnecessary
attention, and I can remain best unperceived if I am alone. 'Tis no
adventure I am embarking on this night. Only a simple errand as far
as Vorden, a matter of ten leagues at most.</p>

<p>"And the whole of the <i>verdommte</i> Veluwe to traverse at
dead of night!" the other muttered sullenly.</p>

<p>"I know every corner of it," Diogenes rejoined impatiently. "And
it will not be the first time that I travel on it alone."</p>

<p>Thus Socrates was left grumbling, and anon Diogenes, accompanied
by Nicolaes Beresteyn, started on his way.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>At first the two men spoke little. The air was still cold and
very humid, and the thaw was persisting. The horses stepped out
briskly on the soft, sandy earth.</p>

<p>The distance between Amersfoort and Barneveld is but a couple of
leagues. Within the hour the lights of the little city could be
seen gleaming ahead. After a while Nicolaes Beresteyn became more
loquacious, talked quite freely of the past.</p>

<p>"My father no longer trusts me," he said, with ill-concealed
bitterness. "Did you see how he shut me out of the
council-chamber?"</p>

<p>"Yet the Stadtholder himself told you everything that occurred
subsequently," Diogenes retorted kindly, "including his own plans
and mine errand at this hour. I think that your conscience troubles
you unnecessarily, and you see a deliberate intention in every
simple act."</p>

<p>"And if he did, you could scarce blame him. 'Tis only in the
future you can prove your true worth. And methinks," he added, more
seriously than he was usually wont to speak, "that you will have
occasion to do this very soon."</p>

<p>"In the meanwhile, here's Barneveld ahead of us," Nicolaes
rejoined, with a quick, indefinable sigh, and giving a sudden turn
to the conversation. "I'll see you across the city, then return to
the bosom of my family, there to live in uxorious idleness, whilst
you, a stranger, are entrusted with the destinies of our land. A
poor outlook for a man who is young and a patriot, you'll own."</p>

<p>To this Diogenes thought it best to make no reply. He knew well
enough that the mistrust of which Nicolaes accused his father was a
very real thing, and that it was indeed only time that would soften
the proud burgher's heart toward his only son. It was not likely
that one who but a brief while ago had conspired against the
Stadtholder's life with that abominable Stoutenburg could be
admitted readily into the councils of the very man whom he had
plotted to assassinate. With every desire to forgive, it was but
natural that Mynheer Beresteyn should fail entirely to forget.</p>

<p>No more, however, was said upon the subject now, and Nicolaes
soon relapsed into that sullen mood which had of late become
habitual to him. Thus Diogenes was glad enough to be rid of his
company. At Barneveld he obtained a fresh horse, left his own in
charge of a man known to him, with orders to ride it quietly on the
morrow as far as Wageningen, where he himself would pick it up a
couple of days later. His journey would now lie due east to
Zutphen. There he meant to make a halt of a few hours, and thence
proceed to Vorden, where Marquet was in camp, with four thousand
seasoned troops, trained under Mansfeld, and rested now since the
campaign in Groningen.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder's orders were that the general proceed, at once
to Arnheim, ere the forces of the Archduchess had time to cross the
Ijssel, and to cut off all access to so important a city.</p>

<p>From Vorden to Wageningen, which lies due south form Barneveld,
the journey would be a long one, and, with De Berg's army so near,
might even prove perilous. But De Keysere was at Wageningen, with
three thousand troops and some artillery. His help would be of
immense service to Nijmegen if the latter city, too, were to be
attacked.</p>

<p>"How will you journey from Vorden to Wageningen?" Nicolaes asked
Diogenes in the end. "You will have to avoid the Ijssel."</p>

<p>"I'll cut across to Lang Soeren," the other replied; "and thence
go to Ede."</p>

<p>"There's scarce a track on the Veluwe just there," the other
urged.</p>

<p>"Such as there is, I know," Diogenes retorted curtly. "And I
must trust to luck."</p>

<p>They had brought their horses to a halt about a quarter of a
league outside Barneveld, where the two men decided to part. The
stretch of the great waste, with its undulating, barren hills, and
narrow, scarce visible tracks, lay straight out before them.
Diogenes was sniffing the frosty air out toward the east, where lay
Vorden, and whence there came to his nostrils the sharp tang of the
breeze, that cut like a knife. The thaw which had held sway in the
cities and on the low-lying lands had been vanquished ere it
reached the arid upland. The snow upon the Veluwe lay as even and
as pure as before. Above, a canopy of stars seemed but a
diamond-studded veil of mysterious indigo, stretched over a world
of light, which it failed altogether to dim. The silence and
desolation were absolute; but not so the darkness. To the keen eye
of the adventurer, accustomed to loneliness, the vast stretches of
open country and limitless horizons, there was no such thing as
absolute darkness. He could perceive the slightest accidental upon
the smooth carpet of snow, noted every tiny mound that marked a
clump of rough shrub or grass, and every footmark of beast or bird,
mere flecks of blue upon the virgin pall.</p>

<p>"Such track as there is, I know," he had carelessly asserted
awhile ago, in response to a warning from Nicolaes. And now,
without an instant's hesitation, and tossing to the other a last
curt word of farewell, he gave his horse a slight taste of the
spur, and soon became a mere speck upon the illimitable waste.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>It was close on midnight when, weary, saddle-sore, his boots
covered in half-melted snow, Mynheer Nicolaes Beresteyn demanded
admittance into his native city.</p>

<p>At first the guard at the Koppel-poort, roused from his
slumbers, refused to recognize in the belated traveler the
bridegroom of a few hours ago. Had anyone ever heard, I ask you, of
a bridegroom absenting himself on the very night of his nuptial
until so late an hour? And then returning in a mood that was so
irascible and inconsequent that the sergeant in command of the gate
was on the point of ordering his detention in the guard-room,
pending investigation and the orders of the burgomaster, whose
decision on such points was final? But since the burgomaster, whose
decision on such points was final? But since the burgomaster
happened to be Mynheer Beresteyn, and as the weary and pugnacious
traveler did, in truth, appear to be his only son&mdash;why, it was
perhaps best on the whole to take the matter as a joke, and not to
say too much about it. The sergeant did, indeed, as Nicolaes was
finally allowed to ride over the bridge, essay one or two of the
most time-honoured witticisms at the expense of the belated
bridegroom; but Mynheer Nicolaes was clearly in no mood for chaff,
and when he had passed by, the sergeant and one or two of the men,
who had witnessed his strangely sullen mood, shook their heads in
ominous prognostication of sundry matrimonial difficulties to
come.</p>

<p>The house on the quay, plainly visible from the Koppel-poort,
was dark enough to suggest that every one of its inmates was
already abed. Nicolaes, however, did not ride up to the front door;
but, after he had crossed the bridge, he went straight on through
one or two narrow streets which lay at the back of his home until
he reached the corner of the Korte Gracht, which, again, abuts on
the quay. Thus he had gone round in a semicircle, in obvious
avoidance of the paternal house, and now he brought his horse to a
halt outside a tall and narrow door which was surmounted by a
lanthorn let into the wall. A painted sign which hung from an iron
bracket above the door indicated to the passing wayfarer that the
place was one where rider and horse could find food and
shelter.</p>

<p>Nicolaes dismounted, and going up to the door, he knocked
against it with the point of his foot. This he had to do several
times before the welcome sound of someone moving inside the house
came to his ear. A moment or two later the door was opened
cautiously. A man appeared on the threshold, wrapped in a
night-robe and still wearing a night-bonnet on his head.</p>

<p>"Is that you, mynheer?" he queried drowsily.</p>

<p>"Who else should it be, you loon?" Nicolaes replied irritably.
"Here's your horse," he added, and without waiting for further
commend or protest from the unfortunate landlord thus roused from
his slumbers, he proceeded to tether the animal by the reins to one
of the iron rings in the wall.</p>

<p>"It is so late, mynheer," the man protested dolefully; and so
cold. Will you not take the horse round to the stable yourself? It
is but a step to the right, and there's the gate&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is late, as you say, and cold," Nicolaes retorted curtly.
"And when I paid you so liberally for the horse, I did not bargain
to take service with you as ostler in the middle of the night."</p>

<p>"But, mynheer&mdash;" urged the landlord, still protesting.</p>

<p>But Nicolaes did not listen. In faith, he had ceased to hear,
for already he was striding rapidly down the Korte Gracht, and the
next moment was back on the quay. A few steps brought him to the
door of his father's house. Here he paused for a moment ere he
mounted the stone steps that led up to the massive front door,
stamped his feet so as to shake the melted snow from his boots, and
with a few quick touches tried to re-establish some semblance of
order in his clothes. Indeed, when presently he rapped vigorously
with the iron knocker against the door, he looked no longer like a
wearied and querulous traveler, but rather like a man just returned
from a short and pleasant ride.</p>

<p>To his astonishment it was Maria, his sister Gilda's faithful
tire-woman, who opened the door for him. She anticipated his very
first query by a curt:</p>

<p>"Everyone is abed. The <i>jongejuffrouw</i> alone chose to wait
for you, and I could not let her wait alone."</p>

<p>Nicolaes uttered an angry exclamation.</p>

<p>"Tell my sister to go to bed, too," he commanded briefly. "I'll
go to my rooms at once, as it is so late."</p>

<p>Maria made no audible reply. She mumbled something about
"Shameful conduct!" and "Wedding-night!" But Nicolaes paid no heed,
strode quickly across the hall, and ran swiftly up the stairs.</p>

<p>But on the landing he came abruptly to a halt. He had almost
fallen against his sister Gilda, who stood there waiting for
him.</p>

<p>Behind her, a little way down the passage, a door stood ajar,
and through it there came a narrow fillet of light. At sight of
him, and before he could utter a sound, she put a finger to her
lip, then let the way along the passage. The door which stood ajar
was the one which gave on her own room. She went in, and he
followed her, his heart beating with something like shame or
fear.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she whispered, and gently closed the door behind him.
"Make no noise!" Kaatje has at last sobbed herself to sleep. She
hath been put to bed in her mother's room. "'Twere a shame to
disturb her." Then, as Nicolaes muttered something that sounded
very like a curse, the girl added reproachfully: "Poor Kaatje! You
have shown very little ardour toward her, Klaas."</p>

<p>"I lost my way in the dark," he answered. "I had no thought it
could be so late."</p>

<p>Just then the tower clock of St. Maria Kerk chimed the midnight
hour.</p>

<p>Gilda hazarded timidly: "You should not have thought of
accompanying my lord. He was ready to start out alone; and your
place, Klaas, was beside your wife!"</p>

<p>"Are you going to lecture me about my duty, Gilda?" he said
irritably. "You must not think that because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think nothing," she broke in simply, "save that Kaatje wept
when the evening wore on and you did not return; and that the more
she wept the greater was our father's anger against you."</p>

<p>"He knew that I meant to accompany your husband a part of the
way," Nicolaes retorted. "In truth, had he done me the justice to
read my thoughts, he himself would have bade me go."</p>

<p>"It was kind of you," she rejoined somewhat coolly, to be
concerned as to my lord's safety. But I can assure you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Twas not concern for <i>his</i> safety," he broke in gruffly,
"that caused me to accompany him to-night."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>But he gave no reply, but his lip and turned away from her, with
the air of one who fears that he hath said too much and cares not
to be questioned again.</p>

<p>"I'd best go now," he said abruptly.</p>

<p>He looked around for his gloves, which he had thrown down upon
the table. His manner seemed so strange that Gilda was suddenly
conscious of a nameless kind of fear; the sort of premonition that
comes to highly sensitive natures, at times when hitherto
unsuspected danger suddenly looms upon the cloudless sky of life.
She forced him to return her searching glance.</p>

<p>"You are hiding something from me, Klaas," she said
determinedly. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"I?" he riposted, feigning surprise. "Hiding something? Why
should I have something to hide?"</p>

<p>"That I know not," she replied. "But there was some hidden
meaning in your words just now when you said that 'twas not concern
for my lord's safety that caused you to accompany him this night.
What, then, was it?" she insisted, seeing that he remained silent,
even though he met her gaze with a look that appeared both fearful
and pitying.</p>

<p>She had her back to the door now, looked like some timid
creature brought to bay by a cruel and hitherto unsuspected
enemy.</p>

<p>"You must not ask me for my meaning, Gilda," Nicolaes said at
last. "There are things which concern men only, and with which
women should have no part."</p>

<p>His tone of ill-concealed compassion stung her like a cut from a
whip across the face.</p>

<p>"There is nothing that concerns my lord," she retorted proudly,
"in which he would not desire me to bear my part."</p>

<p>"Then let him tell you himself."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>She threw the question at him like a challenge, stepped up to
him and seized him by the wrist&mdash;no longer a timid creature at
bay. But a strong, determined woman, who feels in some mysterious
way that the man whom she loves is being attacked, and who is
prepared, with every known and unknown weapon almighty love can
suggest, to defend him, his life or his honour, or both.</p>

<p>"You are not going out of this room, Klaas, until you have
explained!" she said with unquestionable determination. "What is it
that my lord should tell me himself?"</p>

<p>"Why he, newly wed and a stranger, was so determined on this,
his wedding night, to carry the Stadtholder's message across the
Veluwe."</p>

<p>Nicolaes spoke abruptly, almost fiercely now, as if wearied of
this wrangling, and burdened with a secret he could no longer hold.
But she did not at first understand his meaning.</p>

<p>"I do not understand what you mean," she murmured vaguely, a
perplexed frown between her eyes.</p>

<p>"There were plenty there eager and willing to go," Nicolaes went
on roughly. "Nay, the errand was not in itself perilous. Speed was
required, yes; and a sound knowledge of the country. But a dozen
men at least who were in this house to-day know the Veluwe as well
as this stranger, and any good horse would cover the ground fast
enough. But he wanted to go&mdash;he, this man whom none of us
know, who was married this day, and whose bride had the first call
on his attention. He insisted with the Stadtholder, and he
went&mdash;And I went with him; would have gone all the way if he
had not forced me to go back. Why did he wish to go, Gilda? Why did
he leave you deliberately this night? Think! Think! And why did he
insist on going alone, with not even one of those besotted boon
companions of his to share in his adventure? A message to
Marquet&mdash;my God!" he added with a sneer. "A message to the
Archduchess, more like, to cross the Ijssel ere it be too
late!"</p>

<p>"You devil!"</p>

<p>She hissed out the words through set lips and teeth clenched in
an access of fierce and overwhelming passion. And before he could
recover himself, before he could guess her purpose, she had seized
his heavy, leathern gloves, which were lying on the table, and
struck him with them full in the face. He staggered, and put his
hand up to his eyes.</p>

<p>"Go!" she commanded briefly.</p>

<p>He tried to laugh the situation off, said almost flippantly:</p>

<p>"I'll punish you for this, you young vixen!"</p>

<p>But she did not move, and her glance seemed to freeze the words
upon his lips.</p>

<p>"Go!" she commanded once more.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I understand your indignation, Gilda. Nay, I honour it. But
remember my warning! Your stranger lord," he went on with slow and
deliberate emphasis, "will be returning anon to the Stadtholder's
camp, a courted and honoured man; but 'tis the armies of the
Archduchess who will have crossed the Ijssel by then, whilst the
orders to Marquet will have reached that commander too late."</p>

<p>Then he turned on his heel and went out of the room, and anon
Gilda heard his footstep resounding along the passage. She listened
until she heard the opening and closing of a distant door, after
which she sighed and murmured, "Poor Kaatje!" That was all; but
there was a world of meaning in the sorrowful compassion wherewith
she said those words.</p>

<p>Then she raised her left hand, round the third finger of which
glittered a plain gold ring. The ring she pressed long and
lingeringly against her lips, and in her heart she prayed, "God
guard you, my dear lord!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V&mdash;A RACE FOR LIFE</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>As for Diogenes, he reached Zutphen in the small hours of the
morning, and after a few hours' rest pushed on to Vorden at dawn.
He himself would have deprecated any suggestion of making of this
journey across the Veluwe a romantic adventure. The upland, under
its covering of snow, held neither terrors nor secrets for him. The
wind, the stars, an unerring instinct and sound knowledge of the
scarce visible tracks, guided him across the arid waste. A real
child of the open, he had less difficulty in finding his way across
such a God-forsaken wild than he would through the intricate
streets of a city.</p>

<p>Messire Marquet, encamped outside Vorden, welcomed the
Stadtholder's messenger effusively. His troops, for the most part
composed of mercenaries from Germany, were getting restive in
idleness; once or twice they had used threats when demanding their
pay. Diogenes, bringing both money and the prospect of a fight, was
doubly welcome. His stay at the camp was brief. By late morning he
was once more on his way, with the intention of re-crossing the
Ijssel at Dieren and of reaching Wageningen before dark. He had but
half a dozen leagues to cover, and eight hours of daylight wherein
to do it. Weather, too, and circumstances favored him. The thaw,
which had been so completely vanquished upon the upland, had
remained sole monarch in the plain. The air was mild and intensely
humid. A dense sea-fog lay over the river and the surrounding
marshes. The numerous little tributaries of the Ijssel and the
intervening canals and ditches were already free from ice, and as
Diogenes put his horse to an easy gallop in the direction of the
river, the animal sank fetlock deep in mud.</p>

<p>The road was solitary, and, as far as the eye could reach
through the mist, seemed entirely deserted. The countryside here
had the desolate appearance peculiar to districts that have been
fought over. The few thatched cottages, which from time to time
loomed out of the mist, still bore the marks of passing fire and
sword; the trees were truncated and sparse, the marshland was
riddled with the scars of ceaseless tramping of men, of wagons, and
of beasts. The inevitable windmills, gaunt-looking and ghost-like
through the humid atmosphere, appeared neglected and forlorn.</p>

<p>But the solitary rider had no eyes for landscape just now. He
could have wished for a clearer day, for it was impossible even for
his keen eyes to see what was going on behind that impenetrable
wall of fog. If Pythagoras' ears had not played him false, De Berg
was there, not very far away, waiting to cross the Ijssel when
opportunity arose.</p>

<p>Thanks to that faithful hypertrophied loon, the ambitious
designs of the Archduchess could still be frustrated. De Berg's
armies were still on the right bank of the Ijssel, and if Marquet
got his men on the move by midday, as he had promised he would do,
the crossing of the enemy troops would become difficult, mayhap
impossible.</p>

<p>These were pleasing thoughts for the man on whose speed and
resource these important plans depended. All that he chafed against
was the imperative slowness of his progress, as the mist enveloped
him more closely the nearer he got to the river. But withal it
protected him, too, hid him mayhap from the prying eyes of vedettes
on the watch. Already, judging by certain landmarks that met him on
the way, Brummen was half a league behind him on his right, Hengles
far away on the left, and Dieren not more than another league on
ahead. For the last quarter of an hour he had heard from time to
time the heavy booming sound, akin to the reverberation of distant
cannonade, which came from the breaking and cracking of the ice as
it drifted downstream. He put his horse to slow trot, as he pried
through the mist for the first indication of a short cut he knew
of, which would take him to the river bank in less than half an
hour.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>The next moment he had spied the narrow track and set his horse
to follow it; when suddenly, out of the mist, there came a loud
report, and Diogenes heard the whistle of a bullet close to his
ear. It almost grazed his shoulder. Without an instant's pause,
without turning to look whence had come this unexpected greeting,
he set spurs to his horse and galloped at breakneck speed toward
the river. Over fields and ditches; no thought of prudence now,
only of speed! Mud and water flew out in all directions under the
horse's frantic gallopade, the plucky beast sinking at times almost
to his knees in the marshy ground. A few minutes later&mdash;five,
perhaps&mdash;Diogenes heard the sound of many hoofs behind him,
obviously in pursuit. He turned to look this time, and through the
mist vaguely discerned some three or four cavaliers, who were
distant from him then less than two hundred yards. So far, so good!
The Ijssel was close by now, and if, when he reached the banks, he
turned off in the direction of the stream, he could easily reach
the ford on this side of Brummen and get across&mdash;on foot, if
need be, if his horse proved an obstacle to rapid progress.</p>

<p>A few more minutes now and the river was in sight, with, far
away on the opposite bank, Brummen, nestling at the foot of the
rising ground, the gate of the Veluwe. With renewed vigor the rider
sped along, his blood whipped up by the chase, his whole body
exhilarated by this sensation of danger and of one of those
sportive races for life for which three months of idleness and
luxury had given him a hitherto unsuspected longing.</p>

<p>Ah, there was the shore at last, the group of three windmills
close to the bank, an unmistakable landmark. Here, too, within two
hundred paces on ahead, was the ford, which no amount of drifting
ice would cause the daring adventurer to miss. Already he was
within a few yards of the low-lying bank, searching the approach to
the ford with eyes now doubly keen, when, with staggering
suddenness, another cavalier appeared, straight in front of him
this time, and barring the way to the river-brink.</p>

<p>No time to note his face; just a second wherein to decide what
had best be done, not only to save his own life, but also the
message which he must carry to Wageningen, at whatever cost. Then
the cavalier turned for one brief second in his saddle, to call to
some companions as yet unseen. A brief second, did I say? 'Twas but
a fraction. The next moment Diogenes had whipped out a pistol from
his saddlebow, and with a steady hand fired at his foe. The
cavalier reeled in his saddle and fell, just as half a dozen others
issued with a shout from out the mist, and those in pursuit put
fresh spurs to their mounts.</p>

<p>It had been madness to attempt the ford now. The young soldier,
sore-pressed, might in truth have sold his life dearly, but with
it, too, he would have sold Nijmegen and the possible success of
the Stadtholder's plans. Ofttimes before, in the course of his
adventurous life, he had been in as tight a place, where life and
death hung quite evenly in the scales of Fate; but never before had
he been quite so anxious to flee. He could not trust the valor of
his sword, his own well-nigh unexampled skill in a fight against
odds that would have made the bravest pause. No! It meant running
away, away as fast as his horse would take him, and faster if the
poor brute gave out. A short gallop along the bank, the cavalier
behind him warming to the pursuit; keeping closer and closer to the
low-lying bank, till the horse began to flounder in what was sheer
morass.</p>

<p>The ford now lay well behind him. The waters of the Ijssel,
tossed for awhile upon the shallows, flowed with increased
swiftness here. Huge ice-blocks floated seaward upon the heaving
bosom of the stream. The foremost of the pursuing cavaliers was
then less than fifty yards behind, and more than one bullet had
whizzed past the fleeing rider, one of them piercing his hat, the
other grazing his thigh, but none doing him serious injury. Already
the rallying cry of the pursuers had turned to one of triumph as
the distance lessened between them and their quarry, when, with a
sudden jerk of the reins, Diogenes plunged headlong into the
river.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>The Ijssel at this point is close on a quarter of a mile wide,
her current is no longer sluggish, whilst the drifting ice-blocks
constitute a peril which had to be boldly faced. But the mist,
which hung thickly over the river, was the daring adventurer's most
faithful ally.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, Diogenes' first thought, when his horse,
finally losing its foothold upon the rapidly shelving bank, started
to swim, was of Gilda, and of that ride which he had promised
himself, with her dear arms clinging around him, her fair hair,
tossed by the wind, brushing against his face. It was one of those
sweet, sad visions which some mocking sprite seems to conjure up at
moments such as this when life&mdash;ay, and honour too!&mdash;are
trembling in the balance. Sad and swift! It vanished almost as
quickly as it came, giving place to thoughts of De Keysere, still
unsuspecting at Wageningen, and of Marquet, who haply had already
started. Was there a trap waiting for him, too? Was this just an
outpost of De Berg's armies; and had they indeed been mysteriously
warned by traitor or spy, as Diogenes more than half suspected?</p>

<p>But what was the use of speculating? Indeed, every conjecture
was futile, for this now was a supreme struggle&mdash;a tussle with
Death, who was watching, uncertain whence and how he would strike.
For the moment the adventurer was at grips with the flood and with
the ice, guiding his horse as best he could toward mid-stream,
where the current kept the threatening floes at bay. His pursuers
had come to a halt upon the bank. Indeed, not one of them had the
mind to follow his quarry on this perilous adventure. They stood
there, some half-dozen of them, holding council, their eyes peering
through the mist in search of the one black speck&mdash;horse and
rider&mdash;now appearing clearly silhouetted against the silvery
water, now vanishing again under cover of the floes. Then one of
them raised his musket and took steady aim at the valiant swimmer,
who had succeeded at last in reaching mid-stream.</p>

<p>The bullet whizzed through the mist. Diogenes' horse, hit
through the neck, plunged and reared, pawed the waters wildly for a
moment, then gave that heart-rending scream which is so harrowing
to the ears of all animal-lovers. But already the rider had his
feet clear of the stirrups, and as the waters finally swept over
the head of the stricken beast, he slid out of the saddle and
struck out for the opposite shore.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI&mdash;A NEST OF
SCORPIONS</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Of the extraordinary events which threatened to make March 21,
1624, one of the most momentous dates in the history of the
Netherlands we have not much in the way of detail. The broad facts
we know chiefly through Van Aitzema's ponderous and minute "Saken
v. Staet," whilst De Voocht was, of course, a friend of the
Beresteyn family, and, as I understand it, was present in the house
at Amersfoort when the terrible catastrophe was so auspiciously and
mysteriously averted.</p>

<p>The one thing, however, which neither he nor Van Aitzema have
made quite clear is the motive which prompted the Stadtholder to go
to Amersfoort in person. He had quite a number of knights and
gentlemen around him whom he could have fully trusted to take even
so portentous a message and such explicit orders as he desired to
send. De Voocht, indeed, suggests that it was Nicolaes Beresteyn
who persuaded him, urging the obstinacy of his father, the
burgomaster, and of the burghers of the city, who had steadily
opposed the Stadtholder's wishes when he&mdash;Nicolaes&mdash;had
been sent to convey them.</p>

<p>Nicolaes Beresteyn had joined his sovereign lord at the camp at
Utrecht a couple of days after his wedding. Wearied of sentimental
dalliance with the stolid Kaatje, he was glad enough that his duty
demanded his presence in camp rather than in the vicinity of his
young wife's apron-strings.</p>

<p>It was but natural that, when the Stadtholder desired to send
orders to Amersfoort, he should do so through the intermediary of
Nicolaes. But on that day, which was March 20, the young man
returned, vowing that these were not being obeyed; not a matter of
disloyalty, of course, just of tenacity. Civic dignitaries,
conscious of their worth and of the sacrifices they had made in the
common cause, were wont to wax obstinate where the affairs of their
own cities were concerned. But, on the other hand, resistance to
his will had invariably the effect of rousing the Stadtholder's
arbitrary temper to a point of unreasoning anger. Olden Barneveldt
had expiated his contumacy on the scaffold, and I doubt not that,
when Nicolaes returned from Amersfoort that evening and delivered
his report, the fate of even so trusted a councillor as Mynheer
Beresteyn hung for awhile in the balance.</p>

<p>That the matter was one of supreme importance it were impossible
to doubt. Maurice of Nassau would not lightly have left his camp at
Utrecht that day. The forces of the Archduchess Isabella, who,
under the leadership of De Berg and of Isembourg, were threatening
Gelderland from two sides, had succeeded on the one part in
crossing the Ijssel. His own army was threatened by that of Spinola
from the south. On the other hand, the messenger whom he had sent
across the Veluwe to urge Marquet and De Keysere to concentrate
inside Arnheim and Nijmegen had not yet returned. Nevertheless, he
chose, by this suddenly planned excursion to Amersfoort, to expose
his valuable person to serious danger; a fact which subsequent
events proved only too conclusively.</p>

<p>Nicolaes Beresteyn was sent back at dawn the following morning
to warn the burgomaster of the Stadtholder's coming, and enjoining
the strictest secrecy. The young man was under orders to say
nothing beyond that fact. When closely questioned, however, by his
father and also by others, he did admit that fugitives from Ede had
succeeded in reaching the camp.</p>

<p>Fugitives from Ede? What did that mean? Why should there be
fugitives from Ede, when the armies of the Archduchess were so many
leagues away?</p>

<p>Nicolaes Beresteyn shrugged his shoulders. "The Stadtholder will
explain," was all that he said.</p>

<p>He appeared impatient and consequential, made them all feel that
he could say more if he cared. He had been kept out of the prince's
councils while he was under the paternal room, but now he had
gained a place in the camp which had always been his by right.
These solemn burghers&mdash;important enough within the purlieus of
their own city&mdash;had become insignificant, mere civilians, now
that the fate of the country rested upon those who were young
enough to bear arms.</p>

<p>Nicolaes tried to meet his sister's glance.</p>

<p>Her indifference toward him galled his sense of importance, and
he wished her to know that he neither repented nor was ashamed of
what he had said the other night. Anon, when he had succeeded in
forcing her eyes to meet his, he gave her a look charged with a
mocking challenge. Up to this hour, she had said nothing to her
father; now Nicolaes appeared to dare her to speak. But his sneers
had not the power to disturb her sublime trust in the man she
loved. That some mystery did cling to his journey across the Veluwe
she could no longer doubt; but her fears upon the subject dwelt
solely on any personal danger that might have overtaken him.</p>

<p>As for her father and his friends, they had apparently decided
to possess their souls in patience. There was, indeed, nothing to
do but to wait the Stadtholder's arrival, and in the meanwhile to
try and hold those fears in check which had been aroused by the
ominous words, "Fugitives from Ede."</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder arrived in the course of the morning. Mynheer
Beresteyn did not receive him on the doorstep, as he would have
done had the visit been an open one. As it was, the passers-by on
the busy quay did not bestow more than a passing glance on the
plainly clad cavalier who swung himself out of the saddle outside
the burgomaster's house. A message from the camp, probably, they
thought. Mynheer Nicolaes had been backward and forward from
Utrecht several times these past two or three days. The burgomaster
awaited his exalted guest in the hall. His attitude and the
expression of his face were alike pregnant with eager questionings.
The Stadtholder gave curt acknowledgement to the greetings of
Mynheer Beresteyn, of his family, and of his friends, and then
strode deliberately into the banqueting-hall.</p>

<p>It looked vast and deserted at this early hour of a winter's
morning. Nothing of the animation, the riotous gaiety of that day,
less that a week ago, seemed to linger in its sombre, panelled
walls. The daïs upon which the brides and bridegrooms and the
wedding party had sat, and which had crowned so brilliant a
spectacle, had been removed, and the magnificent gold and silver
plate, the fine linens and priceless crystals been carefully stowed
away. Serving-men and sweepers were busy airing and dusting the
room when the door was thrown open, and His Highness came in,
ushered in by his host. They fled at sight of these great
gentlemen, like so many rabbits into carefully hidden burrows.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder went up to the long centre table and faced
Mynheer Beresteyn and those who had come in with him&mdash;the
members of his family and half a dozen burghers, men of importance
in the little city. Every one could see that His Highness's anger
was bitter against them all. "And so, mynheer," he began curtly,
and in tones of marked irritation, and addressing himself more
particularly to the burgomaster, "you have thought fit to defy my
orders."</p>

<p>"Your Highness!" protested Mynheer Beresteyn.</p>

<p>"Yet they were clear enough," the Stadtholder went on, not
heeding the interruption. "Or did your son Nicolaes fail to
explain?"</p>

<p>"He told us, your Highness, that it was feared the armies of the
Archduchess had crossed the Ijssel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The armies of the Archduchess crossed the Ijssel three days
ago," Maurice of Nassau broke in impatiently. "Since then they have
overrun Gelderland and occupied Ede, putting that city to fire and
sword."</p>

<p>There came a sound like the catching of breath, the rise of a
gasp of horror and anguish in every one's throat. But it was
quickly suppressed, and His Highness was listened to in silence
until the end. Even now, when he paused, no one spoke. All eyes
were cast to the ground in self-centered meditation. The whole
thing had come as a thunderbolt out of a cloudless sky. Ede had
always seemed so safe, so remote. A little city which led nowhere
save to the Zuyder Zee, and in the very heart of the United
Provinces. What could be the motive of the Archduchess's commanders
to adventure thus far into a country which was so universally
hostile to them, even to the most miserable peasant, who would
pollute every well and stream rather than see the enemy overrun the
land?</p>

<p>But all these men&mdash;ay, and the women, too&mdash;had seen so
much, suffered so much; fire and sword were such familiar dangers
before their eyes, that for them the time had gone when sighs and
lamentations would ease their overburdened hearts. They had learned
to receive every fresh blow from God's hands in silence, but with
determination to fight on, to fight again and to the death once
more, if need be, for their liberties, their rights, and the
welfare of their children. It was indeed Mynheer Beresteyn who took
the next words out of the Stadtholder's mouth.</p>

<p>"Then Amersfoort, too, is threatened?" he said simply.</p>

<p>The prince nodded.</p>

<p>"Think you," he retorted, "that I would have ordered the
evacuation of the town had there not been imperative necessity for
such a course? Now, you may pray God that your wilful disobedience
hath not placed your city in jeopardy."</p>

<p>"'Twas but yesterday we had the order," one of the burghers
urged. "And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'Twas yesterday it should have been obeyed," the Stadtholder
broke in roughly. "You would then have saved me a perilous journey,
for the country already is infested with spies and vedettes,
outposts of the Spanish armies."</p>

<p>"We are all ready to guard your Highness with our lives," the
burgomaster said quietly.</p>

<p>"'Tis your wits I want, mynheer," the prince riposted dryly,
"not your blood. Indeed, I do fear that Amersfoort is threatened,
though I know not if De Berg will spend his forces on you, or,
rather, concentrate them on Arnheim. But you must be prepared," he
added with stern emphasis.</p>

<p>"You are not in a position to defend yourselves, and I cannot
detach any of my troops to come to your assistance if you are
attacked. Therefore, my orders were: 'Evacuate the town.' You,
mynheer burgomaster, must issue your proclamation at once. Let
every one go who can, taking women and children with them. Those
who remain do so at their risk. Some of you can go north to
Amsterdam, others west to Utrecht. Let De Berg find an empty shell
when he comes."</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>Only those who had ever had the sorry task of abandoning a home
in the face of an advancing enemy can have any conception of what
this peremptory order meant to these burghers&mdash;fathers of
families for the most part, who after the terrible privations which
they had suffered for over half a century, had begun but a few
years ago to reconstitute their country and their homes, to resume
their interrupted industries, their commerce, their splendid art,
to re-establish the wealth and power which had been their
birthright, and which the tyranny of a bigoted and jealous overlord
had wilfully wrested from them.</p>

<p>Now it meant laying aside spindles and looms once again, lathes,
chisels, or books, in order to buckle on swords which threatened to
rust in their scabbards, and to don steel helmets. It meant leaving
the women to weep, the children fatherless.</p>

<p>Anxious eyes searched the Stadtholder's drawn, moody face; more
than one mind reverted to memories of this peerless and fearless
commander, the hero of Turnhout and Ostend. Would he have spoken in
those days of "evacuation" and of "helplessness"? Would he have
dreaded Spinola or the hosts of the Archduchess?</p>

<p>Ah, that subtle, insidious disease had indeed done its work!
What mysterious poison was it that had shaken this great man's
nerve, made him gloomy and fretful, weakened that indomitable will
which had once made the tyrant of Madrid quake for the future of
his kingdom?</p>

<p>"De Berg would not dare&mdash;" one of the burghers hazarded
timidly.</p>

<p>"He may not," His Highness answered. "In which case it might be
safe for you all to return to your homes a few days hence. But some
of those who fled from Ede believe that De Berg intends to detach
some of his troops and with them push on as far as the Zuyder Zee,
leaving it to others to join Isembourg, who is coming up from
Kleve, and with his help capture Nijmegen first and then
Arnheim."</p>

<p>"Marquet by now," observed Beresteyn, "must be well on the way
to Arnheim, and De Keysere close to Nijmegen. They can intercept
Isembourg and cut him off from Ede and De Berg. Your Highness's
messenger&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Our messenger," the prince broke in curtly, "failed to deliver
our messages. Marquet is <i>not</i> on his way to Arnheim, and De
Keysere was still at Wageningen when the first fugitives from Ede
ran terror-stricken into our camp."</p>

<p>The words were scarce out of his mouth when the sound of a low,
quickly suppressed cry came from the rear of the little group that
had gathered around His Highness. Few heard it, or guessed whence
it had come. Only Mynheer Beresteyn, turning swiftly, caught his
daughter's eyes fixed with a set expression upon him. With an
almost imperceptible glance he beckoned to her, and she pushed her
way through to his side, and slid her cold little hand into his
firm grasp. Encouraged by her father's nearness, it was Gilda who
uttered the word of protest which had risen to more than one pair
of lips.</p>

<p>"Impossible, your Highness!" she said resolutely.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" Maurice of Nassau retorted curtly. "Why
impossible, <i>mejuffrouw</i>?"</p>

<p>"Because my lord is a brave man, as full of resource as he is of
courage. He undertook to deliver your Highness's commands to
Messire Marquet and Mynheer de Keysere. He is not a man to
fail."</p>

<p>She looked brave and determined, without a trace of
self-consciousness, even though the rigid education meted out to
girls in these times forbade their raising a voice in the councils
of their lords. But in this case she had been voicing what was in
more than one mind, and when she looked around her with a kind of
timid defiance, she only encountered kindly glances.</p>

<p>Her father pressed her hand in tender encouragement. The
Stadtholder himself appeared gracious and indulgent. It was only
her brother's gaze that was unendurable, for it was charged with
sarcasm, not unmixed with malevolence. Did Nicolaes hate her, then?
A sickening sense of horror filled the poor girl's soul at the
thought. Klaas, her little brother, whom she had loved and
mothered, though he was her elder.</p>

<p>Ofttimes had she stood between his childish peccadillos and his
father's wrath. And now&mdash;she could not even bear to meet his
glance. She knew that he triumphed, and that he rejoiced in his
triumph, even though he must know that she was wounded to the
quick. His warning was ringing in her ear, his warning which had,
in truth, proved prophetic: "The orders to Marquet will reach that
commander too late!"</p>

<p>As in a dream, she listened to the Stadtholder's words. The
whole situation appeared unreal&mdash;impossible.</p>

<p>"Your defense of your husband," the prince was saying, "does you
honour, <i>mejuffrouw</i>. But this is not a time for sentiment,
but for facts. And these it is our duty to face. We placed our
every hope on Marquet's co-operation, but Arnheim and Nijmegen are
in peril at this hour because certain messages which I sent failed
to reach their destination. We have not the leisure to discuss the
causes of this failure; rather must we take immediate measures for
the safety of our subjects here."</p>

<p>Gilda perforce had to remain silent. To the others, in fact, the
matter was only important, in so far that the messenger's failure
to arrive had placed Arnheim and Nijmegen in jeopardy. What cared
they for her heart-breaking anxiety on account of her beloved?</p>

<p>She looked up at her father, because from him she could always
expect sympathy. But he, too, was over-preoccupied just now; patted
her hand gently, then let it go, absorbed as he was in listening to
the Stadtholder's orders for the speedy evacuation of
Amersfoort.</p>

<p>She turned away with a bitter sigh, all the more resolutely
suppressed as her brother's mocking glance followed her every
movement. The men now were in close conference, the Stadtholder
sitting at the table, the burgomaster beside him, with pen and ink,
drafting the necessary proclamation, the others grouped around,
discussing and tendering advice. Every one was busy, every one had
something to think about.</p>

<p>Gilda, heavy-hearted, took the opportunity of slipping unseen
out of the room.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>What prompted her to run up to the very top of the house, like
some stricken bird seeking an eyrie, she could not herself have
told you. There is such a thing as instinct, and instinct takes
innumerable forms according to the most pressing needs of the
heart. For the moment, Gilda's most pressing need was a sight of
her beloved. Quite apart from the importance of his presence now
with news from the threatened cities, she longed to see him, to
feel his arms round her, to warm her starved soul in the sunshine
of his love and his never absent smile. This longing it was that
drove her up to the attic chambers, under the apex of the roof; for
these chambers had tiny dormer windows which commanded extensive
views of the countryside far beyond the ramparts and beyond the
Eem.</p>

<p>Gilda wandered into one of the attic chambers and threw open the
narrow casements that gave on the back of the house. Leaning
against the window frame, she looked out over the river and beyond
it into the mist-laden distance. The sharp, humid air did her good,
with its savour of the sea and the tang of spring already lurking
in the atmosphere. The sea-fog which had hung over the country for
some days still made a dense white veil that enveloped all the life
that lay beyond the ramparts, and gave to the little city a strange
air of isolation, as if the very world ended on the other side of
its walls. From where Gilda stood, high above a forest of roofs and
gables, she could see the picturesque fortifications, the
monumental gates and turrets, and the Joris Poort and Nieuwpoort,
which spanned the Eem on this side. Far away on her right was
Utrecht; on her left Barneveld, beyond which stretched the arid
upland which held in its cruel breast the secret of her husband's
fate.</p>

<p>The girl felt inexpressibly alone, weighted with that sense of
forlornness from which only the young are wont to suffer. With the
years there comes a more complete self-sufficiency, a greater
desire for solitude. Gregariousness is essentially the attribute of
youth. And Gilda had no one in whom she could confide. Her father,
in truth, had been all to her that a mother might have been; but
just now the girl was pining for one of her own sex, for some one
who would not be busy with many things, with politics and wars and
dissensions, but whose breast would be warm and soft to pillow a
head that was weary.</p>

<p>The tears gathered in Gilda's eyes and fell unheeded down her
cheeks. It seemed to her as if every moment now she must see a
rider galloping swiftly toward her as if she must hear that merry
laugh ringing right across the marshland. But all that she saw was
the sleepy little city, stretching out before her until it seemed
to melt and merge in the arms of the mist; the network of narrow
streets, the crow's foot gables, the dormer windows and ornamental
corbellings; and, above everything, the tower of St. Maria and St.
Joris, with quaint market-place alive with people that looked like
ants, fussy and minute.</p>

<p>Even as she gazed, wide-eyed and tearful, the bell of St. Maria
began to toll. The slow monotonous reverberation seemed in itself a
presage of evil. From the height, Gilda could see the human ants
pause awhile in their activities. Their very attitude, the grouping
of individual figures, a kind of arrested action in the entire life
of the town, proclaiming brooding terror. A moment or two later the
sharp clang of the town-crier's bell mingled with the majestic
booming, and people started to run toward the market-place from
every direction.</p>

<p>Gilda watched this gathering, could see the narrow streets
waxing dark with moving forms. She saw the casements thrown open
one by one, heads and shoulders filling the dark squares of the
window frames. And down below, the arrival of the town-crier, with
his halberd and his bell, a crowd of diminutive ant-like forms
pressed round his heels. A grey picture, yet all alive with
movement, like unto one over which an impatient artist has hastily
passed an obliterating brush; the outlines blurred, the colours
dull and hazy in the humid atmosphere. It all seemed so dreamlike,
so remote. Only a week ago life had appeared so exquisitely gay and
so easy! An ardent lover, a happy future, home, adventure!
Everything was tumbling out fulsomely from the Cornucopia of Fate.
And now all the tragedy represented by those running people below;
the enemy at the gates; the abandoned homes; the devastated city;
crying children and starving women&mdash;a whole herd of fugitives
wandering over the desolate marshland, seeking shelters in cities
already over-filled, asking for food where so little was to be
had.</p>

<p>It was cruel! Oh, horribly cruel! And aweful to see the children
dancing around the town-crier, teasing by pulling at his doublet or
trying to steal his bell. The crowd in the market-place had become
very dense, and still people came running out of the side streets.
The steps of St. Maria Kerk were black with the moving throng, and
Gilda thought with added heartache of that same crowd, five short
days ago, rallying for a holiday, cheering her and her handsome
lover, wishing her joy and prosperity in the endless days to
come.</p>

<p>Soon the city appeared weltering in confusion. The town-crier
continued to ply his bell, and to call the proclamation ordered by
the burgomaster. He went on so that every citizen in turn might
hear, and now the crowd no longer tended all one way. Some had
heard and were hurrying home to consult with their families, to
make arrangements either for speedy departure or for weathering the
terrible alternative of an invading army. Others lingered in groups
on the market-place or at street corners, discussing or lamenting,
according to their temperament, pausing to ask friends what they
would do or what they thought of the terrible situation.</p>

<p>Gilda, up at the attic casement, could almost guess by the
attitude, the gestures of the scared human ants, just how unsteady
had become their mental balance. It was all so unexpected, and
there was nothing that anyone could do to help in this terrible
emergency. The Stadtholder was going back to camp. He had declared
that he could not help. Threatened from every side, he could not
spare his forces to come to the aid of so small a place as
Amersfoort. And he&mdash;the stranger with the happy smile and the
gay, inconsequent temper&mdash;who had been sent across the Veluwe
to obtain succour&mdash;had failed to return. There was no garrison
at Amersfoort, so there was nothing for it but to flee.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>At what precise moment Gilda became aware of the solitary rider
galloping <i>tête baissée</i> toward the city, it were impossible
to say. He came out of the mist from the direction of Utrecht, and
Gilda saw him long before the sentry at the Joris Poort challenged
him. Apparently he had papers and all necessaries in order, for he
was admitted without demur; and at the sight Gilda turned away from
her point of vantage, ran across the attic chamber and down the
stairs. It was such a very short distance between the Joris Poort
and the front door of the burgomaster's house, and she wanted so
much to be the first to welcome him.</p>

<p>It was then half an hour before noon. The city by this time was
in the throes of a complete upheaval. The noise in the streets had
become incessant and deafening. Church bells tolling, town-criers
bawling, the clang of the halberds of the city guards mingling with
the rattle of cart-wheels upon the cobble-stones, with the tramping
of hundreds of feet and stamping of innumerable horses' hoofs. The
air was resonant with shrieks and cries, with the grating and
jarring of metal, with peal of bells and the hubbub of a throng on
the move. Gilda, when she reached the foot of the stairs, found
herself facing the wide-open doorway, and through it saw the quay
alive with people running, with horses and driven cattle, with
crowds scrambling into the boats down below, with carts and dogs
and children and barrows piled up with furniture and luggage
hastily tied together.</p>

<p>The confusion bewildered her. Determined not to allow futile
terror to overmaster her, she, nevertheless, felt within her whole
being the sense of an impending catastrophe. She could not approach
the door, because the crowd was swarming up the stone steps, and
her father's serving-men, armed with stout sticks and cudgels, had
much ado to keep some of the more venturesome or more terrified
among that throng from invading the house.</p>

<p>How that solitary rider whom she had spied in the distance would
succeed in forging his way through the dense mass of surging
humanity, she could not imagine; and yet through all the turmoil,
the din, the terror she was more conscious of his nearness than of
any other sensation. The longing to see him was, in a certain sort
of way, appeased. She knew that he lived and that time alone stood
between her present and past longing and the bliss of nestling once
more in his arms.</p>

<p>Oh, the crowd! It was rapidly becoming unmanageable. The
serving-men plied their cudgels in vain. There were men and women
there stronger and bolder than others who were determined to have a
word with the burgomaster.</p>

<p>"I am Mynheer Beresteyn's friend!" was shouted authoritatively
to the helpless guardians of their master's privacy. Or, "You know
me, Anton? Make way for me there. I must speak with the
burgomaster!"</p>

<p>"The burgomaster is busy!" the serving-men bawled out until they
were hoarse. "No one can be admitted!"</p>

<p>But it was difficult for any man to raise a stick against
well-known burghers of the city, friends and acquaintances who had
supped here in the house at Mynheer's own table; and the pressure
became more and more difficult to withstand every moment. Some of
the people had actually pushed their way into the hall, making it
impossible for Gilda to get near the door; and the longing was
irresistible to be close at hand when he dismounted, so that her
smile might be the first to greet him as he ran up the steps. She
pictured it all&mdash;his coming, his appearance, the way he would
look about him, knowing that she must be near.</p>

<p>Then all at once something awful happened. Gilda, from where she
stood, could neither see nor hear what it was; and yet she knew,
just from looking at the crowd, that something more immediately
terrifying had turned this seething mass of humanity into a horde
of scared beasts. Their movements suddenly became more swift; it
seemed as if some fearsome goad had been applied to the entire
population of the city, and the desire, to get away, to run, to
flee had become more insistent.</p>

<p>Those who had swarmed up the steps of the burgomaster's house
ran down again. They had no longer the desire to speak with anyone,
or to appeal to the servants to let them pass. They only wanted to
run like the others, the few more grave ones gathering their
scattered families around them like a mother hen does her
chicks.</p>

<p>And, oh, the awful din! It had intensified a thousand-fold, and
seemed all of a sudden like hell let loose. So many people
shrieked, the women and the children for the most part. And the
boatmen down on the water, plying for hire their small craft,
already dangerously overloaded with fugitives and their goods. But
now everyone on the quay appeared obsessed with the desire to get
into the boats. There was scrambling and fighting upon the quay,
shrieks of terror followed by ominous splashes in the murky waters.
Gilda closed her eyes, not daring to look.</p>

<p>And still the clang of the church bells tolling and the hideous
cacophony of a whole population stampeding in a mad panic.</p>

<p>The hall, the doorway, the outside steps were now deserted. Life
and movement and din were all out on the quay and in the streets
around. The serving-men even had thrown down their sticks and
cudgels. Some of them had disappeared altogether, others stood in
groups, skulking and wide-eyed. Gilda tried to frame a query. Her
pale, anxious face no doubt expressed the words which her lips
could not utter, for one of the men in the hall replied in a husky
whisper:</p>

<p>"The Spaniards! They are on us!"</p>

<p>She wanted to ask more, for at first it did not seem as if this
were fresh news. The Spaniards were at Ede, the town was being
evacuated because of them. What had occurred to turn an ordered
evacuation into so redoubtable a stampede?</p>

<p>And still no sign of my lord.</p>

<p class="cpb">6.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the doors of the banqueting-hall were thrown open,
and the burgomaster appeared. Had Gilda doubted for a moment that
something catastrophic had actually happened, she would have felt
her doubts swept aside by the mere aspect of her father. He,
usually so grave, so dignified, was trembling like a reed, his hair
was dishevelled, his cheeks of a grey, ashen colour. The word
"Gilda" was actually on his lips when he stepped across the
threshold, and quite a change came over him the moment he caught
sight of his daughter. Before he could call to her she was already
by his side, and in an instant he had her by the hand and dragged
her with him back into the banqueting-hall.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" she asked, in truth more bewildered than
frightened.</p>

<p>"The Spaniards!" her father replied briefly. "They are on
us."</p>

<p>"Yes," she ventured, frowning; "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not three leagues away," he broke in curtly. "Their vanguard
will be here by nightfall."</p>

<p>She looked round her, puzzled to see them all so calm in
contrast to the uproar and the confusion without. The Stadtholder
was sitting beside the table, his head resting on his hand. He
looked woefully ill. Nicolaes Beresteyn was beside him, whispering
earnestly.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, father dear?" Gilda asked in a
hurried whisper.</p>

<p>"My fellow-burghers and I are remaining at our posts," Beresteyn
replied quietly. "We must do what we can to save our city, and our
presence may do some good."</p>

<p>"And Nicolaes?" she asked again.</p>

<p>"Nicolaes has his horse ready. He will take you to Utrecht in
His Highness's train." Then, as Gilda made no comment on this, only
gave his hand a closer pressure, he added tentatively: "Unless you
would prefer to go with Mynheer van den Poele and his family. He is
taking Kaatje and her mother to Amsterdam."</p>

<p>"I would prefer to remain with you," she said simply.</p>

<p>"Impossible, my dear child!" he retorted.</p>

<p>"My place is here," she continued firmly, "and I'll not go. Oh,
can't you understand?" she pleaded, with a break in her voice. "If
you sent me away, I should go mad or die!"</p>

<p>"But, Gilda&mdash;" the poor man protested.</p>

<p>"My lord is here," Gilda suddenly broke in more calmly.</p>

<p>"My lord? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I saw him awhile ago. I was up in the attic-chamber, he came
through the Joris Poort."</p>

<p>"Your eyes deceived you. He would be here by now."</p>

<p>"He should be here," she asserted. "I cannot understand what has
happened. Perhaps the crowd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your eyes deceived you," he reiterated, but more doubtfully
this time. Then, as just at that moment the Stadtholder and caught
his eye, Beresteyn called to him, "My daughter says that my lord
has returned."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" burst forth impulsively from Nicolaes.</p>

<p>"Why should it be impossible?" Gilda retorted quickly, and fixed
coldly challenging eyes upon her brother. "Why should you say that
it is impossible?" she insisted, seeing that Nicolaes now looked
shamefaced and confused. "What do you know about my lord?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing!" Nicolaes stammered. "I did not mean that, of
course; it only seems so strange&mdash;" And he added roughly,
"Then why is he not here?"</p>

<p>"The crowd is very dense about the streets," one of the burghers
suggested. "My lord, mayhap hath found it difficult to push his way
through."</p>

<p>"Why should he be coming to Amersfoort?" mused Mynheer
Beresteyn.</p>

<p>"He came from the direction of Utrecht," Gilda replied. "Some
one at the camp must have told him that His Highness was here."</p>

<p>"No one knew I was coming hither," the Stadtholder broke in
impatiently.</p>

<p>"My sister more like hath been troubled with visions," Nicolaes
rejoined with a sneer. "Nor have we the time," he added, "to wait
on my lord's pleasure. If your Highness is ready, we should be
getting to horse."</p>

<p>"But surely," Gilda protested with pitiful earnestness, "your
Highness will wait to see your messenger. He must be bringing news
from Messire Marquet. He&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," the Stadtholder broke in decisively, "I'll see him. Let
some one go out into the streets at once and find the man. Tell him
that we are waiting&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He knows his way about the town," Nicolaes interposed, with an
ill-concealed note of spite in his voice. "Why should he need a
pilot?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Every one looked nervy and
worried. Then the Stadtholder turned once more to the burgomaster,
and queried abruptly:</p>

<p>"Are those two companions of my lord's still in your house,
mynheer? Can you not send one of them?"</p>

<p>The suggestion met with universal approval. And Mynheer
Beresteyn himself urged the advisability of finding my lord's
friends immediately. He took his daughter's hand. It was cold as
ice, and quivered like a wounded bird in his warm grasp. He patted
it gently, reassuringly. Her wild eyes frightened him. He knew what
she suffered, and in his heart condemned his son for those
insinuations against the absent. But this was not a moment for
delicacy or for scruples. The hour was a portentous one, and
fraught with peril for a nation and its chief. The individual
matters so little at such times. The feelings, the sufferings, the
broken heart of one women or one man&mdash;how futile do they seem
when a whole country is writhing in the throes of her death
agony?</p>

<p>"Go, my dear child," Beresteyn admonished firmly. "Obey His
Highness's commands. Find my lord's friends and tell them to go at
once, and return hither with my lord. Go," he added; and whispered
gently in Gilda's ear, as he led her, reluctant yet obedient, to
the door, "Leave your husband's honour in my hands."</p>

<p>She gave him a grateful look, and he gave her hand a last
reassuring pressure. Then he let her go from him, only urging her
to hurry back.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed for a moment that he did not feel for
her in her anxiety and her misery. But the man in question was a
stranger&mdash;an Englishman, what?&mdash;and Mynheer Beresteyn was
above all a patriot, a man who had suffered acutely for his
country, had sacrificed his all for her, and was ready to do it
again whenever she called to him. The Stadtholder stood for the
safety and the integrity of the United Provinces; he was the
champion and upholder of her civil and religious liberties. His
personal safety stood, in the minds of Beresteyn and his fellow
burghers, above every consideration on earth.</p>

<p>Gilda knew this, and though she trusted her father implicitly,
she knew that her beloved would be ruthlessly sacrificed, even by
him, if, through misadventure or any other simple circumstance
entirely beyond his control, he happened to have failed in the
enterprise which had been entrusted to him. Nicolaes, of course,
was an avowed enemy. Why? Gilda could not conjecture. Was it
jealousy, or petty spite only? If so, what advantage could he reap
from the humiliation of one who already was a member of his own
family? But she felt herself encompassed with enemies. No one had
attempted to defend my lord's honour when it was so ruthlessly
impugned save her father, and he was too absorbed, too much
centered in thoughts of his country's peril, to do real battle for
the absent.</p>

<p>It was with a heavy heart that she turned to go up the stairs in
search of the two men who alone were ready to go through fire in
the defense of their friend. A melancholy smile hovered round
Gilda's lips. She felt that with those two quaint creatures she had
more in common at this hour than with her father, whom she
idolized. In those too poor caitiffs she had all that her heart had
been hungering for: simple hearts that understood her sorrow, loyal
souls that never wavered. For evil or for good, through death-peril
or through seeming dishonour, their friend whom they reverenced
could count upon their devotion. And as Gilda went wearily up the
stairs, her mind conjured up the picture of those two ludicrous
vagabonds, with their whimsical saws and rough codes of honour, and
she suddenly felt less lonely and less sad.</p>

<p class="cpb">7.</p>

<p>Great was her disappointment, therefore, when she reached the
guest-chamber, which they still occupied, to find that it was
empty. The whole house was by this time in a hopeless state of
turmoil and confusion. Serving-men and maids rushed aimlessly
hither and thither, up and down the stairs, along the passages, in
and out of the rooms; or stood about in groups, whispering or
cowering in corners. Some of them had already fled; the few who
remained looked like so many scared chickens, fussy and
inconsequent,&mdash;the maids, with kirtles awry and hair unkempt,
the men striving to look brave and determined, putting on the air
of masters, and adding to the maids' distress by their aimless,
hectoring ways.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the house now left of that orderly
management which is the pride of every self-respecting housewife.
Doors stood open, displaying the untidiness of the rooms; there was
noise and bustle everywhere, calls of distress and loud
admonitions. From no one could Gilda learn what she desired to
know. She was forced to seek out Maria, her special tiring-woman,
who, it was to be hoped, had some semblance of reason left in her.
Maria, however, had no love for the two rapscallions, who were
treated in the house as if they were princes, and knew nothing of
the respect due to their betters. She replied to her young
mistress's inquiries by shrugging her shoulders and calling heaven
to witness her ignorance of the whereabouts of those abominable
louts.</p>

<p>"Spoilt, they have been," the old woman asserted sententiously.
"Shamefully spoilt. They have neither order nor decency, nor the
slightest regard for the wishes of their betters&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Maria, whither have the two good fellows gone?" Gilda
broke in impatiently.</p>

<p>"Gone? Whither have they gone?" Maria ejaculated, in pious
ignorance of such probable wickedness. "Nay, that ye cannot expect
any self-respecting woman to know. They have gone, the miserable
roysterers! Went but an hour ago, without saying by your leave.
This much I do know. And my firm belief is that they were naught
but a pair of Spanish spies, come to hand us all, body and soul,
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maria, I forbid thee to talk such rubbish!" Gilda exclaimed
wrathfully.</p>

<p>And, indeed, her anger and her white and worried look did
effectually silence the garrulous woman's tongue.</p>

<p>Even the waiting-maids! Even these ignorant fools! Gilda could
have screamed with the horror of it all, as if she had suddenly
landed in a nest of scorpions and their poison encompassed her
everywhere. This story of spies! God in Heaven, how had it come
about? Whose was the insidious tongue that had perverted her
brother Nicolaes first, and then every trimmer and rogue in the
house? Gilda felt as if it might ease her heart to run around with
a whip, and lash all these base detractors into acknowledgment of
their infamy. But she forced herself to patience.</p>

<p>A vague instinct had already whispered to her that she must not
go back to the banqueting-hall with the news that my lord's friends
had gone, and that no one had any knowledge of their whereabouts.
She felt that if she did that, her brother's sneers would become
unendurable, and that she might then be led to retort with
accusations against her only brother which she would afterwards
forever regret.</p>

<p>So she waited for awhile, curtly bade Maria to be gone, and to
leave her in peace. She wanted to think, to put a curb on her fears
and her just wrath against this unseen army of calumniators; for
wrath and fear are both evil counsellors. And above all, she wanted
to see her beloved.</p>

<p>He was in the town. She knew it as absolutely as that she was
alive. Were her eyes likely to be deceived? Even now, when she
closed her eyes, she could see him, as she had done but a few
minutes ago, walking his horse through the Joris Poort, his plumed
hat shading the upper part of his face. She could see him, with
just that slight stoop of his broad shoulders which denoted almost
unendurable fatigue. She had noted this at the moment, with a pang
of anxiety, and then forgotten it all in the joy of seeing him
again. She remembered it all now. Oh, how could they think that she
could be deceived?</p>

<p>Just for a second or two she had the mind to run back to the
casement in the attic-chamber and see if she could not from thence
spy him again. But surely this would be futile. He must have
reached the quay by now, would be at the front door, with no one to
welcome him. In truth, the longing to see him had become sheer
physical pain.</p>

<p>So Gilda once more made her way down into the hall.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII&mdash;A SUBTLE
TRAITOR</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Down below, in the banqueting-hall, Gilda's departure had at
first been followed by a general feeling of obsession, which caused
the grave men here assembled to remain silent for awhile and
pondering. There was no lack of sympathy, I repeat; not even on the
part of the Stadtholder, whose heart and feelings were never wholly
atrophied. But there had sprung up in the minds of these grave
burghers an unreasoning feeling of suspicion toward the man whom
they had trusted implicitly such a brief while ago.</p>

<p>Terror at the imminence of their danger, the appearance of the
dreaded foe almost at their very gates, had in a measure&mdash;as
terror always will&mdash;blurred the clearness of their vision, and
to a certain extent warped their judgements. The man now appeared
before them as a stranger, therefore a person to be feared, even
despised to the extent of attributing the blackest possible
treachery to him. They forgot that the closest possible ties of
blood and of tradition bound the English gentleman to the service
of the Prince of Orange. Sir Percy Blakeney now, and Diogenes the
soldier of fortune of awhile ago, were one and the same. But no
longer so to them. The adder's fork had bitten into their soul and
left its insidious poison of suspicion and of misbelief.</p>

<p>So none of them spoke, hardly dared to look on Mynheer
Beresteyn, who, they felt, was not altogether with them in their
distrust. The Stadtholder had lapsed into one of his surly moods.
His lean, brown hands were drumming a devil's tattoo upon the
table.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Nicolaes broke into a harsh and mirthless
laugh.</p>

<p>"It would all be a farce," he exclaimed with bitter malice, "if
it did not threaten to become so tragic." Then he turned to the
Stadtholder, and his manner became once more grave and earnest.
"Your Highness, I entreat," he said soberly, "deign to come away
with me at once, ere you fall into some trap set by those
abominable spies&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nicolaes," his father broke in sternly, "I forbid you to make
these base insinuations against your sister's husband."</p>

<p>"I'll be silent if you command me," Nicolaes rejoined quietly.
"But methinks that his Highness's life is too precious for
sentimental quibbles. Nay," he went on vehemently, and like one who
is forced into speech against his will, "I have warned Gilda of
this before. While were all waiting here calmly, trusting to that
stranger who came, God knows whence, he was warning De Berg to
effect a quick crossing."</p>

<p>"It is false!" protested the burgomaster hotly.</p>

<p>"Then, I pray you," Nicolaes insisted hotly, "tell me how it is
that De Berg did forestall his Highness's plans? Who was in the
council-chamber when the plans were formulated save yourselves? Who
knew of the orders to Marquet? Marquet hath not gone to relieve
Arnheim, and the armies of the Archduchess are at our gates!"</p>

<p>He paused, and a murmur of assent went round the room, and when
Mynheer Beresteyn once more raised his voice in protest, saying
firmly: "I'll not believe it! Let us wait at least until we've
heard what news my lord hath brought!" No one spoke in response,
and even the Stadtholder shrugged his shoulders, as if the matter
of a man's honour or dishonour had no interest for him.</p>

<p>"Your Highness," Nicolaes went on with passionate earnestness,
"let me beg of you on my knees to think of your noble father, of
the trap into which he fell, and of his assassin, Gérard&mdash;a
stranger, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But this man saved my life once!" the Stadtholder said, with an
outburst of generous feeling in favour of the man to whom, in
truth, he owed so much.</p>

<p>"He hated Stoutenburg then, your Highness," Nicolaes retorted,
and boldly looked his father in the face&mdash;his father who knew
his own share in that hideous conspiracy three months ago. "He
loved my sister Gilda. It suited his purpose then to use his sword
in your Highness's service. But remember, he is only a soldier of
fortune after all. Have we not all of us heard him say a hundred
times that he had lived hitherto by selling his sword to the
highest bidder?"</p>

<p>This time his tirade was greeted by a distinct murmur of
approval. Only the burgomaster raised his voice admonishingly once
more.</p>

<p>"Take care, Nicolaes!" he exclaimed. "Take care!"</p>

<p>"Take care of what?" the young man retorted with all his wonted
arrogance, and challenged his father with a look.</p>

<p>"Would you give your only son away," that look appeared to say,
"in order to justify a stranger?"</p>

<p>Then, as indeed Mynheer Beresteyn remained silent, not exactly
giving up the contention, but forced into passive acquiescence by
the weight of public opinion and that inalienable feeling of family
and kindred which makes most men or women defend their own against
any stranger, Nicolaes continued, with magnificent assumption of
patriotic fervor:</p>

<p>"Have we the right hazard so precious a thing as his Highness's
life for the sake of sparing my sister's feelings?"</p>

<p>In this sentiment every one was ready to concur. They did not
actually condemn the stranger; they were not prepared to call him a
traitor and a potential assassin, or to believe one half of
Nicolaes Beresteyn's insinuations. They merely put him aside, out
of their minds, as not entering into their present schemes. And
even the burgomaster could not gainsay the fact that his son was
right.</p>

<p>The most urgent thing at the present juncture was to get the
Stadtholder safely back to his camp at Utrecht. Every minute spent
in this garrisonless city was fraught with danger for the most
precious life in the United Provinces.</p>

<p>"Where is his Highness's horse?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Just outside," Nicolaes replied glibly; "in charge of a man I
know. Mine is ready too. Indeed, we should get to horse at
once."</p>

<p>The Stadtholder did not demur.</p>

<p>"Have the horses brought to," he said quickly. "I'll be with you
in a trice."</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Nicolaes hurried out of the room, his Highness remaining behind
for a moment or two, in order to give his final instructions, a
last admonition or two to the burghers.</p>

<p>"Do not resist," he said earnestly. "You have not the means to
do aught but to resign yourselves to the inevitable. As soon as I
can, I will come to your relief. In the meanwhile, conciliate De
Berg by every means in your power. He is not a harsh man, and the
Archduchess has learnt a salutary lesson from the discomfiture of
Alva. She knows by now that we are a stiff-necked race, whom it is
easier to cajole than to coerce. If only you will be patient! Can
you reckon on your citizens not to do anything rash or foolish that
might bring reprisals upon your heads?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the burgomaster replied. "I think we can rely on them for
that. When your Highness has gone we'll assemble on the market
place, and I will speak to them. We'll do our best to stay the
present panic and bring some semblance of order into the town."</p>

<p>Their hearts were heavy. 'Twas no use trying to minimize the
deadly peril which confronted them. There was a century of
oppression, of ravage, and pillage, and bloodshed to the credit of
the Spanish armies. It was difficult to imagine that the spirit of
an entire nation should have changed suddenly into something more
tolerant and less cruel.</p>

<p>However, for the moment, there was nothing more to be said, and
alas! it was not as if the whole terrible situation was a novel
one. They had all been through it before, at Leyden and
Bergen-op-Zoom, at Haarlem and Delft, when they were weeping their
land free from the foreign tyrant; and it was useless at this hour
to add to the Stadtholder's difficulties by futile lamentations.
All the more as Nicolaes had now returned with the welcome news
that the horses were there, and everything ready for his Highness's
departure. He appeared more excited than before, anxious to get
away as quickly as may be.</p>

<p>"There is a rumour in the town," he said, "that Spanish vedettes
have been spied less than a league away."</p>

<p>"And have you heard any rumour as to the arrival of our
Diogenes?" the Stadtholder asked casually.</p>

<p>Nicolaes hesitated a moment ere he replied: "I have heard
nothing definite."</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>A minute later the Stadtholder was in the hall. The doors were
open and the horses down below in the charge of an equerry.</p>

<p>Nicolaes, half way down the outside stone steps, looked the
picture of fretful impatience. With a dark frown upon his brow, he
was scanning the crowd, and now and again a curse broke through his
set lips when he saw the Stadtholder still delayed by futile
leave-takings.</p>

<p>"In the name of heaven, let us to horse!" he exclaimed almost
savagely.</p>

<p>Just at that moment his Highness was taking a kindly farewell of
Gilda.</p>

<p>"I wish, <i>mejuffrouw</i>," he was saying, "that you had
thought of taking shelter in our camp."</p>

<p>Gilda forced herself to listen to him, her lips tried to frame
the respectful words which convention demanded. But her eyes she
could not control, nor yet her thoughts, and they were fixed upon
the crowd down below, just as were those of her brother Nicolaes.
She thought that every moment she must catch sight of that plumed
hat, towering above the throng, of those sturdy shoulders, forging
their way to her. But all that she saw was the surging mass of
people. A medley of colour. Horses, carts, the masts of ships.
People running. And children. Numberless children, in arms or on
their tiny feet; the sweet, heavy burdens that made the present
disaster more utterly catastrophic.</p>

<p>Then suddenly she gave a loud cry.</p>

<p>"My lord!" she called, at the top of her voice. Then something
appeared to break in her throat, and it was with a heart-rending
sob that she murmured almost inaudibly: "Thank God! It is my
lord!"</p>

<p>The Stadtholder turned, was across the hall and out in the open
in a trice.</p>

<p>"Where?" he demanded.</p>

<p>She ran after him, seized his surcoat with a trembling hand, and
with the other pointed in the direction of the Koppel-poort.</p>

<p>"A plumed hat!" she murmured vaguely, for her teeth were
chattering so that she could scarcely speak. "All broken and
battered with wind and weather&mdash;a torn jerkin&mdash;a
mud-stained cloak. He is leading his horse. He has a three days'
growth of beard on his chin, and looks spent with fatigue. There!
Do you not see him?"</p>

<p>But Nicolaes already had interposed.</p>

<p>"To horse, your Highness!" he cried.</p>

<p>He would have given worlds for the privilege to seize the
Stadtholder then and there by the arm, and to drag him down the
steps and set him on his horse before the meeting which he dreaded
could take place. But Maurice of Nassau, torn between his desire to
get out of the threatened city as quickly as possible and his wish
to speak with the messenger whom an inalienable instinct assured
him that he could trust, was lingering on the steps trying in his
turn to catch sight of Diogenes.</p>

<p>"Beware of the assassin's dagger, your Highness!" Nicolaes
whispered hoarsely in his ear. "In this crowd who can tell? Who
knows what deathly trap is being laid for you?"</p>

<p>"Not by that man, I'll swear!" the Stadtholder affirmed.</p>

<p>"Nay, if he is loyal he can follow you to the camp and report to
you there. But for God's sake remember your father and the
miscreant Gérard. There too, a crowd; the hustling, the hurry! In
the name of your country, come away!"</p>

<p>There was no denying the prudence of this advice. Another
instant's hesitation, the obstinacy of an arbitrary temperament
that abhors being dictated to, the Stadtholder was ready to go.
Gilda, on the top of the steps, was more like a stone statue of
expectancy than like a living woman. Nay, all that she had alive in
her were just her eyes, and they had spied her beloved. He was then
by the Koppel-poort, some hundred yards or more on the other side
of the quay, with a seething mass of panic-stricken humanity
between him and the steps of Mynheer Beresteyn's house.</p>

<p>He had dismounted and was leading his horse. The poor beast,
spent with fatigue, looked ready to drop, and, indeed, appeared too
dazed to pick his own way through the crowd. As it was, he was more
than a handful for his equally wearied master, whose difficulties
were increased a hundredfold by the number of small children who
were for ever getting in the way of the horse's legs, and were in
constant danger of being kicked or trampled on.</p>

<p>But Gilda never lost sight of him now that she had seen him.
With every beat of her heart she was measuring the footsteps that
separated him from the Stadtholder. And the more Nicolaes fretted
to hurry his Highness away, the more she longed and yearned for the
quick approach of her beloved.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>Amongst all those here present, Gilda was the only one who
scented some unseen danger for them all in Nicolaes' strangely
feverish haste. What the others took for zeal, she knew by instinct
was naught but treachery. What form this would take she could not
guess; but this she knew, that for some motive as sinister as it
was unexplainable, Nicolaes did not wish the Stadtholder and his
messenger to meet. That same motive had caused him to utter all
those venomous accusations against her husband, and was even now
wearing him into a state of fretfulness which bordered on
dementia.</p>

<p>"My lord!" she cried out to her beloved at one time; and felt
that even through all the din and clatter her voice had reached his
ear, for he raised his head, and it even seemed to her as if his
eyes met hers above the intervening crowd and as if the supernal
longing for him which was in her heart had drawn him with its
mystic power over every obtruding obstacle.</p>

<p>For, indeed, the next moment he was right at the foot of the
steps, not five paces from the Stadtholder.</p>

<p>Nicolaes spied him in a moment, and a loud curse broke from his
lips.</p>

<p>"That skulking assassin!" he cried; and with a magnificent
gesture covered the Stadtholder with his body. "To horse, your
Highness, and leave me to deal with him!"</p>

<p>Maurice of Nassau, indeed was one of the bravest men of his
time, but the word "assassin" was bound to ring unpleasantly in the
ears of a man whose father had met his death at a murderer's hand.
Half-ashamed of his fears, he nevertheless did take advantage of
Nicolaes' theatrical attitude to slip behind him and mount his
horse as quickly as he could. But with his foot already in the
stirrup compunction appeared to seize him. Wishing to palliate the
gross insult which was being hurled at the man who had once saved
his life at imminent peril of his own, he now turned and called to
him in gracious, matter-of-fact tones:</p>

<p>"Why, man, what made you tarry so long? Come with us to Utrecht
now. We can no longer wait."</p>

<p>With this he swung himself in the saddle.</p>

<p>"Not another step man, at your peril!"</p>

<p>This came from Nicolaes Beresteyn, who was still standing in a
dramatic pose between Diogenes and the Stadtholder, with his cloak
wrapped around his arm.</p>

<p>"Stand back, you fool!!" retorted the other loudly, and would
have pushed past him, when suddenly Nicolaes disengaged his arm
from his cloak wrapped around his arm.</p>

<p>For one fraction of a second the gleam of steel flashed in the
humid air; then, without a word of warning, swift as a hawk
descending on his prey, he struck at Diogenes with all his
might.</p>

<p>It had all happened in a very few brief seconds. Diogenes, spent
with fatigue, or actually struck, staggered and half fell against
the bottom step. But Gilda, with a loud cry, was already by his
side, and as Nicolaes raised his arm to strike once again, she was
on him like some lithe pantheress.</p>

<p>She seized his wrist, and gave it such a violent twist that he
uttered a cry of pain, and the dagger fell with a clatter to the
ground. After which everything became a blur. She heard her
brother's loudly triumphant shout:</p>

<p>"His Highness's life was threatened. Mine was but an act of
justice!" even as he in his turn swung himself into the saddle.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder looked dazed. It had all happened so quickly
that he had not the time to visualize it all. De Voocht, who was in
the hall of the burgomaster's house from the moment when the
Stadtholder bade farewell to Gilda until that when he dug his spurs
into his horse and scattered the crowd in every direction, tells us
in his "Brieven"&mdash;the one which is dated March 21,
1626&mdash;that the incidents followed on one another with such
astounding rapidity that it was impossible for any one to
interfere.</p>

<p>All that he remembers very clearly is seeing his Highness
getting to horse, then the flash of steel in the air and Nicolaes
Beresteyn's arm upraised ready to strike. He could not see if any
one had fallen. The next moment he heard Gilda's heart-piercing
shriek, and saw her running down the stone steps&mdash;almost
flying, like a bird.</p>

<p>Mynheer Beresteyn followed his daughter as rapidly as he could.
He reached the foot of the steps just as his son put his horse to a
walk in the wake of his Highness. He was wont to say afterwards
that at the moment his mind was an absolute blank. He had heard his
daughter's cry and seen Nicolaes strike; but he had not actually
seen Diogenes. Now he was just in time to see his son's final
dramatic gesture and to hear his parting words:</p>

<p>"There, father," Nicolaes shouted to him, and pointed to the
ground, "is the pistol which the miscreant pointed at the
Stadtholder when I struck him down like a dog!"</p>

<p>The people down on the quay had hardly perceived anything. They
were too deeply engrossed in their own troubles and deadly
peril.</p>

<p>When the horses reared under the spur they scattered like so
many hens out of the way of immediate danger; but a second or two
later they were once more surging everywhere, intent only on the
business of getting away.</p>

<p>Gilda, at the foot of the steps, saw and heard nothing more. The
sudden access of almost manlike strength wherewith she had fallen
on her brother and wrenched the murderous dagger from his grasp had
as suddenly fallen from her again. Her knees were shaking; she was
almost ready to swoon.</p>

<p>She put out her arms and encountered those of her father, which
gave her support. Her brother's voice, exultant and cruel, reached
her ears as through a veil.</p>

<p>"My lord!" she murmured, in a pitiful appeal.</p>

<p>She did not know how severely he had been struck; indeed, she
had not seen him fall. Her instinct had been to rush on Nicolaes
first and to disarm him. In this she succeeded. Then only did she
turn to her beloved.</p>

<p>But the crowd, cruelly indifferent, was all around like a
surging sea. They pushed and they jostled; they shouted and filled
the air with a medley of sounds. Some actually laughed. She saw
some comely faces and ugly ones; some that wept and others that
grinned. It seemed to her even for a moment that she caught sight
of a round red face and of lean and lanky Socrates. She tried to
call to him, to beg him to explain. She turned to her father,
asking him if in truth she was going mad.</p>

<p>For she called in vain to her beloved. He was no longer
here.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;DEVIL'S-WRIT</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>When Diogenes, taken wholly unawares by Nicolaes' treacherous
blow, had momentarily lost his balance, he would have been in a
precarious position indeed had not his faithful friends been close
at hand at the moment.</p>

<p>It is difficult to surmise how terribly anxious the two
philosophers had been these past few days. Indeed, their anxiety
had proved more than a counterpart to that felt by Gilda, and had,
with its simple-hearted sympathy, expressed in language more
whimsical than choice, been intensely comforting to her.</p>

<p>Both these worthies had been inured to blows and hurts from the
time when as mere lads, they first learned to handle a sword, and
Pythagoras' wound, which would have laid an ordinary man low for a
fortnight, was, after four days, already on the mend. To keep a man
of that type in bed, or even within four walls, when he began to
feel better was more than any one could do. And when he understood
that Diogenes had been absent four days on an errand for the
Stadtholder, that the <i>jongejuffrouw</i> was devoured with
anxiety on his behalf, and that that spindle-legged gossoon
Socrates was spending most of the day and one half of the night on
horseback, patrolling the ramparts watching for the comrade's
return; when he understood all that, I say, it was not likely that
he&mdash;Pythagoras&mdash;an able-bodied man and a doughty horseman
at that, would be content to lie abed and be physicked by any
grovelling leech.</p>

<p>Thus the pair of them were providentially on the watch on that
memorable March 21, and they both saw their comrade-in-arms enter
the city by the Joris Poort. They followed him as best they could
through the crowd, cursing and pushing their way, knowing well that
Diogenes' objective could be none other than a certain house they
wot of on the quay, where a lovely <i>jongejuffrouw</i> was waiting
in tears for her beloved.</p>

<p>Remember that to these two caitiffs the fact that the Spaniards
were said to be at the very gates of Amersfoort was but a mere
incident. With their comrade within the city, they feared nothing,
were prepared for anything. They had been in far worse plights than
this many a time in their career, the three of them, and had been
none the worse for it in the end.</p>

<p>Of course, now matters had become more complicated through the
<i>jongejuffrouw</i>. She had become the first consideration, and
though it was impossible not to swear at Diogenes for thus having
laid this burden on them all, it was equally impossible to shirk
its responsibilities.</p>

<p>The <i>jongejuffrouw</i> above all. That had become the moral
code of these two philosophers, and with those confounded Spaniards
likely to descend on this town&mdash;why, the <i>jongejuffrouw</i>
must be got out of it as soon as may be! No wonder that Diogenes
had turned up just in the nick of time! Something evidently was in
the wind, and it behooved for comrades-in-arms to be there, ready
to help as occasion arose.</p>

<p>A simple code enough, you'll admit; worthy of simple,
unsophisticated hearts. Socrates, being the more able-bodied of the
two, then took command, dismounted, and left his lubberly compeer
in charge of the horses at a comparatively secluded corner of the
market-place.</p>

<p>"If you can get hold of one more horse," he said airily, "one
that is well-saddled and looks sprightly and fresh, do not let your
super-sensitive honesty stand in your way. Diogenes' mount looked
absolutely spent, and I'm sure he'll need another."</p>

<p>With which parting admonition he turned on his heel and made his
way toward the quay.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Socrates happened to be on the spot, or very
near it, when Diogenes was struck by the hand of a traitor, and,
wearied, sick, and faint, lost his footing and fell for a moment
helpless against the steps, whilst Nicolaes Beresteyn dug his spurs
into his horse's sides and urged the Stadtholder to immediate
haste.</p>

<p>A second or two later these two were lost to sight in the crowd.
It was Socrates who received his half-swooning friend in his arms,
and who dragged him incontinently into the recess formed by the
side of the stone steps and the wall of the burgomaster's
house.</p>

<p>By great good fortune, the dagger-thrust aimed by the abominable
miscreant had lost most of its virulence in the thick folds of
Diogenes' cloak. The result was just a flesh wound in the neck,
nothing that would cause so hardened a soldier more than slight
discomfort. His scarf, tied tightly around his shoulders by
Socrates' rough, but experienced hands, was all that was needed for
the moment. It had only been fatigue, and perhaps the
unexpectedness of the onslaught, that had brought him to his knees
for that brief second, and rendered him momentarily helpless. Time
enough, by mischance for Nicolaes to drag the Stadtholder finally
out of sight.</p>

<p>But by the time Diogenes' faithful comrade had found shelter for
him in the angle of the wall the feeling of sickness had passed
away.</p>

<p>"The Stadtholder," he queried abruptly, "where is he?"</p>

<p>"Gone!" Socrates grunted through clenched teeth. "Gone, together
with that spawn of the devil who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"After him!" Diogenes commanded, speaking once more with that
perfect quietude which is the attribute of men of action at moments
of acute peril. "Get me a horse, man! Mine is spent."</p>

<p>"In the market-place," Socrates responded laconically.
"Pythagoras is in charge. You can have the beast, and we'll
follow." Then he added, under his breath: "And the
<i>jongejuffrouw</i>? She was so anxious&mdash;"</p>

<p>Diogenes made no reply, gave one look up at the house which
contained all that for him was dearest on God's earth. But he did
not sigh. I think the longing and the disappointment were too keen
even for that. The next moment he had already started to push his
way through the throng along the quay, and thence into Vriese
Straat in the direction of the market-place, closely followed by
his long-legged familiar.</p>

<p>As soon as the Groote Market lay open before him, his sharp eyes
searched the crowd for a sight of the Stadtholder's plumed bonnet.
Soon he spied his Highness right across the place, with Nicolaes
riding close to his stirrup.</p>

<p>The two horsemen were then tending toward Joris Laan, which
leads straight to the <i>poort</i>.</p>

<p>At that end of the <i>markt</i> the crowd was much less dense,
and Joris Laan beyond appeared practically deserted. It was, you
must remember, from that side that the enemy would descend upon the
city when he came, and the moving throng, if viewed from a height,
would now have looked like a column of smoke when it is all blown
one way by the wind. Already the Stadtholder and Nicolaes had been
free to put their horses to a trot. Another moment and they would
be galloping down Joris Laan, which is but three hundred yards from
the <i>poort</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh, God, grant me wings!" Diogenes muttered, between his
teeth.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" Socrates asked.</p>

<p>"Prevent the Stadtholder from falling into an abominable trap,
if I can," the other replied briefly.</p>

<p>Socrates pointed to the distant corner of the <i>markt</i>,
where Pythagoras could be dimly perceived waiting patiently beside
three horses.</p>

<p>"I see the ruffian has stolen a horse," he said. "So long as it
is a fresh one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall need it." Diogenes remarked simply.</p>

<p>"I told him only to get the best, but you can't trust that loon
since good fortune hath made him honest."</p>

<p>The next few seconds brought them to the spot. Pythagoras hailed
them with delight. He was getting tired of waiting. Three horses,
obviously fresh and furnished with excellent saddlery, were here
ready. Even Socrates had a word of praise for his fat compeer's
choice.</p>

<p>"Where did you get him from?" he queried, indicating the mount
which Diogenes had without demur selected for himself.</p>

<p>Pythagoras shrugged his shoulder. What did it matter who had
been made the poorer by a good horse? Enough that it was here now,
ready to do service to the finest horseman in the Netherlands.
Already Diogenes had swung himself into the saddle, and now he
turned his horse toward Nieuwpoort.</p>

<p>"Where do we go?" the others cried.</p>

<p>"After me!" he shouted in reply.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>Nose to heels, the three riders thundered through the city. It
was deserted at this end of it, remember. Thank God for that! And
now for a host of guardian angels to the rescue! Down the Oude
Straat they galloped, their horses' hoofs raising myriads of sparks
from the uneven cobblestones. "God grant me wings!" the leader had
cried ere he set spurs to his horse, and the others followed
without an instant's thought as to the whither or the wherefore.
"After me!" he had called; and they who had fought beside him so
often, who had bled with him, suffered with him, triumphed at
times, been merry always, were well content to follow him now and
forget everything in the exhilaration of this chase.</p>

<p>A chase it was! They could not doubt it, even though they seemed
at this moment to be speeding in the opposite direction to that
pursued by the Stadtholder and Nicolaes Beresteyn. But they well
knew their friend's way, when he let his mount have free rein and
threw up his head with that air of intense vitality which in him
was at its height when life and death were having a tussle
somewhere at the end of a ride.</p>

<p>Down the Oude Straat, which presently abuts on the ramparts.
Then another two hundred yards to Nieuwpoort. No one in sight now.
This part of the city looks like one of the dead. Doors open wide,
litter of every sort encumbering the road. The din from afar, even
the ceaseless tolling of St. Maria bell, seem like dream-sounds,
ghost-like and unreal. Now the <i>poort</i>. Still no one insight.
No guard. No sentry. The gate left open. Here two or three halberds
hastily thrown down in some hurried flight. There a culverin,
forlorn looking, gaping wide-mouthed, like some huge toad yawning,
as if astonished or wearied to find itself deserted. Then again, a
pile of muskets. It must have been a sudden panic that drove the
guard from their post. But, thank God, the gate!</p>

<p>Diogenes is already through; after him his two compeers. A
quarter of a league further on they suddenly draw rein. The horses
rear, snorting and tossing, panting with the excitement and fretted
with the curb. The riders blink for a second or two in the glare.
The white mist is positively blinding here, where its sovereignty
is unfettered. Just a clump of trees, way out on the right, here
and there a hut with thatched roof and a piece of low fencing, or
the gaunt arms of a windmill stretched with eerie stillness to the
silvery sky. And above it all the mist&mdash;a pale shroud that
envelopes everything.</p>

<p>To the east and the south the arid upland plunges head-long
through it into infinity, cloaks within its stern bosom the secrets
of the lurking enemy&mdash;the armies of De Berg, the Spanish
outposts, the ambuscades. To the west Utrecht, unseen&mdash;and
just now two tiny specks speeding along its road&mdash;the
Stadtholder and Nicolaes Beresteyn. They came out into the open
through Joris Poort, and are now some four hundred yards or less
from the spot where three panting but exhilarated philosophers were
now filling their lungs with the crisp, humid air.</p>

<p>They looked neither to right nor left. The Stadtholder, easily
recognizable by his plumed bonnet, rides a length or less in
advance of his companion. The fog has not yet swallowed them up.
Diogenes takes all this in. A simple enough picture&mdash;the
sea-fog and two riders speeding towards Utrecht. But a swift
intaking of his breath, a tight closing of his firm lips, indicate
to the others that all is not as simple as it seems.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>Then a very curious thing happened. At first it seemed nothing.
But to the watchers outside Nieuwpoort it had the same effect as a
flash of lightning would have in an apparently cloudless sky. It
began with Nicolaes Beresteyn drawing his horse close up to the
Stadtholder, on his Highness's right. Then for another few seconds
the two riders went along side by side, like one black speck now,
still quite distinguishable through the fog. Socrates and
Pythagoras had their eyes on Diogenes. But Diogenes did not move.
He was frowning, and his face had a set and tense expression. He
had his horse tightly on the curb, and appeared almost wilfully to
fret the animal, who was pawing the wet, sandy ground and covering
itself with lather&mdash;a picture of tearing impatience.</p>

<p>"What do we do now?" Pythagoras exclaimed at last, unable, just
like the horse, to contain his excitement.</p>

<p>"Wait," Diogenes replied curtly. "All may be well after
all."</p>

<p>"In which case?" queried Socrates.</p>

<p>"Nothing!"</p>

<p>A groan of disappointment rose to a couple of parched throats;
but it was never uttered. What went on in the mist on the road to
Utrecht, four hundred yards away, had stifled it at birth.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder's horse had become restive. A simple matter
enough; but in this case unexplainable, because Maurice of Nassau
was a splendid horseman. He could easily have quietened the animal
if there had not been something abnormal in its sudden antics. It
reared and tossed for no apparent reason, would have thrown a less
experienced rider.</p>

<p>"The brute is being teased with a goad," Pythagoras remarked
sententiously.</p>

<p>That was clear enough. Even in the distance, and experienced eye
could have perceived that the horse became more and more
unmanageable every moment, and the Stadtholder's seat more and more
precarious. Then suddenly there came the sharp report of a pistol.
The horse, goaded to madness, took the bit between its teeth, and
with a final plunge bolted across country, away from that strident
noise, which, twice repeated at intervals, had turned its
fretfulness into blind panic.</p>

<p>It was at the first report that Socrates and Pythagoras again
glanced at their leader. A gurgle of delight escaped them when they
caught his eye. They had received their orders. The next moment all
three had dug their spurs in their horses' flanks and were
galloping over sand and ditch.</p>

<p>Diogenes' horse, given free rein at last, after the maddening
curb of awhile ago, was soon half a dozen lengths ahead of the
others, tearing along with all its might at right angles to the
direction in which the Stadtholder's panic-stricken animal was
rushing like one possessed. That direction was Ede.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>In truth, the low-lying land veiled in sea-fog must at that
moment have presented a very curious spectacle. Maurice of Nassau,
Prince of Orange, the hope and pride of the Netherlands, helpless
upon a horse that was running away with him straight in the
direction of the nearest Spanish outposts.</p>

<p>Three soldiers of fortune, strangers, in the land hastening to
intercept him, and a couple of hundred yards or so behind the
Stadtholder, Nicolaes Beresteyn, puzzled and terror-filled at this
unexpected check to his manoeuvre, pushing along for dear life.</p>

<p>It had been such a splendid scheme, evolved over there in the
lonely mill on the Veluwe, between a reprobate and a traitor. The
Spaniards on the watch. The Stadtholder helpless, whilst his mount
carried him headlong into their hands. What a triumph for
Stoutenburg, who had planned it all, and for Nicolaes Beresteyn,
the worker of the infamous plot! The Stadtholder prisoner in the
hands of the Archduchess! His life the price of the subjection of
the Netherlands!</p>

<p>And all to be frustrated by a foolish mischance! Three riders
intent upon intercepting that runaway horse! Who in thunder were
they? The mist, remember, would have blurred Nicolaes' vision. His
thoughts were not just then on the man whom he hated. They were
fixed upon the possibility&mdash;remote, alas!&mdash;of convincing
the Stadtholder after this that the goaded horse had been the
victim of a series of accidents.</p>

<p>Even at this moment the foremost of the three riders had
overtaken the runaway. He galloped for a length or two beside it,
then, with a dexterous and unerring grip, he seized the
panic-stricken animal by the bridle. A few seconds of desperate
struggle 'twixt man and beast. Then man remained the conqueror. The
horse, panting, quivering in every limb, covered in sweat and foam,
was finally brought to a standstill, and the Stadtholder in an
instant had his feet clear of the stirrups and swung himself out of
the saddle.</p>

<p class="cpb">6.</p>

<p>Then, and then only, did Nicolaes Beresteyn recognize the man
who for the second time had frustrated his nefarious
plans&mdash;the man whom, because of his easy triumphs, the
humiliation which he had inflicted upon him, because of his
careless gaiety and his very joy of life, he hated with a curious,
sinister intensity.</p>

<p>A ferocious imprecation rose to his lips. For awhile everything
became a blank. The present, the future, even the past. Everything
became chaos in his mind, he could no longer think. All that he had
planned became a blur, as if the sea-fog had enveloped his senses
as well as the entire landscape.</p>

<p>But this confused mental state only lasted a very little
while&mdash;a few seconds perhaps. Slowly, while he gazed on that
distant group of men and horses, his perceptions became clearer
once more. And even before the imprecation had died on his lips it
gave place to a smile of triumph. Nicolaes Beresteyn had remembered
that his Majesty the devil might well be trusted to care for his
own. Had he not served the hell-born liege lord well?</p>

<p>For the nonce he brought his horse to a halt. It would be worse
than folly to go on. With recognition of those three horsemen over
there had also come the certainty that he was now irretrievably
unmasked. The Stadtholder, his father, his sister, even his young
wife, would turn from him in horror, as from a traitor and an
outcast&mdash;a pariah, marked with the brand of Cain.</p>

<p>No! Henceforth, for good or for evil, his fortunes must be
linked openly with Stoutenburg&mdash;with the man who wielded such
a strange cabalistic power over him that he (Nicolaes)&mdash;rich,
newly wed, in a highly enviable worldly position&mdash;had been
ready to sacrifice his all in his cause, and to throw in the last
shred of his honour into the bargain. In Stoutenburg's
cause&mdash;ay, and in order to be revenged on the man who had
never wronged him save in his conceit&mdash;that most vulnerable
spot in the moral armour of such contemptible rogues as was
Nicolaes Beresteyn.</p>

<p>The spot where he had brought his horse to a halt was
immediately behind a low, deserted hut, which concealed him from
view. Here he dismounted and, throwing the reins over his arm,
advanced cautiously to a point of vantage at the angle of the
little building, whence he could see what those four men were doing
over there but himself remain unseen.</p>

<p>They, too, had dismounted, and were obviously intent on
examining the Stadtholder's horse. A sinister scowl spread over
Nicolaes Beresteyn's face. There was still a chance, then, of
putting a bullet in one or other of those two men&mdash;the hated
enemy or the Stadtholder. Nicolaes pondered; the scowl on his face
became almost satanic in its expression of cruelty. Awhile ago, he
had replaced his pistol in the holster, after it had served its
nefarious purpose. Now he took it out again and examined it
thoroughly.</p>

<p>It had one more charge in it, the devilish charge invented by
the Borgias, the secret of which one of that infamous race had
confided to Stoutenburg. The fumes from the powder when it struck
the eyes must cause irretrievable blindness. Indeed, it had proved
its worth already.</p>

<p>Nicolaes, from his hiding-place, could see those four men quite
clearly. The Stadtholder, Diogenes, the two caitiffs, all standing
round the one horse. Then Diogenes took something out of his belt.
He raised his arm, and the next moment a sharp report rang through
the mistladen air. The poor animal rolled over instantly into the
mud.</p>

<p>The scowl on Nicolaes' face now gave place once more to a smile
of triumph&mdash;more sinister than the frown. With the gesture of
a conqueror, he clutched the pistol more firmly. The potent fumes
had, in truth, wrought their fiendish work on the innocent beast.
Diogenes had just put it out of its misery, and his two familiars
were preparing to mount one of the horses, whilst he and the
Stadtholder had the other two by the reins.</p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p>The miscreant was sure enough of his aim, and the others would
be unprepared. He was sure, too, of the swiftness of his horse, and
the Spanish outposts were less than a quarter of a league away,
whilst within half that distance Stoutenburg was on the watch with
a vedette, waiting to capture the Stadtholder on his runaway horse
as it had been prearranged.</p>

<p>Once there he&mdash;Nicolaes&mdash;would be amongst friends.</p>

<p>Then, why not?</p>

<p>Already the riders had put their horses to a trot. Diogenes and
the Stadtholder on ahead, the two loons some few lengths in their
rear. In less than three minutes they would be within range of
Nicolaes' pistol and its blinding fumes. And Diogenes was riding on
the side nearest to his enemy.</p>

<p>Nicolaes Beresteyn grasped his weapon more firmly. He realized
with infinite satisfaction that his arm was perfectly steady.
Indeed, he had never felt so absolutely calm. The measured tramp of
the horses keyed him up to a point of unswerving determination. He
raised his arm. The horses were galloping now. They would pass like
a flash within twenty paces of him.</p>

<p>The next moment the sharp report of the pistol rang stridently
through the mist. There was a burst, a flash, a column of smoke.
Nicolaes jumped into the saddle and set spurs to his horse. The
other riders went galloping on for a few seconds&mdash;not more.
Then one of them swayed in his saddle. Nicolaes then was a couple
of hundred yards away.</p>

<p>"You are hit, man!" the Stadtholder exclaimed. "That abominable
assassin&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the words died in his throat. The reins had slipped out of
Diogenes' grasp, and he rolled down into the mud.</p>

<p class="cpb">7.</p>

<p>A sudden jerk brought the Stadtholder's horse to a halt. He
swung himself out of the saddle, ran quickly to his companion.</p>

<p>"You are hit, man!" he reiterated; this time with an
unexplainable feeling of dread.</p>

<p>The other seemed so still, and yet his clothes and the soft
earth around him showed no stains of blood.</p>

<p>Pythagoras now was also on the spot. He had slid off the horse
as soon as the infamous assassin had started to ride away. Socrates
was trying to give chase. Even now two pistol-shots rang out in
quick succession right across the moorland. But the hell-hound was
well mounted, and the avenging bullets failed to reach their mark.
All this the Stadtholder took in with a rapid glance, even whilst
Pythagoras, round-eyed and scared, was striving with gentle means
to raise the strangely inert figure.</p>

<p>"He hath swooned," the Stadtholder suggested.</p>

<p>The stricken man had one arm across his face. His had had fallen
from his head, leaving the fine, square brow free and the crisp
hair weighted by the sweat of some secret agony. The mouth, too,
was visible, and the chin, with its four days' growth of beard, the
mouth that was always ready with a smile. It was set now in an
awesome contraction of pain, and, withal, that terrible
immobility.</p>

<p>Now Socrates was arriving. A moment or two later he, too, had
dismounted, cursing lustily that he had failed to hit the
hell-hound. A mute query, an equally mute reply, was all that
passed between him and Pythagoras.</p>

<p>Then the stricken man stirred as if suddenly roused to
consciousness.</p>

<p>"Are you hit, man?" the Stadtholder queried again.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no!" he replied quickly. "Only a little dazed. That is
all."</p>

<p>He raised himself to a sitting posture, helping himself up with
his hands, which sank squelching into the mud; whereat he gave a
short laugh, which somehow went a cold shiver down the listener's
spines.</p>

<p>"Where is my hat?" he asked. "Pythagoras, you lazy loon, get me
my hat."</p>

<p>He must indeed have been still dazed, for when his friend picked
up the hat and gave it to him, his hand shot out for it quite wide
of the mark. He gave another laugh, short and toneless as before,
and set the hat on his head, pulling down well over his eyes.</p>

<p>"I had a mugful of hot ale at Amersfoort before starting," he
said. "It must have got into my head."</p>

<p>He made no attempt to get to his feet, but just sat there, with
his two slender hands all covered with mud, tightly clasped between
his knees.</p>

<p>"Can you get to horse?" his Highness queried at last.</p>

<p>"No," Diogenes replied, "not just yet, an' it please you, I
verily think that I would roll out of my saddle again, which would,
in truth, be a disgusting spectacle."</p>

<p>"But we cannot leave you here, man," the Stadtholder rejoined,
with a slight tone of impatience.</p>

<p>"And why not, I pray you?" he retorted. "Your Highness must get
to Utrecht as quickly as may be. A half-drunken lout like me would
only be a hindrance."</p>

<p>His voice was thick now and halting, in very truth like that of
a man who had been drinking heavily. He rested his elbows on his
knees and held his chin between his mud-stained hands.</p>

<p>"Socrates, you lumpish vagabond," he exclaimed all of a sudden,
"don't stand gaping at me like that! Bring forth his Highness's
horse at once, and see that you accompany him to Utrecht without
further mishap, or 'tis with us you'll have to deal on your
return!"</p>

<p>"But you, man!" the Stadtholder exclaimed once more.</p>

<p>He felt helpless and strangely disturbed in his mind, not
understanding what all this meant; why this man, usually so alert,
so keen, so full of vigour, appeared for the moment akin to a
babbling imbecile.</p>

<p>"I'll have a good sleep inside that hut, so please you," the
other replied more glibly. "These two ruffians will find me here
after they have seen your gracious Highness safely inside your
camp."</p>

<p>Then, as the Stadtholder still appeared to hesitate, and neither
of the others seemed to move, Diogenes added, with an almost
desperate note of entreaty:</p>

<p>"To horse, your Highness, I beg! Every second is precious.
Heaven knows what further devilry lies in wait for you, if you
linger here."</p>

<p>"Or for you, man," the Stadtholder murmured involuntarily.</p>

<p>"Nay, not for me!" the other retorted quickly. "The Archduchess
and her gang of vultures fly after higher game than a drunken
wayfarer lost on the flats. To horse, I entreat!"</p>

<p>And once more he pressed his hands together, and so tightly that
the knuckles shone like polished ivory, even through their covering
of mud.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder then gave a sign to the two men. It was
obviously futile to continue arguing here with a man who refused to
move. He himself had very rightly said that every second was
precious. And every second, too, was fraught with danger. Already
his Highness had well-nigh been the victim of a diabolical
ambuscade, might even at this hour have been a prisoner in the
hands of the enemy, a hostage of incalculable value, even if his
life had been spared, but for the audacious and timely interference
of this man, who now appeared almost like one partially bereft of
reason.</p>

<p>"We'll see you safely inside the hut, at any rate," was his
Highness's last word.</p>

<p>"And I'll not move," Diogenes retorted with a kind of savage
obstinacy, "until the mist has swallowed up your gracious Highness
on the road to Utrecht."</p>

<p>After that there was nothing more to be said. And we may take it
that the Stadtholder got to horse with unaccountable reluctance.
Something in that solitary figure sitting there, with the plumed
hat tilted over his eyes and the slender, mud-stained hands tightly
locked together, gave him a strange feeling of nameless dismay,
like a premonition of some obscure catastrophic tragedy.</p>

<p>But his time and his safety did not belong to himself alone.
They were the inalienable property of a threatened country, that
would be grasping in her death-throes if she were deprived of him
at this hour of renewed and deadly danger. So he gathered the reins
in his hands and set spurs to his horse, and once he had started he
did not look behind him, lest his emotion got the better of his
judgement.</p>

<p>The two gossoons immediately followed in his wake. This they did
because the friend they had always been wont to obey had thus
commanded, and his seeming helplessness rendered his orders doubly
imperative at this hour. They rode a length or two behind the
Stadtholder, who presently put his horse to a gallop. Utrecht now
was only a couple of leagues away.</p>

<p>The three horsemen galloped on for a quarter of a league or less
at the same even, rapid pace. Then Pythagoras slackened speed. The
others did not even turn to look at him, he seemed to have done it
by tacit unspoken consent. The Stadtholder and Socrates sped on in
the direction of Utrecht and Pythagoras turned his horse's head
round toward the direction whence he had come.</p>

<p class="cpb">8.</p>

<p>The afternoon lay heavy and silent upon the plain. There was as
yet no sign of the approach of the enemy from the south, and the
low-lying land appeared momentarily hushed under its veil of mist,
as if conscious of the guilty secret enshrined within its bosom.
The fog, indeed, had thickened perceptibly. It lay like a wall
around that lonely figure, still sitting there on the soft earth,
with its head buried in its hands.</p>

<p>Far away, the gaunt-looking carcase of the dead horse appeared
as the only witness of a hideous deed as yet un-recorded. Each a
blurred and uncertain mass&mdash;the dead horse and the lonely
figure, equally motionless, equally pathetic&mdash;were now the
sole occupants of the vast and silent immensity.</p>

<p>Not far away, in the little town of Amersfoort, humanity,
panic-stricken and terrorized, filled the air with clamour and with
wails. Here, beneath the ghostly shroud of humid atmosphere,
everything was stilled as if in ghoulish expectancy of something
mysterious, indiscernible which was still to come. It was like the
arrested breath before the tearing cry, the hush which precedes a
storm.</p>

<p>Overhead, a flight of rooks sent their melancholy cawing through
the air.</p>

<p>When Pythagoras was within fifty yards of his friend he
dismounted, and, leading his horse by the bridle, he walked toward
him. When he was quite near Diogenes put out a hand to him.</p>

<p>"I knew you would come back, you fat-witted nonny," he said
simply.</p>

<p>"Socrates had to go on with the Stadtholder," the other
remarked, "or he'd be here, too." Then he added tentatively: "Will
you lean on my arm?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll have to do that now, old crony, shall I not?"
Diogenes replied. "That devil," he murmured under his breath, "has
blinded me!"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX&mdash;MALA FIDES</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Nicolaes Beresteyn, riding like one possessed had reached
Stoutenburg's encampment one hour before nightfall. He brought the
news of the failure of his plan for the capture of the Stadtholder,
spoke with many a muttered oath of the Englishman and his two
familiars, and of how they had interposed just in the nick of time
to stop the runaway horse.</p>

<p>"But for that cursed rogue!" he exclaimed savagely, "Maurice of
Nassau would now be a prisoner in our hands. We would be holding
him to ransom, earning gratitude, honours, wealth at the hands of
the Archduchess. Whereas&mdash;now&mdash;"</p>

<p>But there was solace to the bitterness of this disappointment.
The blinding powder, invented by the infamous Borgia, had done its
work. The abominable rogue, the nameless adventurer, who had twice
succeeded in thwarting the best-laid schemes of his lordship of
Stoutenburg, had paid the full penalty for his audacity and his
arrogant interference.</p>

<p>Blind, helpless, broken, an object now of contemptuous pity
rather than of hate, he was henceforth powerless to wreak further
mischief.</p>

<p>"Just before I put my horse to a swift gallop," Nicolaes
Beresteyn had concluded, "I saw him sway in the saddle and roll
down into the mud. One of the vagabonds tried to chase me; but my
horse bore me well and I was soon out of his reach."</p>

<p>That news did, indeed compensate Stoutenburg for all the
humiliation which he had endured at the hands of his successful
rival in the past. A rival no longer; for the Laughing Cavalier,
blind and helpless, was not like ever to return to claim his young
wealthy wife and to burden her with his misery. This last tribute
to the man's pluck and virility Stoutenburg paid him unconsciously.
He could not visualize that splendid creature, so full of life and
gaiety, and conscious of might strength, groping his way back to
the side of the woman whom he had dazzled by his power.</p>

<p>"He would sooner die in a ditch," he muttered to himself, under
his breath, "than excite her pity!"</p>

<p>"Then the field is clear for me!" he added exultantly; and fell
to discussing with Nicolaes his chances of regaining Gilda's
affections. "Do you think she ever cared for the rogue?" he
queried, with a strange quiver of emotion in his harsh voice.</p>

<p>Nicolaes was doubtful. He himself had never been in love. He
liked his young wife well enough; she was comely and rich. But
love? No, he could not say.</p>

<p>"She'll not know what has become of him," Stoutenburg said,
striving to allay his own doubts. "And women very quickly
forget."</p>

<p>He sighed, proud of his own manly passion that had survived so
many vicissitudes, and was linked to such a tenacious memory.</p>

<p>"We must not let her know," Nicolaes insisted.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg gave a short, sardonic laugh. "Are you afraid she
might kill you if she did?" he queried.</p>

<p>Then, as the other made no reply, but stood there brooding, his
soul a prey to a sudden horror, which was not unlike a vague pang
of remorse, Stoutenburg concluded cynically:</p>

<p>"I'll give the order that every blind beggar found wandering
around the city be forthwith hanged on the nearest tree. Will that
allay your fears?"</p>

<p>Thereafter he paid no further heed to Nicolaes, whom, in his
heart, he despised for a waverer and a weakling; but he gave orders
to his master of the camp to make an immediate start for
Amersfoort.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Amersfoort had, in the meanwhile, so De Voocht avers, become
wonderfully calm. Those whose nerves would not stand the strain of
seeing the hated tyrants once more within the gates of their
peace-loving little city, those who had no responsibilities, and
those who had families, fled at the first rumour of the enemy's
approach. Indeed, for many hours the streets and open places, the
quays and the sleepy, sluggish river, had on the first day been
nothing short of a pandemonium. Then everything gradually became
hushed and tranquil. Those who were panic-stricken had all gone by
nightfall; those who remained knew the risk they were taking, and
sat in their homes, waiting and pondering. Amersfoort that evening
might have been a city of the dead.</p>

<p>Darkness set in early, and the sea-fog thickened at sundown.
Some wiseacres said that the Spaniards would not come until the
next day. They proved to be right. The dawn had hardly spread o'er
the whole of the eastern sky on the morning of the twenty-second,
when the master of the enemy's camp was heard outside the ramparts,
demanding the surrender of the city.</p>

<p>The summons was received in absolute silence. The gates were
open, and the mercenaries marched in. In battle array, with banners
flying, with pikemen, halberdiers and arquebusiers; with fifes and
drums and a trainload of wagons and horses, and the usual rabble of
beggarly camp followers, they descended on the city like locusts;
and soon every tavern was filled to overflowing with loud-voiced,
swarthy, ill-mannered soldiery, and all the streets and places
encumbered with their carts and their horses and their
trappings.</p>

<p>They built a bonfire in the middle of the market-place, and all
around it a crowd of out-at-elbows ruffians, men, women, and
children, filled the air with their shrieks and their bibulous
songs. Some four thousand troops altogether, so De Voocht states,
spread themselves out over the orderly, prosperous town, invaded
the houses, broke open the cellars and storehouses, made the day
hideous with their noise and their roistering.</p>

<p>As many as could found shelter in the deserted homes of the
burghers; others used the stately kerks as stabling for their
horses and camping ground for themselves. The inhabitants offered
no resistance. A century of unspeakable tyranny ere they had gained
their freedom had taught them the stern lesson of submitting to the
inevitable. The Stadtholder had ordered them to submit. Until he
could come to their rescue they must swallow the bitter cup of
resignation to the dregs. It could not be for long. He who before
now had swept the Spanish hordes off the sacred soil of the United
Provinces could do so again. It was only a case for a little
patience. And patience was a virtue which these grave sons of a
fighting race knew how to practise to its utmost limit.</p>

<p>And so the burghers of Amersfoort who had remained in the city
in order to watch over its fate and over their property submitted
without murmur to the arrogant demands of the invaders. Their wives
ministered in proud silence to the wants of the insolent rabble.
The saw their dower-chests ransacked, their effects destroyed or
stolen, their provisions wasted and consumed. They waited hand and
foot, like serving wenches, upon their tyrants; for, indeed, it had
been the proletariat who had been the first to flee.</p>

<p>They even succeeded in keeping back their tears when they saw
their husbands&mdash;the more noted burghers of the
town&mdash;dragged as hostages before the commander of the invading
troops, who had taken up his quarters in the burgomaster's
house.</p>

<p>That commander was the Lord of Stoutenburg. In high favour with
the Archduchess now, he had desired leave to carry through this
expedition to Amersfoort. Private grudge against the man who had
robbed him of Gilda, or lust for revenge against the Stadtholder
for the execution of Olden Barneveldt, who can tell? Who can read
the inner workings of a tortuous brain, or appraise the passions of
an embittered heart?</p>

<p>Attended by all the sinister paraphernalia which he now
affected, the Lord of Stoutenburg entered Amersfoort in the late
afternoon as a conqueror, his eyes glowing with the sense of
triumph over a successful rival and of power over a disdainful
woman. The worthy citizens of the little town gazed with
astonishment and dread upon his sable banner, broidered in silver
with a skull and crossbones&mdash;the emblem of his relentlessness,
now that the day of reckoning had come.</p>

<p>He rode through the city, hardly noticing its silent death-like
appearance. Not one glance did he bestow on the closed shutters to
the right or left of him. His eyes were fixed upon the tall
pinnacled roof of the burgomaster's house, silhouetted against the
western sky, the stately abode on the quay where, in the days long
since gone by, he had been received as an honoured guest. Since
then what a world of sorrow, of passion, of endless misery had been
his lot! It seemed as if, on the day when he became false to Gilda
Beresteyn in order to wed the rich and influential daughter of
Marnix de St. Aldegonde, fickle fortune had finally turned her back
on him. His father and brother ended their days of the scaffold;
his wife, abandoned by him and broken-hearted; he himself a
fugitive with a price upon his head, a potential assassin, and that
vilest thing on earth, a man who sells his country to her
enemies.</p>

<p>No wonder that, at a comparatively early age, the Lord of
Stoutenburg looked a careworn and wearied man. The lines on his
face were deep and harsh, his hair was turning grey at the temples.
Only the fire in his deepset eyes was fierce and strong, for it was
fed with the fire of an ever-enduring passion&mdash;hatred. Hatred
of the Stadtholder; hatred of the nameless adventurer who had
thwarted him at every turn; hatred of the woman who had shut him
out wholly from her heart.</p>

<p>But now the hour of triumph had come. For it had schemed and
lied and striven and never once given way to despair. It had come,
crowned with immeasurable success. The Stadtholder&mdash;thanks to
the subtle poison of an infamous Borgia, administered by a
black-hearted assassin&mdash;was nothing but a physical wreck;
whilst those who had brought him&mdash;Stoutenburg&mdash;to his
knees three short months ago were at his mercy at last. A longing
as cruel as it was vengeful had possession of his soul whenever he
thought of these two facts.</p>

<p>His schemes were not yet mature, and he had not yet arrived at
any definite conclusion as to how he would reach the ultimate goal
of his desires; but this he did know&mdash;that the Stadtholder was
too sick to put up a fight for Amersfoort, and that Gilda and her
stranger lover were definitely parted, and both of them entirely in
his power. Their fate was as absolutely in his hands as his had
once been in theirs. And the Lord of Stoutenburg, with his eyes
raised to the pinnacled roof of the house that sheltered the woman
whom he still loved with such passionate ardour, felt that for the
first time for this man a year he might count himself as almost
happy.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>Nicolaes Beresteyn was among the last to enter his native city.
He did so as a shameless traitor, a dishonoured gambler who had
staked his all upon a hellish die. Indeed now he seemed like a man
possessed, careless of his crime, exulting in it even. The vague
fear of meeting his father and Gilda eye to eye seemed somehow to
add zest to his adventure. He did not know how much they knew, or
what they guessed, but felt a strange thrill within his tortuous
soul at the thought of standing up before them as their master, of
defying them and deriding their reproaches.</p>

<p>His young wife he knew to be away. Her father had started off
for Amsterdam with his family and his servants at the first rumour
of the enemy's approach. In any case she was his. She and her
wealth and Mynheer van den Poele's influence and business
connexions. He&mdash;Nicolaes&mdash;who had always been second in
his father's affections always subservient to Gilda and to Gilda's
interests, and who since that affair in January had been treated
like a skulking schoolboy in the paternal home, would now rule
there as a conqueror, a protector on whose magnanimity the comfort
of the entire household would depend.</p>

<p>These and other thoughts&mdash;memories, self-pity, rage, too,
and hatred, and imputations against fate&mdash;coursed through his
mind as he rode into his native city at the head of the rearguard
of Stoutenburg's troops. He drew rein outside his father's house.
Not the slightest stirring of his dormant conscience troubled him
as he ran swiftly up the familiar stone steps.</p>

<p>With the heavy basket-hilt of his rapier he rapped vigorously
against the stout oak panels of the door, demanding admittance in
the name of the Archduchess Isabella, Sovereign Liege Lady of the
Netherlands. At once the doors flew open, as if moved by a spring.
Two elderly serving-men stood alone in the hall, silent and
respectful.</p>

<p>At the sight of their young master they both made a movement as
if to run to him, deluded for the moment into hopes of salvation,
relief from this awful horror of imminent invasion. But he paid no
heed to them. His very look chilled them and froze the words of
welcome upon their lips, as he strode quickly past them into the
hall.</p>

<p>The shades of evening were now rapidly drawing in. Except for
the two serving-men, the house appeared deserted. In perfect order,
but strangely still and absolutely dark. As he looked about him,
Nicolaes felt as if he were in a vault. A cold shiver ran down his
spine. Curtly he bade the men bring lighted candles into the
banqueting-hall.</p>

<p>Here, too, silence and darkness reigned. In the huge monumental
hearth a few dying embers were still smouldering, casting a warm
glow upon the red tiles, and flicking the knobs and excrescences of
the brass tools with minute crimson sparks.</p>

<p>Nicolaes felt his nerves tingling. He groped his way to one of
the windows, and with an impatient hand tore at the casement.
Stoutenburg's troops were now swarming everywhere. The quay was
alive with movement. Some of the soldiers were bivouacking against
the house, had build up a fire, the ruddy glow of which, together
with the flicker of resin torches, thew a weird and uncertain light
into the room. Nicolaes felt his teeth chattering with cold. His
hands were like fire. Could it be that he was afraid&mdash;afraid
that in a moment or two he would hear familiar footsteps coming
down the stairs, that in a moment or two he would have to face the
outraged father, come to curse his traitor son?</p>

<p>Bah! This was sheer cowardice! But a brief while ago he had
exulted in his treachery, gloried in his callous disregard of his
monstrous crime. How it seemed to him that a pair of sightless yet
still mocking eyes glared at him from out the gloom. With a shudder
and a quickly smothered cry of horror, Nicolaes buried his face in
his hands.</p>

<p>The next moment the two serving-men came in, carrying lighted
candles in heavy silver candelabra. These they set upon the table;
and one of them, kneeling beside the hearth, plied the huge
bellows, coaxing the dying embers into flame. After which they
stood respectfully by, awaiting further commands. Obviously they
had had their orders&mdash;absolute obedience and all those outward
forms of respect which they were able to accord. Nicolaes looked at
them with a fierce, defying glance. He knew them both well.
Greybeards in the service of his father, they had seen the young
master grow up from cradle to this hour when he stood, a rebel and
a skunk, on the paternal hearth.</p>

<p>But they did not flinch under his glance. They knew that they
had been specially chosen for the unpleasant task of waiting upon
the enemy commanders because their tempers had no longer the
ebullience of youth, and they might be trusted to remain calm in
the face of arrogance or even of savagery&mdash;even in the face of
Mynheer Nicolaes, the child they had loved, the youth they had
admired, now a branded traitor, who had come like a thief in the
night to barter his honour for a crown of shame.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>A certain commotion outside on the quay proclaimed the fact that
the commander of the troops, the Lord of Stoutenburg, had entered
the town at the head of his bodyguard, and followed by his master
of the camp and his equerries.</p>

<p>He, too, made straight for the burgomaster's house, brought his
horse to a halt at the foot of the stone steps. With a curt nod,
Nicolaes bade the old crones to run to the front door and receive
his Magnificence. In this, as in everything else, the men obeyed at
once and in silence.</p>

<p>But already Stoutenburg, preceded by his equerries and his
torchbearers, had stepped across the threshold. He knew his way
well about the house. As boys, he and his brother Groeneveld had
played their games in and around the intricate passages and stairs.
As a young man he had sat in the deep window embrasures, holding
Gilda's hand, taking delight in terrifying her with his impetuous
love, and forcing her consent to his suit by his masterful wooing.
A world of memories, grave and gay, swept over him as he entered
the banqueting-hall, where, but for his many misfortunes&mdash;as
he callously called h is crimes&mdash;he would one day have sat at
the bridegroom's table beside Gilda, his plighted wife.</p>

<p>Both he and Nicolaes felt unaccountably relieved at meeting one
another here. For both of them, no doubt, the silence and gloom of
this memory-haunted house would in the long run have proved
unendurable.</p>

<p>"I did not know that I should meet you here," Stoutenburg
exclaimed, as he grasped his friend by the hand.</p>

<p>"I thought it would be best," Nicolaes replied curtly.</p>

<p>But this warm greeting from the infamous arch-traitor, in the
presence of the two loyal old servants, brought a hot flush to the
young man's brow. The last faint warning from his drugged
conscience, mayhap. But the feeling of shame faded away as swiftly
as it had come, and the next moment he was standing by, impassive
and seemingly unconcerned, while the Lord of Stoutenburg gave his
orders to the men.</p>

<p>These orders were to prepare the necessary beds for my lord and
for Mynheer Nicolaes Beresteyn, also for the equerries, and proper
accommodation for my lord's bodyguard, which consisted of twenty
musketeers with their captain. Moreover, to provide supper for his
Magnificence and mynheer in the banqueting-hall, and for the rest
of the company in some other suitable room, without delay.</p>

<p>The two old crones took the orders in silence, bowed, and
prepared to leave the room.</p>

<p>"Stay," my lord commanded. "Where is the burgomaster?"</p>

<p>"In his private apartments, so please you," one of the men
replied.</p>

<p>"And his daughter?"</p>

<p>"The <i>jongejuffrouw</i> is with Mynheer the Burgomaster."</p>

<p>"Tell them both I want them to sup here with me and Mynheer
Nicolaes."</p>

<p>Again the men bowed with the same silent dignity. It was
impossible to gather from their stolid, mask-like faces what their
thoughts might be at this hour. When they had gone, Stoutenburg
peremptorily dismissed his equerries.</p>

<p>"If you have anything to complain of in this house," he said
curtly, "come and report to me at once. To-morrow we leave at
dawn."</p>

<p>Both the equerries gave a gasp of astonishment.</p>

<p>"To-morrow?" one of them murmured, apparently quite taken aback
by this order.</p>

<p>"At dawn," Stoutenburg reiterated briefly.</p>

<p>This was enough. Neither did the equerries venture on further
remarks. They had served for some time now under his Magnificence,
knew his obstinacy and the irrevocableness of his decisions when
once he had spoken.</p>

<p>"No further commands until then, my lord?" was all that the
spokesman said.</p>

<p>"None for you," Stoutenburg replied curtly. "But tell Jan that
the moment&mdash;the moment, you understand&mdash;that the
burgomaster enters this room, he is to be prevented from doing any
mischief. If he carries a weapon, he must at once be disarmed; if
he resists, there should be a length of rope handy wherewith to tie
his hands behind his back. But otherwise I'll not have him hurt.
Understand?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, my lord," the equerry gave answer. "'Tis simple
enough."</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>Now the two friends&mdash;brothers in crime&mdash;were alone in
the vast, panelled hall.</p>

<p>Nicolaes had said nothing, made no movement of indignation or
protest, when the other delivered his monstrous and treacherous
commands against the personal liberty of the burgomaster. He had
sat sullen and glowering, his head resting against his hand.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg looked down on him for a moment or two, his deep-set
eyes full of that contempt which he felt for this weak-kneed and
conscience-plagued waverer. Then he curtly advised him to leave the
room.</p>

<p>"You might not think it seemly," he remarked with a sneer, "to
be present when I take certain preventive measures against your
father. These measures are necessary, else I would not take them.
You would not have him spitting some of our men, or mayhap do
himself or Gilda some injury, would you?"</p>

<p>"I was not complaining," Nicolaes retorted dryly.</p>

<p>Indeed, he obeyed readily enough. Now that the time had come to
meet his father, he shrank from the ordeal with horror. It would
have come, of course; but, like all weak natures, Nicolaes was
always on the side of procrastination. He rose without another
word, and, avoiding the main door of the banqueting-hall, he went
out by the back one, which gave on a narrow antechamber and thence
on the service staircase.</p>

<p>"I'll remain in the ante-chamber," he said. "Call me when you
wish."</p>

<p>Stoutenburg shrugged his shoulders. He was glad to remain alone
for awhile&mdash;alone with that wealth of memories which would not
be chased away. Memories of childhood, of adolescence, of youth
untainted with crime; of love, before greed and ambition had caused
him to betray so basely the girl who had believed in him.</p>

<p>"If Gilda had remained true to me," he sighed, with almost
cynical inconsequence, exacting fidelity where he had given none.
"If she had stuck to me that night in Haarlem everything would have
been different."</p>

<p>He went up to the open window, and, leaning his arm against the
mullion, he gazed upon the busy scene below. The current of cold,
humid air appeared to do him good. His arquebusiers and pikemen,
bivouacking round the spluttering fires, striving to keep the damp
air out of their stiffening limbs; the shouts, the songs, the
peremptory calls; the shrieks of frightened women and children; the
loud Spanish oaths; the medley of curses in every tongue&mdash;all
this confused din pertaining to strife seemed to work like a tonic
upon his brooding spirit. A blind beggar soliciting alms among the
soldiery chased all softer thoughts away.</p>

<p>"Hey, there!" he shouted fiercely, to one of the soldiers who
happened just then to have caught his eye, "Have I not given orders
that every blind beggar lurking around the city be hung to the
nearest tree?"</p>

<p>The men laughed. A monstrously tyrannical order such as that
suited their present mood.</p>

<p>"But this one was inside the city, so please your Magnificence,"
one of them protested with a cynical laugh, "when we arrived."</p>

<p>"All the more reason why he should be hung forthwith!"
Stoutenburg riposted savagely in reply.</p>

<p>A loud guffaw greeted this inhuman order. His Magnificence was
loudly cheered, his health drunk in deep goblets of stolen wine.
Then a search was made for the blind beggar. But he, luckily for
himself, had in the meanwhile taken to his heels.</p>

<p class="cpb">6.</p>

<p>The next moment a slight noise behind him caused the Lord of
Stoutenburg to turn on his heel. The door had been thrown open, and
the burgomaster, having his daughter on his arm, stood upon the
threshold. He was dressed in his robes of office, with black cloak
and velvet bonnet; but he wore a steel gorget round his neck and
rapier by his side.</p>

<p>At the sight of his arch enemy, he had paused under the lintel,
and the ashen pallor of his cheeks became more marked. But he had
no time to move, for in an instant Jan and three or four men were
all around him.</p>

<p>At this treacherous onslaught a fierce oath escaped Beresteyn's
lips. In an instant his sword was out of its scabbard, he himself
at bay, covering Gilda with his body, and facing the men who had
thus scurrilously rushed on him out of the gloom.</p>

<p>But obviously resistance was futile. Already he was surrounded
and disarmed, Gilda torn forcibly away from him, thrust into a
corner, whilst he himself was rendered helpless, even though he
fought and struggled magnificently. The whole unequal combat had
only lasted a few seconds; and now the grand old man stood like a
fettered lion, glowering and defiant, his hands tied behind his
back with a length of rope, against which he was straining with all
his might.</p>

<p>One of the most disloyal pitfalls ever devised against an
unsuspecting civilian&mdash;and he the chief dignitary of a
peace-loving city. Stoutenburg watched the scene with an evil
glitter in his restless eyes. Shame and compunction did, in truth,
bear no part in his emotions at this moment. He was exulting in the
thought of his vile stratagem, pleased that he had thought of
enticing Gilda hither by summoning her father at the same time. It
was amusing to watch them both&mdash;the burgomaster still
dignified, despite his helplessness, and Gilda beautiful in her
indignation. By St. Bavon, the girl was lovely, and still
desirable. And thank Beelzebub and all the powers of darkness who
lent their aid in placing so exquisite a prize in the hands of the
conqueror.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg could have laughed aloud with glee. As it was, he
made an effort to appear both masterful and indifferent. He knew
that he could take his time, that any scheme which he might
formulate for his own advancement and the satisfaction of his every
ambition was now certain of success. The future was entirely his,
to plan and mould at will.</p>

<p>So now he deliberately turned back to the window, closed it with
a hand that had not the slightest tremor in it. Then he returned to
the centre of the room, sat down beside the table, and took on a
cool and judicial air. All his movements were consciously slow. He
looked at the burgomaster and at Gilda with ostentatious irony,
remained silent for awhile as if in pleasant contemplation of their
helplessness. "You are in suspense," his silence seemed to express.
"You know that your fate is in my hands. But I can afford to wait,
to take mine ease. I am lord of the future, and you are little
better than my slaves."</p>

<p>"Was it not foolishness to resist, mynheer?" he said at last, in
a tone of gentle mockery. "Bloodshed, eh? In truth, the role of
fire-eater ill becomes your dignity and your years."</p>

<p>"Spare me your insults, my lord," Beresteyn retorted, with calm
dignity. "What is your pleasure with my daughter and with me?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you anon," Stoutenburg replied coolly, "when you
are more composed."</p>

<p>"I am ready now to hear your commands."</p>

<p>"Quite submissive, eh?" the other retorted with a sneer.</p>

<p>"No; only helpless, and justly indignant at this abominable
outrage."</p>

<p>"Also surprised&mdash;what?&mdash;at seeing me here
to-night?"</p>

<p>"In truth, my lord, I had not expected to see the son of Olden
Barneveldt at the head of enemy troops."</p>

<p>"Or <i>your</i> son in his train, eh?"</p>

<p>The burgomaster winced at the taunt. But he rejoined quite
simply:</p>

<p>"If what rumour says is true, my lord, then I have no son."</p>

<p>"If," Stoutenburg retorted dryly, "rumour told you that Nicolaes
Beresteyn hath returned to his allegiance, then the jade did not
lie. Your son, mynheer, hath shown you which way loyalty lies. Not
in the service of a rebel prince, but in that of Archduchess
Isabella, our Sovereign Liege."</p>

<p>He paused, as if expecting some word of reply from the
burgomaster; but as the latter remained silent, he went on more
lightly:</p>

<p>"But enough of this. Whether you, Mynheer Beresteyn, and your
son do make up your differences presently is no concern of mine.
You will see him anon, no doubt, and can then discuss your family
affairs at your leisure. For the nonce, I do desire to know whether
your city intends to be submissive. I have exercised great leniency
up to this hour; but you must remember that I am equally ready to
punish at the slightest sign of contumely or of resistance to my
commands."</p>

<p>"For the leniency to which the Lord of Stoutenburg lays claim,"
Beresteyn rejoined with perfect dignity, "in that, up to this hour
he has not murdered our peaceful citizens, burned down our houses,
or violated our homes, we tender him our thanks. As for the future,
the treacherous pitfall into which I have fallen, and the
unwarrantable treatment that is meted out to me, will mayhap prove
to my unfortunate fellow-citizens that resistance to overwhelming
force is worse than useless."</p>

<p>"Excellent sentiments, mynheer!" Stoutenburg retorted.
"Dictated, I make no doubt, by one who knows the usages of
war."</p>

<p>"We do all of us," the burgomaster gave quiet answer, "obey the
behests of our Stadtholder, our Sovereign Liege."</p>

<p>"The rebel prince, mynheer, who, by commanding you to submit,
hath for once gauged rightly the temper of the Sovereign whom he
hath outraged. Will you tell me, I pray you," Stoutenburg added,
with a sardonic grin, "whether the <i>jongejuffrouw</i> your
daughter is equally prepared to obey Maurice of Nassau's behests
and submit to my commands?"</p>

<p>At this cruel thrust an almost imperceptible change came over
the burgomaster's calm, dignified countenance; and even this change
was scarce noticeable in the uncertain, flickering light of the wax
candles. Perhaps he had realized, for the first time, the full
horror of his position, the full treachery of the snare which had
been laid for him, and which left him, pinioned and helpless, at
the mercy of an unscrupulous and cowardly enemy. Not only him, but
also his daughter.</p>

<p>A groan like that of a wounded beast escaped his lips, and his
powerful arms and shoulders strained at the cords that fettered
him. Nevertheless, after a very brief moment of silence he rejoined
with perfect outward calm:</p>

<p>"My daughter, my lord, was under my protection until vile
treachery rendered me helpless. Now that her father can no longer
watch over her, she is under the protection of every man of
honour."</p>

<p>"That is excellently said, mynheer," Stoutenburg replied. "And
in a few words you have put the whole situation tersely and
clearly. You have orders from the Stadtholder to obey my commands;
therefore I do but make matters easier for you by having you
removed to your apartments, instead of merely commanding you to
return thither&mdash;an order which, if you were free, you might
have been inclined to disobey."</p>

<p>"A truce on your taunts, my lord!" broke in the burgomaster
firmly. "What is your pleasure with us?"</p>

<p>"Just what I have had the honour to tell you," Stoutenburg
replied coolly. "That you return forthwith to your apartments."</p>

<p>"But my daughter, my lord?"</p>

<p>"She sups here, with her brother Nicolaes and with me."</p>

<p>"'Tis only my dead body you'll drag away from here," the
burgomaster rejoined quietly.</p>

<p>Once more Stoutenburg broke into that harsh, mirthless laugh
which had become habitual to him and which seemed to find its
well-spring in the bitterness of his soul.</p>

<p>"Fine heroics, mynheer!" he said derisively. "But useless, I
fear me, and quite unnecessary. Were I to assure you that your
daughter hath ceased to rouse the slightest passion in my heart or
to stir my senses in any way, you would mayhap not credit me. Yet
such is the case. The <i>jongejuffrouw</i>, I'll have you believe,
will be as safe with me as would the ugliest old hag out of the
street."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, my lord," Beresteyn rejoined with calm dignity,
"whilst I live I remain by my daughter's side."</p>

<p>Stoutenburg shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Jan," he called, "take mynheer the burgomaster back to his
apartments. I have no further use for him."</p>

<p class="cpb">7.</p>

<p>Mynheer Beresteyn was still a comparatively young and vigorous
man. In his day, he had been counted one of the finest soldiers in
the armies of the Prince of Orange, and had accomplished prodigies
of skill and valour at Turnhout and Ostend. The feeling that at
this moment, when he would have given his life to protect his
daughter, he was absolutely helpless, was undoubtedly the most
cruel blow he had ever had to endure at the hands of Fate. His
eyes, pathetic in their mute appeal for forgiveness, sought those
of Gilda. She had remained perfectly still all this while, silent
in the dark corner whither Jan and the soldiers had thrust her at
their first onslaught on the burgomaster. But she had watched the
whole scene with ever-increasing horror, not at thought of herself,
of her own danger, only of her father and all that he must be
suffering. Now her one idea was to reassure him, to ease the burden
of sorrow and of wrath which his own impotence must have laid upon
his brave soul.</p>

<p>Before any of the men could stop her, she had evaded them. Swift
and furtive as a tiny lizard, she had wormed her way between them
to her father's side. Now she had her arms round his neck, her head
against his breast.</p>

<p>"Do not be anxious because of me, father dear," she whispered
under her breath. "God hath us all in His keeping. Have no fear for
me."</p>

<p>A deep groan escaped the old man's breast. His eyes, fierce and
indignant, rested with an expression of withering contempt upon his
enemy.</p>

<p>"Jan," Stoutenburg broke in harshly, "didst not hear my
commands?"</p>

<p>Four pairs of hands immediately closed upon the burgomaster. He,
like a creature at bay, started to struggle.</p>

<p>"Some one knock that old fool on the head!" his lordship shouted
with a fierce oath.</p>

<p>And Jan raised his fist, overwilling to obey. But, with a loud
cry of indignation, Gilda had already interposed. She seized the
man's wrist with her own small hands and turned flaming eyes upon
Stoutenburg.</p>

<p>"Violence is unnecessary, my lord," she said, vainly striving to
speak coolly and firmly. "My father will go quietly, and I will
remain here to listen to what you have to say."</p>

<p>"Bravely spoken!" Stoutenburg rejoined with a sneer. "And you,
Mynheer Beresteyn, would do well to learn wisdom at so fair a
source. You and your precious daughter will come to no harm if you
behave like reasonable beings. There is such a thing," he added
cynically, "as submitting to the inevitable."</p>

<p>"Do not trust him, Gilda," the old man cried. "False to his
country, false to his wife and kindred, every word which he utters
is a lie or a blasphemy."</p>

<p>"Enough of this wrangle," Stoutenburg exclaimed, wrathful and
hoarse. "Jan, take that ranting dotard away!"</p>

<p>Then it was that, just before the men had time to close in all
round the burgomaster, Gilda, placing one small, white hand upon
her father's arm, pointed with the other to the door at the far end
of the room. Instinctively the old man's glance turned in that
direction. The door was open, and Nicolaes stood upon the
threshold. He had heard his father's voice, Stoutenburg's brutal
commands, his sister's cry of indignation.</p>

<p>"Nicolaes is here, father dear," Gilda said simply. "God knows
that he is naught but an abominable traitor, yet methinks that even
he hath not fallen so low as to see his own sister harmed before
his eyes."</p>

<p>At sight of his son an indefinable look had spread over the
burgomaster's face. It seemed as if an invisible and ghostly hand
had drawn a filmy grey veil all over it. And a strange hissing
sound&mdash;the intaking of a laboured sigh&mdash;burst through his
tightly set lips.</p>

<p>"Go!" he cried to his son, in a dull, toneless voice, which
nevertheless could be heard, clear and distinct as a bell, from end
to end of the vast hall. "A father's curse is potent yet,
remember!"</p>

<p>Nicolaes broke into a forced and defiant laugh, tried to assume
a jaunty, careless air, which ill agreed with his pallid face and
wild, scared eyes. But, before he could speak, Jan and the soldiers
had finally seized the burgomaster and forcefully dragged him out
of the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X&mdash;A PRINCE OF
DARKNESS</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Gilda had seen her father dragged away from her side without a
tear. Whatever tremor of apprehension made her heart quiver after
she had seen the last of him, she would not allow these two men to
see.</p>

<p>She was not afraid. When a woman has suffered as Gilda had
suffered during these past two days, there is no longer in her any
room for fear. Not for physical fear, at any rate. All her
thoughts, her hopes, her anxieties were concentrated on the
probable fate of her beloved. That unerring instinct which comes to
human beings when they are within measurable distance of some
acute, unknown danger amounts at times to second sight. This was
the case with Gilda. With the eyes of her soul she could see and
read something of what went on in her enemy's tortuous brain. She
could see that he knew something about her beloved, and that he
meant to use that knowledge for his own abominable ends. What these
were she could not divine. Prescience did not go quite so far. But
it had served her in this, that when her father was taken away she
had just sufficient time and strength of will to brace herself up
for the ordeal which was to come.</p>

<p>It is always remarkable when a woman, young and brought up in
comparative seclusion and ignorance, is able to face moral danger
with perfect calm and cool understanding. It was doubly remarkable
in the case of a young girl like Gilda. She was only just twenty,
had been the idol of her father; motherless, she had no counsels
from those of her own sex, and there are always certain receptacles
in a woman's soul which she will never reveal to the most loving,
most indulgent father.</p>

<p>Three months ago, this same absolutely innocent, unsophisticated
girl had suddenly been confronted with the vehement, turbulent
passions of men. She had seen them in turmoil all round
her&mdash;love, hatred, vengeance, treachery&mdash;she herself
practically the pivot around which they raged. Out of the deadly
strife she had emerged pure, happy in the arms of the man whom her
wondrous adventures as much as his brilliant personality had taught
her to love.</p>

<p>Since then her life had been peaceful and happy. She had allowed
herself to be worshipped by that strangely captivating lover of
hers, whose passionately wilful temperament, tempered by that
persistent, sunny gaiety she had up to now only half understood. He
made her laugh always made her taste a strange and exquisite bliss
when he held her in his arms. But withal she had up till now kept
an indulgent smile in reserve for his outbursts of vehemence, for
his wayward, ofttimes irascible moods, his tearing impatience when
she was away from him. Her love for him in the past had been almost
motherly in its tenderness.</p>

<p>Somehow, with his absence, with the danger which threatened him,
all that had become changed, intensified. The tenderness was still
in her heart for him, an exquisite tenderness which caused her
sheer physical ache now, when her mind conjured up that brief
vision which she had had of him yesterday morning, wearied, with
shoulders bent, his face haggard above a three-day's growth of
beard, his eyes red-rimmed and sunken. But with that tenderness
there was mingled at this hour a feeling which was akin to
fierceness&mdash;the primeval desire of the woman to defend and
protect her beloved&mdash;that same tearing impatience with Fate,
of which he had been wont to suffer, for keeping him away from her
sheltering arms.</p>

<p>Oh, she understood his vehemence now! No longer could she smile
at his fretfulness. She, too, was a prey at this hour to a wildly
emotional mood, tempest-tossed and spirit-stirring; her very soul
crying out for him. And she hated&mdash;ay, hated with an intensity
which she herself scarcely could apprise&mdash;this man whom she
knew to be his deadly enemy.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>"Sit down, sister; you are overwrought."</p>

<p>Nicolaes' cool, casual words brought her straightway back to
reality. Quietly, mechanically she took the seat which he was
offering&mdash;a high-backed, velvet-covered chair&mdash;the one in
which the Stadtholder had sat at her wedding feast. She closed her
eyes, and sat for a moment or two quite still. Visions of joy and
of happiness must not obtrude their softly insidious presence
beside the stern demands of the moment. Stoutenburg brought a
footstool, and placed it to her feet. She felt him near her, but
would not look on him, and he remained for awhile on his knees
close beside her, she unable to move away from him.</p>

<p>"How beautiful you are!" he murmured, under his breath.</p>

<p>Her hand was resting on the arm of her chair. She felt his lips
upon it, and quickly drew it back, wiping it against her gown as if
a slimy worm had left its trail upon her fingers Seeing which, he
broke into a savage curse and jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"I thank you for the reminder, <i>mejuffrouw</i>," he said
coldly.</p>

<p>After which he sat down once more beside the long centre table,
at some little distance from her, but so that the light from the
candles fell upon her dainty figure, graceful and dignified against
the background of the velvet-covered chair, the while his own face
remained in shadow. Nicolaes, nervous and restless, was pacing up
and down the room.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>"Allow me, <i>mejuffrouw</i>," Stoutenburg began coolly after
awhile, "to tender you my sincere regrets for the violence to which
necessity alone compelled me to subject the burgomaster; a worthy
man, for whom, believe me, I entertain naught but sincere
regard."</p>

<p>"I pray you, my lord," she retorted with complete
self-possession, "to spare me this mockery. Had you not determined
to put an insult on me, an insult which, apparently, you dared not
formulate in the presence of my father. You had not, of a certainty
subjected him to such an outrage."</p>

<p>"You misunderstand my motives, <i>mejuffrouw</i>. There was, and
is, no intention on my part to insult you. Surely, as you yourself
very rightly said just now, your brother's presence is sufficient
guarantee for that."</p>

<p>"I said that, in order to quieten my father's fears. The
treacherous snare which you laid for him, my lord, is proof enough
of your cowardly intentions."</p>

<p>"You do yourself no good, <i>mejuffrouw</i>," rejoined the lord
of Stoutenburg harshly, "by acrimony or defiance. I had to lure
your father hither, else he would not have allowed you to come.
Violence to you&mdash;though you may not believe it&mdash;would be
repellent to me. But, having got you both here, I had to rid myself
of him, using what violence was necessary."</p>

<p>"And why, I pray you, had you, as you say, to rid yourself of my
father? Were you afraid of him?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied; "but I am compelled to put certain matters
before you for your consideration, and did not desire that you
should be influenced by him."</p>

<p>A quick sigh of satisfaction&mdash;or was it
excitement?&mdash;escaped her breast. Fretful of all these
preliminaries, which she felt were but the opening gambits of his
dangerous game, she was thankful that, at last, he was coming to
the point.</p>

<p>"Let us begin, <i>mejuffrouw</i>," Stoutenburg resumed, after a
moment's deliberation, "by assuring you that the whereabouts of
that gallant stranger who goes by the name of Diogenes are known to
me and to your brother Nicolaes. To no one else."</p>

<p>He watched her keenly while he spoke. Shading his eyes with his
hand, he took in every transient line of her face, noted the pallor
of her cheeks, the pathetic droop of the mouth. But he was forced
to own that at that curt announcement, wherewith he had intended to
startle and to hurt, not the slightest change came over her. She
still sat there, cool and impassive, her head resting against the
velvet cushion of the chair, the flickering light of the candle
playing with the loose tendrils of her golden hair. Her eyes he
could not see, for they were downcast, veiled by the delicate,
blue-veined lids; but of a surety, not the slightest quiver marred
the perfect stillness of her lips.</p>

<p>In truth, she had expected some such statement from that
execrable traitor. Her intuition had not erred when it told her
that, in some subtle, devilish way, he would use the absence of her
beloved as a tool wherewith to gain what he had in view. Now what
she realized most vividly was that she must not let him see that
she was afraid. Not even let him guess if she were hurt. She must
keep up a semblance of callousness before her enemy for as long as
she could. With her self-control, she would lose her most
efficacious weapon. Therefore, for the next minute or two, she
dared not trust herself to speak, lest her voice, that one
uncontrollable thing, betrayed her.</p>

<p>"I await your answer, <i>mejuffrouw</i>," Stoutenburg resumed
impatiently, after awhile.</p>

<p>"You have asked me no question, my lord," she rejoined simply.
"Only stated a fact. I but wait to hear your further pleasure."</p>

<p>"My pleasure, fair one," he went on lightly, "is only to prove
to you that I, as ever before, am not only your humble slave but
also your sincere friend."</p>

<p>"A difficult task, my lord. But let me see, without further
preamble, I pray you, how you intend to set about it."</p>

<p>"By trying to temper your sorrow with my heartfelt sympathy," he
murmured softly.</p>

<p>"My sorrow?"</p>

<p>"I am forced to impart sad news to you, alas!"</p>

<p>"My husband is dead?" The cry broke from her heart, and this
time she was unable to check it. Will and pride had been easy
enough at first. Oh, how easy! But not now. Not in the face of
this! She would have given worlds to appear calm, incredulous. But
how could she? How could she, when such a torturing vision had been
conjured up before her eyes?</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed as if reason itself began to totter. She
looked on the man before her, and he appeared like a ghoulish
fiend, with grinning jaws and sinister eyes, the play of light
behind him making his face appear black and hideous. She put her
hands up to her face, closed her eyes, and, oh, Heaven, how she
prayed for strength!</p>

<p>None indeed but an implacable enemy, a jealous suitor, could
have seen such soul-agony without relenting. But Stoutenburg was
one of those hard natures which found grim pleasure in wounding and
torturing. His love for Gilda, intensely passionate but never
tender, was nothing now but fierce desire for mastership of her and
vengeance upon his successful rival. The girl's involuntary cry of
misery had been as balm to his evil soul. Now her hands dropped
once more on her lap. She looked at him straight between the eyes,
her own still a little wild, lit by a feverish brightness.</p>

<p>"You have killed him," she said huskily. "Is that it? Answer me!
You have killed him?"</p>

<p>He put up his hand, smiling, as if to soothe a crying child.</p>

<p>"Nay! On my honour!" he replied quietly. "I have not seen that
gallant adventurer these three months past."</p>

<p>"Well, then?"</p>

<p>"Ask your brother Nicolaes, fair one. He saw him but a few hours
ago."</p>

<p>"Ay, yesterday," she retorted. "When he tried to assassinate
him. I saw the murderous hand uplifted; I saw it all I tell you!
And in my heart I cursed my only brother for the vile traitor that
he is. But, thank Heaven, my lord was only hurt. I
believe&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, put her hand up to her throat. The glance in
Stoutenburg's eyes gave her a feeling as if she were about to
choke.</p>

<p>"You are quite right, <i>mejuffrouw</i>," he broke in drily, "in
believing that the intrepid Englishman who, for reasons best known
to himself, hath chosen to meddle in the affairs of this
country&mdash;that he, I say, was only hurt when your brother
interposed yesterday betwixt him and the Stadtholder. The two
ragamuffins who usually hang around him did probably save him from
further punishment at the moment. But not altogether. Nicolaes will
tell you that, half an hour later, that same intrepid and
meddlesome English gentleman did once more try to interfere in the
affairs of our Sovereign Liege the Archduchess Isabella. This time
with serious consequences to himself."</p>

<p>"My brother Nicolaes," she murmured, more quietly this time,
"hath killed my husband?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" here broke in Nicolaes at last. "The whole thing, I
vow, was the result of an accident."</p>

<p>"What whole thing?" she reiterated slowly. "I pray you to be
more explicit. What hath happened to my husband?"</p>

<p>"The explosion of a pistol," Nicolaes stammered, shamed out of
his defiance at seeing his sister's misery, yet angered with
himself for this weakness. "He is not dead, I swear!"</p>

<p>"Maimed?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Blind," Nicolaes replied, "but otherwise well. I swear it!" he
protested, shutting his ears to Stoutenburg's scornful laugh, his
eyes to the other's sardonic grin, his miserably weak nature
swaying like a pendulum 'twixt his ambition, his hatred of the once
brilliant soldier of fortune, and his dormant tenderness for the
sweet and innocent sister to whom his treacherous hand had dealt
such a devilish blow.</p>

<p>There was silence in the room now. Gilda had uttered no cry when
that same blow fell on her like a crash. It had seemed to snap the
very threads that held her to life. One sigh, and one only, came
through her lips, like the dying call of a wounded bird. All
feeling, all emotion, seemed suddenly to have died out of her,
leaving her absolutely numb, scarcely conscious, with wide,
unseeing eyes staring straight out before her, striving to
visualize that splendid creature, that embodiment of gaiety, of
laughter, of careless insouciance, stricken with impotence; those
merry, twinkling eyes sightless. The horror of it was so appalling
that it placed her for the moment beyond the power of suffering.
She was not a human being now at all; she had no soul, no body, no
life. Her senses had ceased to be. She neither saw nor heard nor
felt. She was just a thing, a block of insentient stone into which
life would presently begin to trickle slowly, bringing with it a
misery such as could not be endured even by lost souls in hell.</p>

<p>How the time went by she did not know.</p>

<p>Just before this awful thing had happened she had chanced to
look at the clock. It was then five minutes to eight. But all this
was in the past. She no longer heard the ticking of the clock, nor
her enemy's laboured breathing, nor Nicolaes' shuffling footsteps
at the far end of the room. Fortunately, she could not see the
triumph, the ominous sparkle, which glittered in Stoutenburg's
eyes. He knew well enough what she suffered, or would be suffering
anon when consciousness would return. Knew and revelled in it. He
was like those inquisitors, the unclean spirits that waited on
Spanish tyranny, who found their delight in watching the agony of
their victims on the rack; who treasured every groan, exulted over
every cry, wrung by unendurable bodily pain. Only with him it was
the moral agony of those whom he desired to master that caused him
infinite bliss. His stygian nature attained a demoniacal
satisfaction out of the mental torture which he was able to
inflict.</p>

<p>It is an undoubted fact that even the closest scrutiny of
contemporary chronicles has failed to bring to light a single
redeeming feature in this man's character, and all that the most
staunch supporters of the Barneveldt family can bring forward in
mitigation of Stoutenburg's crimes is the fact that his whole soul
had been warped by the judicial murder of his father and of his
elder brother, by his own consequent sufferings and those of his
unfortunate mother.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>"You will, I hope, <i>mejuffrouw</i>, give me the credit of
having tried to break this sad news to you as gently as I
could."</p>

<p>The words, spoken in smooth, silky tones were the first sounds
that reached Gilda's returning perceptions. What had occurred in
between she had not the vaguest idea. She certainly was still
sitting in the same chair, with that sinister creature facing her,
and her brother Nicolaes skulking somewhere in the gloom. The fire
was still cracking in the hearth, the clock still ticking with
insentient monotony. A tiny fillet of air caused the candle-light
to flicker, and sent a thin streak of smoke upwards in an
ever-widening spiral.</p>

<p>That streak of smoke was the first thing that Gilda saw. It
arrested her eyes, brought her back slowly to consciousness. Then
came Stoutenburg's hypocritical tirade. Her senses were returning
one by one. She even glanced up at the clock. It marked three
minutes before eight. Only two minutes had gone by. One hundred and
twenty seconds. And they appeared longer than the most
phantasmagoric conception of eternity. Two minutes! And she
realized that she was alive, that she could feel, and that her
beloved was sightless. Was it at all strange that, with return to
pulsating life, there should arise within her that indestructible
attribute of every human heart&mdash;a faint germ of hope?</p>

<p>When first the awful truth was put before her by her bitterest
foe, she had not been conscious of the slightest feeling of doubt.
Nicolaes' stammering protests, his obvious desire to minimise his
own share of responsibility, had all helped to confirm the
revelation of a hideous crime.</p>

<p>"He is not dead, I swear!" and "He is not otherwise hurt!" which
broke from the dastard's quaking lips at the moment, had left no
room for doubt or hope. At least, so she thought. And even now that
faint ray of light in the utter blackness of her misery was too
elusive to be of any comfort. But it helped her to collect herself,
to look those two craven miscreants in the face. Nicolaes obviously
dared not meet her glance, but Stoutenburg kept his eyes fixed upon
her, and the look of triumph in them whipped up her dormant
pride.</p>

<p>And now, when his double-tongued Pharisaism reached her ear, she
swallowed her dread, bade horror be stilled. She knew that he was
about to place an "either&mdash;or" before her which would demand
her full understanding, and all the strength of mind and body that
she could command. The fate of her beloved was about to be dangled
before her, and she would be made to choose&mdash;what?</p>

<p>"You began, my lord," she said, with something of her former
assurance&mdash;and God alone knew what it cost her to
speak&mdash;"by saying that you desired to place certain matters
before me for my consideration. I have not yet heard, remember,
what those matters are."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;true!" he rejoined, with hypocritical unction. "But
I felt it my duty&mdash;my sad duty, I may say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A truce on this hollow mockery!" she riposted. "I pray you,
come to the point."</p>

<p>"The point is, fair one, that both Nicolaes and I desire to
compass your welfare," he retorted blandly.</p>

<p>"This you can do best at this hour, my lord, by allowing me to
return to the privacy of mine apartments."</p>

<p>"So you shall, <i>myn engel</i>&mdash;so you shall," he rejoined
suavely. "You will need time to prepare for departure."</p>

<p>She frowned, puzzled this time.</p>

<p>"For departure?" she asked, a little bewildered.</p>

<p>"I leave this town to-morrow at the head of my troops."</p>

<p>"Thank God for that!" she rejoined earnestly.</p>

<p>"And you, <i>mejuffrouw</i>," he added curtly, "will accompany
us."</p>

<p>"I?" she asked, not altogether understanding, the frown more
deeply marked between her brows.</p>

<p>"Methought I spoke clearly," he went on, in his habitual harsh,
peremptory tone. "I only came to this town in order to fetch you,
<i>myn engel</i>. To-morrow we go away together."</p>

<p>"The folly of human grandeur hath clouded your brain, my lord!"
she said coldly.</p>

<p>"In what way?" he queried, still perfectly bland and mild.</p>

<p>"You know well that I would sooner die than follow you."</p>

<p>"I know well that most women are over-ready with heroics. But,"
he added, with a shrug of the shoulders, "these tantrums usually
leave me cold. You are an intelligent woman, <i>mejuffrouw</i>, and
you have seen your valiant father resign himself to the
inevitable."</p>

<p>"I pray you waste no words, my lord," she rejoined coolly.
"Three months ago, when at Ryswick, your crimes found you out, and
you strove to involve me in your own disgrace and ruin, I gave you
mine answer&mdash;the same that I do now. My dead body you can take
with you, but I, alive, will never follow you!"</p>

<p>"'Twas different then," he retorted, with a cynical smile. "You
had a fortune-hunting adventurer to hand who was determined to see
that your father's shekels did not lightly escape his grasp.
To-day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To-day," she retorted, and rose to her feet, fronted him now,
superb with indignation, "he is sightless, absent, impotent, you
would say, to protect me against your villainy! You miserable,
slinking cur!"</p>

<p>Stoutenburg's harsh, forced laugh broke in upon her wrath.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed lightly. "You little spit-fire! In very
truth, I like you better in that mood. Heroics do not become you,
<i>myn schat</i>, and they are so unnecessary. Did you perchance
imagine that it was love for you that hath influenced my decision
to take you away from here?"</p>

<p>"I pray God, my lord, that I be not polluted by as much as a
thought from you!"</p>

<p>"Your prayers have been granted, fair one," he retorted with a
sneer. "'Tis but seldom I think of you now, save as an exquisite
little termagant whom it will amuse me to tame. But this is by the
way. That pleasure will lose nothing by procrastination. You know
me well enough by now to realise that I am not likely to be lenient
with you after your vixenish treatment of me. For the nonce, I pray
you to keep a civil tongue in your head," he added roughly. "On
your conduct at this hour will depend your future comfort. Nicolaes
will not always be skulking in dark corners, ready to interfere if
my manner become too rough."</p>

<p>"He is here now," she said boldly, "and if there is a spark of
honour left in him he will conduct me to my rooms!"</p>

<p>With this she turned and walked steadily across the room. Even
so his harsh laugh accompanied her as far as the door. When her
hand was upon the knob, he called lightly after her:</p>

<p>"The moment you step cross the threshold, <i>myn schat</i>, Jan
will bring you back here&mdash;in his arms!"</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>Instinctively she paused, realizing that the warning had come
just in time&mdash;that the next moment, in very truth, she would
be in the hands of those vile traitors who were there ready to obey
their master's every command. She paused, too, in order to murmur a
quick prayer for Divine guidance, seeing that human protection was
denied her at this hour. What could she do? She was like a bird
caught in a snare from which there seemed to be no issue.
Stoutenburg's sneering laugh rang in her ear. He was beside her
now, took her hand from the knob and held it for a moment forcibly
in his. His glance, charged with cruel mockery, took in every line
of her pallid face.</p>

<p>"Heroics again, fair one!" he said, with an impish grin. "Must I
assure you once more that you are perfectly safe with me? See, if
you were in danger from me, would not your brother interfere? Bah!
Nicolaes knows well enough that passion doth not enter into my
schemes at this hour. My plans are too vast to be swayed by your
frowns or your smiles. I have entered this city as a conqueror. As
a conqueror I shall go out of it to-morrow, and you will come with
me. I shall go hence because I choose, and for reasons which I will
presently make clear to you.</p>

<p>"But you shall come with me. When you are with me in my camp, I
may honour you as my future wife, or cast you from me as I would a
beggar. That will depend on my mood, and upon your temper. Nicolaes
will not be there to run counter to my will. Therefore, understand
me, my pretty fire-eater, that from this hour forth you are as
absolutely my property as my dogs are, my horse, or the boots which
I wear. I am the master here," he concluded with strangely sinister
calm, "And my will alone is law."</p>

<p>"A law unto yourself," she retorted, faced him with absolute
composure, neither defiant nor afraid, her nerves quiescent, her
voice perfectly steady, "and mayhap unto your cringing sycophants.
But above your will, my lord, is that of God; and neither death nor
life are your slaves."</p>

<p>"Ay! But methinks they are, <i>myn engel</i>," he answered
drily. "Yours in any case."</p>

<p>"No human being, my lord, can lose the freedom to die."</p>

<p>"You think not?" he sneered. "Well, we shall see."</p>

<p>He let go her hand, then quietly turned and walked to the
window, threw open the casement once more, then beckoned to her.
Strangely stirred, she followed, moved almost mechanically by
something she could not resist.</p>

<p>At a sign from him she looked out upon the busy scene on the
quay below&mdash;the enemy soldiers in possession, their bivouac
fires, their comings and goings, the unfortunate citizens running
hither and thither at their bidding, fetching and carrying,
hustled, pushed, beaten, ordered about with rough words or the
persuasive prod of pike or musket. A scene, alas, which already as
a child had been familiar to her. A peaceable town in the hands of
ruthless soldiery; the women fleeing from threatened insults,
children clinging to their mother's skirts, men standing by, grim
and silent, not daring to protest lest mere resentment brought
horrible reprisals upon the city.</p>

<p>Gilda looked out for awhile in silence, her heart aching with
the misery which she beheld, yet could not palliate. Then she
turned coldly inquiring eyes on the prime mover of it all.</p>

<p>"I have seen a reign of terror such as this before, my lord,"
she said. "I was at Leyden, as you well know, and I have not
forgotten."</p>

<p>"A reign of terror, you call it, <i>mejuffrouw</i>?" he retorted
coolly. "Nay, you exaggerate. What is this brief occupation?
To-morrow we go, remember. Is there a single house demolished at
this hour, a single citizen murdered? You are too young to
recollect Malines of Ghent, the reign of Alva over these
recalcitrant countries. I have been lenient so far. I have spared
fire and sword. Amersfoort still stands. It will stand to-morrow,
even after my soldiers have gone," he went on speaking very slowly,
"if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If what, my Lord?" she asked, for he had paused.</p>

<p>The moment had come, then, the supreme hour when that dreaded
"either&mdash;or" would be put before her. Even now he went on with
that same sinister quietude which seemed like the voice of some
relentless judge, sent by the King of Darkness to sway her
destiny.</p>

<p>"If," Stoutenburg concluded drily, "you <i>mejuffrouw</i>, will
accompany me. Oh," he added quickly, seeing that at once she had
resumed that air of defiance which irritated even whilst it amused
him. "I do not mean as an unwilling slave, pinioned to my
chariot-wheel or strapped into a saddle, nor yet as a picturesque
corpse, with flowing hair and lilies 'twixt your lifeless hands.
No, no, fair one! I offer you the safety of your native city, the
immunity of your fellow-citizens, in exchange for a perfectly
willing surrender of your live person into my charge."</p>

<p>She looked on him for awhile, mute with horror, then murmured
slowly:</p>

<p>"Are you a devil, that you should propose such an execrable
bargain?"</p>

<p>He laughed and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I am what you and my native land have made me," he replied. "As
to that, the Stadtholder never offered to bargain with me for my
father's life."</p>

<p>"Who but a prince of darkness would dream of doing so?" she
retorted.</p>

<p>"Call me that, an you wish, fair one," he put in lightly; "and
come back to the point."</p>

<p>"And the point is, my Lord?"</p>

<p>"That I will respect this city if you come to-morrow, willing
and submissive, with me. "</p>

<p>"That, never!" she affirmed hotly.</p>

<p>"In that case," he riposted coldly, "my soldiers will have a
free hand ere they quit the town, to sack it at their pleasure.
Pillage, arson, will be rewarded; looting will be deemed a virtue,
as will murder and outrage. Even your father&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough, my lord!" she exclaimed, with passionate indignation.
"Tell me, I pray, which of the unclean spirits of Avernus did
suggest this infamy to you?" Then, as he met her burning glance
with another careless shrug and a mocking laugh, she turned to
Nicolaes, and cried out to him, almost with entreaty: "Klaas! You
at least are not a party to such hideous villainy!"</p>

<p>But he, sullen and shamefaced, only threw her an angry look.</p>

<p>"You make it very difficult for us, Gilda," he said moodily, "by
your stupid obstinacy."</p>

<p>"Obstinacy?" she retorted, puzzled at the word. Then reiterated
it once or twice. "Obstinacy&mdash;obstinacy? My God, hath the boy
gone mad?"</p>

<p>"What else is it but obstinacy?" he rejoined vehemently. "You
know that, despite all he says, Stoutenburg hath never ceased to
love you. And now that he is master here you are lucky indeed to
have him as a suitor. He means well by you, by us all, else I were
not here. Think what it would mean to me, to father, to everyone of
us, if you were Stoutenburg's wife. But you jeopardize my future
and the welfare of us all by those foolish tantrums."</p>

<p>She gazed on him in utter horror&mdash;on this brother whom she
loved; could scarcely believe her ears that it was he&mdash;really
he&mdash;who was uttering such odious words. She felt her gorge
rising at this callous avowal of a wanton and insulting treachery.
And he, feeling the contempt which flashed on him from her glowing
eyes, avoided her glance, tried to shift his ground, to argue his
point with the sophistry peculiar to a traitor, and sank more
deeply every moment into the mire of dishonour.</p>

<p>"It is time you realized, Gilda," he said, "that our unfortunate
country must sooner or later return to her true allegiance. The
Stadtholder is sick. His arbitrary temper hath alienated some of
his staunchest friends. The Netherlands are the unalienable
property of Spain; though two rebel princes have striven to wrest
them from their rightful master, the might of Spain was sure to be
felt in the end. 'Twas folly ever to imagine that this so-called
Dutch Republic would ever abide; and the hour, though tardy, has
struck at last when such senseless dreams must come to an end."</p>

<p>"Well spoken, friend Nicolaes!" Stoutenburg put in lustily. "In
verity, our Liege Lady the Archduchess Isabella, whom may God
protect, could with difficulty find a more eloquent champion."</p>

<p>"Or our noble land so vile a traitor!" Gilda murmured, burning
now with shame. "Thank Heaven, Nicolaes, that our poor father is
not here, for the disgrace of it all would have struck him dead at
your feet. Would to God," she murmured under her breath, "that it
killed me now!"</p>

<p>"An undutiful prayer, <i>myn engel</i>," Stoutenburg rejoined,
"seeing that its fulfilment would mean that Amersfoort and her
citizens would be wiped off the face of the earth."</p>

<p>This time he spoke quite quietly, without any apparent threat,
only with determination, like one who knows that he is master and
hath full powers to see his will obeyed. She looked at him keenly
for a moment or two, wondering if she could make him flinch, if she
could by word or prayer shake him in that devilish purpose which in
truth must have found birth through the whisperings of uncanny
fiends.</p>

<p>Gilda gazed critically at his lean, hard face with the sunken,
restless eyes that spoke so eloquently of disappointed hopes and
frustrated ambitions; the mouth, thin-lipped and set; the unshaven
chin; the hollow temples and grizzled hair. She took in every line
of his tall, gaunt figure; the shoulders already bent, the hands
fidgety and claw-like; the torn doublet and shabby boots, all
proclaiming the down-at-heel adventurer who has staked his
all&mdash;honour, happiness, eternity&mdash;for ambition; has
staked all he possessed and played a losing game.</p>

<p>But for pity or compunction Gilda sought in vain. The glance
which after awhile was raised to hers revealed nothing but unholy
triumph and a cruel, callous mockery. In truth, that glance had
told her that she could expect neither justice nor mercy from him,
and had spared her the humiliation of a desperate and futile
appeal.</p>

<p>A low moan escaped her lips. She tottered slightly, and felt her
knees giving way under her.</p>

<p>Vaguely she put out her hand, fearing that she might fall. Even
so, she swayed backwards, feeling giddy and sick. But the dread of
losing consciousness before this man whom she loathed and despised
kept up both her courage and her endurance. She felt the panelling
of the window-embrasure behind her, and leaned against it for
support.</p>

<p class="cpb">6.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg had made no effort to come to her assistance,
neither had Nicolaes. Probably both of them knew that she would
never allow either of them to touch her. But Stoutenburg's mocking
glance had pursued her all through her valiant fight against
threatening unconsciousness. Now that she leaned against the
framework of the window, pale and wraith-like, only her delicate
profile vaguely distinguishable in the semi-gloom, her lips parted
as if to drink in the cold evening air, she looked so exquisite, so
desirable, that he allowed his admiration of her to override every
other thought.</p>

<p>"You are lovely, <i>myn schat</i>," he said quietly. "Exquisite
and worthy to be a queen. And, by Heaven," he exclaimed with sudden
passion, "you'll yet live to bless this hour when I broke your
obstinacy. Hand in hand, <i>myn engel</i>, you and I, we'll be
masters of this beautiful land. I feel that I could do great things
if I had you by my side. Listen, Gilda," he went on eagerly,
thinking that because she remained silent and motionless she had
given up the fight, and was at last resigned to the
inevitable&mdash;"listen, my beautiful little vixen! The
Archduchess will wish to reward me for this; the capture of
Amersfoort is no small matter, and I have further projects in mind.
In the meanwhile, De Berg hath already hinted that she might
re-establish the republic under the suzerainty of Spain, and
appoint me as her Stadtholder. Think, <i>myn Geliefde</i>: think
what a vista of glorious, satisfied ambition lies before us both!
Nay, before us all. Your father, chief pensionary; Nicolaes,
general of our armies; your family raised above every one in the
land. You'll thank me, I say; thank me on your knees for my
constancy and for my unwavering loyalty to you. And even to-night,
presently, when you are quite calm and at rest, you'll pray to your
God, I vow, for His blessing upon your humble and devoted
slave."</p>

<p>He bent the knee when he said this, still scornful even in this
affectation of humility, and raised the hem of her gown to his
lips. She did not look down on him, nor did she snatch her skirts
out of his hand. She just stared straight out before her, and said
slowly, with great deliberation:</p>

<p>"To-night&mdash;presently&mdash;when I am at rest&mdash;I will
pray God to kill you ere you put your monstrous threat into
execution."</p>

<p>With a light laugh he jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Still the shrewish little vixen, what?" he said carelessly.
"Yet, see what a good dog I am. I'll not bear resentment, and you
shall have the comfort of your father's company at the little
supper party which I have prepared. Only the four of us, you and
the burgomaster, and Nicolaes and I; and we can discuss the
arrangements for our forthcoming wedding, which shall be
magnificent, I promise you. But be sure of this, fair one," he went
on harshly, drew up his gaunt figure to its full height, "that what
I've said I've said. To-morrow at sunrise I go hence, and you come
with me, able-bodied and willing, to a place which I have in mind.
But this city will be the hostage for your good behaviour. My
soldiers remain here under the command of one Jan, who obeys all my
behests implicitly and without question, because he hates the
Stadtholder as much as I do, and hath a father's murder to avenge
against that tyrant, just as I have. Jan will stay in Amersfoort
until I bid him go. But at one word from me, this city will be
reduced to ashes, and not one man, woman or child shall live to
tell the tale of how the <i>jongejuffrouw</i> Gilda Beresteyn set
her senseless obstinacy above the lives of thousands.</p>

<p>"Think not that I'll relent," he concluded, and once more turned
to the open window, gazed down upon the unfortunate city which he
had marked as the means to his fiendish ends. His restless eyes
roamed over the busy scene; his soldiers, his&mdash;the
executioners who would carry out his will! Never had he been so
powerful; never had his ambition been so near its goal! It had all
come together&mdash;the humiliation of the Stadtholder, his own
success in this daring enterprise, Gilda entirely at his mercy!
Success had crowned all his nefarious schemes at last. "Nothing
will change me from my purpose," he said, with all the harsh
determination which characterized his every action&mdash;"nothing!
Neither your tears nor your frowns nor your prayers. There is no
one, understand me, no one who can stand between me and my
resolve."</p>

<p>"No one but God," she murmured under her breath. "Oh, God,
protect me now! My God, save me from this!"</p>

<p>Dizzy, moving like a sleep-walker, she tried to hold herself
erect, tried to move from the window, and from the propinquity of
that execrable miscreant.</p>

<p>"Have I your permission to go now?" she murmured faintly.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied; "to your father. I'll order Jan to release
our worthy burgomaster, and you and he can pray for my demise at
your leisure. Whether you confide in him or not is no concern of
mine. I would have you remember that my promise to respect this
city and her inhabitants only holds good if you, of your own free
will, come with me to-morrow. Amersfoort shall live if you come
willingly. You are the best judge whether your father would be the
happier for this knowledge. Methinks it would be kinder to let him
think that you come to-morrow as my willing bride. But that is for
you to decide. I want him here anon to give his blessing upon our
future union in the presence of your brother Nicolaes. I wish the
bond to be made irrevocable as soon as may be. If you or your
father break it afterwards, it will be the worse for Amersfoort.
Try and believe that the alternative is one of complete
indifference to me. I have everything in the world now that I could
possibly wish for. My ambition is completely satisfied. To have you
as my wife would only be the pandering to a caprice. And now you
may go, <i>myn schat</i>," he concluded. "The destinies of your
native city are in your dainty hands."</p>

<p>He watched her progress across the room with a sarcastic grin.
But in his heart he was conscious of a bitter disappointment.
Unheard by her, he muttered under his breath:</p>

<p>"If only she would care, how different everything might be!"</p>

<p>Aloud he called to Nicolaes: "Escort your sister, man, into the
presence of the burgomaster! And see that Jan and a chosen few form
a guard of honour on the passage of the future Lady of
Stoutenburg."</p>

<p>Nicolaes hastened to obey. Gilda tried to check him with a
brief. "I thank you; I would prefer to go alone!"</p>

<p>But already he had thrown open the door, and anon his husky
voice could be heard giving orders to Jan.</p>

<p>Gilda, at the last, turned once more to look on her enemy. He
caught her eye, bowed very low, his hand almost touching the ground
ere he brought it with a sweeping flourish back to his breast, in
the most approved fashion lately brought in from France.</p>

<p>"In half an hour supper will be served," he said. "I await the
honour of the burgomaster's company and of your own!"</p>

<p>And he remained in an attitude of perfect deference whilst she
passed silently out of the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI&mdash;THE
DANGER-SPOKE</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Gilda had refused her brother's escort, preferring to follow
Jan; and Nicolaes, half indifferent, half ashamed, watched her
progress up the stairs, and when she had disappeared in the gloom
of the corridor above, he went back to his friend.</p>

<p>The two old serving-men were now busy in the banqueting-hall,
bringing in the supper. They set the table with silver and crystal
goblets, with jugs of Spanish and Rhenish wines, and dishes of
cooked meats. They came and went about their business expeditiously
and silently, brought in two more heavy candelabra with a dozen or
more lighted candles in their sconces, so that the vast room was
brilliantly lit. They threw fresh logs upon the fire, so that the
whole place looked cosy and inviting.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg had once more taken up his stand beside the open
window. Leaning his arm against the mullion, he rested his head
upon it. Bitterness and rage had brought hot tears to his eyes.
Somehow it seemed to him as if in the overflowing cup of his
triumph something had turned to gall. Gilda eluded him. He could
not understand her. The experience which he had of women had taught
him that these beautiful and shallow creatures, soulless for the
most part and heartless, were easily to be cajoled with soft words
and bribed with wealth and promises. Yet he had dangled before
Gilda's eyes such a vision of glory and exalted position as should
have captured, quite unconditionally, the citadel of her
affections, and she had remained indifferent to it all.</p>

<p>He had owned himself still in love with her, and she had
remained quite callous to his ardour. He had tried indifference,
and had only been paid back in his own coin. To a man of
Stoutenburg's intensely egotistical temperament, there could only
be one explanation to this seeming coldness. The wench's
senses&mdash;it could be nothing more&mdash;were still under the
thrall of that miserable adventurer who, thank Beelzebub and his
horde, had at last been rendered powerless to wreak further
mischief. There could be, he argued to himself, no aversion in her
heart for one who was so ready to share prosperity, power, and
honour with her, to forgive and forget all that was past, to raise
her from comparative obscurity to the most exalted state that had
ever dazzled a woman's fancy and stormed the inmost recesses of her
soul.</p>

<p>She was still infatuated with the varlet, and that was all. A
wholly ununderstandable fact. Stoutenburg never could imagine how
she had ever looked with favour on such an adventurer, whose
English parentage and reputed wealth were, to say the least,
problematical. Beresteyn had been a fool to allow his only daughter
to bestow her beauty and her riches on a stranger, about whom in
truth he knew less than nothing. The girl, bewitched by the
rascallion, had cajoled her father and obtained his consent. Now
she was still under the spell of a handsome presence, a resonant
voice, a provoking eye. It was, it could be, nothing more than
that. When once she understood what she had gained, how utterly
inglorious that once brilliant soldier of fortune had become, she
would descend from her high attitude of disdain and kiss the hand
which she now spurned.</p>

<p>But, in anticipation of that happy hour, the Lord of Stoutenburg
felt moody and discontented.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Nicolaes' voice, close to his elbow, roused him from his gloomy
meditations.</p>

<p>"You must be indulgent, my friend," he was saying in a smooth
conciliatory voice. "Gilda had always a wilful temper."</p>

<p>"And a tenacious one," Stoutenburg retorted. "She is still in
love with that rogue."</p>

<p>"Bah!" the other rejoined, with a note of spite in his tone. "It
is mere infatuation! A woman's whimsey for a good-looking face and
a pair of broad shoulders! She should have seen the scrubby rascal
as I last caught sight of him&mdash;grimy, unshaven, broken. No
woman's fancy would survive such a spectacle!"</p>

<p>Then, as Stoutenburg, still unconsoled, continued to stare
through the open window, muttering disjointed phrases through
obstinately set lips, he went on quite gaily:</p>

<p>"You are not the first by any means, my friend, whose
tempestuous wooing hath brought a woman, loving and repentant, to
heel. When I was over in England with my father, half a dozen years
ago, we saw there a play upon the stage. It had been writ by some
low-born mountebank, one William Shakespeare. The name of the play
was 'The Taming of the Shrew.' Therein, too, a woman of choleric
temper did during several scenes defy the man who wooed her. In the
end he conquered; she became his wife, and as tender and submissive
an one as e'er you'd wish to see. But, by St. Bavon, how she
stormed at first! How she professed to hate him! I was forcibly
reminded of that play when I saw Gilda defying you awhile ago; and
I could have wished that you had displayed the same good-humour
over the wrangle as did the gallant Petruchio&mdash;the hero of the
piece."</p>

<p>Stoutenburg was interested.</p>

<p>"How did he succeed in the end?" he queried. "Your Petruchio, I
mean."</p>

<p>"He starved the ranting virago into submission," Nicolaes
replied, with an easy laugh. "Gave her nothing to eat for a day and
a night; swore at her lackeys; beat her waiting-maids. She was
disdainful at first, then terrified. Finally, she admired him,
because he had mastered her."</p>

<p>"A good moral, friend Nicolaes!"</p>

<p>"Ay! One you would do well to follow. Women reserve their
disdain for weaklings, and their love for their masters."</p>

<p>"And think you that Gilda&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gilda, my friend, is but a woman after all. Have no fear,
she'll be your willing slave in a week."</p>

<p>Stoutenburg's eyes glittered at the thought.</p>

<p>"A week is a long time to wait," he murmured. "I wish that
now&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused. Something that was happening down below on the quay
had attracted his attention&mdash;unusual merriment, loud laughter,
the strains of a bibulous song. For a minute or two his keen eyes
searched the gloom for the cause of all this hilarity. He leaned
far out the window, called peremptorily to a group of soldiers who
were squatting around their bivouac fire.</p>

<p>"Hey!" he shouted. "Peter! Willem!&mdash;whatever your
confounded names may be! What is that rascallion doing over
there?"</p>

<p>"Making us all laugh, so please your lordship," one of the
soldiers gave reply; "by the drollest stories and quips any of us
have ever heard."</p>

<p>"Where does he come from?"</p>

<p>"From nowhere, apparently," the man averred. "He just fell among
us. The man is blind, so please you," he added after a moment's
hesitation.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg swore.</p>

<p>"How many times must I give orders," he demanded roughly, "that
every blind beggar who comes prowling round the camps be hanged to
the nearest post?"</p>

<p>"We did intend to hang him," the soldier replied coolly; "but
when first he came along he was so nimble that, ere we could
capture him, he gave us the slip."</p>

<p>"Well," Stoutenburg rejoined harshly, "it is not too late. You
have him now."</p>

<p>"So we have, Magnificence," the man replied, hesitated for a
second or two, then added: "But he is so amusing, and he seems a
gentleman of quality, too proud for the hangman's rope."</p>

<p>"Too proud is he?" his lordship retorted with a sneer. "A
gentleman of quality, and amusing to boot? Well, let us see how his
humour will accommodate itself to the gallows. Here, let me have a
look at the loon."</p>

<p>There was much hustling down below after this; shouting and
prolonged laughter; a confused din, through which it was impossible
to distinguish individual sounds. Stoutenburg's nerves were
tingling. He was quite sure by now that he had recognised that
irrepressible merry voice. A gentleman of quality! Blind! Amusing!
But, if Nicolaes' report of yesterday's events were true, the man
was hopelessly stricken. And what could induce him to put his head
in the jackal's mouth, to affront his triumphing enemy, when he
himself was so utterly helpless and abject?</p>

<p>Not long was the Lord of Stoutenburg left in suspense. Even
whilst he gazed down upon the merry, excited throng, he was able to
distinguish in the midst of them all a pair of broad shoulders that
could only belong to one man. The soldiers, laughing, thoroughly
enjoying the frolic, were jostling him not a little for the sheer
pleasure of measuring their valour against so hefty a fellow. And
he, despite his blindness, gave as good as he got; fought valiantly
with fist and boot and gave his tormentors many a hard knock,
until, with a loud shout of glee, some of the men succeeded in
seizing hold of him, and hoisted him up on their shoulders and
brought him into the circle of light formed by the resin
torches.</p>

<p>A double cry came in response&mdash;one of amazement from
Stoutenburg and one of horror from Nicolaes. But neither of them
spoke. Stoutenburg's lips were tightly set; a puzzled frown
appeared between his brows. In truth, for once in the course of his
devilish career, he was completely taken aback and uncertain what
to do. The man whom he saw there before him, in ragged clothes,
unshaved and grimy, blinking with sightless eyes, was the man whom
he detested above every other thing or creature on earth&mdash;the
reckless soldier of fortune of the past, for awhile the proud and
successful rival; now just a wreck of humanity, broken, ay, and
degraded, and henceforth an object of pity rather than a menace to
his rival's plans. His doublet was in rags, his plumed hat
battered, his toes shone through the holes in his boots. The upper
part of his face was swathed in a soiled linen bandage. This had,
no doubt, been originally intended to shield the stricken eyes; but
it had slipped, and those same eyes, with their horrible fixed
look, glittered with unearthly weirdness in the flickering
light.</p>

<p>"Salute his Magnificence, the lord and master of Amersfoort and
of all that in it lies!" one of the soldiers shouted gaily.</p>

<p>And the blind man forthwith made a gesture of obeisance swept
with a wide flourish his battered plumed hat from off his head.</p>

<p>"To his Magnificence!" he called out in response. "Though mine
eyes cannot see him, my voice is raised in praise of his nobility
and his valour. May the recording angels give him his full
deserts."</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>The feeling of sheer horror which had caused Nicolaes to utter a
sudden cry was, in truth, fully justified.</p>

<p>"It can't be!" he murmured, appalled at what he saw.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg answered with a hoarse laugh. "Nay, by Satan and all
his myrmidons it is!"</p>

<p>Already he was leaning out of the window, giving quick orders to
the men down below to bring that drunken vagabond forthwith into
his presence. After which he turned once more to his friend.</p>

<p>"We'll soon see," he said, "if it is true, or if our eyes have
played us both an elusive trick. Yet, methinks," he added
thoughtfully, "that the pigwidgeon who of late hath taken my
destiny in hand is apparently intent on doing me a good turn."</p>

<p>"In what way?" the other asked.</p>

<p>"By throwing my enemy across my path," Stoutenburg replied
drily.</p>

<p>"You'll hang him of course?" Nicolaes rejoined.</p>

<p>"Yes; I'll hang him!" Stoutenburg retorted, with a snarl. "But I
must make use of him first."</p>

<p>"Make use of him? How?"</p>

<p>"That I do not know as yet. But inspiration will come, never you
fear, my friend. All that I want is a leverage for bringing the
Stadtholder to his knees and for winning Gilda's love."</p>

<p>"Then, in Heaven's name, man," Nicolaes rejoined earnestly,
"begin by ridding yourself of the only danger-spoke in your
wheel!"</p>

<p>"Danger-spoke?" Stoutenburg exclaimed, threw back his head and
laughed. "Would you really call that miserable oaf a serious bar to
mine ambition or a possible rival in your sister's regard?"</p>

<p>And, with outstretched hand he pointed to the door.</p>

<p>There, under the lintel&mdash;pushed on by Jan and two or three
men who, powerfully built though they were, looked like pigmies
beside the stricken giant, drunk as an owl, his hat awry above that
hideous bandage, dirty, unkempt, and ragged&mdash;appeared the man
who had once been the brilliant inspiration of Franz Hals' immortal
"Laughing Cavalier."</p>

<p>At sight of him Nicolaes Beresteyn gave a loud groan and
collapsed into a chair; burying his face in his hand. He was ever a
coward, even in villainy; and when the man whom he had once hated
so bitterly, and whom his craven hand had struck in such a
dastardly manner, lurched into the room, and as he fell against the
table uttered an inane and bibulous laugh, his nerve completely
forsook him.</p>

<p>At a peremptory sign from Stoutenburg, Jan closed the doors
which gave on the hall; but he and two of the men remained at
attention inside the room.</p>

<p>The blind man groped with his hands till they found a chair,
into which he sank, with powerful limbs outstretched, snorting like
a dog just come out of the water. With an awkward gesture he pushed
his hat from off his head, and in so doing he dislodged the grimy
bandage so that it sat like a scullion's cap across his white
forehead.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg watched him with an expression of cruel
satisfaction. It is not often given to a man to have an enemy and a
rival so completely in his power, and the exultation in
Stoutenburg's heart was so great that he was content to savour it
in silence for awhile. Nicolaes was beyond the power of speech, and
so the silence for a moment or two remained absolute.</p>

<p>Then the blind man suddenly sat up, craning his neck and rolling
his sightless eyes.</p>

<p>"I wonder where the devil I am!" he murmured through set lips.
He appeared to listen intently; no doubt caught the sound of life
around him, for he added quickly: "Is anybody here?"</p>

<p>"I am here," Stoutenburg replied curtly. "Do you know whom I am,
sirrah?"</p>

<p>"In truth, I do not," Diogenes replied. "But by your accent I
would judge you to be a man who at this moment is mightily
afraid."</p>

<p>"Afraid?" Stoutenburg retorted, with a loud laugh. "I, afraid of
a helpless vagabond who has been fool enough to run his head into a
noose which I had not even thought of preparing for him?"</p>

<p>"Yet you are afraid my lord," the other rejoined quietly, "else
you would not have ordered your bodyguard to watch over your
precious person whilst you parleyed with a blind man."</p>

<p>"My bodyguard is only waiting for final orders to take you to
the gallows," Stoutenburg rejoined roughly. "You may as well know
now as later that it is my intention to hang you."</p>

<p>"As well now as later," the blind man assented, with easy
philosophy. "I understand that for the nonce, whoever you
Magnificence may be, you are master in Amersfoort. As such, you
have a right to hang anyone you choose. Me or another. What
matters? I was very nearly hung once, you must know, by the Lord of
Stoutenburg. I did not mind much then; I'd mind it still less now.
People talk of a hereafter. Well, whatever it is, it must be a
better world that this, so I would just as soon as not, go and find
out for myself."</p>

<p>He struggled to his feet, still groping with his hands for
support, found the edge of the table and leaned up against it.</p>

<p>"Let's to the hangman, my lord," he said thickly. "If I'm to
hang, I prefer it to be done at once. And if we tarry too long I
might get sober ere I embark on the last adventure. But," he added,
and once more appeared to search the room with eyes that could not
see, "there's someone else here besides your lordship. Who is
it?"</p>

<p>"My friend and yours," Stoutenburg replied. "Mynheer Nicolaes
Beresteyn."</p>

<p>There was a second or two of silence. Nicolaes made as if he
would speak, but Stoutenburg quickly put a finger up to his lips,
enjoining him to remain still. The blind man passed his trembling
hand once or twice in front of his eyes as if to draw aside an
unseen veil that hid the outer world from his gaze.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he murmured contentedly. "My friend Klaas! He is here too,
is he? That is indeed good news. For Nicolaes was ever my friend.
That time three months ago&mdash;or was it three years, or three
centuries? I really have lost count&mdash;that time that the Lord
of Stoutenburg was on the point of hanging me, Klaas would have
interposed on my behalf, only something went wrong with his heart
at the moment, or his nerves, I forget which."</p>

<p>"'Twere no use to rely on mynheer's interference this time,"
Stoutenburg put in drily. "There is but one person in the world now
who can save you from the gallows."</p>

<p>"You mean the Lord of Stoutenburg himself?" the blind man
queried blandly.</p>

<p>"Nay! He is determined to hang you. But there is another."</p>

<p>"Then I pray your lordship to tell me who that other is,"
Diogenes replied.</p>

<p>"You might find one, sirrah, in the <i>jongejuffrouw</i> Gilda
Beresteyn, the Lord of Stoutenburg's promised wife."</p>

<p>Diogenes made no reply to this. He was facing the table now,
still clinging to it with one hand, whilst the other wandered over
the objects on the table. Suddenly they encountered a crystal jug
which was full of wine. An expression of serene beatitude
overspread his face. He raised the goblet to his lips, but ere he
drank he said carelessly:</p>

<p>"Ah, the <i>jongejuffrouw</i> Beresteyn is the promised wife of
the Lord of Stoutenburg?"</p>

<p>"My promised wife!" Stoutenburg put in roughly. "Methought you
would ere this have recognized the man whom you tried to rob of all
that he held most precious."</p>

<p>"Your lordship must forgive me," the blind man rejoined drily.
"But some unknown miscreant&mdash;whom may the gods
punish&mdash;interfered with me yesterday forenoon, when I was
trying to render assistance to my friend Klaas. In the scuffle that
ensued, I received a cloud of stinking fumes in the face, which has
totally robbed me of sight."</p>

<p>As he spoke he raised his eyes, blinking in that pathetic and
inconsequent manner peculiar to the blind. Nicolaes gave an audible
groan. He could not bear to look on those sightless orbs, which in
the flickering light of the wax candles appeared weird and
unearthly.</p>

<p>"Oh," Stoutenburg put in carelessly, "is that how
the&mdash;er&mdash;accident occurred?"</p>

<p>"So, please your lordship, yes," Diogenes replied. "And I was
left stranded on the moor, since those two unreclaimed varlets,
Pythagoras and Socrates by name, did effectually ride off in the
wake of the Stadtholder, leaving me in the lurch. A pitiable
plight, your lordship will admit."</p>

<p>"So pitiable," the other retorted with a sneer, "that you
thought to improve your condition by bearding the Lord of
Stoutenburg in his lair."</p>

<p>"I did not know your lordship was in Amersfoort," Diogenes
replied imperturbably. "I thought&mdash;I hoped&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, and Stoutenburg tried in vain to read what went on
behind that seemingly unclouded brow. The blind man appeared
serene, detached, perfectly good-humoured. His slender hand, which
looked hard beneath its coating of grime, was closed lovingly
around the crystal jug. Stoutenburg vaguely wondered how far the
man was really drunk, or whether his misfortune had slightly addled
his brain. So much unconcern in the face of an imminent and
shameful death gave an uncanny air to the whole appearance of the
man. Even now, with a gently apologetic smile, he raised the jug
once more to his lips. Stoutenburg placed a peremptory hand upon
his arm.</p>

<p>"Put that down, man," he said harshly. "You are drunk enough as
it is, and you'll have need of all your wits to-night."</p>

<p>"There you are wrong my lord," Diogenes retorted, and quietly
transferred the jug to his other hand. "A man, meseems, needs no
wits to hang gracefully. And I feel that I could do that best if I
might quench my thirst ere I met my friend the hangman."</p>

<p>"You may not meet him at all."</p>

<p>"But just now you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That it was my intention to hang you," Stoutenburg assented.
"So it is. But I am in rare good humour to-night, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So it seems, my lord," the blind man put in carelessly. "So it
seems."</p>

<p>He appeared to be swaying on his feet, and to have some
difficulty in retaining his balance. He still clung to the edge of
the table with one hand. In the other he had the jug fill of
wine.</p>

<p>"The <i>jongejuffrouw</i> Gilda Beresteyn," Stoutenburg went on,
"will sup with me this night to celebrate our betrothal. The
fulfillment of this, my great desire, hath caused me to feel
lenient toward mine enemies."</p>

<p>"Have I not always asserted," Diogenes broke in with comical
solemnity&mdash;"always ass-asserted that your lordship was a noble
and true gentleman?"</p>

<p>"Women, we know," his lordship continued, ignoring the
interruption, "are wont to be tenderhearted where their&mdash;their
former swains are concerned. And I feel that if the
<i>jongejuffrouw</i> herself did make appeal to me on your behalf,
I would relent towards you."</p>

<p>"B-b-but would that not be an awkward&mdash;a very awkward
decision for your lordship?" Diogenes riposted, turning round
vacant eyes on Stoutenburg.</p>

<p>"Awkward? How so?</p>

<p>"If I do not hang, the <i>jongejuffrouw</i>, 'stead of being my
widow, would still be my wife. And the laws of this
country&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have no concern with the laws of this country," Stoutenburg
rejoined drily, "in which, anyhow, you are an alien. As soon as the
Archduchess our Liege Lady is once more mistress here, we shall
again be at war with England."</p>

<p>"Poor England!"</p>

<p>Diogenes sighed, and solemnly wiped a tear from his blinking
eyes.</p>

<p>"And every English <i>plepshurk</i> will be kicked out of the
country. But that is neither here nor there."</p>

<p>"Neither here nor there," the other assented, with owlish
gravity. "But before England is s-sh-s-swept off the map, my
lordship, what will happen?"</p>

<p>"My marriage to the <i>jongejuffrouw</i>," Stoutenburg replied
curtly. "She hath consented to be my wife, and my wife she will be
as soon as I have mind to take her. So you may drink to our union,
sirrah. I'll e'en pledge you in a cup."</p>

<p>He poured himself out a goblet of wine, laughing to himself at
his own ingenuity. That was the way to treat the smeerlap. Make him
feel what a pitiable, abject knave he was! Then show him up before
Gilda, just as he was&mdash;drunk, ragged, unkempt, an object of
derision in his misfortune rather than of pity.</p>

<p>"Nay," the rascal objected, his speech waxing thicker and his
hand more unsteady, "I cannot pledge you, my lord, in drinking to
your union with my own wife, unless&mdash;unless my friend Klaas
will drink to that union, too. Mine own brother by the law, you
see, my lord, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mynheer Nicolaes will indeed drink to his sister's happy union
with me," Stoutenburg retorted, with a sneer. "His presence here is
a witness to my good intentions toward the wench. So you may drink,
sirrah. The <i>jongejuffrouw</i> herself is overwilling to submit
to my pleasure&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the imperious words were smothered in his throat, giving
place to a fierce exclamation of choler. The blind man had at his
invitation raised the jug of wine to his lips, but in the act his
feet apparently slipped away from under him. The jug flew out of
his hand, would have caught the Lord of Stoutenburg on the head had
he not ducked just in time. But even so his Magnificence was hit on
the shoulder by the heavy crystal vessel, and splashed from head to
foot with the wine, whilst Diogenes collapsed on the floor with a
shamed and bibulous laugh.</p>

<p>A string of savage oaths and tempestuous abuse poured from
Stoutenburg's lips, which were in truth livid with rage. Already
Jan had rushed to his assistance, snatched up a serviette from the
table, and soon contrived to wipe his lordship's doublet clean.</p>

<p>The blind man in the meanwhile did his best to hoist himself up
on his feet once more, clung to the edge of the table; but the
sight of him released the last floodgate of Stoutenburg's
tempestuous wrath. He turned with a vicious snarl upon the
unfortunate man, and it would indeed have fared ill with the
defenceless creature, for the Lord of Stoutenburg was not wont to
measure his blows by the helplessness of his victims, had not a
sudden exclamation from Nicolaes stayed the hand that was raised to
strike.</p>

<p>"Gilda!" the young man cried impulsively.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg's arm dropped to his side. He turned toward the
door. Gilda had just entered with her father, and was coming slowly
down the room.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII&mdash;TEARS, SIGHS,
HEARTS</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Gilda caught sight of her beloved the moment she entered. To say
that their eyes met would indeed be folly. Certain it is, however,
that the blind man turned his sightless gaze in her direction. She
only gave a gasp, pressed her hands to her heart as if the pain
there was unendurable, and at the moment even the beauty of her
face was marred by the look of soul-racking misery in her eyes and
the quivering lines around her mouth.</p>

<p>The next moment, even while Jan and the soldiers retired,
closing the doors behind them, she was in her husband's arms. Ay,
even though Stoutenburg tried to intercept her. She did not hear
his mocking laugh, or her brother's vigorous protest, nor yet her
father's cry of horror. She just clung to him who, blind, fallen,
degraded an you will, was still the beloved of her heart, the man
to whom she had dedicated her soul.</p>

<p>She swallowed her tears, too proud to allow those who had
wrought his ruin to see how mortally she was hurt.</p>

<p>She passed her delicate hands, fragrant as the petals of
flowers, over his grimy face, those poor, stricken eyes, the noble
brow so deeply furrowed with pain. She murmured words of endearment
and of tenderness such as a mother might find to soothe the trouble
of a suffering child. All in a moment. Stoutenburg had not even the
time to interfere, to utter the savage oaths which rose from his
vengeful heart at sight of the loving pity which this beautiful
woman lavished on so contemptible an object.</p>

<p>Nor had the blind man time to encircle that exquisite form in
his trembling arms. He had put them out at first, with a pathetic
gesture of infinite longing. It was just a flash, a vision of his
past self, an oblivion of the hideous, appalling present. Her arms
at that moment were round his neck, her head against his breast,
her soft, fair hair against his lips.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>Then something happened. A magnetic current seemed to pass
through the air. Diogenes freed himself with a sudden jerk from
Gilda's clinging arms, staggered back against the table, swaying on
his feet and uttering an inane laugh; whilst she, left standing
alone, turned wide, bewildered eyes on her brother Nicolaes, who
happened to be close to her at the moment. I think that she was
near to unconsciousness then, and that she would have fallen, but
that the burgomaster stepped quickly to her side and put his arms
round her.</p>

<p>"May God punish you," he muttered between his teeth, and turned
to Stoutenburg, who had watched the whole scene with a sinister
scowl, "for this wanton and unnecessary cruelty!"</p>

<p>"You wrong me, mynheer," Stoutenburg retorted, with a shrug "I
but tried to make your daughter's decision easier for her."</p>

<p>Then, as the burgomaster made no reply, but, with grim, set look
on his face, drew his daughter gently down to the nearest chair,
Stoutenburg went on lightly, speaking directly to Gilda:</p>

<p>"In the course of my travels, <i>mejuffrouw</i>, I came across a
wise philosopher in Italy. He was a man whom an adverse fate had
robbed of most things that he held precious; but he told me that he
had quite succeeded in conquering adversity by the following means.
He would gaze dispassionately on the objects of his past desires,
see their defects, appraise them at their just value, and in every
case he found that their loss was not so irreparable as he had
originally believed."</p>

<p>"A fine moral lesson, my lord," the burgomaster interposed,
seeing that Gilda either would not or could not speak as yet. "But
I do not see its point."</p>

<p>"'Tis a simple one, mynheer," Stoutenburg retorted coldly. "I
pray you, look on the man to whom, an you had your way, you would
even now link your daughter."</p>

<p>Instinctively Beresteyn turned his lowering gaze in the
direction to which his lordship now pointed with a persuasive
gesture. Diogenes was standing beside the table, his powerful frame
drawn up to its full height, his sightless eyes blinking and
gleaming with weird inconsequence in the flickering light of the
candles. His hands were clasped behind his back, and on his face
there was a curious expression which the burgomaster was not shrewd
enough to define&mdash;one of self-deprecation, yet withal of
introspection and of detachment, as if the helpless body alone were
present and the mind had gone a-roaming in the land of dreams. The
burgomaster tried manfully to conceal the look of half-contemptuous
pity which, much against his will, had crept into his eyes.</p>

<p>"The man," he rejoined calmly, "is what Fate and a dastard's
hand have made him, my lord. Many a fine work of God hath been
marred by an evildoer's action."</p>

<p>"That is as may be mynheer," Stoutenburg riposted coolly. "But
'tis of the present and of the future you have to think
now&mdash;not of the past."</p>

<p>"Even so, my lord, I would sooner see my daughter in the arms of
the stricken lion than in those of a wily jackal."</p>

<p>"Am I the wily jackal?" Stoutenburg put in, with a sneer. Then,
as the burgomaster made no reply, he added tersely: "I see that the
<i>jongejuffrouw</i> hath told you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Everything," Beresteyn assented calmly.</p>

<p>"And that I await your blessing on our union?"</p>

<p>"My blessing you cannot have, my lord, as you well know," the
burgomaster retorted firmly. "'Twas blasphemy to invoke the name of
God on such an unholy alliance. My daughter is the lawfully wedded
wife of an English gentleman, Sir Percy Blakeney by name, and until
the law of this country doth sever those bonds she cannot wed
another."</p>

<p>Stoutenburg gave a strident laugh.</p>

<p>"That is, indeed, unfortunate for the English gentleman with the
high-sounding name," he said, with a sneer, "whom I gravely suspect
of being naught but the common varlet whom we all know so well in
Haarlem. But, gentleman or churl," he added, with a cynical shrug,
"'tis all one to me. He hangs to-morrow, unless&mdash;"</p>

<p>A loud cry of burning indignation escaped the burgomaster's
lips.</p>

<p>"You would not further provoke the wrath of God," he exclaimed,
"by this foul and cowardly crime!"</p>

<p>"And why not, I pray you?" the other coolly retorted. "Nor do I
think that the Almighty would greatly care what happened to this
drunken knave. The refuse of human kind, the halt, the lame, and
the blind, are best out of the way."</p>

<p>"A man, my lord," the burgomaster protested, "Who when he had
you in his power, generously spared your life!"</p>

<p>"The more fool he!" Stoutenburg riposted drily. "'Tis my turn
now. He hangs to-morrow, unless, indeed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless, what, my lord?"</p>

<p>"Unless," Stoutenburg went on, with an evil leer, "my future
wife will deign to plead with me for him&mdash;with a kiss."</p>

<p>A groan like that of a wounded beast broke from the
burgomaster's heavy heart. For a moment a light that was almost
murderous gleamed in his eyes. His fists were clenched; he murmured
a dark threat against the man who goaded him wellnigh to madness.
Then, suddenly, he met Stoutenburg's mocking glance fixed upon him,
and a huge sob rose in his throat, almost choking him. Gilda, with
a pitiful moan, had hidden her face against her father's
sleeve.</p>

<p>"'Tis but anticipating the happy time by a few hours,"
Stoutenburg went on, with calm cynicism. "But I have a fancy to
hold my future wife in my arms now&mdash;at this moment&mdash;and
to grant her in exchange for her first willing kiss the life of a
miserable wretch whose life or death are, in truth, of no account
to me."</p>

<p>He took a step or two forward in the direction where Gilda sat,
clinging with desperate misery to her father. Then, as the
burgomaster, superb with indignation, grand in his dignity,
Instinctively interposed his burly figure between his daughter and
the man whom she loathed, Stoutenburg added, with well-assumed
carelessness:</p>

<p>"If the <i>jongejuffrouw</i> prefers to put off the happy moment
until we are alone in my camp to-morrow, we'll say no more about
it. Let the rogue hang; I care not!"</p>

<p>"My lord,"&mdash;the burgomaster spoke once more in a vigorous
protest, which, alas, he knew to be futile&mdash;"what you suggest
is monstrous, inhuman! God will never permit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I pray you, mynheer," Stoutenburg broke in fiercely, "let us
leave the Almighty out of our affairs. I have read my Bible as
assiduously as you when I was younger, and in it I learned that God
hath enjoined all wives to submit themselves to their husbands. A
kiss from my betrothed, a word or gentle pleading, are little
enough to ask in exchange for an act of clemency. And you, Heer
Burgomaster, do but stiffen my will by your interference. Will you,
at least, let the <i>jongejuffrouw</i> decide on the matter for
herself, and, in her interests and your own, give to all that she
does your unqualified consent!"</p>

<p>"My consent you'll never wring from me, as you well know, my
lord. I and my daughter are powerless to withstand your might, but
if we bend to the yoke it is because it hath pleased God that we
should wear it, not because we submit with a free will. By exulting
in such a monstrous crime you do but add to the loathing which we
both feel for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Silence!" Stoutenburg broke in fiercely. "Silence, you dolt!
What good, think you, you do yourself or your daughter by provoking
me beyond endurance? She knows my decision, and so, methinks, do
you. If the <i>jongejuffrouw</i> feels such unqualified hatred for
me, let her return to your protecting arms and leave Amersfoort to
its fate. As for that sightless varlet, let him hang, I say! I am a
fool, indeed to listen to your gibberish! Jan!" he called, and
strode to the door with a great show of determination, staking his
all now on this card which he had decided to play.</p>

<p>But the card was a winning one, as well he knew. Already Gilda,
as if moved by an unseen voice, had jumped to her feet and
intercepted him ere he reached the door. Her whole appearance had
changed&mdash;the expression of her eyes, her tone, her
gestures.</p>

<p>"My father is overwrought, my lord," she said firmly. "He hath
already promised me that he would offer no opposition to my
wishes."</p>

<p>She looked him straight in the eyes, and he returned her gaze,
his restless eyes seeming to search her very soul. She had, in
truth, changed most markedly. She was, of course,
afraid&mdash;afraid for that miserable <i>plepshurk's</i> life. But
the change was something more than that&mdash;at least, Stoutenburg
chose to think so. There was something in her glance at this moment
that he did not quite understand, that he did not dare understand.
A wavering&mdash;almost he would have called it a softness, had he
dared. He came nearer to her, and, though at first she drew back
from him, she presently held her ground, still gazing on him like a
bird when it is fascinated and cannot move.</p>

<p>Now he was quite sure that her blue eyes looked less hard, and
certainly her mouth was less tightly set. Her lips were slightly
parted, and her breath came quick and panting. Ah, women were queer
creatures! Had Nicolaes been right when he quoted the English play?
Gilda had certainly begun by falling against that contemptible
rascal's breast, but since then? Had her wayward fancy been
repelled by that whole air of physical degradation which emanated
from the once brilliant cavalier, or had it been merely dazzled by
visions of power and of wealth, which had their embodiment in him
who was her future lord?</p>

<p>He himself could not say. All that he knew, all that he felt of
a certainty now, was that he held more than one winning card in
this gamble for possession of an exquisite and desirable woman.
Still holding her gaze, he took her hands. She did not resist, did
not attempt to draw away from him, and he murmured softly:</p>

<p>"What are your wishes, <i>myn engel</i>?"</p>

<p>"To submit to your will, my lord," she replied firmly.</p>

<p>"At last!" he exclaimed, on a note of triumph, drew her still
closer to him. "A kiss, fair one, to clinch this bargain, which
hath made me the happiest of men!"</p>

<p>He had lost his head for the moment. Satisfaction, and an almost
feverish sense of exultation, had turned his blood to liquid fire.
All that he saw was this lovely woman, whom he had nearly
conquered. Nearly, but not quite. At his desire for a kiss he felt
that she stiffened. She closed her eyes, and even her lips became
bloodless. She appeared on the verge of a swoon. Bah! Even this
phase would pass away. Nicolaes was right. Women reserved their
contempt for weaklings. In the end 'twas the master whom they
adored.</p>

<p>"A kiss, fair one!" he called again. "And the rogue shall live
or hang according as your lips are sweet or bitter!"</p>

<p>He was on the point of snatching that kiss at last, when
suddenly there came so violent a crash that the whole room shook
with the concussion, and even the windows rattled in their frames.
The blind man, more unsteady than ever on his feet, had tried to
get hold of a chair, lost his balance in the act, and, in the
endeavour to save himself from falling, had lurched so clumsily
against the table that it overturned, and all the objects upon
it&mdash;silver, crystal, china dishes, and candelabra&mdash;fell
with a deafening clatter on the floor.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg, uttering one of his favourite oaths, had
instinctively turned to see whence had come this terrific noise. In
turning, his hold on Gilda's wrists had slightly relaxed;
sufficiently, at any rate, to enable her to free herself from his
grasp and to seek shelter once more beside her father. Diogenes
alone had remained unruffled through the commotion. Indeed, he
appeared wholly unconscious that he had brought it about. He had
collapsed amidst the litter, and now sprawled on the floor,
surrounded by a medley of broken glass, guttering candles, hot food
and liquor, convulsed with laughter, whist his huge, dark eyes,
with the dilated pupils and pale, narrow circles of blue light,
looked strangely ghostlike in the gloom.</p>

<p>"Who in thunder," he muttered inarticulately, "is making this
confounded din?"</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>At the noise, too, the men had come running in from the hall.
The sound had been akin to the detonation of a dozen pistols, and
they had rushed along, prepared for a fight. With the fall of the
candelabra, the vast banqueting hall had suddenly been plunged into
semi-darkness. Only a couple of wax candles in tall sconces, which
had originally set on the sideboard, vaguely illumined the
disorderly scene.</p>

<p>Diogenes, with his infectious laugh, did in truth succeed in
warding off the punishment which his Magnificence already held in
preparation for him. As it was, Stoutenburg caught sight of Gilda's
look of anxiety, and this at once put him into a rare good humour.
He had had his wish. Gilda had been almost kind, had practically
yielded to him in the presence of the man whom he desired to
humiliate and to wound, as he himself had been humiliated and
wounded in the past.</p>

<p>Whether the blind man's keen sense of hearing had taken in every
detail of the scene, it was of course impossible to say. But one
thing he must have heard&mdash;the brief soliloquy at the door,
when Gilda, in response to his ardent query. "What are your wishes,
<i>myn engel</i>?" had replied quite firmly: "To submit to your
will, my lord!" That moment must, in truth, have been more galling
and more bitter to the once gallant Laughing Cavalier than the
rattle of the rope upon the gallows, or the first consciousness
that he was irremediably blind.</p>

<p>Indeed, Stoutenburg had had something more than his wish. To
make a martyr of the rogue, he would have told you, was not part of
his desire. All that he wanted was to obliterated the man's former
brilliant personality from Gilda's mind; that he should henceforth
dwell in her memory as she last saw him, abject in his obvious
impotence, owing his life to the woman whom he had wooed and
conquered in the past with the high hand of a reckless adventurer.
After that, the rogue might hang or perish in a ditch: his lordship
did not care. What happened to blind men in these days of fighting
when none but the best men had a chance to live at all, he had
never troubled his head to inquire. At any rate, he knew that a
sightless lion was less harmful than a keen-eyed mouse. Ah, in
truth he had had more than his wish and satisfied now as to the
present and the future, the thought that the moment had come to let
well alone, and to remove from Gilda's sight the spectacle which,
by some subtle reaction, might turn her heart back to pity for the
knave. He gave Jan a significant nod.</p>

<p>But Gilda, whose glowing eyes had watched his every movement,
was quick to interpose.</p>

<p>"My lord," she cried in protest, "I hold you to your
bargain!"</p>

<p>"Have no fear, myn chat," he answered suavely. "I will not
repudiate it. The fellow's life is safe enough whilst you and the
Heer Burgomaster honour me by supping with me. After that, the
decision rests with you. As I said just now, he shall live or hang
according as your lips are sweet or bitter. For the nonce, I am
wearied and hungry. We'll sup first, so please you."</p>

<p>And Gilda had to stand by whilst she saw her husband dragged
away from her presence. He offered no resistance; indeed, accepted
the situation with that good-humoured philosophy which was so
characteristic of him. But, oh, if she could have conveyed to him
by a look all the tenderness, the sorrow, the despair, that was
torturing her heart! If she could have run to him just once more,
to whisper into his ear those burning words of love which would
have eased his pain and hers!</p>

<p>If she could have defied that abominable tyrant who gloated over
her misery, and, hand in hand with her beloved, have met death by
his side, with his arms around her, her spirit wedded to his, ere
they appeared together before the judgement seat of God!</p>

<p>But, as that arrogant despot had reminded her, she had even lost
the freedom to die. The destinies of her native city were in her
hands. Unless she bowed her willing neck to his will, Amersfoort
and all its citizens would be wiped off the face of the earth. And
as she watched the chosen of her heart led like a captive lion to
humiliation if not to death those monstrous words rang in her ears,
that surely must provoke the wrath of God.</p>

<p>Therefore, she watched his departure dry-eyed and motionless.
Ay! envying him in her heart, that he, at least, was not called
upon to make such an appalling sacrifice as lay now before her. She
had indeed come to that sublimity of human suffering that she
almost wished to see those dear, sightless eyes closed in their
last long sleep, rather than that he should be forced to endure
what to him would be ten thousand times worse than death&mdash;her
submission to that miscreant&mdash;her willing union; and he,
ignorant of how the tyrant had wrung this submission from her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;THE STYGIAN
CREEK</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>The Lord or Stoutenburg was conscious of a great feeling of
relief when the blind man was finally removed from his presence.
While the latter stood there, even in the abjectness of his plight,
Stoutenburg felt that he was a living menace to the success of all
his well-thought-out schemes. He kept his eyes fixed on Gilda with
a warning look, that should be a reminder to her of the
immutability of his resolve. He tried, in a manner, to surround her
with a compelling fluid that would engulf her resistance and leave
her weak and passive to his will.</p>

<p>There was of necessity a vast amount of confusion and din ere
order was restored among the débris; and conversation was
impossible in the midst of the clatter that was going on&mdash;men
coming and going, the rattle of silver and glass. Gilda, the while,
sat quite still, her blue eyes fixed with strange intensity on the
door through which her beloved had disappeared. Her father stood
beside her, holding her hand, and she rested her cheek against
his.</p>

<p>The burgomaster, throughout the last scene, had not once looked
at Diogenes. A dark, puzzled frown lingered between his brows
whilst he stared moodily into the fire. He absolutely ignored the
presence of his son, putting into practice his stern dictum that
henceforth he had no son, whilst Nicolaes, who was becoming inured
to his shameful position, put on a careless and jaunty air, spoke
with easy familiarity to Stoutenburg, and peremptorily to the
men.</p>

<p>Then at last the table was once more set, the candles relit, and
the board again spread for supper. Stoutenburg, with an elegant
flourish, invited his guests to sit, offered his arm to Gilda to
lead her to the table. She, moved by a pathetic desire to
conciliate him, a forlorn hope that a great show of submission on
her part would soften his cruel heart and lighten the fate of her
beloved, placed her hand upon his sleeve, and when she met his
admiring glance a slight flush drove the pallor from her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"You are adorable, <i>myn geloof</i>!" he murmured.</p>

<p>He appeared highly elated, sat at the head of the table, with
Gilda on his right and the burgomaster on his left, whilst Nicolaes
sat beside his sister.</p>

<p>The two old crones served the supper, coming and going with a
noiselessness and precision acquired in long service in the
well-conducted house of the burgomaster. They knew the use of the
two pronged silver utensils which Mynheer Beresteyn had acquired of
late direct from France, where they were used at the table of
gentlemen of quality for conveying food to the mouth. They knew how
to remove each service from the centre of the table without unduly
disturbing the guests, and how to replace one cloth with another
the moment it became soiled with sauce or wine.</p>

<p>Jan stood at the Lord of Stoutenburg's elbow and served him
personally and with his own hands. Every dish, before it was handed
to his lordship, was placed in front of the burgomaster, who was
curtly bidden to taste of it. His Magnificence, adept in the
poisoner's art, was taking no risks himself.</p>

<p>The cook had done his best, and the supper was, I believe,
excellent. The Oille, the most succulent of dishes, made up of
quails, capons, and ducks and other tasty meats, was a marvel of
gastronomic art, and so were the tureens of beef with cucumber and
the breast of veal larded and garnished with hard-boiled eggs. In
truth it was all a terrible waste, and sad to see such excellent
fare laid before guests who hardly would touch a morsel. Gilda
could not eat, her throat seemed to close up every time she tried
to swallow. Indeed, she had to appeal to the very last shred of her
pride to keep up a semblance of dignity before her enemy. The
burgomaster, too, flushed with shame at the indignity put upon him,
did no more than taste of the dishes as they were put before him by
the surly Jan.</p>

<p>The Lord of Stoutenburg, on the other hand, put up a great show
of hilarity, talked much and drank deeply, discussed in a loud,
arrogant voice with Nicolaes the Archduchess's plans for the
subduing of the Netherlands. And Nicolaes, after he had imbibed two
or three bumpers of heady Spanish wine, felt more assured, returned
Gilda's reproachful glances with indifference, and his father's
contempt with defiance.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>What Gilda suffered it were a vain attempt to describe. How she
contrived to remain at the table; to appear indifferent almost gay;
to glance up now and again at a persuasive challenge from
Stoutenburg, will for ever remain her secret. She never spoke of
that hour, of that hateful, harrowing supper, like an odious
nightmare, which was wont in after years to sent a shudder of
horror right through her whenever she recalled it.</p>

<p>The burgomaster remained at first obstinately silent, whilst the
Lord of Stoutenburg talked with studied insolence of the future of
the Netherlands. The happy times would now come back, the traitor
vowed, when the United Provinces, dissolved into feeble and
separate entities, without form or governance, would once more
return to their allegiance and bow the knee before the might of
Spain; when the wholesome rule of another Alva would teach these
stiffnecked and presumptuous burghers that comfort and a measure of
welfare could only be obtained by unconditional surrender and
submission to a high, unconquerable Power.</p>

<p>"Freedom! Liberty!" he sneered. "Ancient Charters! Bah! Empty,
swaggering words, I say, which their masters will soon force them
to swallow. Then will follow an era more suited to all this
beggarly Dutch rabble, one that will teach them a lesson which will
at last stick in their memories. The hangman, that's what they
want! The stake! The rack! Our glorious Inquisition, and the
relentlessness which, alas, for the nonce hath lain buried with our
immortal Alva!"</p>

<p>He drank a loyal toast to the coming new era, to the
Archduchess, to King Philip IV, who in his glorious reign would see
Spain once more unconquered, the Netherlands subdued, England
punished at last. Nicolaes joined him with many a lustful shout,
whilst the burgomaster sat with set lips, his eyes glowing with
suppressed indignation. Once or twice it seemed as if his stern
self-control would give way, as if his burning wrath would betray
him into words and deeds that might cause abysmal misery to
hundreds of innocent people whilst not serving in any way the cause
which he would have given his life to uphold.</p>

<p>Indeed, in the book of heroic deeds of which God's angel hath a
record, none stand out more brilliantly than the endurance of the
Burgomaster of Amersfoort and of his daughter on this memorable
occasion. Nor is there in the whole valorous history of the
Netherlands a more glorious page than that which tells of the
sacrifice made by father and daughter in order to save the city
which they loved from threatened annihilation.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>But like all things, good and evil, the trial came to an end at
last. The Lord of Stoutenburg gave the signal, and the burgomaster
and Gilda rose from the table both, in truth, with a deep sigh of
thankfulness.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg remained deferential until the
end&mdash;deferential, that is, with an undercurrent of mockery,
which he took no pains to conceal, His bow, as he finally took
leave of his guests, bidding the burgomaster a simple farewell and
Gilda au revoir until the dawn on the morrow, was so obviously
ironical that Beresteyn was goaded into an indignant tirade, which
he regretted almost as soon as he had uttered it.</p>

<p>"Let him who stands," he said firmly, and with all of his wonted
dignity, "take heed lest he fall. The Netherlands are not conquered
yet, my lord, because your mercenary troops have succeeded, for the
time being, in overrunning one of her provinces. Ede may have
fallen. Amersfoort may for the moment, be under your
heel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Arnheim and Nijmegen may have capitulated by now," Stoutenburg
broke in derisively. "Sold to De Berg, like Amersfoort and Ede, by
the craven <i>smeerlap</i> to whom you have given your
daughter."</p>

<p>"Even that may have happened," the burgomaster riposted hotly,
"if so be the will of God. But we are a race of fighters. We have
beaten and humiliated the Spaniard and driven him from off our land
before now. And Maurice of Nassau, the finest captain of the age,
is unconquered still!"</p>

<p>"Mightily sick, so I'm told," the other put in carelessly. "He
was over-ready, methinks, to abandon Amersfoort to its fate."</p>

<p>"Only to punish you more effectually in the end. Take heed, my
lord, take heed! The multiplicity of your crimes will find you out
soon enough."</p>

<p>"'Sblood!" retorted Stoutenburg, unperturbed; "but you forget,
mynheer burgomaster, that, whate'er betide me, your daughter's fate
is henceforth linked to mine own."</p>

<p>Then it was that Beresteyn repented of his outburst, for indeed
he had gained nothing by it, and Stoutenburg had used the one
argument which was bound to silence him. What, in truth, was the
use of wrangling? Dignity was sure to suffer, and that mocking
recreant would only feel that his triumph was more complete.</p>

<p>Even now he only laughed, pointed with an ironical flourish of
his arm to the widely open doors, through which in the dimly
lighted hall, a group of men could be perceived, sitting or
standing around the centre table, with Diogenes standing in their
midst, his fair head crowned by the hideous bandage, and his broad
shoulders towering above the puny, swarthy Spanish soldiery. He had
a mug of ale in his hand, and holding it aloft he was singing a
ribald song, the refrain of which was taken up by the men. In the
vague and flickering light of resin torches, his sightless orbs
looked spectral, like those of a wraith.</p>

<p>"You should be grateful to me, mynheer," Stoutenburg added with
a sneer, "for freeing your daughter from such a yoke."</p>

<p>He returned to Gilda, took her unresisting hand and raised it to
his lips. Above it, he was watching her face. She was looking
beyond him, straight at the blind man; and though Stoutenburg at
that moment would have bartered much for the knowledge of what was
in her thoughts, he could not define the expression of her eyes. At
one time he thought that they had softened, that the fulfilment of
all his hopes was hanging once more in the balance. It seemed for
the moment as if she would snatch away her hand and seek shelter,
as she had done before, against the heart of her beloved; that
right through that outer husk of misery and degradation she saw
something that puzzled her rather than repelled. A question seemed
to be hovering on her lips. A question of a protest. Or was it a
mute appeal for forgiveness?</p>

<p>Stoutenburg could not tell. But he felt that for a space of a
few seconds the whole edifice of his desires was tottering, that
Fate might, after all, still be holding a thunderbolt in store for
him, which would hurl him down from the pinnacle of this momentary
triumph. Gilda&mdash;as a woman&mdash;was still unconquered.
Neither her heart nor her soul would ever be his. Somehow it was
the glance wherewith she regarded the blind man that told the Lord
of Stoutenburg this one unalterable fact.</p>

<p>The sortilege which he had tried to evoke, by letting her look
on the pitiful wreck who had once been her lover, had fallen short
in its potent charm. His own brilliant prospects, his masterful
personality, ay, his well-assumed indifference, had all failed to
cast their spells over her. Unlike the valiant Petruchio of the
English play, he had not yet succeeded in taming this beautiful
shrew. In the past she had resisted his blandishments; if she
succumbed at all, it would be beneath the weight of his
tyranny.</p>

<p>Well, so be it! Nicolaes, no doubt, had been right when he said
that women reserved their disdain for weaklings. It was the man of
iron who won a woman's love. The thought sent a fierce glow of
hatred coursing through his blood. Mythical and fatalistic as he
was, he believed that his lucky star would only begin to rise when
he had succeeded in winning Gilda for his own. He had deemed women
an easy conquest in the past. This one could not resist him for
long. Even men were wont to come readily under his
way&mdash;witness Nicolaes Beresteyn, who was as wax in his hands.
In the past, he had delighted in wielding a kind of cabalistic
power, which he undoubtedly possessed, over many a weak or shifty
character. His mother even was wont to call him a magician, and
stood not a little in awe of the dark-visaged, headstrong child,
and later on of the despotic, lawless youth, who had set the crown
on her manifold sorrows by his callousness and his crimes.</p>

<p>That power had been on the wane of late. But it was
not&mdash;could not&mdash;be gone from him forever. Nicolaes was
still his sycophant. Jan and his kind were willing to go to death
for him. His own brain had devised a means for bringing that
obstinate burgomaster and the beautiful Gilda to their knees. Then,
of a surety, in the Cornucopia of Fate there was something more
comforting, more desirable, than a thunderbolt!</p>

<p>Was he not a man the master of his destiny?</p>

<p>Bah! What was a woman's love, after all? Why not let her
go&mdash;be content with worldly triumphs? The sacking of
Amersfoort, which would yield him wealth and treasure; the
gratitude of the Archduchess: a high&mdash;if not the
highest&mdash;position in the reconquered provinces! Why not be
content with those? And Stoutenburg groaned like a baffled tiger,
because in his heart of hearts he knew these things would not
content him in the end. He wanted Gilda! Gilda, of the blue eyes
and the golden hair, the demure glance and fragrant hands. His
desire for her was in his bones, and he felt that he would indeed
go raving mad if he lost her after this&mdash;if that beggarly
drunkard, unwashed, dishonoured, and stricken with blindness,
triumphed through his very abasement and the magnitude of his
misfortune.</p>

<p>"This, at any rate, I can avert!" he murmured under his breath.
And somehow the thought eased the racking jealousy that was
torturing him&mdash;jealousy of such an abject thing. He waited
until Gilda had passed out of the room, and when she was standing
in the hall, so obviously bidding a last farewell in her heart to
the man she loved so well, he called peremptorily to Jan:</p>

<p>"Take the varlet," he commanded roughly, "and hang him on the
Koppel-poort!"</p>

<p>At the word Gilda turned on him like an infuriated tigress.
Pushing past her father, past the men, who recoiled from her as if
from a madwoman, she was back beside the execrable despot who thus
put the crown on his hideous cruelties.</p>

<p>"Your bargain, my lord!" she cried hoarsely. "You dare
not&mdash;you dare not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My bargain, fair one?" Stoutenburg retorted coolly. "Nay, you
were so averse to fulfilling your share of it, that I have repented
me of proposing it. The varlet hangs. That is my last word."</p>

<p>His last word! And Jan so ready to obey! The men were already
closing in around her beloved; less than a minute later they had
his hands securely pinioned behind his back. Can you wonder that
she lost her head, that she fought to free herself from her
father's arms, and, throwing reserve, dignity to the winds, threw
herself at the feet of that inhuman monster and pleaded with him as
no woman on earth had, mayhap, ever pleaded before?</p>

<p>We do not like to think of that exquisite, refined woman
kneeling before such an abominable dastard. Yet she did it! Words
of appeal, of entreaty, poured from her quivering lips. She raised
her tear-stained face to his, embraced his knees with her arms. She
forgot the men that stood by, puzzled and vaguely awed&mdash;Jan
resolute, her father torn to the heart. She forgot everything save
that there was a chance&mdash;a remote chance&mdash;of softening a
cruel heart, and she could not&mdash;no, could not!&mdash;see the
man she loved dragged to shameful death before her eyes.</p>

<p>She promised&mdash;oh, she promised all that she had to
give!</p>

<p>"I'll be your willing slave, my lord, in all things," she
pleaded, her voice broken and hoarse. "Your loving wife, as you
desire. A kiss from me? Take it, an you will. I'll not resist! Nay,
I'll return it from my heart, in exchange for your clemency."</p>

<p>Then it was that the burgomaster succeeded at last in tearing
her away from her humiliating position. He dragged her to her feet,
drew her to his breast, tried by words and admonition to revive in
her her sense of dignity and her self-control. Only with one word
did he, in his turn, condescend to plead.</p>

<p>"An you have a spark of humanity left in you, my lord," he said
loudly, "order your executioners to be quick about their
business."</p>

<p>For the Lord of Stoutenburg had, with a refinement of cruelty
almost unbelievable, were it not a matter of history, stayed Jan
from executing his inhuman order.</p>

<p>"Wait!" his glittering eyes appeared to say to the sycophant
henchman who hung upon his looks. "Let me enjoy this feast until I
am satiated."</p>

<p>Then, when Gilda lay at last, half-swooning in the shelter of
her father's arms, he said coolly:</p>

<p>"Have I not said, fair one, that if you deigned to plead the
rascal should not hang? See! The potency of your charm upon my
sensitive heart! The man who hath always been my most bitter enemy,
and whom at last I have within my power, shall live because your
fair arms did encircle my knees, and because of your free will you
offered me a kiss. Mynheer Burgomaster," he added, with easy
condescension, "I pray you lead your daughter to her room. She is
over-wrought and hath need of rest. Go in peace, I pray you. That
drunken varlet is safe now in my hands."</p>

<p>The burgomaster could not trust himself to reply. Only his
loving hands wandered with a gentle, soothing gesture over his
beloved daughter's hair, whilst he murmured soft, endearing words
in her ear. Gradually she became more calm, was able to gather her
wits together, to realize what she had done and all that she had
sacrificed, probably in vain. Stoutenburg had spoken soft words,
but how could she trust him, who had ever proved himself a liar and
a cheat? She was indeed like a miserable, captive bird, held,
maimed and bruised, in a cruel trap set by vengeful and cunning
hands. It seemed almost incredible why she should be made to suffer
so.</p>

<p>What had she done? In what horrible way had she sinned before
God, that His hand should lie so heavily upon her? Even her
sacrifice&mdash;sublime and selfless&mdash;failed to give her the
consolation of duty nobly accomplished. Everything before her was
dreary and dark. Life itself was nought but torture. The few
days&mdash;hours&mdash;that must intervene until she knew that
Amersfoort was safe confronted her like the dark passage into
Gehenna. Beyond them lay death at last, and she, a young girl
scarce out of adolescence, hitherto rich, beautiful, adulated, was
left to long for that happy release from misery with an intensity
of longing akin to the sighing of souls in torment.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;TREACHERY</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Throughout this harrowing scene the blind man had stood by,
pinioned, helpless, almost lifeless in his immobility. The only
sign of life in him seemed to be in those weird, sightless orbs, in
which the flickering light of the resin torches appeared to draw
shafts of an unearthly glow. He was pinioned and could not move.
Half a dozen soldiers had closed in around him. Whether he heard
all that went on, many who were there at the time declared it to be
doubtful. But, even if he heard, what could he have done? He could
not even put his hands up to his ears to shut out that awful sound
of his beloved wife's hoarse, spent voice pleading desperately for
him.</p>

<p>One of the men who was on guard over him told De Voocht
afterwards that he could hear the tough sinews cracking against the
bonds that held the giant captive, and that great drops of sweat
appeared upon the fine, wide brow. When Gilda, leaning heavily upon
her father's arm, finally mounted the stairs which led up to her
room, the blind man turned his head in that direction. But the
<i>jongejuffrouw</i> went on with head bent and did not glance down
in response.</p>

<p>All this we know from De Voocht, who speaks of it in his
"Brieven." But he was not himself present on the scene and hath it
only from hearsay. He questioned several of the men subsequently as
he came in contact with them, and, of course, the burgomaster's
testimony was the most clear and the most detailed. Mynheer
Beresteyn admitted that, throughout that awful,
ne'er-to-be-forgotten evening, he could not understand the blind
man's attitude, was literally tortured with doubts of him. Was he,
in truth, the craven wretch which he appeared to be&mdash;the
miserable traitor who had sold the Stadtholder's original plans to
De Berg, betrayed Marquet and De Keysere, and hopelessly
jeopardized the whole of Gelderland, if not the entire future of
the Netherlands? If so, he was well-deserving of the gallows, which
would not fail to be his lot.</p>

<p>But was he? Was he?</p>

<p>The face, of course, out of which the light of the eyes had
vanished, was inscrutable. The mouth, remember, was partially
hidden by the three days' growth of beard, and grime and fatigue
had further obliterated all other marks of expression. Of course,
the man must have suffered tortures of humiliation and rage, which
would effectually deaden all physical pain. But at the time he
seemed not to suffer. Indeed, at one moment it almost seemed if he
were asleep, with sightless eyes wide open, and standing on his
feet.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>After Gilda and her father had disappeared on the floor above,
the Lord of Stoutenburg, like a wild and caged beast awaiting
satisfaction, began pacing up and down the long banqueting-hall.
The doors leading into it from the hall had been left wide open,
and the men could see his lordship in his restless wanderings, his
heavy boots ringing against the reed-covered floor. He held his
arms folded across his chest, and was gnawing&mdash;yes,
gnawing&mdash;his knuckles in the excess of his excitement and his
choler.</p>

<p>Then he called Jan, and parleyed with him for awhile, consulted
Mynheer Nicolaes, who was more taciturn and gloomy than ever
before.</p>

<p>The soldiers knew what was coming. They had witnessed the scene
between the <i>jongejuffrouw</i> and his Magnificence and some of
them who had wives and sweethearts of their own, had felt
uncomfortable lumps, at the time, in their throats. Others, who had
sons, fell to wishing that their offsprings might be as finely
built, as powerful as that poor, blind, intoxicated wretch who, in
truth, now had no use for his magnificent muscles.</p>

<p>But what would you? These were troublous times. Life was
cheap&mdash;counted for nothing in sight of such great gentlemen as
was the Lord of Stoutenburg. The varlet, it seems, had offended his
lordship awhile ago. Jan knew the story, and was very bitter about
it, too. Well, no man could expected to be treated with gentleness
by a great lord whom he had been fool enough to offend. The blind
rascallion would hang, of that there could be no doubt. The
<i>jongejuffrouw</i> had been pacified with soft words and vague
promises, but the rascal would hang. Any man there would have bet
his shirt on the issue. You had only to look at his lordship. A
more determined, more terrifying look it were impossible to meet.
Even Jan looked a little scared. When his Magnificence looked like
that it boded no good to any one. All the rancour, the gall, that
had accumulated in his heart against everything that pertained to
the United Provinces and to their Stadtholder would effectively
smother the slightest stirring of conscience or pity. Perhaps, when
the <i>jongejuffrouw</i> knelt at his feet, he had thought of his
mother, who, equally distraught and equally humiliated, had knelt
in vain at the Stadtholder's feet, pleading for the life of her
sons. Oh, yes, all that had made the Lord of Stoutenburg terribly
hard and callous.</p>

<p>But the men were sorry for the blind vagabond, for all that. He
had had nothing to do with the feuds between the Stadtholder and
the sons of Olden Barneveldt. He had done nothing, seemingly, save
to win the love of the beautiful lady whom his Magnificence had
marked for his own. He was brave, too. You could not help admiring
him as he stood between you and your comrades, his head thrown
back, a splendid type of virility and manhood. Half-seas over he
may have been. His misfortunes were, in truth, enough to make any
man take a drink; but you could not help but see that there was an
air of spirituality about the forehead and the sensitive nostrils
which redeemed the face from any suggestion of sensuality. And now
and again a quaint smile would play round the corners of his mouth,
and the whole wan face would light up as if with a sudden whimsical
thought.</p>

<p>Then all at once he threw back his head and yawned.</p>

<p>Such a droll fellow! Yawning on the brink of eternity! It was,
in truth, a pity he should hang!</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>Yes, the blind man yawned, loudly and long, like one who is
ready for bed. And the harmless sound completed Stoutenburg's
exasperation. He once more gave the harsh word of command:</p>

<p>"Take the varlet out and hang him!"</p>

<p>Obviously this time it would be irrevocable. There was no one
here to plead, and there was Jan, stolid and grim as was his wont,
already at attention under the lintel&mdash;a veritable tower of
strength in support of his chief's decisions.</p>

<p>Jan was not in the habit of arguing with his lordship. This, or
any other order, was as one to him. As for the blind
vagabond&mdash;well, Jan was as eager as his Magnificence to get
the noose around the rascal's throat. There were plenty of old
scores to settle between them&mdash;the humiliation of three months
ago, which had sent Stoutenburg, disgraced and a fugitive, out of
the land, had hit Jan severely, too.</p>

<p>And that never-to-be-forgotten discomfiture was entirely due to
this miserable caitiff, who, indeed would get naught but his
deserts.</p>

<p>The task, in truth, was a congenial one to Jan. A blind man was
easy enough to deal with, and this one offered but little
resistance. He had been half-asleep, it seems, and only woke to
find himself on the brink of eternity. Even so, his good-humour did
not forsake him.</p>

<p>"Odd's fish!" he exclaimed when, roughly shaken from his
somnolence, he found himself in the hands of the soldiery. "I had
forgotten this hanging business. You might have left a man to
finish his dreams in peace."</p>

<p>He appeared dazed, and his speech was thick. He had been
drinking heavily all the evening, and, save for an odd moment or so
of lucid interval, he had been hopelessly fuddled all along. And he
was merry in his cups; laughter came readily to his lips; he was
full of quips and sallies, too, which kept the men in rare
good-humour. In truth, the fellow would joke and sing apparently
until the hangman's rope smothered all laughter in his throat.</p>

<p>But he had an unquenchable thirst; entreated the men to bring
him a jug of wine.</p>

<p>"Spanish wine," he pleaded. "I dote on Spanish wine, but had so
little of it to drink in my day. That villainous rascal
Pythagoras&mdash;some of you must have known the pot-bellied
loon&mdash;would always seize all there was to get. He and
Socrates. Two scurvy runagates who should hang 'stead o' me. Give
me a mug of wine, for mercy's sake!"</p>

<p>The men had none to give, and the matter was referred to
Jan.</p>

<p>"Not another drop!" Jan declared with unanswerable finality.
"The knave is quite drunk enough as it is."</p>

<p>"Ah!" the blind man protested with ludicrous vehemence. "But
there thou'rt wrong, worthy Jan. No man is ever&mdash;is ever drunk
enough. He may be top-heavy, he may be as drunk as a lord, or as
fuddled as David's sow. He may be fuzzy, fou, or merely sottish;
but sufficiently drunk? No!"</p>

<p>A shout of laughter from the men greeted this solemn
pronouncement. Jan shrugged his shoulders impatiently.</p>

<p>"Well, that is as may be!" he rejoined gruffly. "But not another
drop to drink wilt thou get from me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jan," the poor man protested, with a pitiable note of
appeal, "my good Jan, think on it! I am about to hang! Wouldst
refuse the last request of a dying man?"</p>

<p>"Thou'rt about to hang," Jan assented, unmoved. "Therefore,
'twere a pity to waste good liquor on thee."</p>

<p>"I'll pay the well, my good Jan," Diogenes put in, with a
knowing wink of his sightless eyes.</p>

<p>"Pay me?" Jan retorted, with a grim laugh. "'Tis not much
there's left in thy pockets, I'm thinking."</p>

<p>"No," the blind man agreed, nodding gravely. "These good men
here did, in truth&mdash;empty my pockets effectually awhile ago.
'Twas not with coin I meant to repay thee, good Jan&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With what, then?"</p>

<p>"Information, Jan!" the blind man replied, sinking his voice to
a hoarse whisper. "Information for the like of which his Lordship
of Stoutenburg would give his ears."</p>

<p>Jan laughed derisively. The men laughed openly. They thought
this but another excellent joke on the part of the droll
fellow.</p>

<p>"Bah!" Jan said, with a shrug of the shoulder. "How should a
varlet like thee know aught of which his lordship hath not full
cognisance already?"</p>

<p>"His lordship," the other riposted quickly, even whilst a look
of impish cunning overspread his face&mdash;"his lordship never was
in the confidence of the Stadtholder. I was!"</p>

<p>"What hath the Stadtholder to do with the matter?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing, nothing!" the blind man replied airily. "Thou art
obstinate, my good Jan, and 'tis not I who would force thee to
share a secret for the possession of which, let me assure thee, his
lordship would repay me not only with a tankard of his best wine,
but with my life! Ay, and with a yearly pension of one thousand
guilders to boot."</p>

<p>These last few words he had spoken quite slowly and with grave
deliberation, his head nodding sagely while he spoke. The look of
cunning in those spectral orbs had lent to his pale, wan face an
air of elfin ghoulishness. He was swaying on his feet, and now and
again the men had to hold him up, for he was on the very point of
measuring his length on the hall floor.</p>

<p>Jan did not know what to make of it all. Obviously the man was
drunk. But not so drunk that he did not know what he was talking
about. And the air of cunning suggested that there was something
alive in the fuddled brain. Jan looked across the hall in the
direction of the banqueting-room.</p>

<p>The doors were wide open, and he could see that his lordship,
who at first had paced up and down the long room like a caged
beast, had paused quite close to the door, then advanced on tip-toe
out into the hall, where he had remained for the last minute or
two, intent and still, with eager, probing glance fixed upon the
blind man. Now, when Jan questioned him with a look, he gave his
faithful henchman a scarce perceptible sign, which the latter was
quick enough to interpret correctly.</p>

<p>"Thou dost set my mouth to water," he said to the blind man,
with well-assumed carelessness, "By all this talk of yearly
pensions and of guilders. I am a poor man, and not so young as I
was. A thousand guilders a year would keep me in comfort for the
rest of my life."</p>

<p>"Yet art so obstinate," Diogenes riposted with a quaint, inane
laugh, "as to deny me a tankard of Spanish wine, which might put
thee in possession of my secret&mdash;a secret, good Jan, worth
yearly pensions and more to his lordship."</p>

<p>"How do I know thou'rt not a consummate liar?" Jan protested
gruffly.</p>

<p>"I am!" the other riposted, wholly unruffled. "I am! Lying hath
been my chief trade ever since I was breeched. Had I not lied to
the Stadtholder he would not have entrusted his secrets to me, and
I could not have bartered those secrets for a tankard of good
Spanish wine."</p>

<p>"Thy vaunted secrets may not be worth a tankard of wine."</p>

<p>"They are, friend Jan, they are! Try them and see."</p>

<p>"Well, let's hear them and, if they are worth it, I'll pay thee
with a tankard of his lordship's best Oporto."</p>

<p>But the blind man shook his head with owlish solemnity.</p>

<p>"And then sell them to his lordship," he retorted, "for pensions
and what not, whilst thine own hand, mayhap, puts the rope around
my neck. No, no, my good Jan, say no more about it. I'd as lief see
his lordship and thee falling into the Stadtholder's carefully laid
trap, and getting murdered in your beds, even while I am on my
journey to kingdom come."</p>

<p>"Who is going to murder us?" Jan queried, frowning and puzzled,
trying to get his cue once more from his master. "And how?"</p>

<p>"I'll not tell thee," the blind man replied, with a quick turn
to that obstinacy which so oft pertains to the drunkard, "not if
thou wert to plunge me in a bath of best Oporto."</p>

<p>Some of the men began to murmur.</p>

<p>"We might all share?" one or two of them suggested.</p>

<p>"Let's hear what it is," others declared.</p>

<p>"I'll tell thee, knave, what I'll do," Jan rejoined decisively.
"I'll bring thee a tankard of Oporto to loosen thy tongue. Then, if
thy secret is indeed as important as thou dost pretend, I'll see
that the hangman is cheated of thy carcass."</p>

<p>For awhile the blind man pondered.</p>

<p>"Loosen my hands then, friend Jan," he said, "for, in truth, I
am trussed like a fowl; then let's feel the handle of that tankard.
After that we'll talk."</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>The soldiers sat around the table, watching the blind man with
grave attention. At a sign from Jan they soon loosened his bonds.
There was something magnetic in the air just then, something that
sent sensitive nerves aquiver, and of which these rough fellow were
only vaguely conscious. They could not look on that drunken loon
without laughing. He was more comical than ever now, with that air
of bland beatitude upon his face as his slender fingers closed
around the handle of the tankard which Jan had just placed in his
hand.</p>

<p>"I would sell my soul for a butt of this nectar," he said; and
drank in the odour of the wine with every sign of delight, even
before he raised the tankard to his lips.</p>

<p>The Lord of Stoutenburg watched the blind man, too. A deep
furrow between his brows testified to the earnest concentration of
his thoughts. The man knew something, or thought he knew, of that
his lordship could not be in doubt. The question was, was that
knowledge of such importance as the miserable wretch averred, or
was he merely, like any rogue who sees the rope dangling before his
eyes, trying to gain a respite, by proposing vain bargains or
selling secrets that had only found birth in his own fuddled brain.
Stoutenburg, remember, was no psychologist. Indeed, psychology did
not exist as a science in these days when men were over-busy with
fighting, and had no time or desire to probe into the inner
workings of one another's soul.</p>

<p>On the other hand, here was a man, thus his lordship argued to
himself, who might know something of the Stadtholder's plans. He
was wont, before he rolled so rapidly down the hill of manhood and
repute, to be an inimate of Maurice of Nassau. He might, as lately
as yesterday, have been initiated into the great soldier's plans
for repelling this sudden invasion of the land which he had thought
secure. The Stadtholder, in truth, was not the man to abandon all
efforts at resistance just because his original plans had
failed.</p>

<p>True, the attempt to rescue Arnheim and Nijmegen had ended in
smoke. Marquet and De Keysere were, thanks to timely warning, being
held up somewhere by the armies of Isembourg and De Berg. But
Maurice of Nassau would not of a certainty, thus lightly abandon
all hopes of saving Gelderland. He must have formulated a project,
and Stoutenburg, who was no fool, was far from underestimating the
infinite brain power and resourcefulness of that peerless
commander. Whether he had communicated that project to this
besotted oaf was another matter.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg searched the blind man's face with an intent glance
that seemed to probe the innermost thoughts behind that fine, wide
brow. For the moment, the face told him nothing. It was just
vacant, the sightless eyes shone with delight, and the tankard
raised to the lips effectually hid all expression around the
mouth.</p>

<p>Well, there was not much harm done, the waste of a few moments,
if the information proved futile. Jan was ready with the rope, if
the whole thing proved to be a mere trick for putting off the
fateful hour. As the Lord of Stoutenburg gazed on the blind man,
trying vainly to curb his burning impatience, he instinctively
thought of Gilda. Gilda, and his hopeless wooing of her, her
coldness toward him and her passionate adherence to this miserable
caitiff, who, in truth, had thrown dust in her eyes by an outward
show of physical courage and a mock display of spurious
chivalry.</p>

<p>What if the varlet had been initiated in the Stadtholder's
projects? What if he betrayed them now&mdash;sold them in exchange
for his own worthless life, and stood revealed, before all the
world, as an abject coward, as base as any Judas who would sell his
master for thirty pieces of silver? The thought turned the
miscreant giddy, so dazzling did this issue appear before his
mental vision. What a revelation for a fond and loyal woman, who
had placed so worthless an object on a pinnacle of valour! What a
disillusionment! She had staunchly believed in his integrity up to
now. But after this?</p>

<p>In truth, what more can a man desire than to see the honour of a
rival smirched in the eyes of a woman who spurns him? That was the
main thought that coursed through Stoutenburg's brain, driving
before it all obstinacy and choler, ay, even soothing his
exacerbated nerves.</p>

<p>He gave a sign to Jan.</p>

<p>"Bring that varlet here to me," he commanded. "I'll speak to him
myself."</p>

<p>The sound of his voice chased the look of beatitude from the
blind man's face, which took on an expression of bewildered
surprise.</p>

<p>"I had no thought his lordship was here," he said, with a
self-conscious, inane laugh.</p>

<p>The men were murmuring audibly. Some of them had seen visions of
good reward, shared amongst them all, after the blind man had been
made to speak. But Jan paid no heed to their discontent. In a trice
he had seen the blind man secure once more, with arms tied as
before behind his back. Diogenes had uttered a loud cry of protest
when the empty tankard was torn out of his hand.</p>

<p>"Jan," he shouted, in a thick, hoarse voice, "if thou'rt a knave
and dost not keep faith with me, the devil himself will run away
with thee."</p>

<p>"His Magnificence will hear what thou hast to say," Jan retorted
gruffly. "After that, we'll see."</p>

<p>He led the prisoner through into the banqueting-hall, and
despite the men's murmurings, he closed the door upon them. He sat
the blind man down in a chair, opposite his lordship. The poor loon
had begun to whimper softly, just like a child, and continued to
appeal pitiably to Jan.</p>

<p>"If his lordship is satisfied," he murmured confidingly, "you'll
see to it, Jan, that I do not hang."</p>

<p>"Jan has his orders!" his lordship put in roughly. "But take
heed, sirrah! If your information is worth having, you may go to
hell your own way; I care nought! But remember," he added, with
slow and stern emphasis, "if you trick me in this, 'twil not be the
rope for you at dawn&mdash;but the stake!"</p>

<p>Diogenes gave a quick shudder.</p>

<p>"By the lord," he said blandly, "how very unpleasant! But I am a
man of my word. Jan put good wine into me. He shall be paid for it.
And I'll tell you what the Stadtholder hath planned for the defeat
of the Lord of Stoutenburg."</p>

<p>"Well," his lordship retorted curtly. "I wait!"</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment whilst the blind man apparently
collected his thoughts. He sat, trussed and helpless in the chair,
with his head thrown back, and the full light of the candles
playing upon his pale face&mdash;the latter still vacant and with a
childish expression of excitement about those weird, dark orbs. The
Lord of Stoutenburg, master of the situation, sat in a high-backed
chair opposite him, his chin resting in his hand, his eyes,
glowering and fierce, searching that strange, mysterious face
before him. Strange and mysterious, in truth, with those sightless
eyes, that glittered uncannily whenever the flickering candle-light
caught the abnormally dilated pupils, and those quavering lips
which every moment broke into a whimsical and inane smile.</p>

<p>"Jan, my friend," the blind man asked after a while, "art
here?"</p>

<p>"Ay!" Jan replied gruffly. "I'm here right enough to see that
thou'rt up to no mischief."</p>

<p>"How can I be that, worthy Jan?" the other retorted blandly,
"since thou hast again trussed me like a capon?"</p>

<p>"Well, the sooner thou hast satisfied his lordship," Jan
rejoined with stolid indifference, "the sooner thou wilt be
free&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To go to hell mine own way!" Diogenes put in with a hiccough.
"So his lordship hath pledged his word. Let all those who are my
friends bear witness that his lordship did pledge his word."</p>

<p>He paused, and once again a look of impish cunning over-spread
his face. He seemed to be preparing for a fateful moment which
literally would mean life or death for him. An exclamation of angry
impatience from Stoutenburg recalled him to himself.</p>

<p>"I am ready," he protested with eager servility, "to do his
lordship's pleasure."</p>

<p>"Then speak, man!" Stoutenburg retorted savagely, "ere I wring
the words from thee with torture!"</p>

<p>"I was only thinking how to put the matter clearly," Diogenes
protested blandly. "The Stadtholder only outlined his plan to me.
There was so little time. My friend Klaas will remember that after
his Highness's horse bolted across the moor I was able to stop
it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;curse your interference!" Stoutenburg muttered
between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Amen to that!" the blind man assented. "But for it, I should
still have the privilege of beholding your lordship's pleasing
countenance. But at the moment I had no thought save to stop a
runaway horse. The Stadtholder was mightily excited, scented that a
trap had been laid for him. My friend Klaas again will remember
that, after his Highness dismounted he stopped to parley with me
upon the moor."</p>

<p>Nicolaes nodded.</p>

<p>"Then it was," Diogenes went on, "that he told what he meant to
do. I was, of course, to bear my part in the new project, which was
to make a feint upon Ede&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A feint upon Ede?"</p>

<p>"Ay! A surprise attack, which would keep De Berg, who is in Ede,
busy whilst the Stadtholder&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bah!" Stoutenburg broke in contemptuously, "De Berg is too wary
to be caught by a feint."</p>

<p>"So he is, my lord, so he is!" Diogenes rejoined with solemn
gravity. "But if I were to tell you that the surprise attack is to
be made in full force, and that the weight will fall on the south
side of the town, what then?"</p>

<p>"I do not see with what object."</p>

<p>"Yet you, my lord, would know the Stadtholder's tactics of old.
You fought under his banner&mdash;once."</p>

<p>"Before he murdered my father, yes!" Stoutenburg broke in
impatiently. He did not relish this allusion to his former fighting
days, before black treachery had made him betray the ruler he once
served. "But what of that?"</p>

<p>"For then your lordship would remember," the blind man went on
placidly, "that the Stadtholder's favorite plan was always to draw
the enemy away by a ruse from his own chief point of attack."</p>

<p>"But where would the chief point of attack be in this case?"
Stoutenburg queried with a frown.</p>

<p>"At a certain <i>molen</i> your lordship wot of on the
Veluwe."</p>

<p>"Impossible!"</p>

<p>"Oh, impossible? Your lordship is pleased to jest. Some days
ago, spies came into Utrecht with the information that the Lord of
Stoutenburg had his camp at an old <i>molen</i>, which stands
disused and isolated on the highest point of the Veluwe, somewhere
between Apeldoorn and Barneveld."</p>

<p>"My camp? Bah! The mill was only a halting place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The spies averred, my lord," the blind man broke in blandly,
"that vast stores of arms and ammunition are accumulated in that
halting-place. And that the attack on Amersfoort was planned within
its rickety walls."</p>

<p>Then, as the Lord of Stoutenburg made no comment on
this&mdash;indeed, he had cast a rapid, significant glance on
Nicolaes, who throughout this colloquy had appeared as keen, as
interested, as his friend&mdash;the blind man went on slowly:</p>

<p>"The Stadtholder's objective is the <i>molen</i> on the
Veluwe."</p>

<p>"What? From Ede!" Nicolaes exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No, no! Have I not said that the attack on Ede would be a
feint? It will be the Stadtholder himself who, with a comparatively
small force, will push on toward Barneveld and the <i>molen</i>,
and at once cut off all communication between Ede and
Amersfoort."</p>

<p>"I understand," Stoutenburg rejoined, with a grave nod. "But if
it is a small force we can easily&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can now," Diogenes assented coolly, "since you are
warned."</p>

<p>"Quite right! Eh, friend Nicolaes?" his lordship retorted, and
strove to let his harsh voice express a world of withering
contempt. "If all this is not a trick you varlet hath served us
well. What say you? Shall we let him go to hell his own way, and
save the hangman a deal of pother?"</p>

<p>"If it all prove true," Nicolaes put in cautiously. "But what
proof have we?"</p>

<p>"None, in truth. Nor would I let this craven vagabond out of
Jan's sight until we do make sure that he hath not lied. But
there'll be no harm in being prepared. Here, sirrah!" his lordship
continued, once more addressing the blind man. "With how strong a
force doth the Stadtholder propose to cut us off from Ede?"</p>

<p>But, during this brief colloquy between the two friends, the
blind man had begun to nod. His head fell forward on his chest, the
heavy lids veiled the stricken eyes, and anon a peaceable snore
came through the partially open mouth. Stoutenburg swore, as was
his wont, the moment his choler was roused, and Jan shook the
prisoner roughly by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Eh? Eh? What?" the latter queried, blinked his sightless eyes,
and turned a pale and startled face vaguely from side to side.
"What is it? Where's that confounded&mdash;?</p>

<p>"Answer his lordship's question!" Jan commanded briefly.</p>

<p>"Question? What question? Your lordship must forgive me. I am so
fatigued, and that tankard of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I asked thee, knave," Stoutenburg broke in impatiently, "with
how strong a force the Stadtholder proposed to cut us off from
Ede?"</p>

<p>"Call it four thousand, my lord," the blind man babbled, "and
let me go to sleep."</p>

<p>"You shall sleep till Judgement Day when I've done with you,
sirrah! Will the Stadtholder lead that force in person?"</p>

<p>The blind man winked and blinked, tried to collect his thoughts,
which apparently had all wandered off toward the Land of Nod. Then
he said:</p>

<p>"The plan was to leave the bulk of that force to menace
Amersfoort. But the Stadtholder himself meant to push on as far as
the <i>molen</i>, with but a few hundred of his picked men. He
thought to seize the stores of arms and ammunition there and then
to await the coming of the Lord of Stoutenburg, who, driven out of
Amersfoort and cut off from Ede, would make of necessity for his
headquarters."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>The exclamation, deep and prolonged, came from three pairs of
lips. Stoutenburg, Nicolaes and Jan looked at one another, and
there was triumph and satisfaction depicted in their glance. The
same thought had occurred simultaneously to these three traitors;
the Stadtholder, with a comparatively small force, pushing on to
the lonely <i>molen</i> on the Veluwe, not knowing that some of De
Berg's troops were holding the Ijssel beyond.</p>

<p>He would be caught like a rat in a trap; and the question was
whether it would not be better to allow him to carry out his plan,
not to oppose him on his way, to let him reach the <i>molen</i> and
then close in behind him, so that he would have but two
alternatives before him&mdash;to surrender in the <i>molen</i> or
to turn his small force in the direction of the Zuider Zee, and
therein seek a watery grave.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>"I must have a little time to think," Stoutenburg muttered to
himself, after a while.</p>

<p>The blind man had apparently dropped off to sleep again. His
head had once more fallen forward on his chest. Jan was prepared to
give him another rude awakening, but his lordship stopped him with
a sign.</p>

<p>"Let the muckworm sleep," he said. "I must think out the whole
position. If what the knave says is true-</p>

<p>"I am inclined to believe it true," Nicolaes interposed. "The
man is too fuddled to have invented so circumstantial a story. And
I have it in my mind," he added reflectively, "that when the
Stadtholder visited Amersfoort yesterday he said something to my
father about devising a plan later on if the city were seriously
threatened."</p>

<p>"Then, by Satan! all would be well indeed!" And Stoutenburg drew
up his gaunt figure to its full height, looked every inch a
conqueror, with heel set upon the neck of his foes. Jan alone
looked dubious.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't trust the rogue," he said grimly.</p>

<p>"Would you hang him now?" Stoutenburg retorted.</p>

<p>"No; I would wait to make sure. Let him sleep awhile now. When
he wakes out of his booze, he might be able to give us further
details."</p>

<p>"In the meanwhile," his lordship rejoined, "keep the men under
arms, Jan. I have not yet thought the matter over; but this I
know&mdash;that I'll start for the <i>molen</i> with a few hundred
musketeers and pikemen as soon as I am sure that this rascallion
hath not spun a tissue of lies. Do you send out spies at once in
every direction, with orders to bring back information immediately.
We must hear if an attack hath indeed been made on Ede, and if the
Stadtholder is moving out of Utrecht. Have you some men you can
trust?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, so please your lordship," Jan replied. "I can send
Piet Walleren in the direction of Ede, and I myself will push on
toward Utrecht. We'd both be back long before dawn."</p>

<p>"And 'tis not you who could be nousled, eh, good Jan?" his
lordship was pleased to say.</p>

<p>"If we have been tricked by this tosspot," Jan riposted gruffly,
"I'll see him burnt alive, and 'tis mine own hand will set the
brand to the stake."</p>

<p>He paused, and drew in his breath with a shudder; for he had
turned to look on the blind man whom he was threatening with so
dire a fate and whom he had thought asleep, and encountered those
sightless orbs fixed upon him as if they could see something
through and beyond him, some ghoul or spectre lurking in a distant
corner of the room. So uncanny and terrifying did the rascal look,
indeed, that instinctively Jan, who believed neither in God nor the
devil, remembered his mother's early teachings, and made sundry and
vague signs of the Cross upon his breast, with a view to exorcising
those evil spirits which must be somewhere lurking about, unseen by
all save by the man who had lost his sight.</p>

<p>"What is it now?" Stoutenburg queried with a scowl.</p>

<p>The blind man indeed appeared to be listening&mdash;listening so
intently, with head now craned forward and eyes fixed into
vacancy&mdash;that instinctively the three recreants listened too.
To what, they could not have told. Through the open casement the
sound of life&mdash;camp life, of sentries' challenging call, of
bivouac fires, and rowdy soldiery&mdash;came in as before. A little
less roisterous, perhaps, seeing that most of the men, tired after
long days of marching and hours of carousing, had settled
themselves down to sleep.</p>

<p>Inside the room, the monumental clock up against the wall ticked
off each succeeding second with tranquil monotony. It was now close
upon midnight. Nothing had happened. Nothing could have happened,
to disturb the wonted tenor of the life of an army in temporary
occupation of an unresisting city. Nothing, in fact, unless that
blind tatter-demalion over there had indeed spoken the truth.</p>

<p>And still he listened. A vague anxiety seemed to have completely
banished sleep, even momentarily to have dissipated the potent
effect of that excellent Oporto; and on his face there was that
strained look peculiar to those who have been robbed of one sense
and are at pains to exert the others to their utmost power. It
seemed as if his sightless orbs must pierce some hidden veil which
kept vital secrets hidden from ordinary human gaze. And these three
men&mdash;traitors all&mdash;whose craven hearts, weighted with
crime, were sensitive to every uncanny spell, felt their own senses
unaccountably thrilled by that motionless, stony image of a man
whose very soul appeared on the alert, and in whom life itself, was
as it were, momentarily arrested.</p>

<p>The spell continued for a moment or two. A minute, perhaps, went
by; then, with an impatient curse, Stoutenburg jumped to his feet,
strode rapidly to the window, and, leaning out far over the sill,
he listened.</p>

<p>Indeed, at first it was naught but the habitual confused sounds
that reach his ear. But as he, in his turn, strained every sense to
hear, something unusual seemed to mingle with the other sounds. A
murmuring. Strange voices. A few isolated words that rose above the
others, louder than the sentries' call; also a patter of feet, like
men running and a clang of arms that at this hour should have been
stilled.</p>

<p>The Lord of Stoutenburg could not have told you then why those
sounds should have suddenly filled his mind with
foreboding&mdash;why, indeed, he heard them at all. Beneath the
window, ranged against the wall, the men of his picked company were
sleeping peacefully. Their bivouac fire fed by those on guard, shed
a pleasant glow over the familiar scene. Beyond its ruddy gleam
everything looked by contrast impenetrably dark. The river beyond
it, nothing; only blackness&mdash;a blackness that could be felt.
The lights of the city had long since been extinguished, only one
tiny glimmer, which came from a small oil-lamp, showed above the
Koppel-poort.</p>

<p>But that confused sound, that murmuring, came from the rear of
the burgomaster's house, from the direction of the Market Place,
where the bulk of his lordship's army was encamped.</p>

<p>"What in thunder does it mean?" Stoutenburg muttered.</p>

<p>Nicolaes came and joined him by the window. He, too, strained
his ears to hear, feeling his nerves vaguely stirred by a kind of
superstitious dread. But Stoutenburg turned to the blind man, and
tried to read an answer in the latter's white, set face.</p>

<p>Jan shook Diogenes fiercely by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Dost hear, knave?" he said harshly. "What does it all
mean?"</p>

<p>"What does what mean, worthy Jan?" the blind man queried
blandly.</p>

<p>"Thou are listening for something. What is it? His lordship
desires to know."</p>

<p>"Canst thou hear anything, friend Jan?" the other riposted
serenely.</p>

<p>"Only the usual sounds. What should I hear?"</p>

<p>"The armies of the Stadtholder on the move."</p>

<p>An exclamation of incredulity broke from Stoutenburg's lips.
Nevertheless, he turned imperatively to Jan.</p>

<p>"Go or send at once into the town," he commanded. "Let us hear
if anything has happened."</p>

<p>In a moment Jan was out of the room; and soon his gruff voice
could be heard from outside, questioning and giving orders. He had
gone himself to see what was amiss.</p>

<p>And Stoutenburg, half incredulous, yet labouring under strong
excitement, once more approached the window and, leaning far out
into the night, set his ears to listen.</p>

<p>His senses, too, were keyed up now, detached as they were from
everything else except just what went on outside. The subdued
murmurings reached his perceptions independently of every other
sound. A hum of voices, and through it that of Jan, questioning and
commanding; and others that talked agitatedly, with many
interruptions.</p>

<p>After awhile he felt that he could stand the strain no longer.
Very obviously something had happened, something was being
discussed out on the Market Place, and there was a kind of buzzing
in the air, as if around the hive of bees that have been disturbed
by a company of robber-wasps. And to
him&mdash;Stoutenburg&mdash;for whom that buzzing might mean the
first step toward the pinnacle of his desires, the turning point of
his destiny, beyond which lay power, dominion, ambition satisfied,
and passion satiated, every moment of suspense and silence became
positive torture. A primeval, savage instinct would, but for the
presence of Nicolaes, have driven him to seizing the helpless
prisoner by the throat, and thus to ease the tension on his nerves
and still the wild hammering of blood on his temples.</p>

<p>But Nicolaes did, as it happened, exercise in this instance a
restraining influence on his friend; quite unknowingly, of course,
as his was the weaker nature. But the last half hour had wrought a
marked change in Stoutenburg&mdash;a subtle one, which he himself
could not have defined. Before then, he had been striving for great
things&mdash;for revenge, for power, for the satisfaction of his
passions. But now he felt that he had attained all that, and more.
Obviously his stricken enemy had not lied. The Stadtholder was
about to fall into a trap which was easy enough to set. The once
brilliant Laughing Cavalier had sunk to a state of moral and
physical degradation from which he could never now recover. And
Gilda! Gilda had but to realize the slough of turpitude into which
her former lover had sunk to turn gratefully and with a sigh of
infinite relief to the man who had freed her from such a yoke.</p>

<p>In truth, Stoutenburg felt that he no longer needed to climb. He
had reached the summit. The summit of ambition, of power, of
sentimental satisfaction. He was a conqueror now; master in the
land of his birth; the future Stadtholder of the United Province,
wedded to the richest heiress in the Netherlands; happy, feared,
and obeyed.</p>

<p>That was his position now, and that was the cause of the subtle
change in him&mdash;a change which forced him to keep his savage
instincts in check before his servile friend; forced to try and
appear before others as above petty passions; a justiciary and not
a terrorist.</p>

<p class="cpb">6.</p>

<p>The minutes sped by, leaden-footed for the impatience of these
two men. Nicolaes and Stoutenburg, each trying to appear calm,
hardly dared to speak with one another lest their speech betrayed
the exacerbation of their nerves.</p>

<p>It was Nicolaes' turn now to pace up and down the room, to halt
beside the window and peer out into the darkness in search of Jan's
familiar figure. Stoutenburg had once more taken a seat on the
highbacked chair, striving to look dignified and detached. His arm
was thrown over the table, and with his sharply pointed nails he
was drumming a devil's tatoo on the board.</p>

<p>Alone, the blind man appeared perfectly serene. After that brief
moment of comparative lucidity, he had relapsed into somnolence.
Occasional loud snores testified that he was once more wandering in
the Elysian fields of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Half an hour after midnight Jan returned.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt about it," were the first words he spoke. "An
attack on Ede appears to be in progress, and the Stadtholder left
his camp at Utrecht a couple of hours ago with a force of four
thousand men."</p>

<p>He was out of breath, having run, he said, all the way from the
Joris Poort, where he had gleaned the latest information.</p>

<p>"Who brought the news?" his lordship asked.</p>

<p>"No one seems to know, my lord," Jan replied. "But every one in
the town has it. The rumour hath spread like wildfire. It started
at opposite quarters of the city. The Nieuw Poort had it that a
surprise attack had been delivered on Ede earlier in the evening,
and the Joris Poort that the Stadtholder and his force are on the
move. The captains at the gates had heard the news from runners who
had come direct from Utrecht and from Ede."</p>

<p>"Where are those runners now?"</p>

<p>"In both cases the captains sent them back for further
information. The fellows were willing enough to go, for a
consideration; but the business has become a dangerous one, for the
roads to Utrecht and Ede, they averred are already full of the
Stadtholder's vedettes."</p>

<p>"Bah!" Stoutenburg ejaculated contemptuously. "A device for
extorting money!"</p>

<p>"Probably," Jan riposted dryly. "But the money will be well
spent if we get the information. The men are not to be paid until
they return. And if they do not return&mdash;" Jan shrugged his
shoulders. If the spies did not return, it would go to prove that
the Stadtholder's vedettes were not asleep.</p>

<p>"I sent Piet Wallerin and one or two others out, too," he added,
"with orders to push on both roads as far as possible, and bring
back any information they can obtain&mdash;the sooner the
better.</p>

<p>"They have not yet returned?" Stoutenburg asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! They have only been gone half an hour."</p>

<p>"Is the night very dark?"</p>

<p>"Very dark, my lord."</p>

<p>"Piet may never get back."</p>

<p>"In that case we shall know that the Stadtholder's vanguard has
sighted him," Jan rejoined coolly. "Nothing else would keep Piet
from getting back."</p>

<p>Stoutenburg nodded approval.</p>

<p>"You think, then, that this varlet here spoke the truth?"</p>

<p>"I have no longer any doubt of it, my lord," Jan gave reply.
"Though I did not actually speak with the men who seem originally
to have brought the news, the captains at the Poorts had no doubt
whatever as to its authenticity. But we shall know for certain
before dawn. Piet and the others will have returned by
then&mdash;or not, as the case may be. But we shall know."</p>

<p>"And, of course, we are prepared?"</p>

<p>"To do just what your lordship commands. The men will be under
arms within the next two hours, and I can seek the Master of the
Camp, and send him at once to your lordship for instructions."</p>

<p>"Mine instructions are simple enough, good Jan; and thou canst
convey them to the Master of the Camp thyself. They are, to remain
quiescent, under arms but asleep. To surrender the town if it be
attacked&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To surrender?" Jan protested with a frown.</p>

<p>"We must throw dust in the Stadtholder's eyes," Stoutenburg
riposted. "Give the idea that we are feeble and unprepared, and
that I have fled out of Amersfoort. The surrender of the city and
its occupation will keep the main force busy, whilst Maurice of
Nassau, anxious to possess himself of our person, will push on as
far as the <i>molen</i>, where I, in the meanwhile, will be waiting
for him."</p>

<p>His voice rang with a note of excitement and of triumph.</p>

<p>"With the Stadtholder a prisoner in my hands," he exclaimed, "I
can command the surrender of all his forces. And then the whole of
the Netherlands will be at my feet!"</p>

<p>Never, in his wildest dreams had he hoped for this. Fate, in
very truth, had tired of smiting him, had an overfull cornucopia
for him now and was showering down treasures upon him, one by
one.</p>

<p class="cpb">7.</p>

<p>It was Nicolaes who first remembered the blind man.</p>

<p>During the last momentous half-hour he had been totally
forgotten. Stoutenburg during that time had been in close
confabulation with Jan, discussing plans, making arrangements for
the morrow's momentous expedition. Neither of them seemed to feel
the slightest fatigue. They were men of iron, whom their passions
kept alive. But Nicolaes was a man of straw. He had been racked by
one emotion after the other all day, and now he was so tired that
he could hardly stand. He envied the blind man every time that a
lusty snore escaped the latter's lips, and tried to keep himself
awake by going to the fire from time to time and throwing a log or
two upon it. But he stood in too great an awe of his friend to dare
own to fatigue when the future of his native land was under
discussion.</p>

<p>It was really in order to divert Stoutenburg's attention from
these interminable discussions on what to do and what not to do on
the morrow, that presently, during a pause, he pointed to
Diogenes.</p>

<p>"What is to happen to this drunken loon?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg grinned maliciously.</p>

<p>"Have no fear, friend Nicolaes," he said. "The fate of our
valued informer will be my special care. I have not forgotten him.
Jan knows. While you were nodding, he and I arranged it all. You
did not hear?"</p>

<p>Nicolaes shook his head.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "What did you decide?"</p>

<p>"You shall see, my good Klaas," Stoutenburg replied with grim
satisfaction. "I doubt not but what you'll be pleased. And since we
have now finished the discussion of our plans, Jan will at once go
and bid the Heer Burgomaster rise from his bed and attend upon our
pleasure."</p>

<p>"My father?" Nicolaes exclaimed in surprise. "Why? What hath
he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You will see, my good Klaas," the other broke in quietly. "You
will see. I think that you will be satisfied."</p>

<p>Jan, at his word, had already gone. Nicolaes, really puzzled,
tried to ask questions, but Stoutenburg was obviously determined to
keep the secret of his intentions awhile longer to himself.</p>

<p>It was long past one o'clock now, and bitterly cold. Even the
huge blazing logs in the monumental hearth failed to keep the large
room at a pleasing temperature. Nicolaes, shivering and yawning,
crouched beside the blaze, knocked his half-frozen hands one
against the other. He would at this moment have bartered most of
his ambitions for the immediate prospect of a good bed. But
Stoutenburg was as wide awake as ever, and evidently some kind of
inward fever kept the cold out of his bones.</p>

<p>After Jan's departure he resumed that restless pacing of his up
and down the long room. Up and down, until Nicolaes, exasperated
beyond endurance, could have screamed with choler.</p>

<p>Less than a quarter of an hour later, the burgomaster arrived,
ushered in by Jan. He had apparently not taken off his clothes
since he had been upstairs. It was indeed more that likely that he
had spent the time in prayer, for Mynheer Beresteyn was a pious
man, and the will of God in fortune or adversity was a very real
thing to him. With the same dignified submission which he had
displayed throughout, he had immediately followed Jan when curtly
ordered to do so. But he came down to face the arrogant tyrant for
the third time to-night with as heavy a heart as before, not
knowing what fresh indignity, what new cruel measure, would be put
upon him. Grace or clemency he knew that he could not expect.</p>

<p>The look of malignant triumph wherewith Stoutenburg greeted him
appeared to justify his worst forebodings. The presence, too, of
Diogenes, fettered and asleep, filled his anxious heart with
additional dread. As he stepped out into the room he took no notice
of his son, but only strove to face his arch-enemy with as serene a
countenance as he could command.</p>

<p>"Your lordship desired that I should come," he said quietly.
"What is your lordship's pleasure?"</p>

<p>But Stoutenburg was all suavity. A kind of feline gentleness was
in his tone as he replied:</p>

<p>"Firstly, to beg your forgiveness, mynheer, for having disturbed
you again&mdash;and at this hour. But will you not sit? Jan," he
commanded, "draw a chair nearer to the hearth for the Heer
Burgomaster."</p>

<p>"I was not asleep, my lord," Beresteyn rejoined coldly. "And by
your leave, will take your commands standing."</p>

<p>"Oh, commands, mynheer!" Stoutenburg rejoined blandly. "'Tis no
commands I would venture to give you. It was my duty&mdash;my
painful duty&mdash;not to keep you in ignorance of certain matters
which have just come to my knowledge, and which will have a
momentous bearing upon all my future plans. Will you not sit?" he
added, with insidious urbanity. "No? Ah, well, just as you wish.
But you will forgive me if I&mdash;"</p>

<p>He sat down in his favourite chair, with his back to the table
and the candle-light and facing the fire, which threw ruddy gleams
on his gaunt face and grizzled hair. His deepset eyes were
inscrutable in the shadow, but they were fixed upon the burgomaster
who stood before him dignified and calm, half-turned away from the
pitiful spectacle which the blind man presented in somnolent
helplessness.</p>

<p>"Since last I had the pleasure of addressing you, mynheer,"
Stoutenburg began slowly, after awhile, "it hath come to my
knowledge that the Stadtholder, far from abandoning all hope of
reconquering Gelderland from our advancing forces, did in truth not
only devise a plan whereby he intended to deliver Ede and
Amersfoort from our hands, but his far-reaching project also
embraced the possibility of seizing my person, and once for all
ridding himself of an enemy&mdash;a justiciary, shall we
say?&mdash;who is becoming might inconvenient."</p>

<p>"A project, my lord," the burgomaster riposted earnestly, "which
I pray God may fully succeed."</p>

<p>Stoutenburg gave a derisive laugh.</p>

<p>"So it would have done, mynheer," he said with a sardonic grin.
"It would have succeeded admirably, and by this hour to-morrow I
should no doubt be dangling on a gibbet, for Maurice of Nassau hath
sworn that he would treat me as a knave and as a traitor unworthy
of the scaffold."</p>

<p>"And the world would have been rid of a murderous miscreant,"
the burgomaster put in coldly, "had God so willed it."</p>

<p>"Ah, but God&mdash;your God, mynheer," Stoutenburg retorted with
a sneer, "did not will it, it seems. And forewarned is forearmed,
you know."</p>

<p>Instinctively, as the full meaning of Stoutenburg's words
reached his perceptions the Burgomaster's eyes had sought those of
his son, whilst a ghastly pallor overspread his face even to his
lips.</p>

<p>"The Stadtholder's schemes have been revealed to you," he
murmured slowly. "By whom?"</p>

<p>Then, as Stoutenburg made no reply, only regarded him with a
mocking and quizzical gaze, he added more vehemently:</p>

<p>"Who is the craven informer who hath sold his master to
you?"</p>

<p>"What would you do to him if you knew?" Stoutenburg retorted
coolly.</p>

<p>"Slay him with mine own hand," the burgomaster replied calmly,
"were he my only son!"</p>

<p>"'Twas not I!" Nicolaes cried involuntarily.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg appeared vastly amused.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "It was not your son Klaas, whose merits, by the
way, you have not yet learned to appreciate. Nicolaes hath rendered
me and the Archduchess immense services, which I hope soon to repay
adequately. But," he added with mocking emphasis, "the most signal
service of all, which will deliver the Stadtholder into my hands
and re-establish thereby the dominion of Spain over the
Netherlands, was rendered to me by the varlet whom, but for me, you
would have acclaimed as your son."</p>

<p>And with a wide flourish of the arm, Stoutenburg turned in his
chair and pointed to Diogenes, who, sublimely unconscious of what
went on around him, was even in the act of emitting a loud and
prolonged snore. Instinctively the burgomaster looked at him, his
glance, vague and puzzled, wandered over the powerful figure of the
blind man, the nodding head, the pinioned shoulders, and from him
back to Stoutenburg, who continued to regard
him&mdash;Beresteyn&mdash;with a malicious leer.</p>

<p>"I fear me," the latter murmured after awhile, "That your
lordship will think me over-dull; but&mdash;I don't quite
understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yet, 'tis simple enough," Stoutenburg rejoined; rose from his
chair, and approached the burgomaster, as he spoke with a sudden
fierce tone of triumph. "This miserable cur on whom Gilda once
bestowed her love, seeing the gallows dangling before his bleary
eyes, hath sold me the secrets which the Stadtholder did entrust
him&mdash;sold the to me in exchange for his worthless life! I
entered into a bargain with him, and I will keep my pledge. In very
truth, he hath saved my life by his revelations, and jeopardized
that of the Stadtholder&mdash;my most bitter enemy. Maurice of
Nassau had thought to trap me in the lonely <i>molen</i> on the
Veluwe which is my secret camp. Now 'tis I who will close the trap
on him there, and hold his life, his honour, these provinces, at my
mercy. And all," he concluded with a ringing shout, "thanks to the
brilliant adventurer, the chosen of Gilda's heart, her English
milor, mynheer!&mdash;the gay and dashing Laughing Cavalier!"</p>

<p>He had the satisfaction of seeing that the blow had gone home.
The burgomaster literally staggered under it, as if he had actually
been struck in the face with a whip. Certain it is that he stepped
back and clutched the table for support with one hand, whilst he
passed the other once or twice across his brow.</p>

<p>"My God!" he murmured under his breath.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg laughed as a demon might, when gazing on a tortured
soul. Then he shrugged his shoulders and went on airily:</p>

<p>"You are surprised, mynheer Burgomaster? Frankly, I was not. You
believed this fortune-hunter's tales of noble parentage and English
ancestry. I did not. You doubted his treachery when he went on a
message to Marquet, and sold that message to de Berg. I knew it to
be a fact. My love for Gilda made me clear-sighted, whilst yours
left you blind. Now you see him at last in his true
colours&mdash;base, servile, without honour and without faith. You
are bewildered, incredulous, mayhap? Ask Jan. He was here and heard
him. Ask my captains at the gate, my master of the camp. The
Stadtholder is heading straight for the trap which he had set up
for me, because the cullion who sits there did sell his one-time
master to me."</p>

<p>The burgomaster, overcome with horror and with shame, had sunk
into a chair and buried his face in his hands. The echo of
Stoutenburg's rasping voice seemed to linger in the noble panelled
hall, its mocking accents to be still tearing at the stricken
father's aching heart, still deriding his overwhelming sorrow.
Gilda! His proud, loving, loyal Gilda! If she were to know! A great
sob, manfully repressed, broke from his throat and threatened to
choke him.</p>

<p>And for the first time in this day of crime and of treachery,
Nicolaes felt a twinge of remorse knocking at the gates of his
heart. He could not bear to look on his father's grief, and not
feel the vague stirrings of an affection which had once been
genuine, even though it was dormant now. His father had been
perhaps more just toward him than indulgent. Gilda had been the
apple of his eyes, and he&mdash;Nicolaes&mdash;had been brought up
in that stern school of self-sacrifice and self-repression which
had made heroes of those of his race in their stubborn and glorious
fight for liberty.</p>

<p>No doubt it was that rigid bringing-up which had primarily
driven an ambitious and discontented youth like Nicolaes into the
insidious net spread out for him by the wily Stoutenburg. Smarting
under the discipline imposed upon his self-indulgence by the
burgomaster, he had lent a willing ear to the treacherous promises
of his masterful friend, who held out dazzling visions before him
of independence and of aggrandisement. Even at this moment Nicolaes
felt no remorse for his treachery to his country and kindred. He
was only sentimentally sorry to see his father so utterly broken
down by sorrow.</p>

<p>And then there was Gilda. Already, when Stoutenburg had placed
that cruel "either&mdash;or" before her, Nicolaes had felt an
uncomfortable pain in his heart at the sight of her misery.
Stoutenburg would have called it weakness, and despised him for it.
But Stoutenburg's was an entirely warped and evil nature, which
revelled in crime and cruelty as a solace to past humiliation and
disappointment, whereas Nicolaes was just a craven time-server, who
had not altogether succeeded in freeing himself from past teachings
and past sentiments.</p>

<p>And Gilda's pale, tear-stained face seemed to stare at him
through the gloom, reproachful and threatening, whilst his father's
heartrending sob tore at his vitals and shook him to the soul with
a kind of superstitious awe. The commandment of Heaven, not wholly
forgotten, not absolutely ignored, seemed to ring the death-knell
of all that he had striven for, as if the Great Judge of All had
already weighed his deeds in the balance, and decreed that his
punishment be swift and sure.</p>

<p>But Stoutenburg, in this the hour of his greatest triumph, had
none of these weaknesses. Nor indeed did he care whether the
burgomaster was stricken with sorrow or no. What he did do now was
to go up to Jan, and from the latter's belt take out a pistol. This
he examined carefully, then he put it down upon the table close to
where the burgomaster was sitting.</p>

<p class="cpb">8.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later the stately house on the quay
appeared wrapped in the mantle of sleep. The soldiers, wearied and
discontented, had after a good deal of murmuring, finally settled
down to rest. They had collected what clothes, blankets, curtains
even that they could lay their hands on, and wrapped up in these,
they had curled themselves up upon the floor.</p>

<p>We may take it, however, as a certainty that Jan remained wide
awake, with one ear on that door which gave on the banqueting hall,
and which he, at the command of his master, had carefully closed
behind him.</p>

<p>Upstairs, Nicolaes had thrown himself like an insentient and
wearied mass upon his own bed in the room wherein he had slept as a
child, as an adolescent, as a youth, now as a black-hearted
traitor, haunted by memories and the ghoulish shadows, of his
crime. He could not endure the darkness, so left a couple of wax
candles burning in their sconces. Whether he actually fell asleep
or no, he could not afterward have told you. Certain it is that he
was not fully awake, but rather on that threshold of dreams which
for those that are happy is akin to the very gate of paradise, but
unto souls that are laden with crime is like the antechamber of
hell. Half consciously Nicolaes could hear Stoutenburg pacing up
and down an adjoining room, restless and fretful, like some untamed
beast on the prowl.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the sharp report of a pistol rang through the
silence of the night. Nicolaes jumped from his bed, with a feeling
of sheer physical nausea, which turned him dizzy and faint.
Stoutenburg had paused abruptly in his febrile wanderings. To the
listener it almost seemed as if he could hear his friend's laboured
breathing, the indrawing of a sigh that spoke of torturing
suspense.</p>

<p>A few minutes went by, and then a heavy step was heard ascending
the stairs, after that, the closing and shutting of a door. Then
nothing more.</p>

<p>In that heavy step, Nicolaes had recognized his father's. Even
now he could hear the burgomaster moving about in his room close
by, which had always been his. Gilda's was further along, down the
passage. Everything now seemed so still. Just for awhile, after the
burgomaster had gone upstairs, Nicolaes had heard the soldiers
moving down below. Rudely awakened from their sleep, they had done
a good deal of muttering. Voices could be heard, and then a rattle,
like the shaking of a door. But apparently the men had been quickly
reassured by Jan.</p>

<p>The silence acted as a further irritant on Nicolaes' nerves.
Taking up a candle, he went out of the room in search of
Stoutenburg. Outside on the landing he came upon Jan, who was on
the same errand bent.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" the young man queried hoarsely.</p>

<p>Jan shook his head. "Which is His Lordship's room?" was all that
he said.</p>

<p>Nicolaes led the way, and Jan followed. They found Stoutenburg
standing in the middle of the room which he had selected for his
own use. He was still fully dressed, had not even taken off his
boots. Apparently he was waiting for news, but otherwise he seemed
quite calm.</p>

<p>"Well?" he queried curtly, as soon as he caught sight of
Jan.</p>

<p>"We cannot get into the room," Jan replied. "After we heard the
shot fired, we saw the burgomaster come out of it; but he locked
the door and, with the key in his hand he walked steadily up the
stairs."</p>

<p>"How did he look?"</p>

<p>"Like a man who had seen a ghost."</p>

<p>"Well?" Stoutenburg queried again, impatiently. "What did you do
after that?"</p>

<p>"I tried the door, of course. It is a stout piece of oak, and I
had no orders to break it down. It would take a heavy joist, and
the men are already grumbling&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes!" Stoutenburg put in curtly. "But the windows?"</p>

<p>"I thought of them, and myself went round to look. Of course we
could climb up to them, but they appeared to be barred and
shuttered."</p>

<p>"So much the better!" his lordship retorted with a note of grim
spite in his rasping voice. "Let the varlet's carcase rot where it
is. Why should we trouble? Go back to bed, Nicolaes," he added
after a slight pause. "And you too, Jan. As for me, I feel that I
could sleep peacefully at last!"</p>

<p>He threw himself on the bed with a long sigh of satisfaction,
and when spoken to again by one of the others, he curtly ordered
them to leave him in peace. So Jan did leave him, and went back to
his men. But Nicolaes, terrified of solitude, which he felt would
for him be peopled with ghouls, elected to find what rest he could
in an armchair beside his friend. And a few minutes later the house
was once more wrapped in the mantle of sleep.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV&mdash;THE <i>MOLEN</i>
ON THE VELUWE</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Again it is to de Voocht's highly interesting and reliable
"Brieven" that we like to turn for an account of the Lord of
Stoutenburg's departure out of Amersfoort. It occurred at dawn of a
raw, dull March morning, and was effected with all the furtiveness,
the silence, usually pertaining to a surprise attack.</p>

<p>The soldiers bivouacking inside that part of the city knew
nothing of the whole affair. But few of them did as much as turn in
their sleep when his lordship rode through the Koppel-poort,
together with four companies of cavaliers. Jan was an adept at
arranging these expeditions, and the Lord of Stoutenburg had made a
specialty of marauding excursions ever since he had started on his
career of treachery against his own country.</p>

<p>His standard-bearer preceded the companies, carrying the sable
standard embroidered in silver, with the skull and cross-bones,
which his lordship had permanently adopted as his device. But they
went without drums or pipes, and with as little clatter as may be,
choosing the unpaved streets whereon the mud lay thick and
effectually deadened the sound of horses' hoofs.</p>

<p>A litter taken from the burgomaster's coach-house and borne by
two strong Flemish horses, bore the <i>jongejuffrouw</i> Gilda
Beresteyn in the train of her future lord. She had offered no
resistance, no protest of any kind, when finally ordered by her
brother to make herself ready. She had spent the greater part of
the night in meditation and in prayer. Her father, hearing her move
about in her room, had come to her in the small hours of the
morning and had sat with her for some time. Nicolaes, wakeful and
restless, had wandered out into the corridor on which gave most of
the sleeping rooms, and had heard the subdued murmurings of the
burgomaster's voice, and occasionally that of his sister. What they
said he could not hear, but he was able subsequently to assure
Stoutenburg that the burgomaster's tone was distinctly one of
admonition, and Gilda's one of patience and resignation.</p>

<p>Just before dawn, one of the old serving men, who had remained
on watch in the house all through the night, brought her some warm
milk and bread, which she swallowed eagerly. The burgomaster was
with her then. But later on, when the Lord of Stoutenburg desired
her presence in the living room, she went to him alone.</p>

<p>That room was the one where, a little more than a week ago, the
Stadtholder had held council with the burgomaster and his friends,
on the day of her wedding, Her wedding! And she had sat in the
little room next to it and played on the virginal so as to attract
her beloved to her side. Then had come the hour of parting, and she
had with her own hands taken his sword to him and buckled it to his
side, and bade him go wither honour and duty beckoned.</p>

<p>My God, what memories!</p>

<p>But she met Stoutenburg's mocking glance with truly remarkable
serenity. She felt neither faint nor weak. He communion with God,
her interview with her father had given her all the strength she
needed, not to let her enemies see what she suffered or if she were
afraid. And when Stoutenburg with callous irony reminded her of his
decision, she answered quite calmly:</p>

<p>"I am ready to do your wish, my lord."</p>

<p>"And you'll not regret it, Gilda," he vowed with sudden
earnestness; and his sunken eyes lighted up with a kind of fierce
ardour which sent a cold shudder coursing down her spine. "By
Heaven! you'll not regret it! You shall be the greatest lady in
Europe, the most admired, the most beloved. Aye! With you beside
me, I feel that I shall have the power to create a throne, a
kingdom, for us both. Queen of the Netherlands, <i>myn engel</i>!
What say you to this goal? And I your king&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused and closely scrutinized her face, marvelled what she
knew of that drunken oaf, once her lover, who now lay dead in the
room below, slain by the avenging hand of an outraged father and an
indignant patriot. But she looked so serene that he came to the
conclusion that she knew nothing. The burgomaster had apparently
desired to spare her for the moment this additional horror and
shame.</p>

<p>Well no doubt it was all for the best. She was ready to come
with him, and that, after all, was the principal thing. In any
event she knew the alternative.</p>

<p>"Jan remains here," he said, "in command of the troops. He will
not leave until I send him word."</p>

<p>Until then, Amersfoort and the lives of all its citizens were in
jeopardy. The quick, scared look in her eyes, when he reminded her
of this, was sufficient to assure him that she fully grasped the
position. Of the Stadtholder's plans, as betrayed by the informer,
she knew, of course, nothing. Better so, he thought. The whole
thing, when accomplished, when he&mdash;Stoutenburg&mdash;was made
master of Gelderland, the Stadtholder a prisoner in his hands, the
United Provinces ready to submit to him, would be a revelation to
her&mdash;a revelation which would make her, he doubted not, a
proud and happy woman, rather than a mere obedient slave.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, he had strictly enjoined Jan to leave the
banqueting hall undisturbed.</p>

<p>"Let the locked door and close shutters guard the grim secret
within," he said decisively. "Apparently the Heer Burgomaster
intends for the nonce to hold his tongue."</p>

<p>In the hurry and excitement of the departure, the soldiers, who
in the night had been roused by the pistol shot, forgot that
unimportant event. Certain it is that not one of them did more than
cursorily wonder what it had been about. Then, as no one gave
reply, the matter was soon allowed to fall into oblivion. At one
moment, Stoutenburg who was standing in the hall waiting for Gilda,
felt tempted to go and have a last look on his dead enemy; but the
key was not in the lock and he would not send to the burgomaster
for it.</p>

<p>It was better so.</p>

<p>Just then Gilda came down the stairs. She was accompanied by her
old waiting woman, Maria, and was wrapped in fur cloak and hood
ready for the journey. Apparently she had taken final leave of her
father, and had quite resigned herself to parting from him.</p>

<p>"The burgomaster is well, I trust, this morning?" Stoutenburg
asked with great urbanity, as soon as he had formally greeted
her.</p>

<p>"I thank you, my lord," she replied coolly. "My father is as
well as I can desire."</p>

<p>The litter was her own. Oft had she travelled in it between
Haarlem and Amersfoort, when the weather was too rough for riding.
Those had been happy journeys to and fro, for both homes were dear
to her. Both now had become hallowed through the presence in them
of her beloved. To Stoutenburg, who watched her keenly while she
crossed the hall, it seemed as if once she glanced round in the
direction of the banqueting room, and craned her neck as if trying
to catch whatever faint sound might be coming from there. She
appeared to shiver, and drew her fur cloak closer round her
shoulders, her lips moved slightly as if murmuring. Stoutenburg
thought that she was bidding a last farewell to the man who she
could not bring herself to forget or to despise and an acute
feeling of unbridled jealousy shot through him like a poisoned
dart&mdash;jealousy even of the dead.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>A mounted scout led the way, to clear the road of encumbrance
that might retard progress. After him came the standard-bearer.
Twelve Spanish halberdiers followed, the shafts of their halberts
swathed in black velvet, behind them one hundred cavaliers, who
were armed with muskets, and a hundred more carrying lances. Then
came the litter, which was covered in leather with richly stamped
leather curtains, at the sides, the shafts, front and back,
supported by heavy Flemish horses, which were sumptuously
caparisoned and plumed. The Lord of Stoutenburg rode on one side of
the litter and Nicolaes on the other, and behind it came two more
companies of musketeers and lancers.</p>

<p>The way lay through the Koppel-poort and then straight across
the Veluwe, on the road which runs to the north of Amersfoort, thus
avoiding any possible encounter with the Stadtholder's vedettes.
Stoutenburg's intention was to await Maurice of Nassau's coming at
the <i>molen</i>, not to offer him battle in the open.</p>

<p>The road was lonely at this early hour, and a cutting wind blew
across from the Zuider Zee, chasing the morning mist before it.
Already on the horizon above the undulating tableland, the pale
wintry sun tinged that mist with gold. Stoutenburg's keen hawklike
eyes searched the distance before him as he rode.</p>

<p>A little after seven o'clock, Barneveld was reached, and a brief
halt called outside the city whilst the scouts went in, in search
of provisions. The inhabitants, scared by the advent of these
strangers, submitted to being fleeced of their goods, not daring to
resist. Though closely questioned, they had but little information
to impart. They had, in truth, heard that Ede was in the hands of
the Spaniards and that Amersfoort had shared the like fate. Runners
had brought the news, which was authentic, together with many wild
rumours that had terrorized the credulous and paved the way for
Stoutenburg's arrival. His sable standard, with its grim device,
completed the subjugation of the worthy burghers of Barneveld, who,
with no garrison to protect them, thought it wisest to obey the
behests of His Magnificence with a show of goodwill, rather than
see their little city pillaged or their citizens dragged as
captives in the train of the conqueror.</p>

<p>Gilda did not leave her litter during the halt. Maria, who had
been riding on a pillion behind one of the equerries, who she
roundly trounced and anathematized all the way, came and waited on
her mistress. But Stoutenburg and Nicolaes kept with unwonted
discretion, or mayhap indifference, out of her way.</p>

<p>The halt, in truth, lasted less than a couple of hours. By nine
o'clock the troop was once more on the way, and an hour later on
the high upland, out toward the east, the lonely <i>molen</i>
loomed, portentous and weird, out of the mist.</p>

<p class="cpb">4.</p>

<p>The spies of the Stadtholder, who had, according to Diogenes'
statement, spoken of the <i>molen</i> as Stoutenburg's camp, where
he had secreted great stores of arms and ammunition, had in truth
been either deceived or deceivers.</p>

<p>The <i>molen</i> was lonely and uninhabited, as it had always
been. No sign of life appeared around it, or sign of the recent
breaking of a camp. True, here and there upon the scrub in the
open, the scorched rough grass or a heap of ashes, indicated that a
fire had been lit there at one time; whilst under the overhanging
platform, the trampled earth converted into mud, and certain débris
of straw and fodder, accused the recent presence of horses and of
men.</p>

<p>But only a few. As to whether the stores of arms and ammunition
were indeed concealed inside the mill-house itself, it was
impossible to say from the mere aspect of the tumble-down building.
Whatever secret the <i>molen</i> contained, it had succeeded in
guarding inviolate up to this hour.</p>

<p>Standing as it did upon a high point of the arid upland, the
<i>molen</i> dominated the Veluwe. Toward the west, whence the
Stadtholder would come, a gentle, undulating slope led down to
Barneveld and Ede, Amersfoort and Utrecht; but in the rear of the
building toward the east, the ground fell away more abruptly, down
to a narrow gorge below.</p>

<p>It was in this gorge, secluded from the prying eyes of possible
vedettes, that Stoutenburg had put up his camp ere he embarked upon
his fateful expedition to Amersfoort, and it was here that he
disposed the bulk of his troop: horses, men and baggage, under the
command of Nicolaes Beresteyn; whilst he himself, with a bodyguard
of fifty picked men, took up his quarters in the <i>molen</i>.</p>

<p>The plan of action was simple enough. The fifty men would remain
concealed in and about the building, until the Stadtholder thinking
the place deserted, walked straight into the trap that had been
laid for him. Then, at the first musket shot, the men from the camp
below were to rush up the sloping ground with a great clatter and
much shouting and battle cry.</p>

<p>The Stadtholder's troops wholly unprepared for the attack would
be thrown into dire confusion, and in the panic that would
inevitably ensue, the rout would be complete. Stoutenburg himself
would see to it that the Stadtholder did not escape.</p>

<p>"Welcome home, <i>myn engel</i>!" had been his semi-ironical,
wholly triumphant greeting to Gilda when her litter came to a halt
and he dismounted in order to conduct her into the
<i>molen</i>.</p>

<p>She gave him no answer, but allowed her hand to rest in his and
walked beside him with a firm step through the narrow door which
gave on the interior of the mill-house. She looked about her with
inquiring eyes that had not a vestige of terror in them. Almost, it
seemed, at one moment as if she smiled.</p>

<p>Did her memory conjure back just then the vision of that other
<i>molen</i>, the one at Ryswick, where so much had happened three
short months ago, and where this arrogant tyrant had played such a
sorry role? Perhaps. Certain it is that she turned to him without
any defiance, almost with a gentle air of appeal.</p>

<p>"I am very tired," she said, with a weary little sigh, "and
would be grateful for a little privacy, if your lordship would
allow my tire-woman to attend on me."</p>

<p>"Your wishes are my laws, <i>myn schat</i>," he replied airily.
"I entreat you to look on this somewhat dilapidated building only
as a temporary halt, where nothing, alas! can be done for your
comfort. I trust you will not suffer from the cold, but absolute
privacy you shall have. The loft up those narrow steps is entirely
at your disposal, and your woman shall come to you
immediately."</p>

<p>Indeed, he called at once through the door, and a moment or two
later Maria appeared, reduced to silence for the nonce by a
wholesome fear. Stoutenburg, in the meanwhile, still with that same
ironical gallantry, had conducted Gilda to the narrow, ladder-like
steps which led up to the loft. He stood at the foot, watching her
serene and leisurely progress.</p>

<p>"How wise you are, <i>mejuffrouw</i>," he said, with a sigh of
satisfaction. "And withal how desirable!"</p>

<p>She turned for a second, then, and looked down on him. But her
eyes were quite inscrutable. Never had he desired her so much as
now. With the gloomy background of those rickety walls behind her,
she looked like an exquisite fairy; her dainty head wrapped in a
hood, through which her small, oval face appeared, slightly
rose-tinted, like a piece of delicate china.</p>

<p>The huge fur coat concealed the lines of her graceful figure,
but one perfect hand rested upon the rail, and the other peeped out
like a flower between the folds of her cloak. He all but lost his
head when he gazed on her, and met those blue eyes that still held
a mystery for him. But, with Stoutenburg, ambition and selfishness
always waged successful warfare even against passion, and at this
hour his entire destiny was hanging in the balance.</p>

<p>The look wherewith he regarded her was that of a conqueror
rather than a lover. The title of the English play had come swiftly
through his mind: "The Taming of the Shrew." In truth, Nicolaes had
been right. Women have no use for weaklings. It is their master
whom they worship.</p>

<p>Just one word of warning did he give her ere she finally passed
out of his sight.</p>

<p>"There will be noise of fighting anon, <i>myn engel</i>," he
said carelessly. "Nothing that need alarm you. An encounter with
vedettes probably. A few musket shots. You will not be afraid?"</p>

<p>"No," she replied simply. "I will not be afraid."</p>

<p>"You will be safe here with me until we can continue our journey
east or south. It will depend on what progress de Berg has been
able to make."</p>

<p>She gave a slight nod of understanding.</p>

<p>"I shall be ready," she said.</p>

<p>Encouraged by her gentleness, he went on more warmly:</p>

<p>"And at the hour when we leave here together, <i>myn schat</i>,
a runner will speed to Amersfoort with order to Jan to evacuate the
city. The burgomaster will be in a position to announce to his
fellow-citizens that they have nothing to fear from a chivalrous
enemy, who will respect person and property, and who will go out of
the gates of Amersfoort as empty-handed as he came."</p>

<p>Whereupon he made her a low and respectful bow, stood aside to
allow the serving woman to follow her mistress. Gilda had
acknowledge his last pompous tirade with a faintly murmured, "I
thank you, my lord." Then she went quickly up the steps and finally
passed out of his sight on the floor above.</p>

<p>Just for a little while he remained quite still, listening to
her footsteps overhead. His lean, sharp-featured face expressed
nothing but contentment now. Success&mdash;complete,
absolute&mdash;was his at last! Less than a fortnight ago, he was
nothing but a disappointed vagrant, without home, kindred, or
prospects; scorned by the woman he loved; despised by a successful
rival; an outcast from the land of his birth.</p>

<p>To-day, his rival was dead&mdash;an object of contempt, not even
of pity, for every honest man; while Gilda, like a ripe and
luscious fruit, was ready to fall into his arms. And he had his
foot firmly planted on the steps of a throne.</p>

<p class="cpb">5.</p>

<p>And now the midday hour had gone by, and silence, absolute,
reigned in and around the <i>molen</i>. Stoutenburg had spend some
time talking to the captain in command of his guard, had himself
seen to it that the men were well concealed in the rear of the
<i>molen</i>. The horses had been sent down to the camp so as to
preclude any possibility of an alarm being given before the
apportioned time. Two men were stationed on the platform to keep a
look-out upon the distance, where anon the Stadtholder and his
troop would appear.</p>

<p>Indeed, everything was ordained and arranged with perfect
precision in anticipation of the great coup which was destined to
deliver Maurice of Nassau into the hands of his enemy.
Everything!&mdash;provided that blind informer who lay dead in the
banqueting hall of the stately house at Amersfoort had not lied
from first to last.</p>

<p>But even if he had lied, even if the Stadtholder had not planned
this expedition, or, having planned it, had abandoned it or given
up the thought of leading it in person&mdash;even so, Stoutenburg
was prepared to be satisfied. Already his busy brain was full of
plans, which he would put into execution if the present one did not
yield him the supreme prize. Gilda was his now, whatever happened.
Gilda, and her wealth, and the influence of the Burgomaster
Beresteyn, henceforth irrevocably tied to the chariot wheel of his
son-in-law. A vista of riches, of honours, of power, was stretched
out before the longing gaze of this restless and ambitious
self-seeker.</p>

<p>For the nonce, he could afford to wait, even though the hours
crept by leaden-footed, and the look-out men up on the platform had
nothing as yet to report. The soldiers outside, wrapped up in
horse-blankets, squatted against the walls of the dilapidated
building, trying to get shelter from the cutting north wind. They
had their provisions for the day requisitioned at Barneveld; but
these they soon consumed for want of something better to do. The
cold was bitter, and anon an icy drizzle began to fall.</p>

<p class="cpb">6.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg, inside the mill-house, had started on that restless
pacing up and down which was so characteristic of him. He had
ordered the best of the provisions to be taken up to the
<i>jongejuffrouw</i> and her maid. He himself had eaten and had
drunk, and now he had nothing to do but wait. And think. Anon he
got tired of both, and when he heard the women moving about
overhead, he suddenly paused in his fretful wanderings, pondered
for a moment or two, and then went resolutely up the stairs.</p>

<p>Gilda was sitting on a pile of sacking; her hands lay idly in
her lap. With a curt word of command, Stoutenburg ordered the
waiting woman to go below.</p>

<p>Then he approached Gilda, and half-kneeling, half-reclining by
her side, he tried to take her hand. But she evaded him, hid her
hands underneath her cloak. This apparently vastly amused his
lordship, for he laughed good-humouredly, and said, with an ardent
look of passionate admiration:</p>

<p>"That is where you are so desirable, <i>myn engel</i>. Never
twice the same. Awhile ago you seemed as yielding as a dove; now
once more I see the young vixen peeping at me through those
wonderful blue eyes. Well!" he added with a sigh of contentment, "I
will not complain. Life by your side, <i>myn geliefde</i>, will
never be dull. The zest of taming a beautiful shrew must ever be a
manly sport."</p>

<p>Then, as she made no sign either of defiance or comprehension,
but sat with eyes strained and neck craned forward, almost as if
she were listening, he raised himself and sat down upon the sacking
close beside her. She puzzled him now, as she always did; and that
puzzlement added zest to his wooing.</p>

<p>"I was waxing so dejected down below," he said, and leaned
forward, his lips almost touching the hood that kept her ears
concealed. "Little did I guess that so much delight lay ready to my
hand. Time is a hard task-master to me just now, and I have not the
leisure to make as ardent love to you as I would wish. But I have
the time to gratify a fancy, and this I will do. My fancy is to
have three kisses from your sweet lips on mine. Three, and no more,
and on the lips, <i>myn schat</i>."</p>

<p>In an instant his arms were round her. But equally suddenly she
had evaded him. She jumped up and ran, as swift as a hare, to the
farther end of the loft, where she remained ensconced behind a
transverse beam, her arms round it for support, her face, white and
set, only vaguely discernible in the gloom.</p>

<p>The dim afternoon light which came but shyly peeping in through
two small windows high up in the walls, failed to reach this angle
of the loft where Gilda had found shelter. With this dim background
behind her, she appeared like some elusive spectre, an apparition,
without form or substance, her face and hands alone visible.</p>

<p>When she escaped him, Stoutenburg had cursed, as was his wont,
then struggled to his feet and tried to carry off the situation
with an affected laugh. But somehow the girls' face, there in the
semi-darkness, gave him an unpleasant, eerie sensation. He did not
follow her, but paused in the centre of the loft, laughter dying
upon his lips.</p>

<p>"Am I to remind you again, you little termagant," he said, with
a great show of bluster, "that Jan is still at Amersfoort, and that
I may yet send a runner to him if I have a mind, ordering that by
nightfall that accursed city be ablaze?"</p>

<p>He was looking straight at her while he spoke. And she returned
his glance, but gave him no reply. Just for the space of a few
seconds an extraordinary stillness appeared to have descended upon
the <i>molen</i>. Up here, in the loft, nothing stirred, nothing
was heard above that silence save the patter of the rain upon the
roof overhead against the tiny window panes. For a few seconds,
whilst Stoutenburg stood like a beast of prey about to spring, and
Gilda, still and silent, like a bird on the alert.</p>

<p>And suddenly, even as he gazed, the man's expression slowly
underwent a change. First the arrogance died out of it, the forced
irony. Every line became set, then rigid, and more and more ashen
in hue, until the whole face appeared like a death-mask, colourless
and transparent as wax, the jaw dropping, the lips parted as for a
cry that would not come. And the sunken eyes opened wider and
wider, and wider still as they gazed, not on Gilda any longer, but
into the darkness behind her, whilst the whole aspect of the man
was like a living statute of horror and of a nameless fear.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, right through the silence and above the weird
patter of the rain, there rang a sound which roused the very echoes
that lay dormant among the ancient rafters. So strange a sound was
it that when it reached his ear, Stoutenburg lost his balance and
swayed on his feet like a drunken man; so strange that Gilda, her
nerves giving way for the first time under the terrible strain
which she had undergone, buried her face against her arms, whilst a
loud sob broke from her throat. Yet the sound in itself was neither
a terrifying nor a tragic one. It was just the sound of a prolonged
and loud peal of laughter.</p>

<p>"By my halidame!" a merry voice swore lustily. "But meseems that
your lordship had no thought of seeing me here!"</p>

<p>Just for a few seconds, superstitious fear held the miscreant
gripped by the throat. A few seconds? To him to Gilda, they seemed
an eternity. Then a hoarse whisper escaped him.</p>

<p>"Spectre or demon, which are you?"</p>

<p>"Both, you devil!" the mocking voice gave reply. "And I would
send you down to hell and shoot you like a dog where you stand, but
for the noise which would bring your men about mine ears."</p>

<p>"To hell yourself, you infamous <i>plepshurk</i>!" Stoutenburg
cried, strove to shake off with a mighty effort the superstitious
dread that made a weakling of him. He fumbled for his sword,
succeeded in drawing it from its scabbard, and cursed himself for
being without a pistol in his belt.</p>

<p>"Where you came from, I know not," he went on in a husky
whisper. "But be you wraith or demon, you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He seemed to speak involuntarily, as if sheer terror was forcing
the words through his bloodless lips. Suddenly he uttered a hoarse
cry:</p>

<p>"<i>A moi!</i> Somebody there! <i>A moi!</i>"</p>

<p>But the walls of the old <i>molen</i> were thick, and his voice,
spent and still half-choked with the horror of that spectral
apparition, refused him effective service. It failed to carry far
enough. The tiny windows were impracticable; the soldiers were
outside at the rear of the building, out of earshot; and down below
there was only the old waiting woman.</p>

<p>"That smeerlap!" he cried, half to himself. "Either a wraith or
blind. In either case&mdash;"</p>

<p>And, sword in hand, he rushed upon his mocking enemy. A blind
man! Bah! What had he to fear? The rogue had in truth thrust Guild
behind him. He stood there, with one of those short English daggers
in his hand, which had of late put the fine Toledo blades to shame.
But a blind man, for all that! How he had escaped out of
Amersfoort, and by whose connivance Stoutenburg had not time to
think. But the man was blind. Every phase of last evening's
interview with him&mdash;the vacant eyes, the awkward
movements&mdash;stood out clearly before his lordship's mental
vision, and testified to that one fact; the man was blind and
helpless.</p>

<p>Crouching like a feline creature upon his haunches, Stoutenburg
was ready for a spring. His every movement became lithe and silent
as that of a snake. He had marked out to himself just how and where
he would strike. He only waited until those eyes&mdash;those awful
eyes&mdash;ceased to look on him. But their glance never wavered.
They followed his ever step. They mocked and derided and threatened
withal! By Satan and all his hordes! those stricken orbs could
see!</p>

<p>At what precise moment that conviction entered Stoutenburg's
tortured brain, he could not himself have told you. But suddenly it
was there. And in an instant his nerve completely forsook him. An
icy sweat broke all over his body. His head swam, his knees gave
way under him, the sword dropped out of his nerveless hand. Then,
with a quick hoarse cry, he turned to flee. His foot was on the top
step of the ladder which led to the room below. A prolonged,
mocking laugh behind him seemed to lend him wings. But
freedom&mdash;aye, and more!&mdash;beckoned from below. There was
only an old woman there, and his soldiers were outside. Ye gods! He
was a fool to fear!</p>

<p>He flew down the few steps, nearly fell headlong in the act, for
his nerves were playing him an unpleasant trick, and the afternoon
light was growing dim. At first, when he reached the place below,
he saw nothing. Nothing save the welcome door, straight before him
which led straight to freedom from this paralysing obsession. With
one bound he had covered half the intervening space, when suddenly
he paused, and an awful curse rose to his lips. There, in the
recess of the doorway, two men were squatting on their heels,
intent upon a game of hazard. One of these men was long and lean,
the other round as a curled-up hedge-hog. They did no more than
glance over their shoulder when His Magnificence the Lord of
Stoutenburg came staggering down the steps.</p>

<p>"Five and four," the lean vagabond was saying. "How many does
that make?"</p>

<p>"Eight, you loon!" the other replied. "My turn now."</p>

<p>They continued their game, regardless of his lordship who stood
there rooted to the spot, trembling in every limb, his body covered
with sweat, feeling like an animal that sees a trap slowly closing
in upon him.</p>

<p>The situation was indeed one to send a man out of his senses.
Stoutenburg, for one brief instant, felt that he was going mad. He
looked from the door to the steps, and back again to the door,
marvelling which way lay his one chance of escape. If he shouted,
would he be heard? Could his men get to him before those two
ruffians fell to and murdered him? Dared he make a dash for the
door? Or&mdash;It was unthinkable that
he&mdash;Stoutenburg&mdash;should be standing here, at the mercy of
three villains, utterly powerless, when outside, not fifty paces
away, the other side of those walls, fifty men at arms were there,
set to guard his person.</p>

<p>And suddenly fear fell away from him. The trembling of his limbs
ceased, his vision became clear, his mind alert. Even around his
quaking lips there came the ghost of a smile.</p>

<p>His senses, keyed up by the imminence of his danger, had seized
upon a sound which came from outside, faint as yet, but very
obviously drawing nearer. In the semi-darkness and with his head
buzzing and his nerves tingling, he could not distinguish either
the quality of the sound nor yet the exact direction whence it
came. But whatever it was&mdash;even if it was not all that he
hoped&mdash;the sound was bound to set his soldiers on the alert;
and if he could only temporize with those ruffians for a minute or
two, the very next would see the captain of his guard rushing in to
report what was happening: That Stadtholder sighted, the signal
given, Nicolaes Beresteyn coming swiftly to the rescue.</p>

<p>Therefore, in the face of his own imminent peril, the Lord of
Stoutenburg no longer felt afraid, only tensely vitally expectant.
The two caitiffs, on the other hand appeared to have heard nothing.
At any rate, they went on with their game, and the flute-like,
high-pitched tones of the fat loon alternated with the deep base of
his companion:</p>

<p>"Three and two make five!"</p>

<p>"No, four, you varlet!"</p>

<p>"Six!"</p>

<p>"Blank, by Beelzebub! My luck is dead out to-day."</p>

<p>And the sound drew nearer. There was no mistaking it. Men
running. The clatter of arms. Horses, too. A pawing, and a
champing, and a general hubbub, which those two ruffians could not
fail to hear. Nor did any sound come down from the loft. Yet Gilda
was there with the miserable <i>plepshurk</i> who, whatever else
happened, would inevitably stand before her now as an informer and
a cheat. This, at any rate, was a fact. The man had betrayed his
master in order to save his miserable life, and the burgomaster had
connived at his escape through an access of doltish weakness. But
the fact remained. The Stadtholder was approaching. The next few
minutes&mdash;seconds, perhaps&mdash;would see the final triumphant
issue of this terrible adventure.</p>

<p>Stoutenburg, like a feline at bay, waited.</p>

<p>Then, all at once, a musket shot rang through the air, then
another, and yet another; and all at once the whole air around was
alive with sounds. The clang of arms; the lusty battle cries. Men
out there had come to grips. In the drenching rain they were at one
another's throats.</p>

<p>The two caitiffs quietly put aside their dice and rose to their
feet. They stood with their backs to the door, their eyes fixed
upon his lordship.</p>

<p>"Stand aside, you dolts!" Stoutenburg cried aloud; for he
thought that he read murder in those two pairs of eyes, and he had
need of all his nerves to assure himself that all was well, that,
though his captain had not come to him for a reason which no doubt
was sound, his soldiers were at grips with the Stadtholder's
vanguard, and Nicolaes was already half-way up the slope.</p>

<p>But he, Stoutenburg, was unarmed, and could not push past those
two assassins who were guarding the door. He bethought himself of
his sword, which lay on the floor of the loft. He turned with a
sudden impulse to get hold of it at all costs, and was met at the
very foot of the steps by the man who had baffled him at every
turn.</p>

<p>Diogenes, sword in hand, did not even pause to look on his
impotent enemy. With one spring, he was across the floor and out by
the door, which one of the ruffians immediately closed behind
him.</p>

<p>It had all happened swifter even than thought. Stoutenburg,
trapped, helpless, more bewildered in truth than terrified, still
believed in a happy issue to his present desperate position. The
thought came to him that he might purchase his safety from those
potential murderers.</p>

<p>"Ten thousand guilders," he called out wildly, "if you will let
me pass!"</p>

<p>But the fat <i>runnion</i> merely turned to the lean one, and
the look of understanding which passed between them sent an icy
shudder down his lordship's spine. He knew that from these two he
could expect no mercy. A hoarse cry of horror escaped his lips as
he saw that each held a dagger in one hand.</p>

<p>Then began that awful chase when man becomes a hunted
beast&mdash;that grim game of hide-and-seek, with the last issue
never once in doubt. The Lord of Stoutenburg trapped between these
narrow walls, ran round and round like a mouse in a cage; now
seeking refuge behind a girder, now leaping over an intervening
obstacle, now crouching, panting and bathed in sweat, under cover
of the gloom. And no one spoke; no one called. Neither the hunted
nor the hunters. It seemed as if a conspiracy of silence existed
between them; or else that the nearness of death had put a seal on
all their lips.</p>

<p>Out there the clang of battle appeared more remote. Nothing
seemed to occur in the immediate approach of the <i>molen</i>. It
all came from afar, resounding across the Veluwe, above the patter
of the rain and the soughing of the wind, through the rafters of
the old mill. Drumming and thumping, the angle of armour, the clang
of pike and lance, of metal; the loud report of musket shot, the
strident grating of chains and wheels. But all far away, not here.
Not outside the <i>molen</i>, but down there in the gorge, where
Nicolaes had been encamped. My heavens, what did it mean?</p>

<p>Already the trapped creature was getting exhausted. Once or
twice he had come down on his knees. His eyes were growing dim. His
breath came and went with a wheezing sound from his breast. It was
not just two murderous brigands who were pursuing him, but Nemesis
herself, with sword of retribution drawn, in her hand an
hour-glass, the sands of which were running low.</p>

<p>All at once the miscreant found himself at the foot of the
steps, and, blindly stumbling, he ran up to the
loft&mdash;instinctively, without set purpose save that of warding
off, if only for a minute, the inevitable end.</p>

<p class="cpb">7.</p>

<p>Gilda was standing at the top of the steps with neck craned
forward, her hands held tightly to her breast, her whole attitude
one of nameless horror. She had been listening to the multifarious
sounds which came from outside, and the natural, womanly fear for
the safety of her beloved had been her one dominant emotion.</p>

<p>She had heard nothing else for a time, until suddenly she caught
one or two stray sounds of that grim and furtive fight for life
which was going on down below. She had reached the top of the
steps, and tried to peer through the gloom to ascertain whose were
those stealthy, swift footfalls so like those of a hunted beast,
and whose the heavy, lumbering tread that spoke of stern and
unwavering pursuit. At first she could see nothing, and the very
silence which lay like a pall upon the grim scene below struck her
with a sense of paralysing dread.</p>

<p>Then she caught sight first of one figure, then of another, as
they crossed her line of vision. She could distinguish nothing very
clearly&mdash;just those slowly moving figures&mdash;and for a
moment or two felt herself unable to move. Then she heard the
laboured breathing of a man, a groan as of a soul tortured with
fear, and the next instant the Lord of Stoutenburg appeared,
stumbling up the narrow steps.</p>

<p>At sight of her he fell like an inert thing with a husky cry at
her feet. His arms encircled her knees; his head fell against her
gown.</p>

<p>"Gilda, save me!" he whispered hoarsely. "For the love of
Heaven! They'll murder me! Save me, for pity's sake! Gilda!"</p>

<p>He sobbed and cried like a child, abject in his terror,
loathsome in his craven cowardice. Gilda could not stir. He held
her with his arms as in a vise. She would have given worlds for the
physical strength to wrench her gown out of his clutch, to flee
from the hated sight of him who had planned to do her beloved such
an irreparable injury. Oh, she hated him! She hated him worse,
perhaps, than she had ever done before, now that he clung like a
miserable dastard to her for mercy.</p>

<p>"Leave the poltroon to us, <i>mejuffrouw</i>," a gentle,
flute-like tone broke in on the miscreant's ravings.</p>

<p>"Now then, take your punishment like a man!" a gruff voice added
sternly.</p>

<p>And two familiar faces emerged out of the gloom, immediately
below where Gilda was standing, imprisoned by those cringing arms.
The man, in truth, had not even the primeval pluck of a savage. He
was beaten, and he knew it. What had happened out there on the
Veluwe, how completely he had been tricked by the Englishman he did
not know as yet. But he was afraid to die, and shrank neither from
humiliation nor contempt in order to save his own worthless life
from the wreck of all his ambitions.</p>

<p>At the sound of those two voices, which in truth were like a
death-knell in his ears, he jumped to his feet; but he did not
loosen his hold on Gilda. Swift as thought he had found refuge
behind her, and held her by the arms in front of him like a
shield.</p>

<p>Historians have always spoken of the Lord of Stoutenburg as
extraordinarily nimble in mind and body. That nimbleness in truth,
stood him in good stead now; or whilst Socrates and Pythagoras,
clumsy in their movements, lumbering and hampered by their respect
for the person of the <i>jongejuffrouw</i>, reached the loft, and
then for one instant hesitated how best to proceed in their grim
task without offending the ears and eyes of the great lady,
Stoutenburg had with one bound slipped from behind her down the
steps and was across the floor of the <i>molen</i> and out the door
before the two worthies had had time to utter the comprehensive
curse which, at this unexpected manoeuvre on the part of their
quarry, had risen to their lips.</p>

<p>"We had promised Diogenes not to allow the blackguard to
escape!" Pythagoras exclaimed ruefully.</p>

<p>And both started in hot pursuit, whilst Gilda, seeking shelter
in a dark angle of the loft, fell, sobbing with excitement and only
half-conscious, upon a pile of sacking.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;THE FINAL
ISSUE</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Pythagoras and Socrates failed to find the trail of the
miscreant, who had vanished under cover of the night. We know that
Stoutenburg did succeed, in fact, in reaching de Berg's encampment,
half-starved and wearied, but safe. How he did it, no one will ever
know. His career of crime had received a mighty check and the
marauding expeditions which he undertook subsequently against his
own country were of a futile and desultory nature. History ceases
to trouble herself about him after that abortive incursion into
Gelderland.</p>

<p>How that incursion was frustrated by the gallant Englishman,
known to fame as the first Sir Percy Blakeney, but to his intimates
as Diogenes, the erstwhile penniless soldier of fortune, we know
chiefly through van Aitzema's <i>Saken von Staet</i>. The worthy
chronicler enlarges upon the Englishman's adventure&mdash;he always
calls him "the Englishman"&mdash;from the time when a week and more
ago, he took leave of Nicolaes Beresteyn outside Barneveld to that
when he reached Amersfoort, just in time to avert a terrible
catastrophe.</p>

<p>The author of <i>Saken v. Staet</i> tells of the ambuscade on
the shores of the Ijssel, "the Englishman's swim for life through
the drifting floes." On reaching the opposite bank, it seems that
he was so spent and more than half frozen, that he lay half
unconscious on the bank for awhile. Presently, however, alive to
the danger of possible further ambuscades, he re-started on his
way, found a deserted hut close by, and crawled in there for
shelter. As soon as darkness had set in he started back for
Zutphen, there to warn Marquet not to proceed. The whole of the
Stadtholder's plans had obviously been revealed to de Berg by some
traitor&mdash;whose identity Diogenes then could not fail but
guess&mdash;and it would have been sheer madness to attempt to
cross the Ijssel now at any of the points originally intended.</p>

<p>To reach Zutphen at this juncture meant for the undaunted
adventurer two leagues and more to traverse, and with clothes
frozen hard to the skin. But he did reach Zutphen in time, and with
the assistance of Marquet, then evolved the plan of an advance into
Gelderland by effecting the crossing of the Ijssel as far north as
Apeldoorn, and then striking across the Veluwe either to Amersfoort
or to Ede, threatening de Berg's advance, and possibly effecting a
junction with the Stadtholder's main army.</p>

<p>After this understanding with Marquet, Diogenes then proceeded
to Arnheim, where the garrison could now only be warned to hold the
city at all costs until assistance could be sent.</p>

<p>In the meantime, de Berg's troops were swarming everywhere. The
Englishman could only proceed by night, had to hide by day on the
Veluwe as best he could. Hence much delay. More than once he was on
the point of capture, but succeeded eventually in reaching
Arnheim.</p>

<p>Here he saw Coorne, who was in command of the small garrison,
assured him of coming relief, and made him swear not to surrender
the city, since the Stadtholder would soon be on his way with
strong reinforcements. Thence to Nijmegen on the same errand. A
more easy journey this, seeing that Isembourg ad not begun his
advance from Kleve. After that, De Keysere and Wageningen.</p>

<p>Van Aitzema says that it was between Nijmegen and Wageningen
that "the Englishman," lurking in a thicket of scrub, overheard
some talk of how the Stadtholder was to be waylaid and captured on
his return to camp from Amersfoort. This fact the chronicler must
have learned at first hand. By this time the forces of de Berg were
spreading over Gelderland. "The Englishman" gathered that the
Archduchess's plans were to leave Isembourg's army to deal with
Arnheim and Nijmegen for the present, whilst de Berg was to march
on Ede, and, if possible, push on as far as Amersfoort. But as to
how the coup against the Stadtholder was to be effected, he could
not ascertain. At the time he did not know that his Highness
intended to visit Amersfoort again. But for him, that little city
where Gilda dwelt was just now the hub of the universe, and thank
Heaven his errand was now accomplished, all his Highness's orders
executed, and he was free to go to his young wife as fast as his
own endurance and Spanish vedettes would allow.</p>

<p>This meant another tramp across open country, which by this time
was overrun with enemy troops. Fugitives from Ede were everywhere
to be seen. "The Spaniards. They are on us!" rang from end to end
of the invaded province, and the echo of that dismal cry must by
now have been rolling even as far as Utrecht.</p>

<p>It meant also seeking cover against enemy surprise parties, who
threw the daring adventurer more than once out of his course, so
that we hear of him once as far south as Rhenen, and then as far
east as Doorn. It meant hiding amongst the reeds in the half-frozen
marshes, swimming the Rhyn at one point, the Eem at another; it
meant days without food and nights without rest. It meant all that,
and more in pluck and endurance and determination, to which three
qualities in "the Englishman" the worthy chronicler, though ever
chary of words, pays ungrudging tribute.</p>

<p>He reached Amersfoort, as we know, just in time to see the
Stadtholder leave the city in the company of the traitor, Nicolaes
Beresteyn, and, struck by that same treacherous hand, fell,
helpless for a moment, at the very threshold of the burgomaster's
house.</p>

<p>After which began the martyrdom which had ended in such perfect
triumph and happiness.</p>

<p>The daring adventurer, left lonely and stricken upon the
moorland, did in truth go through an agony of misery and
humiliation such as seldom falls to the lot of any man. Indeed,
what he did suffer throughout that terrible day, whilst he believed
himself to irretrievable blinded, was never known to any one save
to the two faithful friends who watched lovingly over him.
Socrates, after he had accompanied the Stadtholder, returned to sit
and watch with Pythagoras beside the man to whom they both clung
with such whole-hearted devotion.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>It was not until late in the night that a faint glimmer of
light, coming from the fire which the two caitiffs had managed to
kindle as the night was bitterly cold, reached the young soldier's
aching limbs, and seemed to him like a tiny beacon of hope in the
blackness of his misery. By the time that the grey dawn broke over
the moorland, he had realized that the injury which he had thought
irremediable, had only been transient, and that every hour now
brought an improvement in his power of vision.</p>

<p>Whereupon, three heads were put together to devise a means for
using the Englishman's supposed blindness to the best advantage.
One wise head and two loyal ones, not one of them even remotely
acquainted with fear, what finer combination could be found for the
eventful undoing of a pack of traitors?</p>

<p>Ede was in the hands of the Spaniards, Amersfoort on the point
of sharing the like fate. These facts were sufficiently confirmed
by the stray fugitives who wandered homeless and distracted across
the moorland, and were in turn interrogated by the three
conspirators.</p>

<p>With the woman he loved inside the invaded city, and with that
recreant Stoutenburg in command of the enemy troops there,
Diogenes' first thought was to get into Amersfoort himself at all
risks and costs. As for the plan for freeing the town and punishing
the miscreants, it was simple enough. To collect a small troop of
ruffians from amongst the fugitives on the moorlands and place
these under the command of Socrates, was the first move. The second
was to send Pythagoras with an urgent message to Marquet to hurry
eastward with his army from Apeldoorn, to the relief of Amersfoort,
taking on his way the lonely <i>molen</i> on the Veluwe, where an
important detachment of enemy troops might be expected to
encamp.</p>

<p>The one thing with which Diogenes was, most fortunately amply
provided, was money; money which he had by him when first he
started out of Amersfoort on the Stadtholder's errand; money which
was needful now to enable Socrates to recruit his small army of
ne'er-do-wells and to assist Pythagoras on his embassy to
Marquet.</p>

<p>Thereafter Diogenes, feigning blindness and worse, made his way
into the presence of the Lord of Stoutenburg, who held Gilda at his
mercy and the whole city to ransom for her obedience.</p>

<p>To dangle before the miscreant's eyes the prospect of capturing
the Stadtholder's person, and thus make himself master of the
Netherlands, was the pivot around which the whole plan revolved.
The bait could not fail to attract the ambitious cupidity of the
traitor, and verisimilitude was given to the story by Socrates'
band of ruffians, whose orders were to spread the news of the
Stadtholder's advance both on Ede and Amersfoort, and to silence
effectually any emissaries of Stoutenburg's who might be sent out
to ascertain the truth of these rumours.</p>

<p>We may take it that Socrates and his little troop saw to it that
none of these emissaries did return to Amersfoort for the Lord of
Stoutenburg marched out of the city at dawn, with his sinister
banner flying, with his musketeers, pikemen and lancers, and with
Gilda Beresteyn a virtual prisoner in his train.</p>

<p>That the daring adventurer risked an ignominious death by this
carefully laid plan cannot be denied; but he was one of those men
who had gambled with life and death since he was a child, who was
accustomed to stake his all upon the spin of a coin; and, anyhow,
if he failed, death would have been thrice welcome, as the only
escape out of untold misery and sorrow.</p>

<p>Chance favoured him in this, that at the last he was left face
to face with the burgomaster, to whom he immediately confided
everything, and who enabled him to escape out of the house by the
service staircase, and thence into the streets, where no one knew
him and where he remained all night, effectually concealed as a
unit in the midst of the crowd. He actually went out of Amersfoort
in the train of Stoutenburg; and whilst his lordship's troops made
a long halt at Barneveld, "the Englishman" continued his way
unmolested across the Veluwe to the lonely <i>molen</i>, which was
to witness his success and happiness, or the final annihilation of
all that made life possible.</p>

<p class="cpb">3.</p>

<p>All this and more, in the matter of detail, hath the meticulous
chronicler of the time put conscientiously on record. We must
assume that he was able to verify all his facts at source, chiefly
through the garrulous offices of "the Englishman's" two well-known
familiars.</p>

<p>What, however, will for ever remain unrecorded, save in the book
of heroic deeds, is a woman's perfect loyalty. During those hours
and days, full of horror and of dread, Gilda never once wavered in
her belief in the man she loved. From the moment when Nicolaes
tried to poison her mind against him, and through all the
vicissitudes which placed her face to face with what was a mere
semblance of her beloved, she had never doubted him, when even the
Stadtholder seemed to doubt.</p>

<p>She knew him to be playing a dangerous game&mdash;but a game for
all that&mdash;when first she beheld him, sightless and abject, in
the presence of their mutual enemy, and had rested for one brief
second against his breast. That his eyes, still dazed by the
poisonous fumes, could vaguely discern her face, even though they
could not read the expression thereon, she did not know. The fear
that he was irremediably blind was the most cruel of all the
tortures which she had undergone that night.</p>

<p>When her father came to her in the small hours of the morning to
tell her that all was well with the beloved of her heart, but that
he would have all the need of all her courage and of all her
determination to help him to complete his self-imposed task, she
realized for the first time how near to actual death the torturing
fear had brought her. But from that time forth, she never lost her
presence of mind. With marvellous courage she gripped the whole
situation and played her role unswervingly until the end.</p>

<p>Everything depended on whether Marquet reached the <i>molen</i>
before the Lord of Stoutenburg, or his captains suspected that
anything was wrong. True, Pythagoras had brought back the news that
he had met the loyal commander at Apeldoorn, and that the latter,
despite the fact that he and his troops intend to take there a
well-earned rest, had immediately given the order to march. But,
even so, the future of the Netherlands and of her Stadtholder, as
well as the fate of the gallant Englishman and his beloved wife,
lay in the hands of God.</p>

<p>One hour before dusk Marquet's vedettes first came in contact
with the outposts of Beresteyn's encampment in the gorge below the
<i>molen</i>. There was a brief struggle, fierce on both sides,
until the main body of Marquet's army, four thousand strong,
appeared on the eastern heights above the gorge.</p>

<p>Whilst the Lord of Stoutenburg ran round and round the narrow
space wherein he was a hunted prisoner, trying to escape that
shameful death which threatened him at the hand of two humble
justiciaries, his few hundred men were falling like butchered
beasts beneath the pike-thrusts and musket shots of Marquet's
trained troops.</p>

<p>Nicolaes Beresteyn was the first to fall.</p>

<p>It was better so. Dishonour so complete could be only wiped out
by death.</p>

<p>When, a day or two later, after Marquet had driven the Spaniards
out of Amersfoort, the burgomaster heard the news of the death of
his only son. He murmured an humble and broken-hearted: "Thank
God!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch17" id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;THE ONLY
WORLD</h2>

<p class="cpb">1.</p>

<p>Out there, in the lonely <i>molen</i> on the Veluwe, Gilda had
remained for a while, half numb with nerve strain, suffering from
the reaction after the terrible excitement of the past few hours.
Presently her old serving-woman came to her, still raging with
choler at the outrage committed against her person by those two
abominable rascallions.</p>

<p>With great volubility, she explained to her mistress that they
had fallen on her unawares when first she had been sent down-stairs
by his lordship&mdash;whom may God punish!&mdash;The had bound and
gagged her, and then told her quite cheerfully that this was an act
of friendship on their part, to save her from a worse fate and from
the temptation of talking when she should remain silent.</p>

<p>She had been thrust into a dark angle of the mill-house, from
whence she could see absolutely nothing, and where she had lain all
this while, entirely helpless, hearing that awful din which had
been going on outside, expecting to be murdered in cold blood at
any moment, and tortured with fear as to what was happening to her
mistress. Only a few moments ago, the two ruffians had reappeared,
running helter-skelter down the steps and thence out through the
door into the open. Fortunately, one of them, conscience-stricken
no doubt, had thought, before fleeing, to release her from her
bonds.</p>

<p>Maria was stupid, uncomprehending and garrulous; but she was
loyal, and had a warm and ample bosom, whereon a tired and aching
head could find a little rest.</p>

<p>Gilda, her body still shaken by hysterical sobs, her teeth
chattering, her senses reeling with the horror of all that she had
gone through, found some measure of comfort in the old woman's
ministrations. A mugful of wine, left over from the midday meal,
helped her to regain command over her nerves. Holding her young
mistress in her arms, Maria, crooning like a mother over her baby,
rocked the half-inert young form into some semblance of sleep.</p>

<p class="cpb">2.</p>

<p>And here Diogenes found her a couple of hours later, curled up
like a tired child in the arms of the old woman.</p>

<p>He came up on tiptoe, carrying a lanthorn, for now it was quite
dark. This he placed on the floor, and then, with infinite caution,
he slid into Maria's place and took the beloved form into his own
strong arms.</p>

<p>She scarcely moved, just opened her eyes for a second or two,
and then nestled closer against his shoulder, with a little sigh,
half of weariness, but wholly of content.</p>

<p>She was just dead-tired after all she had gone through, and now
she slept just like a baby in his arms; whilst he was as happy as
it is possible for any human being to be, for she was safe and
well, and nothing could part her from him now. He was satisfied to
watch her as she slept, her dear face against his breast, her soft
breath coming and going with perfect evenness through her parted
lips.</p>

<p>Once he stooped and kissed her, and then she woke, put her arms
around his neck, and both forgot for the time being that there was
another world save that of Love.</p>
