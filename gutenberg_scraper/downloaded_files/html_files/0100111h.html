To S.A.

I loved you, so I drew these tides of men into my hands
   and wrote my will across the sky in stars
To earn you Freedom, the seven-pillared worthy house,
   that your eyes might be shining for me
                                              When we came.

Death seemed my servant on the road, till we were near
   and saw you waiting:
When you smiled, and in sorrowful envy he outran me
   and took you apart:
                                        Into his quietness.

Love, the way-weary, groped to your body, our brief wage
   ours for the moment
Before earth's soft hand explored your shape, and the blind
   worms grew fat upon
                                            Your substance.

Men prayed me that I set our work, the inviolate house,
   as a menory of you.
But for fit monument I shattered it, unfinished: and now
The little things creep out to patch themselves hovels
   in the marred shadow
                                              Of your gift.

<p>Mr Geoffrey Dawson persuaded All Souls College to give me
leisure, in 1919-1920, to write about the Arab Revolt. Sir Herbert
Baker let me live and work in his Westminster houses.</p>

<p>The book so written passed in 1921 into proof; where it was
fortunate in the friends who criticized it. Particularly it owes
its thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Bernard Shaw for countless suggestions
of great value and diversity: and for all the present
semicolons.</p>

<p>It does not pretend to be impartial. I was fighting for my hand,
upon my own midden. Please take it as a personal narrative piece
out of memory. I could not make proper notes: indeed it would have
been a breach of my duty to the Arabs if I had picked such flowers
while they fought. My superior officers, Wilson, Joyce, Dawnay,
Newcombe and Davenport could each tell a like tale. The same is
true of Stirling, Young, Lloyd and Maynard: of Buxton and
Winterton: of Ross, Stent and Siddons: of Peake, Homby,
Scott-Higgins and Garland: of Wordie, Bennett and MacIndoe: of
Bassett, Scott, Goslett, Wood and Gray: of Hinde, Spence and
Bright: of Brodie and Pascoe, Gilman and Grisenthwaite, Greenhill,
Dowsett and Wade: of Henderson, Leeson, Makins and Nunan.</p>

<p>And there were many other leaders or lonely fighters to whom
this self-regardant picture is not fair. It is still less fair, of
course, like all war-stories, to the un-named rank and file: who
miss their share of credit, as they must do, until they can write
the despatches.</p>

<h2><a name="intro-ch" id="intro-ch"></a>INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER</h2>

<p>The story which follows was first written out in Paris during
the Peace Conference, from notes jotted daily on the march,
strengthened by some reports sent to my chiefs in Cairo.
Afterwards, in the autumn of 1919, this first draft and some of the
notes were lost. It seemed to me historically needful to reproduce
the tale, as perhaps no one but myself in Feisal's army had thought
of writing down at the time what we felt, what we hoped, what we
tried. So it was built again with heavy repugnance in London in the
winter of 1919-20 from memory and my surviving notes. The record of
events was not dulled in me and perhaps few actual mistakes crept
in&mdash;except in details of dates or numbers&mdash;but the
outlines and significance of things had lost edge in the haze of
new interests.</p>

<p>Dates and places are correct, so far as my notes preserved them:
but the personal names are not. Since the adventure some of those
who worked with me have buried themselves in the shallow grave of
public duty. Free use has been made of their names. Others still
possess themselves, and here keep their secrecy. Sometimes one man
carried various names. This may hide individuality and make the
book a scatter of featureless puppets, rather than a group of
living people: but once good is told of a man, and again evil, and
some would not thank me for either blame or praise.</p>

<p>This isolated picture throwing the main light upon myself is
unfair to my British colleagues. Especially I am most sorry that I
have not told what the non-commissioned of us did. They were but
wonderful, especially when it is taken into account that they had
not the motive, the imaginative vision of the end, which sustained
officers. Unfortunately my concern was limited to this end, and the
book is just a designed procession of Arab freedom from Mecca to
Damascus. It is intended to rationalize the campaign, that everyone
may see how natural the success was and how inevitable, how little
dependent on direction or brain, how much less on the outside
assistance of the few British. It was an Arab war waged and led by
Arabs for an Arab aim in Arabia.</p>

<p>My proper share was a minor one, but because of a fluent pen, a
free speech, and a certain adroitess of brain, I took upon myself,
as I describe it, a mock primacy. In reality I never had any office
among the Arabs: was never in charge of the British mission with
them. Wilson, Joyce, Newcombe, Dawnay and Davenport were all over
my head. I flattered myself that I was too young, not that they had
more heart or mind in the work, I did my best. Wilson, Newcombe,
Dawnay, Davenport, Buxton, Marshall, Stirling, Young, Maynard,
Ross, Scott, Winterton, Lloyd, Wordie, Siddons, Goslett, Stent
Henderson, Spence, Gilman, Garland, Brodie, Makins, Nunan, Leeson,
Hornby, Peake, Scott-Higgins, Ramsay, Wood, Hinde, Bright,
MacIndoe, Greenhill, Grisenthwaite, Dowsett, Bennett, Wade, Gray,
Pascoe and the others also did their best.</p>

<p>It would be impertinent in me to praise them. When I wish to say
ill of one outside our number, I do it: though there is less of
this than was in my diary, since the passage of time seems to have
bleached out men's stains. When I wish to praise outsiders, I do
it: bur our family affairs are our own. We did what we set out to
do, and have the satisfaction of that knowledge. The others have
liberty some day to put on record their story, one parallel to mine
but not mentioning more of me than I of them, for each of us did
his job by himself and as he pleased, hardly seeing his
friends.</p>

<p>In these pages the history is not of the Arab movement, but of
me in it. It is a narrative of daily life, mean happenings, little
people. Here are no lessons for the world, no disclosures to shock
peoples. It is filled with trivial things, partly that no one
mistake for history the bones from which some day a man may make
history, and partly for the pleasure it gave me to recall the
fellowship of the revolt. We were fond together, because of the
sweep of the open places, the taste of wide winds, the sunlight,
and the hopes in which we worked. The moral freshness of the
world-to-be intoxicated us. We were wrought up in ideas
inexpressible and vaporous, but to be fought for. We lived many
lives in those whirling campaigns, never sparing ourselves: yet
when we achieved and the new world dawned, the old men came out
again and took our victory to re-make in the likeness of the former
world they knew. Youth could win, but had not learned to keep: and
was pitiably weak against age. We stammered that we had worked for
a new heaven and a new earth, and they thanked us kindly and made
their peace.</p>

<p>All men dream: but nor equally, Those who dream by night in the
dusty recesses oftheir minds wake in the day to find that it was
vanity: but the dreamers of the day are dangerous men, for they may
act their dream with open eyes, to make it possible. This I did. I
meant to make a new nation, to restore! a lost influence, to give
twenty millions of Semites the foundations on which to build an
inspired dream-palace of their national thoughts. So high an aim
called out the inherent nobility of their minds, and made them play
a generous part in events: but when we won, it was charged against
me that the British petrol royalties in Mesopotamia were become
dubious, and French Colonial policy ruined in the Levant.</p>

<p>I am afraid that I hope so. We pay for these things too much in
honour and in innocent lives. I went up the Tigris with one hundred
Devon Territorials, young, clean, delightful fellows, full of the
power of happiness and of making women and children glad. By them
one saw vividly how great it was to be their kin, and English. And
we were casting them by thousands into the fire to the worst of
deaths, not to win the war but that the corn and rice and oil of
Mesopotamia might be ours. The only need was to defeat our enemies
(Turkey among them), and this was at last done in the wisdom of
Allenby with less than four hundred killed, by turning to our uses
the hands of the oppressed in Turkey. I am proudest of my thirty
fights in that I did not have any of our own blood shed. All our
subject provinces to me were not worth one dead Englishman.</p>

<p>We were three years over this effort and I have had to hold back
many things which may not yet be said. Even so, parts of this book
will be new to nearly all who see it, and many will look for
familiar things and not find them. Once I reported fully to my
chiefs, but learnt that they were rewarding me on my own evidence.
This was not as it should be. Honours may be necessary in a
professional army, as so many emphatic mentions in despatches, and
by enlisting we had put ourselves, willingly or not, in the
position of regular soldiers.</p>

<p>For my work on the Arab front I had determined to accept
nothing. The Cabinet raised the Arabs to fight for us by definite
promises of self-government afterwards. Arabs believe in persons,
not in institutions. They saw in me a free agent of the British
Government, and demanded from me an endorsement of its written
promises. So I had to join the conspiracy, and, for what my word
was worth, assured the men of their reward. In our two years'
partnership under fire they grew accustomed to believing me and to
think my Government, like myself, sincere. In this hope they
performed some fine things, but, of course, instead of being proud
of what we did together, I was bitterly ashamed.</p>

<p>It was evident from the beginning that if we won the war these
promises would be dead paper, and had I been an honest adviser of
the Arabs I would have advised them to go home and not risk their
lives fighting for such stuff: but I salved myself with the hope
that, by leading these Arabs madly in the final victory I would
establish them, with arms in their hands, in a position so assured
(if not dominant) that expediency would counsel to the Great Powers
a fair settlement of their claims. In other words, I presumed
(seeing no other leader with the will and power) that I would
survive the campaigns, and be able to defeat not merely the Turks
on the battlefield, but my own country and its allies in the
council-chamber. It was an immodest presumption: it is not yet:
clear if I succeeded: but it is clear that I had no shadow of leave
to engage the Arabs, unknowing, in such hazard. I risked the fraud,
on my conviction that Arab help was necessary to our cheap and
speedy victory in the East, and that better we win and break our
word than lose.</p>

<p>The dismissal of Sir Henry McMahon confirmed my belief in our
essential insincerity: but I could not so explain myself to General
Wingate while the war lasted, since I was nominally under his
orders, and he did not seem sensible of how false his own standing
was. The only thing remaining was to refuse rewards for being a
successful trickster and, to prevent this unpleasantness arising, I
began in my reports to conceal the true stories of things, and to
persuade the few Arabs who knew to an equal reticence. In this book
also, for the last time, I mean to be my own judge of what to
say.</p>

<h2><a name="intro" id="intro"></a>INTRODUCTION. Foundations of
Revolt</h2>

<h3>CHAPTERS I TO VII</h3>

<blockquote><i>Some Englishmen, of whom Kitchener was chief,
believed that a rebellion of Arabs against Turks would enable
England, while fighting Germany, simultaneously to defeat her ally
Turkey.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Their knowledge of the nature and power and country of the
Arabic-speaking peoples made them think that the issue of such a
rebellion would be happy: and indicated its character and
method.</i><br>
<br>
<i>So they allowed it to begin, having obtained for it formal
assurances of help from the British Government. yet none the less
the rebellion of the Sherif of Mecca came to most as a surprise,
and found the allies unready. It aroused mixed feelings and made
strong friends and strong enemies, amid whose clashing jealousies
its affairs began to miscarry.</i>

<hr align="center" width="25%">

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<p>Some of the evil of my tale may have been inherent in our
circumstances. For years we lived anyhow with one another in the
naked desert, under the indifferent heaven. By day the hot sun
fermented us; and we were dizzied by the beating wind. At night we
were stained by dew, and shamed into pettiness by the innumerable
silences of stars. We were a self-centred army without parade or
gesture, devoted to freedom, the second of man's creeds, a purpose
so ravenous that it devoured all our strength, a hope so
transcendent that our earlier ambitions faded in its glare.</p>

<p>As time went by our need to fight for the ideal increased to an
unquestioning possession, riding with spur and rein over our
doubts. Willy-nilly it became a faith. We had sold ourselves into
its slavery, manacled ourselves together in its chain-gang, bowed
ourselves to serve its holiness with all our good and ill content.
The mentality of ordinary human slaves is terrible&mdash;they have
lost the world&mdash;and we had surrendered, not body alone, but
soul to the overmastering greed of victory. By our own act we were
drained of morality, of volition, of responsibility, like dead
leaves in the wind.</p>

<p>The everlasting battle stripped from us care of our own lives or
of others'. We had ropes about our necks, and on our heads prices
which showed that the enemy intended hideous tortures for us if we
were caught. Each day some of us passed; and the living knew
themselves just sentient puppets on God's stage: indeed, our
taskmaster was merciless, merciless, so long as our bruised feet
could stagger forward on the road. The weak envied those tired
enough to die; for success looked so remote, and failure a near and
certain, if sharp, release from toil. We lived always in the
stretch or sag of nerves, either on the crest or in the trough of
waves of feeling. This impotency was bitter to us, and made us live
only for the seen horizon, reckless what spite we inflicted or
endured, since physical sensation showed itself meanly transient.
Gusts of cruelty, perversions, lusts ran lightly over the surface
without troubling us; for the moral laws which had seemed to hedge
about these silly accidents must be yet fainter words. We had
learned that there were pangs too sharp, griefs too deep, ecstasies
too high for our finite selves to register. When emotion reached
this pitch the mind choked; and memory went white till the
circumstances were humdrum once more.</p>

<p>Such exaltation of thought, while it let adrift the spirit, and
gave it licence in strange airs, lost it the old patient rule over
the body. The body was too coarse to feel the utmost of our sorrows
and of our joys. Therefore, we abandoned it as rubbish: we left it
below us to march forward, a breathing simulacrum, on its own
unaided level, subject to influences from which in normal times our
instincts would have shrunk. The men were young and sturdy; and hot
flesh and blood unconsciously claimed a right in them and tormented
their bellies with strange longings. Our privations and dangers
fanned this virile heat, in a climate as racking as can be
conceived. We had no shut places to be alone in, no thick clothes
to hide our nature. Man in all things lived candidly with man.</p>

<p>The Arab was by nature continent; and the use of universal
marriage had nearly abolished irregular courses in his tribes. The
public women of the rare settlements we encountered in our months
of wandering would have been nothing to our numbers, even had their
raddled meat been palatable to a man of healthy parts. In horror of
such sordid commerce our youths began indifferently to slake one
another's few needs in their own clean bodies&mdash;a cold
convenience that, by comparison, seemed sexless and even pure.
Later, some began to justify this sterile process, and swore that
friends quivering together in the yielding sand with intimate hot
limbs in supreme embrace, found there hidden in the darkness a
sensual co-efficient of the mental passion which was welding our
souls and spirits in one flaming effort. Several, thirsting to
punish appetites they could not wholly prevent, took a savage pride
in degrading the body, and offered themselves fiercely in any habit
which promised physical pain or filth.</p>

<p>I was sent to these Arabs as a stranger, unable to think their
thoughts or subscribe their beliefs, but charged by duty to lead
them forward and to develop to the highest any movement of theirs
profitable to England in her war. If I could not assume their
character, I could at least conceal my own, and pass among them
without evident friction, neither a discord nor a critic but an
unnoticed influence. Since I was their fellow, I will not be their
apologist or advocate. To-day in my old garments, I could play the
bystander, obedient to the sensibilities of our theatre...but it is
more honest to record that these ideas and actions then passed
naturally. What now looks wanton or sadic seemed in the field
inevitable, or just unimportant routine.</p>

<p>Blood was always on our hands: we were licensed to it. Wounding
and killing seemed ephemeral pains, so very brief and sore was life
with us. With the sorrow of living so great, the sorrow of
punishment had to be pitiless. We lived for the day and died for
it. When there was reason and desire to punish we wrote our lesson
with gun or whip immediately in the sullen flesh of the sufferer,
and the case was beyond appeal. The desert did not afford the
refined slow penalties of courts and gaols.</p>

<p>Of course our rewards and pleasures were as suddenly sweeping as
our troubles; but, to me in particular, they bulked less large.
Bedouin ways were hard even for those brought up to them, and for
strangers terrible: a death in life. When the march or labour ended
I had no energy to record sensation, nor while it lasted any
leisure to see the spiritual loveliness which sometimes came upon
us by the way. In my notes, the cruel rather than the beautiful
found place. We no doubt enjoyed more the rare moments of peace and
forgetfulness; but I remember more the agony, the terrors, and the
mistakes. Our life is not summed up in what I have written (there
are things not to be repeated in cold blood for very shame); but
what I have written was in and of our life. Pray God that men
reading the story will not, for love of the glamour of strangeness,
go out to prostitute themselves and their talents in serving
another race.</p>

<p>A man who gives himself to be a possession of aliens leads a
Yahoo life, having bartered his soul to a brute-master. He is not
of them. He may stand against them, persuade himself of a mission,
batter and twist them into something which they, of their own
accord, would not have been. Then he is exploiting his old
environment to press them out of theirs. Or, after my model, he may
imitate them so well that they spuriously imitate him back again.
Then he is giving away his own environment: pretending to theirs;
and pretences are hollow, worthless things. In neither case does he
do a thing of himself, nor a thing so clean as to be his own
(without thought of conversion), letting them take what action or
reaction they please from the silent example.</p>

<p>In my case, the effort for these years to live in the dress of
Arabs, and to imitate their mental foundation, quitted me of my
English self, and let me look at the West and its conventions with
new eyes: they destroyed it all for me. At the same time I could
not sincerely take on the Arab skin: it was an affectation only.
Easily was a man made an infidel, but hardly might he be converted
to another faith. I had dropped one form and not taken on the
other, and was become like Mohammed's coffin in our legend, with a
resultant feeling of intense loneliness in life, and a contempt,
not for other men, but for all they do. Such detachment came at
times to a man exhausted by prolonged physical effort and
isolation. His body plodded on mechanically, while his reasonable
mind left him, and from without looked down critically on him,
wondering what that futile lumber did and why. Sometimes these
selves would converse in the void; and then madness was very near,
as I believe it would be near the man who could see things through
the veils at once of two customs, two educations, two

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<p>A first difficulty of the Arab movement was to say who the Arabs
were. Being a manufactured people, their name had been changing in
sense slowly year by year. Once it meant an Arabian. There was a
country called Arabia; but this was nothing to the point. There was
a language called Arabic; and in it lay the test. It was the
current tongue of Syria and Palestine, of Mesopotamia, and of the
great peninsula called Arabia on the map. Before the Moslem
conquest, these areas were inhabited by diverse peoples, speaking
languages of the Arabic family. We called them Semitic, but (as
with most scientific terms) incorrectly. However, Arabic, Assyrian,
Babylonian, Phoenician, Hebrew, Aramaic and Syriac were related
tongues; and indications of common influences in the past, or even
of a common origin, were strengthened by our knowledge that the
appearances and customs of the present Arabic-speaking peoples of
Asia, while as varied as a field&mdash;full of poppies, had an
equal and essential likeness. We might with perfect propriety call
them cousins&mdash;and cousins certainly, if sadly, aware of their
own relationship.</p>

<p>The Arabic-speaking areas of Asia in this sense were a rough
parallelogram. The northern side ran from Alexandretta, on the
Mediterranean, across Mesopotamia eastward to the Tigris. The south
side was the edge of the Indian Ocean, from Aden to Muscat. On the
west it was bounded by the Mediterranean, the Suez Canal, and the
Red Sea to Aden. On the east by the Tigris, and the Persian Gulf to
Muscat. This square of land, as large as India, formed the homeland
of our Semites, in which no foreign race had kept a permanent
footing, though Egyptians, Hittites, Philistines, Persians, Greeks,
Romans, Turks and Franks had variously tried. All had in the end
been broken, and their scattered elements drowned in the strong
characteristics of the Semitic race. Semites had sometimes pushed
outside this area, and themselves been drowned in the outer world.
Egypt, Algiers, Morocco, Malta, Sicily, Spain, Cilicia and France
absorbed and obliterated Semitic colonies. Only in Tripoli of
Africa, and in the everlasting miracle of Jewry, had distant
Semites kept some of their identity and force.</p>

<p>The origin of these peoples was an academic question; but for
the understanding of their revolt their present social and
political differences were important, and could only be grasped by
looking at their geography. This continent of theirs fell into
certain great regions, whose gross physical diversities imposed
varying habits on the dwellers in them. On the west the
parallelogram was framed, from Alexandretta to Aden, by a mountain
belt, called (in the north) Syria, and thence progressively
southward called Palestine, Midian, Hejaz, and lastly Yemen. It had
an average height of perhaps three thousand feet, with peaks of ten
to twelve thousand feet. It faced west, was well watered with rain
and cloud from the sea, and in general was fully peopled.</p>

<p>Another range of inhabited hills, facing the Indian Ocean, was
the south edge of the parallelogram. The eastern frontier was at
first an alluvial plain called Mesopotamia, but south of Basra a
level littoral, called Kuweit, and Hasa, to Gattar. Much of this
plain was peopled. These inhabited hills and plains framed a gulf
of thirsty desert, in whose heart was an archipelago of watered and
populous oases called Kasim and Aridh. In this group of oases lay
the true centre of Arabia, the preserve of its native spirit, and
its most conscious individuality. The desert lapped it round and
kept it pure of contact.</p>

<p>The desert which performed this great function around the oases,
and so made the character of Arabia, varied in nature. South of the
oases it appeared to be a pathless sea of sand, stretching nearly
to the populous escarpment of the Indian Ocean shore, shutting it
out from Arabian history, and from all influence on Arabian morals
and politics. Hadhramaut, as they called this southern coast,
formed part of the history of the Dutch Indies; and its thought
swayed Java rather than Arabia. To the west of the oases, between
them and the Hejaz hills, was the Nejd desert, an area of gravel
and lava, with little sand in it. To the east of these oases,
between them and Kuweit, spread a similar expanse of gravel, but
with some great stretches of soft sand, making the road difficult.
To the north of the oases lay a belt of sand, and then an immense
gravel and lava plain, filling up everything between the eastern
edge of Syria and the banks of the Euphrates where Mesopotamia
began. The practicability of this northern desert for men and
motor-cars enabled the Arab revolt to win its ready success.</p>

<p>The hills of the west and the plains of the east were the parts
of Arabia always most populous and active. In particular on the
west, the mountains of Syria and Palestine, of Hejaz and Yemen,
entered time and again into the current of our European life.
Ethically, these fertile healthy hills were in Europe, not in Asia,
just as the Arabs looked always to the Mediterranean, not to the
Indian Ocean, for their cultural sympathies, for their enterprises,
and particularly for their expansions, since the migration problem
was the greatest and most complex force in Arabia, and general to
it, however it might vary in the different Arabic districts.</p>

<p>In the north (Syria) the birth rate was low in the cities and
the death rate high, because of the insanitary conditions and the
hectic life led by the majority. Consequently the surplus peasantry
found openings in the towns, and were there swallowed up. In the
Lebanon, where sanitation had been improved, a greater exodus of
youth took place to America each year, threatening (for the first
time since Greek days) to change the outlook of an entire
district.</p>

<p>In Yemen the solution was different. There was no foreign trade,
and no massed industries to accumulate population in unhealthy
places. The towns were just market towns, as clean and simple as
ordinary villages. Therefore the population slowly increased; the
scale of living was brought down very low; and a congestion of
numbers was generally felt. They could not emigrate overseas; for
the Sudan was even worse country than Arabia, and the few tribes
which did venture across were compelled to modify their manner of
life and their Semitic culture profoundly, in order to exist. They
could not move northward along the hills; for these were barred by
the holy town of Mecca and its port Jidda: an alien belt,
continually reinforced by strangers from India and Java and Bokhara
and Africa, very strong in vitality, violently hostile to the
Semitic consciousness, and maintained despite economics and
geography and climate by the artificial factor of a world-religion.
The congestion of Yemen, therefore, becoming extreme, found its
only relief in the east, by forcing the weaker aggregations of its
border down and down the slopes of the hills along the Widian, the
half-waste district of the great water-bearing valleys of Bisha,
Dawasir, Ranya and Taraba, which ran out towards the deserts of
Nejd. These weaker clans had continually to exchange good springs
and fertile palms for poorer springs and scantier palms, till at
last they reached an area where a proper agricultural life became
impossible. They then began to eke out their precarious husbandry
by breeding sheep and camels, and in time came to depend more and
more on these herds for their living.</p>

<p>Finally, under a last impulse from the straining population
behind them, the border people (now almost wholly pastoral), were
flung out of the furthest crazy oasis into the untrodden wilderness
as nomads. This process, to be watched to-day with individual
families and tribes to whose marches an exact name and date might
be put, must have been going on since the first day of full
settlement of Yemen. The Widian below Mecca and Taif are crowded
with the memories and place-names of half a hundred tribes which
have gone from there, and may be found to-day in Nejd, in Jebel
Sham-mar, in the Hamad, even on the frontiers of Syria and
Mesopotamia. There was the source of migration, the factory of
nomads, the springing of the gulf-stream of desert wanderers.</p>

<p>For the people of the desert were as little static as the people
of the hills. The economic life of the desert was based on the
supply of camels, which were best bred on the rigorous upland
pastures with their strong nutritive thorns. By this industry the
Bedouins lived; and it in turn moulded their life, apportioned the
tribal areas, and kept the clans revolving through their rote of
spring, summer and winter pasturages, as the herds cropped the
scanty growths of each in turn. The camel markets in Syria,
Mesopotamia, and Egypt determined the population which the deserts
could support, and regulated strictly their standard of living. So
the desert likewise overpeopled itself upon occasion; and then
there were heavings and thrustings of the crowded tribes as they
elbowed themselves by natural courses towards the light. They might
not go south towards the inhospitable sand or sea. They could not
turn west; for there the steep hills of Hejaz were thickly lined by
mountain peoples taking full advantage of their defensiveness.
Sometimes they went towards the central oases of Aridh and Kasim,
and, if the tribes looking for new homes were strong and vigorous,
might succeed in occupying parts of them. If, however, the desert
had not this strength, its peoples were pushed gradually north, up
between Medina of the Hejaz and Kasim of Nejd, till they found
themselves at the fork of two roads. They could strike eastward, by
Wadi Rumh or Jebel Sham-mar, to follow eventually the Batn to
Shamiya, where they would become riverine Arabs of the Lower
Euphrates; or they could climb, by slow degrees, the ladder of
western oases&mdash;Henakiya, Kheibar, Teima, Jauf, and the
Sirhan&mdash;till fate saw them nearing Jebel Druse, in Syria, or
watering their herds about Tadmor of the northern desert, on their
way to Aleppo or Assyria.</p>

<p>Nor then did the pressure cease: the inexorable trend northward
continued. The tribes found themselves driven to the very edge of
cultivation in Syria or Mesopotamia. Opportunity and their bellies
persuaded them of the advantages of possessing goats, and then of
possessing sheep; and lastly they began to sow, if only a little
barley for their animals. They were now no longer Bedouin, and
began to suffer like the villagers from the ravages of the nomads
behind. Insensibly, they made common cause with the peasants
already on the soil, and found out that they, too, were peasantry.
So we see clans, born in the highlands of Yemen, thrust by stronger
clans into the desert, where, unwillingly, they became nomad to
keep themselves alive. We see them wandering, every year moving a
little further north or a little further east as chance has sent
them down one or other of the well-roads of the wilderness, till
finally this pressure drives them from the desert again into the
sown, with the like unwillingness of their first shrinking
experiment in nomad life. This was the circulation which kept
vigour in the Semitic body. There were few, if indeed there was a
single northern Semite, whose ancestors had not at some dark age
passed through the desert. The mark of nomadism, that most deep and
biting social discipline, was on each of them in his degree.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<p>If tribesman and townsman in Arabic-speaking Asia were not
different races, but just men in different social and economic
stages, a family resemblance might be expected in the working of
their minds, and so it was only reasonable that common elements
should appear in the product of all these peoples. In the very
outset, at the first meeting with them, was found a universal
clearness or hardness of belief, almost mathematical in its
limitation, and repellent in its unsympathetic form. Semites had no
half-tones in their register of vision. They were a people of
primary colours, or rather of black and white, who saw the world
always in contour. They were a dogmatic people, despising doubt,
our modern crown of thorns. They did not understand our
metaphysical difficulties, our introspective questionings. They
knew only truth and untruth, belief and unbelief, without our
hesitating retinue of finer shades.</p>

<p>This people was black and white, not only in vision, but by
inmost furnishing: black and white not merely in clarity, but in
apposition. Their thoughts were at ease only in extremes. They
inhabited superlatives by choice. Sometimes inconsistents seemed to
possess them at once in joint sway; but they never compromised:
they pursued the logic of several incompatible opinions to absurd
ends, without perceiving the incongruity. With cool head and
tranquil judgement, imperturbably unconscious of the flight, they
oscillated from asymptote to asymptote.*</p>

<p>They were a limited, narrow-minded people, whose inert
intellects lay fallow in incurious resignation. Their imaginations
were vivid, but not creative. There was so little Arab art in Asia
that they could almost be said to have had no art, though their
classes were liberal patrons, and had encouraged whatever talents
in architecture, or ceramics, or other handicraft their neighbours
and helots displayed. Nor did they handle great industries: they
had no organizations of mind or body. They invented no systems of
philosophy, no complex mythologies. They steered their course
between the idols of the tribe and of the cave. The least morbid of
peoples, they had accepted the gift of life unquestioningly, as
axiomatic. To them it was a thing inevitable, entailed on man, a
usufruct, beyond control. Suicide was a thing impossible, and death
no grief.</p>

<p>They were a people of spasms, of upheavals, of ideas, the race
of the individual genius. Their movements were the more shocking by
contrast with the quietude of every day, their great men greater by
contrast with the humanity of their mob. Their convictions were by
instinct, their activities intuitional. Their largest manufacture
was of creeds: almost they were monopolists of revealed religions.
Three of these efforts had endured among them: two of the three had
also borne export (in modified forms) to non-Semitic peoples.
Christianity, translated into the diverse spirits of Greek and
Latin and Teutonic tongues, had conquered Europe and America. Islam
in various transformations was subjecting Africa and parts of Asia.
These were Semitic successes. Their failures they kept to
themselves. The fringes of their deserts were strewn with broken
faiths.</p>

<p>It was significant that this wrack of fallen religions lay about
the meeting of the desert and the sown. It pointed to the
generation of all these creeds. They were assertions, not
arguments; so they required a prophet to set them forth. The Arabs
said there had been forty thousand prophets: we had record of at
least some hundreds. None of them had been of the wilderness; but
their lives were after a pattern. Their birth set them in crowded
places. An unintelligible passionate yearning drove them out into
the desert. There they lived a greater or lesser time in meditation
and physical abandonment; and thence they returned with their
imagined message articulate, to preach it to their old, and now
doubting, associates. The founders of the three great creeds
fulfilled this cycle: their possible coincidence was proved a law
by the parallel life-histories of the myriad others, the
unfortunate who failed, whom we might judge of no less true
profession, but for whom time and disillusion had not heaped up dry
souls ready to be set on fire. To the thinkers of the town the
impulse into Nitria had ever been irresistible, not probably that
they found God dwelling there, but that in its solitude they heard
more certainly the living word they brought with them.</p>

<p>The common base of all the Semitic creeds, winners or losers,
was the ever present idea of world-worthlessness. Their profound
reaction from matter led them to preach bareness, renunciation,
poverty; and the atmosphere of this invention stifled the minds of
the desert pitilessly. A first knowledge of their sense of the
purity of rarefaction was given me in early years, when we had
ridden far out over the rolling plains of North Syria to a ruin of
the Roman period which the Arabs believed was made by a prince of
the border as a desert-palace for his queen. The clay of its
building was said to have been kneaded for greater richness, not
with water, but with the precious essential oils of flowers. My
guides, sniffing the air like dogs, led me from crumbling room to
room, saying, 'This is jessamine, this violet, this rose'.</p>

<p>But at last Dahoum drew me: 'Come and smell the very sweetest
scent of all', and we went into the main lodging, to the gaping
window sockets of its eastern face, and there drank with open
mouths of the effortless, empty, eddyless wind of the desert,
throbbing past. That slow breath had been born somewhere beyond the
distant Euphrates and had dragged its way across many days and
nights of dead grass, to its first obstacle, the man-made walls of
our broken palace. About them it seemed to fret and linger,
murmuring in baby-speech. 'This,' they told me, 'is the best: it
has no taste.' My Arabs were turning their backs on perfumes and
luxuries to choose the things in which mankind had had no share or
part.</p>

<p>The Beduin of the desert, born and grown up in it, had embraced
with all his soul this nakedness too harsh for volunteers, for the
reason, felt but inarticulate, that there he found himself
indubitably free. He lost material ties, comforts, all
superfluities and other complications to achieve a personal liberty
which haunted starvation and death. He saw no virtue in poverty
herself: he enjoyed the little vices and luxuries&mdash;coffee,
fresh water, women&mdash;which he could still preserve. In his life
he had air and winds, sun and light, open spaces and a great
emptiness. There was no human effort, no fecundity in Nature: just
the heaven above and the unspotted earth beneath. There
unconsciously he came near God. God was to him not anthropomorphic,
not tangible, not moral nor ethical, not concerned with the world
or with him, not natural: but the being [GREEK-see image 'Greek
image 1' below], thus qualified not by divestiture but by
investiture, a comprehending Being, the egg of all activity, with
nature and matter just a glass reflecting Him.</p>

<p>The Beduin could not look for God within him: he was too sure
that he was within God. He could not conceive anything which was or
was not God, Who alone was great; yet there was a homeliness, an
everyday-ness of this climatic Arab God, who was their eating and
their fighting and their lusting, the commonest of their thoughts,
their familiar resource and companion, in a way impossible to those
whose God is so wistfully veiled from them by despair of their
carnal unworthiness of Him and by the decorum of formal worship.
Arabs felt no incongruity in bringing God into the weaknesses and
appetites of their least creditable causes. He was the most
familiar of their words; and indeed we lost much eloquence when
making Him the shortest and ugliest of our monosyllables.</p>

<p>This creed of the desert seemed inexpressible in words, and
indeed in thought. It was easily felt as an influence, and those
who went into the desert long enough to forget its open spaces and
its emptiness were inevitably thrust upon God as the only refuge
and rhythm of being. The Bedawi might be a nominal Sunni, or a
nominal Wahabi, or anything else in the Semitic compass, and he
would take it very lightly, a little in the manner of the watchmen
at Zion's gate who drank beer and laughed in Zion because they were
Zionists. Each individual nomad had his revealed religion, not oral
or traditional or expressed, but instinctive in himself; and so we
got all the Semitic creeds with (in character and essence) a stress
on the emptiness of the world and the fullness of God; and
according to the power and opportunity of the believer was the
expression of them.</p>

<p>The desert dweller could not take credit for his belief. He had
never been either evangelist or proselyte. He arrived at this
intense condensation of himself in God by shutting his eyes to the
world, and to all the complex possibilities latent in him which
only contact with wealth and temptations could bring forth. He
attained a sure trust and a powerful trust, but of how narrow a
field! His sterile experience robbed him of compassion and
perverted his human kindness to the image of the waste in which he
hid. Accordingly he hurt himself, not merely to be free, but to
please himself. There followed a delight in pain, a cruelty which
was more to him than goods. The desert Arab found no joy like the
joy of voluntarily holding back. He found luxury in abnegation,
renunciation, self restraint. He made nakedness of the mind as
sensuous as nakedness of the body. He saved his own soul, perhaps,
and without danger, but in a hard selfishness. His desert was made
a spiritual ice-house, in which was preserved intact but unimproved
for all ages a vision of the unity of God. To it sometimes the
seekers from the outer world could escape for a season and look
thence in detachment at the nature of the generation they would
convert.</p>

<p>This faith of the desert was impossible in the towns. It was at
once too strange, too simple, too impalpable for export and common
use. The idea, the ground-belief of all Semitic creeds was waiting
there, but it had to be diluted to be made comprehensible to us.
The scream of a bat was too shrill for many ears: the desert spirit
escaped through our coarser texture. The prophets returned from the
desert with their glimpse of God, and through their stained medium
(as through a dark glass) showed something of the majesty and
brilliance whose full vision would blind, deafen, silence us, serve
us as it had served the Beduin, setting him uncouth, a man
apart.</p>

<p>The disciples, in the endeavour to strip themselves and their
neighbours of all things according to the Master's word, stumbled
over human weaknesses and failed. To live, the villager or townsman
must fill himself each day with the pleasures of acquisition and
accumulation, and by rebound off circumstance become the grossest
and most material of men. The shining contempt of life which led
others into the barest asceticism drove him to despair. He
squandered himself heedlessly, as a spendthrift: ran through his
inheritance of flesh in hasty longing for the end. The Jew in the
Metropole at Brighton, the miser, the worshipper of Adonis, the
lecher in the stews of Damascus were alike signs of the Semitic
capacity for enjoyment, and expressions of the same nerve which
gave us at the other pole the self-denial of the Essenes, or the
early Christians, or the first Khalifas, finding the way to heaven
fairest for the poor in spirit. The Semite hovered between lust and
self-denial.</p>

<p>Arabs could be swung on an idea as on a cord; for the unpledged
allegiance of their minds made them obedient servants. None of them
would escape the bond till success had come, and with it
responsibility and duty and engagements. Then the idea was gone and
the work ended&mdash;in ruins. Without a creed they could be taken
to the four corners of the world (but not to heaven) by being shown
the riches of earth and the pleasures of it; but if on the road,
led in this fashion, they met the prophet of an idea, who had
nowhere to lay his head and who depended for his food on charity or
birds, then they would all leave their wealth for his inspiration.
They were incorrigibly children of the idea, feckless and
colour-blind, to whom body and spirit were for ever and inevitably
opposed. Their mind was strange and dark, full of depressions and
exaltations, lacking in rule, but with more of ardour and more
fertile in belief than any other in the world. They were a people
of starts, for whom the abstract was the strongest motive, the
process of infinite courage and variety, and the end nothing. They
were as unstable as water, and like water would perhaps finally
prevail. Since the dawn of life, in successive waves they had been
dashing themselves against the coasts of flesh. Each wave was
broken, but, like the sea, wore away ever so little of the granite
on which it failed, and some day, ages yet, might roll unchecked
over the place where the material world had been, and God would
move upon the face of those waters. One such wave (and not the
least) I raised and rolled before the breath of an idea, till it
reached its crest, and toppled over and fell at Damascus. The wash
of that wave, thrown back by the resistance of vested things, will
provide the matter of the following wave, when in fullness of time
the sea shall be raised once more.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p>The first great rush round the Mediterranean had shown the world
the power of an excited Arab for a short spell of intense physical
activity; but when the effort burned out the lack of endurance and
routine in the Semitic mind became as evident. The provinces they
had overrun they neglected, out of sheer distaste of system, and
had to seek the help of their conquered subjects, or of more
vigorous foreigners, to administer their ill-knit and inchoate
empires. So, early in the Middle Ages, the Turks found a footing in
the Arab States, first as servants, then as helpers, and then as a
parasite growth which choked the life out of the old body politic.
The last phase was of enmity, when the Hulagus or Timurs sated
their blood lust, burning and destroying everything which irked
them with a pretension of superiority.</p>

<p>Arab civilizations had been of an abstract nature, moral and
intellectual rather than applied; and their lack of public spirit
made their excellent private qualities futile. They were fortunate
in their epoch: Europe had fallen barbarous; and the memory of
Greek and Latin learning was fading from men's minds. By contrast
the imitative exercise of the Arabs seemed cultured, their mental
activity progressive, their state prosperous. They had performed
real service in preserving something of a classical past for a
mediaeval future.</p>

<p>With the coming of the Turks this happiness became a dream. By
stages the Semites of Asia passed under their yoke, and found it a
slow death. Their goods were stripped from them; and their spirits
shrivelled in the numbing breath of a military Government. Turkish
rule was gendarme rule, and Turkish political theory as crude as
its practice. The Turks taught the Arabs that the interests of a
sect were higher than those of patriotism: that the petty concerns
of the province were more than nationality. They led them by subtle
dissensions to distrust one another. Even the Arabic language was
banished from courts and offices, from the Government service, and
from superior schools. Arabs might only serve the State by
sacrifice of their racial characteristics. These measures were not
accepted quietly. Semitic tenacity showed itself in the many
rebellions of Syria, Mesopotamia and Arabia against the grosser
forms of Turkish penetration; and resistance was also made to the
more insidious attempts at absorption. The Arabs would not give up
their rich and flexible tongue for crude Turkish: instead, they
filled Turkish with Arabic words, and held to the treasures of
their own literature.</p>

<p>They lost their geographical sense, and their racial and
political and historical memories; but they clung the more tightly
to their language, and erected it almost into a fatherland of its
own. The first duty of every Moslem was to study the Koran, the
sacred book of Islam, and incidentally the greatest Arab literary
monument. The knowledge that this religion was his own, and that
only he was perfectly qualified to understand and practise it, gave
every Arab a standard by which to judge the banal achievements of
the Turk.</p>

<p>Then came the Turkish revolution, the fall of Abdul Hamid, and
the supremacy of the Young Turks. The horizon momentarily broadened
for the Arabs. The Young-Turk movement was a revolt against the
hierarchic conception of Islam and the pan-Islamic theories of the
old Sultan, who had aspired, by making himself spiritual director
of the Moslem world, to be also (beyond appeal) its director in
temporal affairs. These young politicians rebelled and threw him
into prison, under the impulse of constitutional theories of a
sovereign state. So, at a time when Western Europe was just
beginning to climb out of nationality into internationality, and to
rumble with wars far removed from problems of race, Western Asia
began to climb out of Catholicism into nationalist politics, and to
dream of wars for self-government and self-sovereignty, instead of
for faith or dogma. This tendency had broken out first and most
strongly in the Near East, in the little Balkan States, and had
sustained them through an almost unparalleled martyrdom to their
goal of separation from Turkey. Later there had been nationalist
movements in Egypt, in India, in Persia, and finally in
Constantinople, where they were fortified and made pointed by the
new American ideas in education: ideas which, when released in the
old high Oriental atmosphere, made an explosive mixture. The
American schools, teaching by the method of inquiry, encouraged
scientific detachment and free exchange of views. Quite without
intention they taught revolution, since it was impossible for an
individual to be modern in Turkey and at the same time loyal, if he
had been born of one of the subject races&mdash;Greeks, Arabs,
Kurds, Armenians or Albanians&mdash;over whom the Turks were so
long helped to keep dominion.</p>

<p>The Young Turks, in the confidence of their first success, were
carried away by the logic of their principles, and as protest
against Pan-Islam preached Ottoman brotherhood. The gullible
subject races&mdash;far more numerous than the Turks
themselves&mdash;believed that they were called upon to co-operate
in building a new East. Rushing to die task (full of Herbert
Spencer and Alexander Hamilton) they laid down platforms of
sweeping ideas, and hailed the Turks as partners. The Turks,
terrified at the forces they had let loose, drew the fires as
suddenly as they had stoked them. Turkey made Turkish for the
Turks&mdash;<i>Yeni-Turan</i>&mdash;became the cry. Later on, this
policy would turn them towards the rescue of their
irredenti&mdash;the Turkish populations subject to Russia in
Central Asia; but, first of all, they must purge their Empire of
such irritating subject races as resisted the ruling stamp. The
Arabs, the largest alien component of Turkey, must first be dealt
with. Accordingly the Arab deputies were scattered, the Arab
societies forbidden, the Arab notables proscribed. Arabic
manifestations and the Arabic language were suppressed by Enver
Pasha more sternly than by Abdul Hamid before him.</p>

<p>However, the Arabs had tasted freedom: they could not change
their ideas as quickly as their conduct; and the staffer spirits
among them were not easily to be put down. They read the Turkish
papers, putting 'Arab' for Turk' in the patriotic exhortations.
Suppression charged them with unhealthy violence. Deprived of
constitutional outlets they became revolutionary. The Arab
societies went underground, and changed from liberal clubs into
conspiracies. The Akhua, the Arab mother society, was publicly
dissolved. It was replaced in Mesopotamia by the dangerous Ahad, a
very secret brotherhood, limited almost entirely to Arab officers
in the Turkish Army, who swore to acquire the military knowledge of
their masters, and to turn it against them, in the service of the
Arab people, when the moment of rebellion came.</p>

<p>It was a large society, with a sure base in the wild part of
Southern Irak, where Sayid Taleb, the young John Wilkes of the Arab
movement, held the power in his unprincipled fingers. To it
belonged seven out of every ten Mesopotamian-born officers; and
their counsel was so well kept that members of it held high command
in Turkey to the last. When the crash came, and Allenby rode across
Armageddon and Turkey fell, one vice-president of the society was
commanding the broken fragments of the Palestine armies on the
retreat, and another was directing the Turkish forces across-Jordan
in the Amman area. Yet later, after the armistice, great places in
the Turkish service were still held by men ready to turn on their
masters at a word from their Arab leaders. To most of them the word
was never given; for those societies were pro-Arab only, willing to
fight for nothing but Arab independence; and they could see no
advantage in supporting the Allies rather than the Turks, since
they did not believe our assurances that we would leave them free.
Indeed, many of them preferred an Arabia united by Turkey in
miserable subjection, to an Arabia divided up and slothful under
the easier control of several European powers in spheres of
influence.</p>

<p>Greater than the Ahad was the Fetah, the society of freedom in
Syria. The landowners, the writers, the doctors, the great public
servants linked themselves in this society with a common oath,
passwords, signs, a press and a central treasury, to ruin the
Turkish Empire. With the noisy facility of the Syrian&mdash;an
ape-like people having much of the Japanese quickness, but
shallow&mdash;they speedily built up a formidable organization.
They looked outside for help, and expected freedom to come by
entreaty, not by sacrifice. They corresponded with Egypt, with the
Ahad (whose members, with true Mesopotamian dourness, rather
despised them), with the Sherif of Mecca, and with Great Britain:
everywhere seeking the ally to serve their turn. They also were
deadly secret; and the Government, though it suspected their
existence, could find no credible evidence of their leaders or
membership. It had to hold its hand until it could strike with
evidence enough to satisfy the English and French diplomats who
acted as modern public opinion in Turkey. The war in 1914 withdrew
these agents, and left the Turkish Government free to strike.</p>

<p>Mobilization put all power into the hands of those
members&mdash;Enver, Talaat and Jemal&mdash;who were at once the
most ruthless, the most logical, and the most ambitious of the
Young Turks. They set themselves to stamp out all non-Turkish
currents in the State, especially Arab and Armenian nationalism.
For the first step they found a specious and convenient weapon in
the secret papers of a French Consul in Syria, who left behind him
in his Consulate copies of correspondence (about Arab freedom)
which had passed between him and an Arab club, not connected with
the Fetah but made up of the more talkative and less formidable
<i>intelligenzia</i> of the Syrian coast. The Turks, of course,
were delighted; for 'colonial' aggression in North Africa had given
the French a black reputation in the Arabic-speaking Moslem world;
and it served Jemal well to show his co-religionists that these
Arab nationalists were infidel enough to prefer France to
Turkey.</p>

<p>In Syria, of course, his disclosures had little novelty; but the
members of the society were known and respected, if somewhat
academic, persons; and their arrest and condemnation, and the crop
of deportations, exiles, and executions to which their trial led,
moved the country to its depths, and taught the Arabs of the Fetah
that if they did not profit by their lesson, the fate of the
Armenians would be upon them. The Armenians had been well armed and
organized; but their leaders had failed them. They had been
disarmed and destroyed piecemeal, the men by massacre, the women
and children by being driven and overdriven along the wintry roads
into the desert, naked and hungry, the common prey of any
passer-by, until death took them. The Young Turks had killed the
Armenians, not because they were Christians, but because they were
Armenians; and for the same reason they herded Arab Moslems and
Arab Christians into the same prison, and hanged them together on
the same scaffold. Jemal Pasha united all classes, conditions and
creeds in Syria, under pressure of a common misery and peril, and
so made a concerted revolt possible.</p>

<p>The Turks suspected the Arab officers and soldiers in the Army,
and hoped to use against them the scattering tactics which had
served against the Armenians. At first transport difficulties stood
in their way; and there came a dangerous concentration of Arab
divisions (nearly one third of the original Turkish Army was Arabic
speaking) in North Syria early in 1915. They broke these up when
possible, marching them off to Europe, to the Dardanelles, to the
Caucasus, or the Canal&mdash;anywhere, so long as they were put
quickly into the firing-line, or withdrawn far from the sight and
help of their compatriots. A Holy War was proclaimed to give the
'Union and Progress' banner something of the traditional sanctity
of the Caliph's battle-order in the eyes of the old clerical
elements; and the Sherif of Mecca was invited&mdash;or rather
ordered&mdash;to echo the cry.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<p>The position of the Sherif of Mecca had long been anomalous. The
title of 'Sherif implied descent from the prophet Mohammed through
his daughter Fatima, and Hassan, her elder son. Authentic Sherifs
were inscribed on the family tree&mdash;an immense roll preserved
at Mecca, in custody of the Emir of Mecca, the elected Sherif of
Sherifs, supposed to be the senior and noblest of all. The
prophet's family had held temporal rule in Mecca for the last nine
hundred years, and counted some two thousand persons.</p>

<p>The old Ottoman Governments regarded this clan of manticratic
peers with a mixture of reverence and distrust. Since they were too
strong to be destroyed, the Sultan salved his dignity by solemnly
confirming their Emir in place. This empty approval acquired
dignity by lapse of time, until the new holder began to feel that
it added a final seal to his election. At last the Turks found that
they needed the Hejaz under their unquestioned sway as part of the
stage furniture for their new pan-Islamic notion. The fortuitous
opening of the Suez Canal enabled them to garrison the Holy Cities.
They projected the Hejaz Railway, and increased Turkish influence
among the tribes by money, intrigue, and armed expeditions.</p>

<p>As the Sultan grew stronger there he ventured to assert himself
more and more alongside the Sherif, even in Mecca itself, and upon
occasion ventured to depose a Sherif too magnificent for his views,
and to appoint a successor from a rival family of the clan in hopes
of winning the usual advantages from dissension. Finally, Abdul
Hamid took away some of the family to Constantinople into
honourable captivity. Amongst these was Hussein ibn Ali, the future
ruler, who was held a prisoner for nearly eighteen years. He took
the opportunity to provide his sons&mdash;Ali, Abdulla, Feisal, and
Zeid&mdash;with the modern education and experience which
afterwards enabled them to lead the Arab armies to success.</p>

<p>When Abdul Hamid fell, the less wily Young Turks reversed his
policy and sent back Sherif Hussein to Mecca as Emir. He at once
set to work unobtrusively to restore the power of the Emirate, and
strengthened himself on the old basis, keeping the while close and
friendly touch with Constantinople through his sons Abdulla,
vice-chairman of the Turkish House, and Feisal, member for Jidda.
They kept him informed of political opinion in the capital until
war broke out, when they returned in haste to Mecca.</p>

<p>The outbreak of war made trouble in the Hejaz. The pilgrimage
ceased, and with it the revenues and business of the Holy Cities.
There was reason to fear that the Indian food-ships would cease to
come (since the Sherif became technically an enemy subject); and as
the province produced almost no food of its own, it would be
precariously dependent on the goodwill of the Turks, who might
starve it by closing the Hejaz Railway. Hussein had never been
entirely at the Turks' mercy before; and at this unhappy moment
they particularly needed his adherence to their 'Jehad', the Holy
War of all Moslems against Christianity.</p>

<p>To become popularly effective this must be endorsed by Mecca;
and if endorsed it might plunge the East in blood. Hussein was
honourable, shrewd, obstinate and deeply pious. He felt that the
Holy War was doctrinally incompatible with an aggressive war, and
absurd with a Christian ally: Germany. So he refused the Turkish
demand, and made at the same time a dignified appeal to the Allies
not to starve his province for what was in no way his people's
fault. The Turks in reply at once instituted a partial blockade of
the Hejaz by controlling the traffic on the pilgrim railway. The
British left his coast open to specially-regulated food
vessels.</p>

<p>The Turkish demand was, however, not the only one which the
Sherif received. In January 1915, Yisin, head of the Mesopotamian
officers, Ali Riza, head of the Damascus officers, and Abd el Ghani
el Areisi, for the Syrian civilians, sent down to him a concrete
proposal for a military mutiny in Syria against the Turks. The
oppressed people of Mesopotamia and Syria, the committees of the
Ahad and the Fetah, were calling out to him as the Father of the
Arabs, the Moslem of Moslems, their greatest prince, their oldest
notable, to save them from the sinister designs of Talaat and
Jemal.</p>

<p>Hussein, as politician, as prince, as moslem, as modernist, and
as nationalist, was forced to listen to their appeal. He sent
Feisal, his third son, to Damascus, to discuss their projects as
his representative, and to make a report. He sent Ali, his eldest
son, to Medina, with orders to raise quietly, on any excuse he
pleased, troops from villagers and tribesmen of the Hejaz, and to
hold them ready for action if Feisal called. Abdulla, his politic
second son, was to sound the British by letter, to learn what would
be their attitude towards a possible Arab revolt against
Turkey.</p>

<p>Feisal reported in January 1915, that local conditions were
good, but that the general war was not going well for their hopes.
In Damascus were three divisions of Arab troops ready for
rebellion. In Aleppo two other divisions, riddled with Arab
nationalism, were sure to join in if the others began. There was
only one Turkish division this side of the Taurus, so that it was
certain that the rebels would get possession of Syria at the first
effort. On the other hand, public opinion was less ready for
extreme measures, and the military class quite sure that Germany
would win the war and win it soon. If, however, the Allies landed
their Australian Expedition (preparing in Egypt) at Alexandretta,
and so covered the Syrian flank, then it would be wise and safe to
risk a final German victory and the need to make a previous
separate peace with the Turks.</p>

</p>

<p>Delay followed, as the Allies went to the Dardanelles, and not
to Alexandretta. Feisal went after them to get first-hand knowledge
of Gallipoli conditions, since a breakdown of Turkey would be the
Arab signal. Then followed stagnation through the months of the
Dardanelles campaign. In that slaughter-house the remaining Ottoman
first-line army was destroyed. The disaster to Turkey of the
accumulated losses was so great that Feisal came back to Syria,
judging it a possible moment in which to strike, but found that
meanwhile the local situation had become unfavourable.</p>

<p>His Syrian supporters were under arrest or in hiding, and their
friends being hanged in scores on political charges. He found the
well-disposed Arab divisions either exiled to distant fronts, or
broken up in drafts and distributed among Turkish units. The Arab
peasantry were in the grip of Turkish military service, and Syria
prostrate before the merciless Jemal Pasha. His assets had
disappeared. He wrote to his father counselling further delay, till
England should be ready and Turkey in extremities. Unfortunately,
England was in a deplorable condition. Her forces were falling back
shattered from the Dardanelles. The slow-drawn agony of Kut was in
its last stage; and the Senussi rising, coincident with the entry
of Bulgaria, threatened her on new flanks.</p>

<p>Feisal's position was hazardous in the extreme. He was at the
mercy of the members of the secret society, whose president he had
been before the war. He had to live as the guest of Jemal Pasha, in
Damascus, rubbing up his military knowledge; for his brother Ali
was raising the troops in Hejaz on the pretext that he and Feisal
would lead them against the Suez Canal to help the Turks. So
Feisal, as a good Ottoman and officer in the Turkish service, had
to live at headquarters, and endure acquiescingly the insults and
indignities heaped upon his race by the bully Jemal in his
cups.</p>

<p>Jemal would send for Feisal and take him to the hanging of his
Syrian friends. These victims of justice dared not show that they
knew Feisal's real hopes, any more than he dared show his mind by
word or look, since disclosure would have condemned his family and
perhaps their race to the same fate. Only once did he burst out
that these executions would cost Jemal all that he was trying to
avoid; and it took the intercessions of his Constantinople friends,
chief men in Turkey, to save him from the price of these rash
words.</p>

<p>Feisal's correspondence with his father was an adventure in
itself. They communicated by means of old retainers of the family,
men above suspicion, who went up and down the Hejaz Railway,
carrying letters in sword-hilts, in cakes, sewn between the soles
of sandals, or in invisible writings on the wrappers of harmless
packages. In all of them Feisal reported unfavourable things, and
begged his father to postpone action till a wiser time.</p>

<p>Hussein, however, was not a whit cast down by Emir Feisal's
discouragements. The Young Turks in his eyes were so many godless
transgressors of their creed and their human duty&mdash;traitors to
the spirit of the time, and to the higher interests of Islam.
Though an old man of sixty-five, he was cheerfully determined to
wage war against them, relying upon justice to cover the cost.
Hussein trusted so much in God that he let his military sense lie
fallow, and thought Hejaz able to fight it out with Turkey on a
fair field. So he sent Abd el Kader el Abdu to Feisal with a letter
that all was now ready for inspection by him in Medina before the
troops started for the front Feisal informed Jemal, and asked leave
to go down, but, to his dismay, Jemal replied that Enver Pasha, the
Generalissimo, was on his way to the province, and that they would
visit Medina together and inspect them. Feisal had planned to raise
his father's crimson banner as soon as he arrived in Medina, and so
to take the Turks unawares; and here he was going to be saddled
with two uninvited guests to whom, by the Arab law of hospitality,
he could do no harm, and who would probably delay his action so
long that the whole secret of the revolt would be in jeopardy!</p>

<p>In the end matters passed off well, though the irony of the
review was terrible. Enver, Jemal and Feisal watched the troops
wheeling and turning in the dusty plain outside the city gate,
rushing up and down in mimic camel-battle, or spurring their horses
in the javelin game after immemorial Arab fashion. 'And are all
these volunteers for the Holy War?' asked Enver at last, turning to
Feisal. 'Yes,' said Feisal. Willing to fight to the death against
the enemies of the faithful?' Yes,' said Feisal again; and then the
Arab chiefs came up to be presented, and Sherif Ali ibn el Hussein,
of Modhig, drew him aside whispering, 'My Lord, shall we kill them
now?' and Feisal said, 'No, they are our guests.'</p>

<p>The sheikhs protested further; for they believed that so they
could finish off the war in two blows. They were determined to
force Feisal's hand; and he had to go among them, just out of
earshot but in full view, and plead for the lives of the Turkish
dictators, who had murdered his best friends on the scaffold. In
the end he had to make excuses, take the party back quickly to
Medina, picket the banqueting hall with his own slaves, and escort
Enver and Jemal back to Damascus to save them from death on the
way. He explained this laboured courtesy by the plea that it was
the Arab manner to devote everything to guests; but Enver and Jemal
being deeply suspicious of what they had seen, imposed a strict
blockade of the Hejaz, and ordered large Turkish reinforcements
thither. They wanted to detain Feisal in Damascus; but telegrams
came from Medina claiming his immediate return to prevent disorder,
and, reluctantly, Jemal let him go on condition that his suite
remained behind as hostages.</p>

<p>Feisal found Medina full of Turkish troops, with the staff and
headquarters of the Twelfth Army Corps under Fakhri Pasha, the
courageous old butcher who had bloodily 'purified' Zeitun and Urfa
of Armenians. Clearly the Turks had taken warning, and Feisal's
hope of a surprise rush, winning success almost without a shot, had
become impossible. However, it was too late for prudence. From
Damascus four days later his suite took horse and rode out east
into the desert to take refuge with Nuri Shaalan, the Beduin
chieftain; and the same day Feisal showed his hand. When he raised
the Arab flag, the pan-Islamic supra-national State, for which
Abdul Hamid had massacred and worked and died, and the German hope
of the co-operation of Islam in the world-plans of the Kaiser,
passed into the realm of dreams. By the mere fact of his rebellion
the Sherif had closed these two fantastic chapters of history.</p>

<p>Rebellion was the gravest step which political men could take,
and the success or failure of the Arab revolt was a gamble too
hazardous for prophecy. Yet, for once, fortune favoured the bold
player, and the Arab epic tossed up its stormy road from birth
through weakness, pain and doubt, to red victory. It was the just
end to an adventure which had dared so much, but after the victory
there came a slow time of disillusion, and then a night in which
the fighting men found that all their hopes had failed them. Now,
at last, may there have come to them the white peace of the end, in
the knowledge that they achieved a deathless thing, a lucent
inspiration to the children of their race.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<p>I had been many years going up and down the Semitic East before
the war, learning the manners of the villagers and tribesmen and
citizens of Syria and Mesopotamia. My poverty had constrained me to
mix with the humbler classes, those seldom met by European
travellers, and thus my experiences gave me an unusual angle of
view, which enabled me to understand and think for the ignorant
many as well as for the more enlightened whose rare opinions
mattered, not so much for the day, as for the morrow. In addition,
I had seen something of the political forces working in the minds
of the Middle East, and especially had noted everywhere sure signs
of the decay of imperial Turkey.</p>

<p>Turkey was dying of overstrain, of the attempt, with diminished
resources, to hold, on traditional terms, the whole Empire
bequeathed to it. The sword had been the virtue of the children of
Othman, and swords had passed out of fashion nowadays, in favour of
deadlier and more scientific weapons. Life was growing too
complicated for this child-like people, whose strength had lain in
simplicity, and patience, and in their capacity for sacrifice. They
were the slowest of the races of Western Asia, little fitted to
adapt themselves to new sciences of government and life, still less
to invent any new arts for themselves. Their administration had
become perforce an affair of files and telegrams, of high finance,
eugenics, calculations. Inevitably the old governors, who had
governed by force of hand or force of character, illiterate,
direct, personal, had to pass away. The rule was transferred to new
men, with agility and suppleness to stoop to machinery. The shallow
and half-polished committee of the Young Turks were descendants of
Greeks, Albanians, Circassians, Bulgars, Armenians,
Jews&mdash;anything but Seljuks or Ottomans. The commons ceased to
feel in tune with their governors, whose culture was Levantine, and
whose political theory was French. Turkey was decaying; and only
the knife might keep health in her.</p>

<p>Loving the old ways steadily, the Anatolian remained a beast of
burden in his village and an uncomplaining soldier abroad, while
the subject races of the Empire, who formed nearly seven-tenths of
its total population, grew daily in strength and knowledge; for
their lack of tradition and responsibility, as well as their
lighter and quicker minds, disposed them to accept new ideas. The
former natural awe and supremacy of the Turkish name began to fade
in the face of wider comparison. This changing balance of Turkey
and the subject provinces involved growing garrisons if the old
ground was to be retained. Tripoli, Albania, Thrace, Yemen, Hejaz,
Syria, Mesopotamia, Kurdistan, Armenia, were all outgoing accounts,
burdens on the peasants of Anatolia, yearly devouring a larger
draft. The burden fell heaviest on the poor villages, and each year
made these poor villages yet more poor.</p>

<p>The conscripts took their fate unquestioning: resignedly, after
the custom of Turkish peasantry. They were like sheep, neutrals
without vice or virtue. Left alone, they did nothing, or perhaps
sat dully on the ground. Ordered to be kind, and without haste they
were as good friends and as generous enemies as might be found.
Ordered to outrage their fathers or disembowel their mothers, they
did it as calmly as they did nothing, or did well. There was about
them a hopeless, fever-wasted lack of initiative, which made them
the most biddable, most enduring, and least spirited soldiers in
the world.</p>

<p>Such men were natural victims of their showy-vicious Levantine
officers, to be driven to death or thrown away by neglect without
reckoning. Indeed, we found them just kept chopping-blocks of their
commanders' viler passions. So cheap did they rate them, that in
connection with them they used none of the ordinary precautions.
Medical examination of some batches of Turkish prisoners found
nearly half of them with unnaturally acquired venereal disease. Pox
and its like were not understood in the country; and the infection
ran from one to another through the battalion, where the conscripts
served for six or seven years, till at the end of their period the
survivors, if they came from decent homes, were ashamed to return,
and drifted either into the gendarmerie service, or, as broken men,
into casual labour about the towns; and so the birth-rate fell. The
Turkish peasantry in Anatolia were dying of their military
service.</p>

<p>We could see that a new factor was needed in the East, some
power or race which would outweigh the Turks in numbers, in output,
and in mental activity. No encouragement was given us by history to
think that these qualities could be supplied ready-made from
Europe. The efforts of European Powers to keep a footing in the
Asiatic Levant had been uniformly disastrous, and we disliked no
Western people enough to inveigle them into further attempts. Our
successor and solution must be local; and fortunately the standard
of efficiency required was local also. The competition would be
with Turkey; and Turkey was rotten.</p>

<p>Some of us judged that there was latent power enough and to
spare in the Arabic peoples (the greatest component of the old
Turkish Empire), a prolific Semitic agglomeration, great in
religious thought, reasonably industrious, mercantile, politic, yet
solvent rather than dominant in character. They had served a term
of five hundred years under the Turkish harrow, and had begun to
dream of liberty; so when at last England fell out with Turkey, and
war was let loose in the East and West at once, we who believed we
held an indication of the future set out to bend England's efforts
towards fostering the new Arabic world in hither Asia.</p>

<p>We were not many; and nearly all of us rallied round Clayton,
the chief of Intelligence, civil and military, in Egypt. Clayton
made the perfect leader for such a band of wild men as we were. He
was calm, detached, clear-sighted, of unconscious courage in
assuming responsibility. He gave an open run to his subordinates.
His own views were general, like his knowledge; and he worked by
influence rather than by loud direction. It was not easy to descry
his influence. He was like water, or permeating oil, creeping
silently and insistently through everything. It was not possible to
say where Clayton was and was not, and how much really belonged to
him. He never visibly led; but his ideas were abreast of those who
did: he impressed men by his sobriety, and by a certain quiet and
stately moderation of hope. In practical matters he was loose,
irregular, untidy, a man with whom independent men could bear.</p>

<p>The first of us was Ronald Storrs, Oriental Secretary of the
Residency, the most brilliant Englishman in the Near East, and
subtly efficient, despite his diversion of energy in love of music
and letters, of sculpture, painting, of whatever was beautiful in
the world's fruit. None the less, Storrs sowed what we reaped, and
was always first, and the great man among us. His shadow would have
covered our work and British policy in the East like a cloak, had
he been able to deny himself the world, and to prepare his mind and
body with the sternness of an athlete for a great fight.</p>

<p>George Lloyd entered our number. He gave us confidence, and with
his knowledge of money, proved a sure guide through the subways of
trade and politics, and a prophet upon the future arteries of the
Middle East. We would not have done so much so soon without his
partnership; but he was a restless soul, avid rather to taste than
to exhaust. To him many things were needful; and so he would not
stay very long with us. He did not see how much we liked him.</p>

<p>Then there was the imaginative advocate of unconvincing
world-movements, Mark Sykes: also a bundle of prejudices,
intuitions, half-sciences. His ideas were of the outside; and he
lacked patience to test his materials before choosing his style of
building. He would take an aspect of the truth, detach it from its
circumstances, inflate it, twist and model it, until its old
likeness and its new unlikeness together drew a laugh; and laughs
were his triumphs. His instincts lay in parody: by choice he was A
caricaturist rather than an artist, even in statesmanship. He saw
the odd in everything, and missed the even. He would sketch out in
a few dashes a new world, <i>all</i> out of scale, but vivid as a
vision of some sides of the thing we hoped. His help did us good
and harm. For this his last week in Paris tried to atone. He had
returned from A period of political duty in Syria, after his awful
realization of the true shape of his dreams, to say gallantly, I
was wrong: here is the truth'. His former friends would not see his
new earnestness, and thought him fickle and in error; and very soon
he died. It was a tragedy of tragedies, for the Arab sake.</p>

<p>Not a wild man, but <i>Mentor</i> to all of us was Hogarth, our
father confessor and adviser, who brought us the parallels and
lessons of history, and moderation, and courage. To the outsiders
he was peacemaker (I was all claws and teeth, and had a devil), and
made us favoured and listened to, for his weighty judgement. He had
a delicate sense of value, and would present clearly to us the
forces hidden behind the lousy rags and festering skins which we
knew as Arabs. Hogarth was our referee, and our untiring historian,
who gave us his great knowledge and careful wisdom even in the
smallest things, because he believed in what we were making. Behind
him stood Cornwallis, a man rude to look upon, but apparently
forged from one of those incredible metals with a melting-point of
thousands of degrees. So he could remain for months hotter than
other men's white-heat, and yet look cold and hard. Behind him
again were others, Newcombe, Parker, Herbert, Graves, all of the
creed, and labouring stoutly after their fashion.</p>

<p>We called ourselves 'Intrusive' as a band; for we meant to break
into the accepted halls of English foreign policy, and build a new
people in the East, despite the rails laid down for us by our
ancestors. Therefore from our hybrid intelligence office in Cairo
(a jangling place which for its incessant bells and bustle and
running to and fro, was likened by Aubrey Herbert to an oriental
railway station) we began to work upon all chiefs, far and near.
Sir Henry McMahon, High Commissioner in Egypt, was, of course, our
first effort; and his shrewd insight and tried, experienced mind
understood our design at once and judged it good. Others, like
Wemyss, Neil Malcolm, Wingate, supported us in their pleasure at
seeing the war turned constructive. Their advocacy confirmed in
Lord Kitchener the favourable impression he had derived years
before when Sherif Abdulla appealed to him in Egypt; and so McMahon
at last achieved our foundation stone, the understanding with the
Sherif of Mecca.</p>

<p>But before this we had had hopes of Mesopotamia. The beginning
of the Arab Independence Movement had been there, under the
vigorous but unscrupulous impulse of Seyid Taleb, and later of
Yasin el Hashimi and the military league. Aziz el Masri, Enver's
rival, who was living, much indebted to us, in Egypt, was an idol
of the Arab officers. He was approached by Lord Kitchener in the
first days of the war, with the hope of winning the Turkish
Mesopotamian forces to our side. Unfortunately Britain was bursting
then with confidence in an easy and early victory: the smashing of
Turkey was called a promenade. So the Indian Government was adverse
to any pledges to the Arab nationalists which might limit their
ambitions to make the intended Mesopotamian colony play the
self-sacrificing role of a Burma for the general good. It broke off
negotiations, rejected Aziz, and interned Sayid Taleb, who had
placed himself in our hands.</p>

<p>By brute force it marched then into Basra. The enemy troops in
Irak were nearly all Arabs in the unenviable predicament of having
to fight on behalf of their secular oppressors against a people
long envisaged as liberators, but who obstinately refused to play
the part. As may be imagined, they fought very badly. Our forces
won battle after battle till we came to think an Indian army better
than a Turkish army. There followed our rash advance to Ctesiphon,
where we met native Turkish troops whose full heart was in the
game, and were abruptly checked. We fell back, dazed; and the long
misery of Kut began.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our Government had repented, and, for reasons not
unconnected with the fall of Erzerum, sent me to Mesopotamia to see
what could be done by indirect means to relieve the beleaguered
garrison. The local British had the strongest objection to my
coming; and two Generals of them were good enough to explain to me
that my mission (which they did not really know) was dishonourable
to a soldier (which I was not). As a matter of fact it was too late
for action, with Kut just dying; and in consequence I did nothing
of what it was in my mind and power to do.</p>

<p>The conditions were ideal for an Arab movement. The people of
Nejef and Kerbela, far in the rear of Halil Pasha's army, were in
revolt against him. The surviving Arabs in Hali's army were, on his
own confession, openly disloyal to Turkey. The tribes of the Hai
and Euphrates would have turned our way had they seen signs of
grace in the British. Had we published the promises made to the
Sherif, or even the proclamation afterwards posted in captured
Bagdad, and followed it up, enough local fighting men would have
joined us to harry the Turkish line of communication between Bagdad
and Kut. A few weeks of that, and the enemy would either have been
forced to raise the siege and retire, or have themselves suffered
investment, outside Kut, nearly as stringent as the investment of
Townshend within it. Time to develop such a scheme could easily
have been gained. Had the British headquarters in Mesopotamia
obtained from the War Office eight more aeroplanes to increase the
daily carriage of food to the garrison of Kut, Townshend's
resistance might have been indefinitely prolonged. His defence was
Turkishly impregnable; and only blunders within and without forced
surrender upon him.</p>

<p>However, as this was not the way of the directing parties there,
I returned at once to Egypt; and till the end of the war the
British in Mesopotamia remained substantially an alien force
invading enemy territory, with the local people passively neutral
or sullenly against them, and in consequence had not the freedom of
movement and elasticity of Allenby in Syria, who entered the
country as a friend, with the local people actively on his side.
The factors of numbers, climate and communications favoured us in
Mesopotamia more than in Syria; and our higher command was, after
the beginning, no less efficient and experienced. But their
casualty lists compared with Allenby's, their wood-chopping tactics
compared with his rapier-play, showed how formidably an adverse
political situation was able to cramp a purely military
operation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<p>Our check in Mesopotamia was a disappointment to us; but McMahon
continued his negotiations with Mecca, and finally brought them to
success despite the evacuation of Gallipoli, the surrender of Kut,
and the generally unfortunate aspect of the war at the moment. Few
people, even of those who knew all the negotiations, had really
believed that the Sherif would fight; consequently his eventual
rebellion and opening of his coast to our ships and help took us
and them by surprise.</p>

<p>We found our difficulties then only beginning. The credit of the
new factor was to McMahon and Clayton: professional jealousies
immediately raised their heads. Sir Archibald Murray, the General
in Egypt, wanted, naturally enough, no competitors and no competing
campaigns in his sphere. He disliked the civil power, which had so
long kept the peace between himself and General Maxwell. He could
not be entrusted with the Arabian affair; for neither he nor his
staff had the ethnological competence needed to deal with so
curious a problem. On the other hand, he could make the spectacle
of the High Commission running a private war sufficiently
ridiculous. His was a very nervous mind, fanciful and essentially
competitive.</p>

<p>He found help in his Chief of Staff, General Lynden Bell, a red
soldier, with an instinctive shuddering away from politicians, and
a conscientiously assumed heartiness.</p>

<p>Two of the General Staff officers followed their leaders full
cry; and so the unfortunate McMahon found himself deprived of Army
help and reduced to waging his war in Arabia with the assistance of
his Foreign Office Attache's.</p>

<p>Some appeared to resent a war which allowed outsiders to thrust
into their business. Also their training in suppression, by which
alone the daily trivialities of diplomacy were made to look like
man's work, had so sunk into them that when the more important
thing arrived, they made it trivial. Their feebleness of tone, and
niggling dishonesties to one another, angered the military to
disgust; and were bad for us, too, since they patently let down the
High Commissioner, whose boots the G&mdash;s were not good enough
to clean.</p>

<p>Wingate, who had complete confidence in his own grasp of the
situation in the Middle East, foresaw credit and great profit for
the country in the Arab development; but as criticism slowly beat
up against McMahon he dissociated himself from him, and London
began to hint that better use might be made by an experienced hand
of so subtle and involved a skein.</p>

<p>However it was, things in the Hejaz went from bad to worse. No
proper liaison was provided for the Arab forces in the field, no
military information was given the Sherifs, no tactical advice or
strategy was suggested, no attempt made to find out the local
conditions and adapt existing Allied resources in material to suit
their needs. The French Military Mission (which Clayton's prudence
had suggested be sent to Hejaz to soothe our very suspicious allies
by taking them behind the scenes and giving them a purpose there),
was permitted to carry on an elaborate intrigue against Sherif
Hussein in his towns of Jidda and Mecca, and to propose to him and
to the British authorities measures that must have ruined his cause
in the eyes of all Moslems. Wingate, now in military control of our
cooperation with the Sherif, was induced to land some foreign
troops at Rabegh, half-way between Medina and Mecca, for the
defence of Mecca and to hold up the further advance of the
reinvigorated Turks from Medina. McMahon, in the multitude of
counsellors, became confused, and gave a handle to Murray to cry
out against his inconsistencies. The Arab Revolt became
discredited; and Staff Officers in Egypt gleefully prophesied to us
its near failure and the stretching of Sherif Hussein's neck on a
Turkish scaffold.</p>

<p>My private position was not easy. As Staff Captain under Clayton
in Sir Archibald Murray's Intelligence Section, I was charged with
the 'distribution' of the Turkish Army and the preparation of maps.
By natural inclination I had added to them the invention of the
Arab Bulletin, a secret weekly record of Middle-Eastern politics;
and of necessity Clayton came more and more to need me in the
military wing of the Arab Bureau, the tiny intelligence and war
staff for foreign affairs, which he was now organizing for McMahon.
Eventually Clayton was driven out of the General Staff; and Colonel
Holdich, Murray's intelligence officer at Ismailia, took his place
in command of us. His first intention was to retain my services;
and, since he clearly did not need me, I interpreted this, not
without some friendly evidence, as a method of keeping me away from
the Arab affair. I decided that I must escape at once, if ever. A
straight request was refused; so I took to stratagems. I became, on
the telephone (G.H.Q. were at Ismailia, and I in Cairo) quite
intolerable to the Staff on the Canal. I took every opportunity to
rub into them their comparative ignorance and inefficiency in the
department of intelligence (not difficult!) and irritated them yet
further by literary airs, correcting Shavian split infinitives and
tautologies in their reports.</p>

<p>In a few days they were bubbling over on my account, and at last
determined to endure me no longer. I took this strategic
opportunity to ask for ten days' leave, saying that Storrs was
going down to Jidda on business with the Grand Sherif, and that I
would like a holiday and joyride in the Red Sea with him. They did
not love Storrs, and were glad to get rid of me for the moment. So
they agreed at once, and began to prepare against my return some
official shelf for me. Needless to say, I had no intention of
giving them such a chance; for, while very ready to hire my body
out on petty service, I hesitated to throw my mind frivolously
away. So I went to Clayton and confessed my affairs; and he
arranged for the Residency to make telegraphic application to the
Foreign Office for my transfer to the Arab Bureau. The Foreign
Office would treat directly with the War Office; and the Egypt
command would not hear of it, till all was ended.</p>

<p>Storrs and I then marched off together, happily. In the East
they swore that by three sides was the decent way across a square;
and my trick to escape was in this sense oriental. But I justified
myself by my confidence in the final success of the Arab Revolt if
properly advised. I had been a mover in its beginning; my hopes lay
in it. The fatalistic subordination of a professional soldier
(intrigue being unknown in the British army) would have made a
proper officer sit down and watch his plan of campaign wrecked by
men who thought nothing of it, and to whose spirit it made no
appeal. <i>Non nobis, domine</i>.</p>

<blockquote><i>I had believed these misfortunes of the revolt to be
due mainly to faulty leadership, or rather to the lack of
leadership, Arab and English. So I went down to Arabia to see and
consider its great men. The first, the Sherif of Mecca, we knew to

cool.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Then I rode up-country to Feisal, and found in him the leader

science. His tribesmen seemed sufficient instrument, and his hills
to provide natural advantage. So I returned pleased and confident
to Egypt, and told my chiefs how Mecca was defended not by the
obstacle of Rabegh, but by the flank-threat of Feisal in Jebel
Subh.</i>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p>Waiting off Suez was the <i>Lama</i>, a small converted liner;
and in her we left immediately. Such short voyages on warships were
delicious interludes for us passengers. On this occasion, however,
there was some embarrassment. Our mixed party seemed to disturb the
ship's company in their own element. The juniors had turned out of
their berths to give us night space, and by day we filled their
living rooms with irregular talk. Storrs' intolerant brain seldom
stooped to company. But to-day he was more abrupt than usual. He
turned twice around the decks, sniffed, 'No one worth talking to',
and sat down in one of the two comfortable armchairs, to begin a
discussion of Debussy with Aziz el Masri (in the other). Aziz, the
Arab-Circassian ex-colonel in the Turkish Army, now general in the
Sherifian Army, was on his way to discuss with the Emir of Mecca
the equipment and standing of the Arab regulars he was forming at
Rabegh. A few minutes later they had left Debussy, and were
depreciating Wagner: Aziz in fluent German, and Storrs in German,
French and Arabic. The ship's officers found the whole conversation
unnecessary.</p>

<p>We had the accustomed calm run to Jidda, in the delightful Red
Sea climate, never too hot while the ship was moving. By day we lay
in shadow; and for great part of the glorious nights we would tramp
up and down the wet decks under the stars in the steaming breath of
the southern wind. But when at last we anchored in the outer
harbour, off the white town hung between the blazing sky and its
reflection in the mirage which swept and rolled over the wide
lagoon, then the heat of Arabia came out like a drawn sword and
struck us speechless. It was midday; and the noon sun in the East,
like moonlight, put to sleep the colours. There were only lights
and shadows, the white houses and black gaps of streets: in front,
the pallid lustre of the haze shimmering upon the inner harbour:
behind, the dazzle of league after league of featureless sand,
running up to an edge of low hills, faintly suggested in the far
away mist of heat.</p>

<p>Just north of Jidda was a second group of black-white buildings,
moving up and down like pistons in the mirage, as the ship rolled
at anchor and the intermittent wind shifted the heat waves in the
air. It looked and felt horrible. We began to regret that the
inaccessibility which made the Hejaz militarily a safe theatre of
revolt involved bad climate and un-wholesomeness.</p>

<p>However, Colonel Wilson, British representative with the new
Arab state, had sent his launch to meet us; and we had to go ashore
to learn the reality of the men levitating in that mirage. Half an
hour later Ruhi, Consular Oriental assistant, was grinning a
delighted welcome to his old patron Storrs (Ruhi the ingenious,
more like a mandrake than a man), while the newly-appointed Syrian
police and harbour officers, with a scratch guard of honour, lined
the Customs Wharf in salutation of Aziz el Masri. Sherif Abdulla,
the second son of the old man of Mecca, was reported just arriving
in the town. He it was we had to meet; so our coming was
auspiciously timed.</p>

<p>We walked past the white masonry of the still-building water
gate, and through the oppressive alley of the food market on our
way to the Consulate. In the air, from the men to the dates and
back to the meat, squadrons of flies like particles of dust danced
up and down the sunshafts which stabbed into the darkest corners of
the booths through torn places in the wood and sackcloth awnings
overhead. The atmosphere was like a bath. The scarlet leathers of
the armchair on the <i>Lama's</i> deck had dyed Storrs' white tunic
and trousers as bright as themselves in their damp contact of the
last four days, and now the sweat running in his clothes began to
shine like varnish through the stain. I was so fascinated watching
him that I never noticed the deepened brown of my khaki drill
wherever it touched my body. He was wondering if the walk to the
Consulate was long enough to wet me a decent, solid, harmonious
colour; and I was wondering if all he ever sat on would grow
scarlet as himself.</p>

<p>We reached the Consulate too soon for either hope; and there in
a shaded room with an open lattice behind him sat Wilson, prepared
to welcome the sea breeze, which had lagged these last few days. He
received us stiffly, being of the honest, downright Englishmen, to
whom Storrs was suspect, if only for his artistic sense: while his
contact with me in Cairo had been a short difference of opinion as
to whether native clothes were an indignity for us. I had called
them uncomfortable merely. To him they were wrong. Wilson, however,
despite his personal feelings, was all for the game. He had made
preparations for the coming interview with Abdulla, and was ready
to afford every help he could. Besides, we were his guests; and the
splendid hospitality of the East was near his spirit.</p>

<p>Abdulla, on a white mare, came to us softly with a bevy of
richly-armed slaves on foot about him, through the silent
respectful salutes of the town. He was flushed with his success at
Taif, and happy. I was seeing him for the first time, while Storrs
was an old friend, and on the best of terms; yet, before long, as
they spoke together, I began to suspect him of a constant
cheerfulness. His eyes had a confirmed twinkle; and though only
thirty-five, he was putting on flesh. It might be due to too much
laughter. Life seemed very merry for Abdulla. He was short, strong,
fair-skinned, with a carefully trimmed brown beard, masking his
round smooth face and short lips. In manner he was open, or
affected openness, and was charming on acquaintance. He stood not
on ceremony, but jested with all comers in most easy fashion: yet,
when we fell into serious talk, the veil of humour seemed to fade
away. He then chose his words, and argued shrewdly. Of course, he
was in discussion with Storrs, who demanded a high standard from
his opponent.</p>

<p>The Arabs thought Abdulla a far-seeing statesman and an astute
politician. Astute he certainly was, but not greatly enough to
convince us always of his sincerity. His ambition was patent.
Rumour made him the brain of his father and of the Arab revolt; but
he seemed too easy for that. His object was, of course, the winning
of Arab independence and the building up of Arab nations, but he
meant to keep the direction of the new states in the family. So he
watched us, and played through us to the British gallery.</p>

<p>On our part, I was playing for effect, watching, criticizing
him. The Sherifs rebellion had been unsatisfactory for the last few
months (standing still, which, with an irregular war, was the
prelude to disaster), and my suspicion was that its lack was
leadership: not intellect, nor judgement, nor political wisdom, but
the flame of enthusiasm that would set the desert on fire. My visit
was mainly to find the yet unknown master-spirit of the affair, and
measure his capacity to carry the revolt to the goal I had
conceived for it. As our conversation continued, I became more and
more sure that Abdulla was too balanced, too cool, too humorous to
be a prophet: especially the armed prophet who, if history be true,
succeeded in revolutions. His value would come perhaps in the peace
after success. During the physical struggle, when singleness of eye
and magnetism, devotion and self-sacrifice were needed, Abdulla
would be a tool too complex for a simple purpose, though he could
not be ignored, even now.</p>

<p>We talked to him first about the state of Jidda, to put him at
ease by discussing at this first of our interviews the unnecessary
subject of the Sherif's administration. He replied that the war was
yet too much with them for civil government. They had inherited the
Turkish system in the towns, and were continuing it on a more
modest scale. The Turkish Government was often not unkind to strong
men, who obtained considerable licence on terms. Consequently, some
of the licensees in Hejaz regretted the coming of a native ruler.
Particularly in Mecca and Jidda public opinion was against an Arab
state. The mass of citizens were foreigners&mdash;Egyptians,
Indians, Javanese, Africans, and others&mdash;quite unable to
sympathize with the Arab aspirations, especially as voiced by
Beduin; for the Beduin lived on what he could exact from the
stranger on his roads, or in his valleys; and he and the townsman
bore each other a perpetual grudge.</p>

<p>The Beduins were the only fighting men the Sherif had got; and
on their help the revolt depended. He was arming them freely,
paying many of them for their service in his forces, feeding their
families while they were from home, and hiring from them their
transport camels to maintain his armies in the field. Accordingly,
the country was prosperous, while the towns went short.</p>

<p>Another grievance in the towns was in the matter of law. The
Turkish civil code had been abolished, and a return made to the old
religious law, the undiluted Koranic procedure of the Arab Kadi.
Abdulla explained to us, with a giggle, that when there was time
they would discover in the Koran such opinions and judgements as
were required to make it suitable for modern commercial operations,
like banking and exchange. Meanwhile, of course, what townsmen lost
by the abolition of the civil law, the Beduins gained. Sherif
Hussein had silently sanctioned the restoration of the old tribal
order. Beduins at odds with one another pleaded their own cases
before the tribal lawman, an office hereditary in one
most-respected family, and recognized by the payment of a goat per
household as yearly due. Judgement was based on custom, by quoting
from a great body of remembered precedent. It was delivered
publicly without fee. In cases between men of different tribes, the
lawman was selected by mutual consent, or recourse was had to the
lawman of a third tribe. If the case were contentious and
difficult, the judge was supported by a jury of four&mdash;two
nominated by plaintiff from the ranks of defendant's family, and
two by defendant from plaintiff's family. Decisions were always
unanimous.</p>

<p>We contemplated the vision Abdulla drew for us, with sad
thoughts of the Garden of Eden and all that Eve, now lying in her
tomb just outside the wall, had lost for average humanity; and then
Storrs brought me into the discussion by asking Abdulla to give us
his views on the state of the campaign for my benefit, and for
communication to headquarters in Egypt. Abdulla at once grew
serious, and said that he wanted to urge upon the British their
immediate and very personal concern in the matter, which he
tabulated so:&mdash;</p>

<p>By our neglect to cut the Hejaz Railway, the Turks had been able
to collect transport and supplies for the reinforcement of
Medina.</p>

<p>Feisal had been driven back from the town; and the enemy was
preparing a mobile column of all arms for an advance on Rabegh.</p>

<p>The Arabs in the hills across their road were by our neglect too
weak in supplies, machine guns and artillery to defend them
long.</p>

<p>Hussein Mabeirig, chief of the Masruh Harb, had joined the
Turks. If the Medina column advanced, the Harb would join it.</p>

<p>It would only remain for his father to put himself at the head
of his own people of Mecca, and to die fighting before the Holy
City.</p>

<p>At this moment the telephone rang: the Grand Sherif wanted to
speak to Abdulla. He was told of the point our conversation had
reached, and at once confirmed that he would so act in the
extremity. The Turks would enter Mecca over his dead body. The
telephone rang off; and Abdulla, smiling a little, asked, to
prevent such a disaster, that a British brigade, if possible of
Moslem troops, be kept at Suez, with transport to rush it to Rabegh
as soon as the Turks debouched from Medina in their attack. What
did we think of the proposal?</p>

<p>I replied; first, historically, that Sherif Hussein had asked us
not to cut the Hejaz line, since he would need it for his
victorious advance into Syria; second, practically, that the
dynamite we sent down for demolitions had been returned by him with
a note that it was too dangerous for Arab use; third, specifically,
that we had had no demands for equipment from Feisal.</p>

<p>With regard to the brigade for Rabegh, it was a complicated
question. Shipping was precious; and we could not hold empty
transports indefinitely at Suez. We had no Moslem units in our
Army. A British brigade was a cumbersome affair, and would take
long to embark and disembark. The Rabegh position was large. A
brigade would hardly hold it and would be quite unable to detach a
force to prevent a Turkish column slipping past it inland. The most
they could do would be to defend the beach, under a ship's guns and
the ship could do that as well without the troops.</p>

<p>Abdulla replied that ships were insufficient morally, as the
Dardanelles fighting had destroyed the old legend of the British
Navy and its omnipotence. No Turks could slip past Rabegh; for it
was the only water supply in the district, and they must water at
its wells. The earmarking of a brigade and transports need be only
temporary; for he was taking his victorious Taif troops up the
eastern road from Mecca to Medina. As soon as he was in position,
he would give orders to Ali and Feisal, who would close in from the
south and west, and their combined forces would deliver a grand
attack, in which Medina would, please God, be taken. Meanwhile,
Aziz el Masri was moulding the volunteers from Mesopotamia and
Syria into battalions at Rabegh. When we had added the Arab
prisoners of war from India and Egypt, there would be enough to
take over the duties momentarily allotted to the British
brigade.</p>

<p>I said that I would represent his views to Egypt, but that the
British were reluctant to spare troops from the vital defence of
Egypt (though he was not to imagine that the Canal was in any
danger from the Turks) and, still more, to send Christians to
defend the people of the Holy City against their enemies; as some
Moslems in India, who considered the Turkish Government had an
imprescriptable right to the Haramein, would misrepresent our
motives and action. I thought that I might perhaps urge his
opinions more powerfully if I was able to report on the Rabegh
question in the light of my own knowledge of the position and local
feeling. I would also like to see Feisal, and talk over with him
his needs and the prospects of a prolonged defence of his hills by
the tribesmen if we strengthened them materially. I would like to
ride from Rabegh up the Sultani road towards Medina as far as
Feisal's camp.</p>

<p>Storrs then came in and supported me with all his might, urging
the vital importance of full and early information from a trained
observer for the British Commander-in-Chief in Egypt, and showing
that his sending down me, his best qualified and most indispensable
staff officer, proved the serious consideration being given to
Arabian affairs by Sir Archibald Murray. Abdulla went to the
telephone and tried to get his father's consent to my going up
country. The Sherif viewed the proposal with grave distrust.
Abdulla argued the point, made some advantage, and transferred the
mouthpiece to Storrs, who turned all his diplomacy on the old man.
Storrs in <i>full</i> blast was a delight to listen to in the mere
matter of Arabic speech, and also a lesson to every Englishman
alive of how to deal with suspicious or unwilling Orientals. It was
nearly impossible to resist him for more than a few minutes, and in
this case also he had his way. The Sherif asked again for Abdulla,
and authorized him to write to Ali, and suggest that if he thought
fit, and if conditions were normal, I might be allowed to proceed
to Feisal in Jebel Subh; and Abdulla, under Storrs' influence,
transformed this guarded message into direct written instructions
to Ali to mount me as well and as quickly as possible, and convey
me, by sure hand, to Feisal's camp. This being all I wanted, and
half what Storrs wanted, we adjourned for lunch.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p>Jeddah had pleased us, on our way to the Consulate: so after
lunch, when it was a little cooler, or at least when the sun was
not so high, we wandered out to see the sights under the guidance
of Young, Wilson's assistant, a man who found good in many old
things, but little good in things now being made.</p>

<p>It was indeed a remarkable town. The streets were alleys, wood
roofed in the main bazaar, but elsewhere open to the sky in the
little gap between the tops of the lofty white-walled houses. These
were built four or five stories high, of coral rag tied with square
beams and decorated by wide bow-windows running from ground to roof
in grey wooden panels. There was no glass in Jidda, but a profusion
of good lattices, and some very delicate shallow chiselling on the
panels of window casings. The doors were heavy two-leaved slabs of
teak-wood, deeply carved, often with wickets in them; and they had
rich hinges and ring-knockers of hammered iron. There was much
moulded or cut plastering, and on the older houses fine stone heads
and jambs to the windows looking on the inner courts.</p>

<p>The style of architecture was like crazy Elizabethan half-timber
work, in the elaborate Cheshire fashion, but gone gimcrack to an
incredible degree. House-fronts were fretted, pierced and pargetted
till they looked as though cut out of cardboard for a romantic
stage-setting. Every storey jutted, every window leaned one way or
other; often the very walls sloped. It was like a dead city, so
clean underfoot, and so quiet. Its winding, even streets were
floored with damp sand solidified by time and as silent to the
tread as any carpet. The lattices and wall-returns deadened all
reverberation of voice. There were no carts, nor any streets wide
enough for carts, no shod animals, no bustle anywhere. Everything
was hushed, strained, even furtive. The doors of houses shut softly
as we passed. There were no loud dogs, no crying children: indeed,
except in the bazaar, still half asleep, there were few wayfarers
of any kind; and the rare people we did meet, all thin, and as it
were wasted by disease, with scarred, hairless faces and screwed-up
eyes, slipped past us quickly and cautiously, not looking at us.
Their skimp, white robes, shaven polls with little skull-caps, red
cotton shoulder-shawls, and bare feet were so same as to be almost
a uniform.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was oppressive, deadly. There seemed no life in
it. It was not burning hot, but held a moisture and sense of great
age and exhaustion such as seemed to belong to no other place: not
a passion of smells like Smyrna, Naples or Marseilles, but a
feeling of long use, of the exhalations of many people, of
continued bath-heat and sweat. One would say that for years Jidda
had not been swept through by a firm breeze: that its streets kept
their air from year's end to year's end, from the day they were
built for so long as the houses should endure. There was nothing in
the bazaars to buy.</p>

</p>

<p>In the evening the telephone rang; and the Sherif called Storrs
to the instrument. He asked if we would not like to listen to his
band. Storrs, in astonishment, asked What band? and congratulated
his holiness on having advanced so far towards urbanity. The Sherif
explained that the headquarters of the Hejaz Command under the
Turks had had a brass band, which played each night to the Governor
General; and when the Governor General was captured by Abdulla at
Taif his band was captured with him. The other prisoners were sent
to Egypt for internment; but the band was excepted. It was held in
Mecca to give music to the victors. Sherif Hussein laid his
receiver on the table of his reception hall, and we, called
solemnly one by one to the telephone, heard the band in the Palace
at Mecca forty-five miles away. Storrs expressed the general
gratification; and the Sherif, increasing his bounty replied that
the band should be sent down by forced march to Jidda, to play in
our courtyard also, 'And,' said he, 'you may then do me the
pleasure of ringing me up from your end, that I may share your
satisfaction.'</p>

<p>Next day Storrs visited Abdulla in his tent out by Eve's Tomb;
and together they inspected the hospital, the barracks, the town
offices, and partook of the hospitality of the Mayor and the
Governor. In the intervals of duty they talked about money, and the
Sherif s tide, and his relations with the other Princes of Arabia,
and the general course of the war: all the commonplaces that should
pass between envoys of two Governments. It was tedious, and for the
most part I held myself excused, as after a conversation in the
morning I had made up my mind that Abdulla was not the necessary
leader. We had asked him to sketch the genesis of the Arab
movement: and his reply illuminated his character. He had begun by
a long description of Talaat, the first Turk to speak to him with
concern of the restlessness of Hejaz. He wanted it properly
subdued, and military service, as elsewhere in the Empire,
introduced.</p>

<p>Abdulla, to forestall him, had made a plan of peaceful
insurrection for Hejaz, and, after sounding Kitchener without
profit, had dated it provisionally for 1915. He had meant to call
out the tribes during the feast, and lay hold of the pilgrims. They
would have included many of the chief men of Turkey besides leading
Moslems of Egypt, India, Java, Eritrea, and Algiers. With these
thousands of hostages in his hands he had expected to win the
notice of the Great Powers concerned. He thought they would bring
pressure on the Porte to secure the release of their nationals. The
Porte, powerless to deal with Hejaz militarily, would either have
made concessions to the Sherif or have confessed its powerlessness
to the foreign States. In the latter event, Abdulla would have
approached them direct, ready to meet their demands in return for a
guarantee of immunity from Turkey. I did not like his scheme, and
was glad when he said with almost a sneer that Feisal in fear had
begged his father not to follow it. This sounded good for Feisal,
towards whom my hopes of a great leader were now slowly
turning.</p>

<p>In the evening Abdulla came to dine with Colonel Wilson. We
received him in the courtyard on the house steps. Behind him were
his brilliant household servants and slaves, and behind them a pale
crew of bearded, emaciated men with woe-begone faces, wearing
tatters of military uniform, and carrying tarnished brass
instruments of music. Abdulla waved his hand towards them and
crowed with delight, 'My Band'. We sat them on benches in the
forecourt, and Wilson sent them cigarettes, while we went up to the
dining room, where the shuttered balcony was opened right out,
hungrily, for a sea breeze. As we sat down, the band, under the
guns and swords of Abdulla's retainers, began, each instrument
apart, to play heartbroken Turkish airs. Our ears ached with noise;
but Abdulla beamed.</p>

<p>Curious the party was. Abdulla himself, Vice-President <i>in
partibus</i> of the Turkish Chamber and now Foreign Minister of the
rebel Arab State; Wilson, Governor of the Red Sea Province of the
Sudan, and His Majesty's Minister with the Sherif of Mecca; Storrs,
Oriental Secretary successively to Gorst, Kitchener and McMahon in
Cairo; Young, Cochrane, and myself, hangers-on of the staff; Sayed
Ali, a general in the Egyptian Army, commander of the detachment
sent over by the Sirdar to help the first efforts of the Arabs;
Aziz el Masri, now Chief of Staff of the Arab regular army, but in
old days Enver's rival, leader of the Turkish and Senussi forces
against the Italians, chief conspirator of the Arab officers in the
Turkish army against the Committee of Union and Progress, a man
condemned to death by the Turks for obeying the Treaty of Lausanne,
and saved by <i>The Times</i> and Lord Kitchener.</p>

<p>We got tired of Turkish music, and asked for German. Aziz
stepped out on the balcony and called down to the bandsmen in
Turkish to play us something foreign. They struck shakily into
'Deutschland uber Alles' just as the Sherif came to his telephone
in Mecca to listen to the music of our feast. We asked for more
German music; and they played 'Eine feste Burg'. Then in the midst
they died away into flabby discords of drums. The parchment had
stretched in the damp air of Jidda. They cried for fire; and
Wilson's servants and Abdulla's bodyguard brought them piles of
straw and packing cases. They warmed the drums, turning them round
and round before the blaze, and then broke into what they said was
the Hymn of Hate, though no one could recognize a European
progression in it all. Sayed Ali turned to Abdulla and said, 'It is
a death march'. Abdulla's eyes widened; but Storrs who spoke in
quickly to the rescue turned the moment to laughter; and we sent
out rewards with the leavings of the feast to the sorrowful
musicians, who could take no pleasure in our praises, but begged to
be sent home. Next morning I left Jidda by ship for Rabegh.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<p>Moored in Rabegh lay the <i>Northbrook</i>, an Indian Marine
ship. On board was Colonel Parker, our liaison officer with Sherif
Ali, to whom he sent my letter from Abdulla, giving Ali the
father's 'orders' to send me at once up to Feisal. Ali was
staggered at their tenour, but could not help himself; for his only
telegraph to Mecca was by the ship's wireless, and he was ashamed
to send personal remonstrances through us. So he made the best of
it, and prepared for me his own splendid riding-camel, saddled with
his own saddle, and hung with luxurious housings and cushions of
Nejd leather-work pieced and inlaid in various colours, with
plaited fringes and nets embroidered with metal tissues. As a
trustworthy man he chose out Tafas el Raashid, a Hawazim Harb
tribesman, with his son, to guide me to Feisal's camp.</p>

<p>He did all this with the better grace for the countenance of
Nuri Said, the Bagdadi staff officer, whom I had befriended once in
Cairo when he was ill. Nuri was now second in command of the
regular force which Aziz el Masri was raising and training here.
Another friend at court was Faisel Ghusein, a secretary. He was a
Sulut Sheikh from the Hauran, and a former official of the Turkish
Government, who had escaped across Armenia during the war, and had
eventually reached Miss Gertrude Bell in Basra. She had sent
<i>him</i> on to me with a warm recommendation.</p>

<p><b>Emir Abdulla</b>
</p>
</center>

<p>To Ali himself I took a great fancy. He was of middle height,
thin, and looking already more than his thirty-seven years. He
stooped a little. His skin was sallow, his eyes large and deep and
brown, his nose thin and rather hooked, his mouth sad and drooping.
He had a spare black beard and very delicate hands. His manner was
dignified and admirable, but direct; and he struck me as a pleasant
gentleman, conscientious, without great force of character,
nervous, and rather tired. His physical weakness (he was
consumptive) made him subject to quick fits of shaking passion,
preceded and followed by long moods of infirm obstinacy. He was
bookish, learned in law and religion, and pious almost to
fanaticism. He was too conscious of his high heritage to be
ambitious; and his nature was too clean to see or suspect
interested motives in those about him. Consequently he was much the
prey of any constant companion, and too sensitive to advice for a
great leader, though his purity of intention and conduct gained him
the love of those who came into direct contact with him. If Feisal
should turn out to be no prophet, the revolt would make shift well
enough with Ali for its head. I thought him more definitely Arab
than Abdulla, or than Zeid, his young half-brother, who was helping
him at Rabegh, and came down with Ali and Nuri and Aziz to the
palm-groves to see me start. Zeid was a shy, white, beardless lad
of perhaps nineteen, calm and flippant, no zealot for the revolt.
Indeed, his mother was Turkish; and he had been brought up in the
harem, so that he could hardly feel great sympathy with an Arab
revival; but he did his best this day to be pleasant, and surpassed
AM, perhaps because his feelings were not much outraged at the
departure of a Christian into the Holy Province under the auspices
of the Emir of Mecca. Zeid, of course, was even less than Abdulla
the born leader of my quest. Yet I liked him, and could see that he
would be a decided man when he had found himself.</p>

<p>Ali would not let me start till after sunset, lest any of his
followers see me leave the camp. He kept my journey a secret even
from his slaves, and gave me an Arab cloak and head-cloth to wrap
round myself and my uniform, that I might present a proper
silhouette in the dark upon my camel. I had no food with me; so he
instructed Tafas to get something to eat at Bir el Sheikh, the
first settlement, some sixty miles out, and charged him most
stringently to keep me from questioning and curiosity on the way,
and to avoid all camps and encounters. The Masruh Harb, who
inhabited Rabegh and district, paid only lip-service to the Sherif.
Their real allegiance was to Hussein Mabeirig, the ambitious sheikh
of the clan, who was jealous of the Emir of Mecca and had fallen
out with him. He was now a fugitive, living in the hills to the
East, and was known to be in touch with the Turks. His people were
not notably pro-Turkish, but owed him obedience. If he had heard of
my departure he might well have ordered a band of them to stop me
on my way through his district.</p>

<p>Tafas was a Hazimi, of the Beni Salem branch of Harb, and so not
on good terms with the Masruh. This inclined him towards me; and
when he had once accepted the charge of escorting me to Feisal, we
could trust him. The fidelity of road-companions was most dear to
Arab tribesmen. The guide had to answer to a sentimental public
with his life for that of his fellow. One Harbi, who promised to
take Huber to Medina and broke his word and killed him on the road
near Rabegh, when he found out that he was a Christian, was
ostracized by public opinion, and, in spite of the religious
prejudices in his favour, had ever since lived miserably alone in
the hills, cut off from friendly intercourse, and refused
permission to marry any daughter of the tribe. So we could depend
upon the good will of Tafas and his son, Abdulla; and Ali
endeavoured by detailed instructions to ensure that their
performance should be as good as their intention.</p>

<p>We marched through the palm-groves which lay like a girdle about
the scattered houses of Rabegh village, and then out under the
stars along the Tehama, the sandy and featureless strip of desert
bordering the western coast of Arabia between sea-beach and
littoral hills, for hundreds of monotonous miles. In day-time this
low plain was insufferably hot, and its waterless character made it
a forbidding road; yet it was inevitable, since the more fruitful
hills were too rugged to afford passage north and south for loaded
animals.</p>

<p>The cool of the night was pleasant after the day of checks and
discussions which had so dragged at Rabegh. Tafas led on without
speaking, and the camels went silently over the soft flat sand. My
thoughts as we went were how this was the pilgrim road, down which,
for uncounted generations, the people of the north had come to
visit the Holy City, bearing with them gifts of faith for the
shrine; and it seemed that the Arab revolt might be in a sense a
return pilgrimage, to take back to the north, to Syria, an ideal
for an ideal, a belief in liberty for their past belief in a
revelation.</p>

<p>We endured for some hours, without variety except at times when
the camels plunged and strained a little and the saddles creaked:
indications that the soft plain had merged into beds of drift-sand,
dotted with tiny scrub, and therefore uneven going, since the
plants collected little mounds about their roots, and the eddies of
the sea-winds scooped hollows in the intervening spaces. Camels
appeared not sure-footed in the dark, and the starlit sand carried
little shadow, so that hummocks and holes were difficult to see.
Before midnight we halted, and I rolled myself tighter in my cloak,
and chose A. hollow of my own size and shape, and slept well in it
till nearly dawn.</p>

<p>As soon as he felt the air growing chill with the coming change,
Tafas got up, and two minutes later we were swinging forward again.
An hour after it grew bright, as we climbed a low neck of lava
drowned nearly to the top with blown sand. This joined a small flow
near the shore to the main Hejaz lava-field, whose western edge ran
up upon our right hand, and caused the coast road to lie where it
did. The neck was stony, but brief: on each side the blue lava
humped itself into low shoulders, from which, so Tafas said, it was
possible to see ships sailing on the sea. Pilgrims had built cairns
here by the road. Sometimes they were individual piles, of just
three stones set up one above the other: sometimes they were common
heaps, to which any disposed passer-by might add his
stone&mdash;not reasonably nor with known motive, but because
others did, and perhaps they knew.</p>

<p>Beyond the ridge the path descended into a broad open place, the
Masturah, or plain by which Wadi Fura flowed into the sea. Seaming
its surface with innumerable interwoven channels of loose stone, a
few inches deep, were the beds of the flood water, on those rare
occasions when there was rain in the Tareif and the courses raged
like rivers to the sea. The delta here was about six miles wide.
Down some part of it water flowed for an hour or two, or even for a
day or two, every so many years. Underground there was plenty of
moisture, protected by the overlying sand from the sun-heat; and
thorn trees and loose scrub profited by it and flourished. Some of
the trunks were a foot through: their height might be twenty feet.
The trees and bushes stood somewhat apart, in clusters, their lower
branches cropped by the hungry camels. So they looked cared for,
and had a premeditated air, which felt strange in the wilderness,
more especially as the Tehama hitherto had been a sober
bareness.</p>

<p>Two hours up-stream, so Tafas told me, was the throat where Wadi
Fura issued from the last granite hills, and there had been built a
little village, Khoreiba, of running water channels and wells and
palm-groves, inhabited by a small population of freedmen engaged in
date husbandry. This was important. We had not understood that the
bed of Wadi Fura served as a direct road from near Medina to the
neighbourhood of Rabegh. It lay so far south and east of Feisal's
supposed position in the hills that he could hardly be said to
cover it. Also Abdulla had not warned us of the existence of
Khoreiba, though it materially affected the Rabegh question, by
affording the enemy a possible watering-place, safe from our
interference, and from the guns of our warships. At Khoreiba the
Turks could concentrate a large force to attack our proposed
brigade in Rabegh.</p>

<p>In reply to further questions, Tafas disclosed that at Hajar,
east of Rabegh in the hills, was yet another supply of water, in
the hands of the Masruh, and now the headquarters of Hussein
Mabeirig, their Turcophil chief. The Turks could make that their
next stage from Khoreiba towards Mecca, leaving Rabegh unmolested
and harmless on their flank. This meant that the asked-for British
Brigade would be unable to save Mecca from the Turks. For that
purpose would be required a force with A front or a radius of
action of some twenty miles, in order to deny all three
water-supplies to the enemy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the early sunlight we lifted our camels to a steady
trot across the good going of these shingle-beds among the trees,
making for Masturah well, the first stage out from Rabegh on the
pilgrim road. There we would water and halt a little. My camel was
a delight to me, for I had not been on such an animal before. There
were no good camels in Egypt; and those of the Sinai Desert, while
hardy and strong, were not taught to pace fair and softly and
swiftly, like these rich mounts of the Arabian princes.</p>

<p>Yet her accomplishments were to-day largely wasted, since they
were reserved for riders who had the knack and asked for them, and
not for me, who expected to be carried, and had no sense of how to
ride. It was easy to sit on a camel's back without falling off, but
very difficult to understand and get the best out of her so as to
do long journeys without fatiguing either rider or beast. Tafas
gave me hints as we went: indeed, it was one of the few subjects on
which he would speak. His orders to preserve me from contact with
the world seemed to have closed even his mouth. A pity, for his
dialect interested me.</p>

<p>Quite close to the north bank of the Masturah, we found the
well. Beside it were some decayed stone walls which had been a hut,
and opposite it some little shelters of branches and palm-leaves,
under which a few Beduin were sitting. We did not greet them.
Instead, Tafas turned across to the ruinous walls, and dismounted;
and I sat in their shade while he and Abdulla watered the animals,
and drew a drink for themselves and for me. The well was old, and
broad, with a good stone steyning, and a strong coping round the
top. It was about twenty feet deep; and for the convenience of
travellers without ropes, like ourselves, a square chimney had been
contrived in the masonry, with foot and hand holds in the corners,
so that a man might descend to the water, and fill his
goat-skin.</p>

<p>Idle hands had flung so many stones down the shaft, that half
the bottom of the well was choked, and the water not abundant.
Abdulla tied his flowing sleeves about his shoulders; tucked his
gown under his cartridge belt; and clambered nimbly down and up,
bringing each time four or five gallons which he poured for our
camels into a stone trough beside the well. They drank about five
gallons each, for they had been watered at Rabegh a day back. Then
we let them moon about a little, while we sat in peace, breathing
the light wind coming off the sea. Abdulla smoked a cigarette as
reward for his exertions.</p>

<p>Some Harb came up, driving a large herd of brood camels, and
began to water them, having sent one man down the well to fill
their large leather bucket, which the others drew up hand over hand
with a loud staccato chant. We watched them, without intercourse;
for these were Masruh, and we Beni Salem; and while the two clans
were now at peace, and might pass through each other's districts,
this was only a temporary accommodation to further the Sherifs' war
against the Turks, and had little depth of goodwill in it.</p>

<p>As we watched, two riders, trotting light and fast on
thoroughbred camels, drew towards us from the north. Both were
young. One was dressed in rich Cashmere robes and heavy silk
embroidered head-cloth. The other was plainer, in white cotton,
with a red cotton head-dress. They halted beside the well; and the
more splendid one slipped gracefully to the ground without kneeling
his camel, and threw his halter to his companion, saying,
carelessly, 'Water them while I go over there and rest'. Then he
strolled across and sat down under our wall, after glancing at us
with affected unconcern. He offered a cigarette, just rolled and
licked, saying, Tour presence is from Syria?' I parried politely,
suggesting that he was from Mecca, to which he likewise made no
direct reply. We spoke a little of the war and of the leanness of
the Masruh she-camels.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other rider stood by, vacantly holding the
halters, waiting perhaps for the Harb to finish watering their herd
before taking his turn. The young lord cried What is it, Mustafa?
Water them at once'. The servant came up to say dismally, They will
not let me'. 'God's mercy!' shouted his master furiously, as he
scrambled to his feet and hit the unfortunate Mustafa three or four
sharp blows about the head and shoulders with his riding-stick 'Go
and ask them.' Mustafa looked hurt, astonished, and angry as though
he would hit back, but thought better of it, and ran to the
well.</p>

<p>The Harb, shocked, in pity made a place for him, and let his two
camels drink from their water-trough. They whispered, 'Who is he?'
and Mustapha said, 'Our Lord's cousin from Mecca'. At once they ran
and untied a bundle from one of their saddles, and spread from it
before the two riding camels fodder of the green leaves and buds of
the thorn trees. They were used to gather this by striking the low
bushes with a heavy staff, till the broken tips of the branches
rained down on a cloth stretched over the ground beneath.</p>

<p>The young Sherif watched them contentedly. When his camel had
fed, he climbed slowly and without apparent effort up its neck into
the saddle, where he settled himself leisurely, and took an
unctuous farewell of us, asking God to requite the Arabs
bountifully. They wished him a good journey; and he started
southward, while Abdulla brought our camels, and we went off
northward. Ten minutes later I heard a chuckle from old Tafas, and
saw wrinkles of delight between his grizzled beard and
moustache.</p>

<p>'What is upon you, Tafas?' said I.</p>

<p>'My Lord, you saw those two riders at the well?'</p>

<p>'The Sherif and his servant?'</p>

<p>'Yes; but they were Sherif Ali ibn el Hussein of Modhig, and his
cousin, Sherif Mohsin, lords of the Harith, who are blood enemies
of the Masruh. They feared they would be delayed or driven off the
water if the Arabs knew them. So they pretended to be master and
servant from Mecca. Did you see how Mohsin raged when Ali beat him?
Ali is a devil. While only eleven years old he escaped from his
father's house to his uncle, a robber of pilgrims by trade; and
with him he lived by his hands for many months, till his father
caught him. He was with our lord Feisal from the first day's battle
in Medina, and led the Ateiba in the plains round Aar and Bir
Derwish. It was all camel-fighting; and Ali would have no man with
him who could not do as he did, run beside his camel, and leap with
one hand into the saddle, carrying his rifle. The children of
Harith are children of battle.' For the first time the old man's
mouth was full of words.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p>While he spoke we scoured along the dazzling plain, now nearly
bare of trees, and turning slowly softer under foot. At first it
had been grey shingle, packed like gravel. Then the sand increased
and the stones grew rarer, till we could distinguish the colours of
the separate flakes, porphyry, green schist, basalt. At last it was
nearly pure white sand, under which lay a harder stratum. Such
going was like a pile-carpet for our camels' running. The particles
of sand were clean and polished, and caught the blaze of sun like
little diamonds in a reflection so fierce, that after a while I
could not endure it. I frowned hard, and pulled the head-cloth
forward in a peak over my eyes, and beneath them, too, like a
beaver, trying to shut out the heat which rose in glassy waves off
the ground, and beat up against my face. Eighty miles in front of
us, the huge peak of Rudhwa behind Yenbo was looming and fading in
<i>the</i> dazzle of vapour which hid its foot. Quite near in the
plain rose the little shapeless hills of Hesna, which seemed to
block the way. To our right was the steep ridge of Beni Ayub,
toothed and narrow like a saw-blade, the first edge of the sheaf of
mountains between the Tehama and the high scarp of the tableland
about Medina. These Tareif Beni Ayub fell away on their north into
a blue series of smaller hills, soft in character, behind which
lofty range after range in a jagged stairway, red now the sun grew
low, climbed up to the towering central mass of Jebel Subh with its
fantastic granite spires.</p>

<p>A little later we turned to the right, off the pilgrim road, and
took a short cut across gradually rising ground of flat basalt
ridges, buried in sand till only their topmost piles showed above
the surface. It held moisture enough to be well grown over with
hard wiry grass and shrubs up and down the slopes, on which a few
sheep and goats were pasturing. There Tafas showed me a stone,
which was the limit of the district of the Masruh, and told me with
grim pleasure that he was now at home, in his tribal property, and
might come off his guard.</p>

<p>Men have looked upon the desert as barren land, the free holding
of whoever chose; but in fact each hill and valley in it had a man
who was its acknowledged owner and would quickly assert the right
of his family or clan to it, against aggression. Even the wells and
trees had their masters, who allowed men to make firewood of the
one and drink of the other freely, as much as was required for
their need, but who would instantly check anyone trying to turn the
property to account and to exploit it or its products among others
for private benefit. The desert was held in a crazed communism by
which Nature and the elements were for the free use of every known
friendly person for his own purposes and no more. Logical outcomes
were the reduction of this licence to privilege by the men of the
desert, and their hardness to strangers unprovided with
introduction or guarantee, since the common security lay in the
common responsibility of kinsmen. Tafas, in his own country, could
bear the burden of my safe-keeping lightly.</p>

<p>The valleys were becoming sharply marked, with clean beds of
sand and shingle, and an occasional large boulder brought down by a
flood. There were many broom bushes, restfully grey and green to
the eye, and good for fuel, though useless as pasture. We ascended
steadily till we rejoined the main track of the pilgrim road. Along
this we held our way till sunset, when we came into sight of the
hamlet of Bir el Sheikh. In the first dark as the supper fires were
lighted we rode down its wide open street and halted. Tafas went
into one of the twenty miserable huts, and in a few whispered words
and long silences bought flour, of which with water he kneaded a
dough cake two inches thick and eight inches across. This he buried
in the ashes of a brushwood fire, provided for him by a Subh woman
whom he seemed to know. When the cake was warmed he drew it out of
the fire, and clapped it to shake off the dust; then we shared it
together, while Abdulla went away to buy himself tobacco.</p>

<p>They told me the place had two stone-lined wells at the bottom
of the southward slope, but I felt disinclined to go and look at
them, for the long ride that day had tired my unaccustomed muscles,
and the heat of the plain had been painful. My skin was blistered
by it, and my eyes ached with the glare of light striking up at a
sharp angle from the silver sand, and from the shining pebbles. The
last two years I had spent in Cairo, at a desk all day or thinking
hard in a little overcrowded office full of distracting noises,
with a hundred rushing things to say, but no bodily need except to
come and go each day between office and hotel. In consequence the
novelty of this change was severe, since time had not been given me
gradually to accustom myself to the pestilent beating of the
Arabian sun, and the long monotony of camel pacing. There was to be
another stage tonight, and a long day to-morrow before Feisal's
camp would be reached.</p>

<p>So I was grateful for the cooking and the marketing, which spent
one hour, and for the second hour of rest after it which we took by
common consent; and sorry when it ended, and we re-mounted, and
rode in pitch darkness up valleys and down valleys, passing in and
out of bands of air, which were hot in the confined hollows, but
fresh and stirring in the open places. The ground under foot must
have been sandy, because the silence of our passage hurt my
straining ears, and smooth, for I was always falling asleep in the
saddle, to wake a few seconds later suddenly and sickeningly, as I
clutched by instinct at the saddle post to recover my balance which
had been thrown out by some irregular stride of the animal. It was
too dark, and the forms of the country were too neutral, to hold my
heavy-lashed, peering eyes. At length we stopped for good, long
after midnight; and I was rolled up in my cloak and asleep in a
most comfortable little sand-grave before Tafas had done
knee-haltering my camel.</p>

<p>Three hours later we were on the move again, helped now by the
last shining of the moon. We marched down Wadi Mared, the night of
it dead, hot, silent, and on each side sharp-pointed hills standing
up black and white in the exhausted air. There were many trees.
Dawn finally came to us as we passed out of the narrows into a
broad place, over whose flat floor an uneasy wind span circles,
capriciously in the dust. The day strengthened always, and now
showed Bir ibn Hassani just to our right. The trim settlement of
absurd little houses, brown and white, holding together for
security's sake, looked doll-like and more lonely than the desert,
in the immense shadow of the dark precipice of Subh, behind. While
we watched it, hoping to see life at its doors, the sun was rushing
up, and the fretted cliffs, those thousands of feet above our
heads, became outlined in hard refracted shafts of white light
against a sky still sallow with the transient dawn.</p>

<p>We rode on across the great valley. A camel-rider, garrulous and
old, came out from the houses and jogged over to join us. He named
himself Khallaf, too friendly-like. His salutation came after a
pause in a trite stream of chat; and when it was returned he tried
to force us into conversation. However, Tafas grudged his company,
and gave him short answers. Khallaf persisted, and finally, to
improve his footing, bent down and burrowed in his saddle pouch
till he found a small covered pot of enamelled iron, containing a
liberal portion of the staple of travel in the Hejaz. This was the
unleavened dough cake of yesterday, but crumbled between the
fingers while still warm, and moistened with liquid butter till its
particles would fall apart only reluctantly. It was then sweetened
for eating with ground sugar, and scooped up like damp sawdust in
pressed pellets with the fingers.</p>

<p>I ate a little, on this my first attempt, while Tafas and
Abdulla played at it vigorously; so for his bounty Khallaf went
half-hungry: deservedly, for it was thought effeminate by the Arabs
to carry a provision of food for a little journey of one hundred
miles. We were now fellows, and the chat began again while Khallaf
told us about the last fighting, and a reverse Feisal had had the
day before. It seemed he had been beaten out of Kheif in the head
of Wadi Safra, and was now at Hamra, only a little way in front of
us; or at least Khallaf thought he was there: we might learn for
sure in Wasta, the next village on our road. The fighting had not
been severe; but the few casualties were all among the tribesmen of
Tafas and Khallaf; and the names and hurts of each were told in
order.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I looked about, interested to find myself in a new
country. The sand and detritus of last night and of Bir el Sheikh
had vanished. We were marching up a valley, from two hundred to
five hundred yards in width, of shingle and light soil, quite firm,
with occasional knolls of shattered green stone cropping out in its
midst. There were many thorn trees, some of them woody acacias,
thirty feet and more in height, beautifully green, with enough of
tamarisk and soft scrub to give the whole a charming, well kept,
park-like air, now in the long soft shadows of the early morning.
The swept ground was so flat and clean, the pebbles so variegated,
their colours so joyously blended that they gave a sense of design
to the landscape; and this feeling was strengthened by the straight
lines and sharpness of the hills. They rose on each hand regularly,
precipices a thousand feet in height, of granite-brown and dark
porphyry-coloured rock, with pink stains; and by a strange fortune
these glowing hills rested on hundred-foot bases of the
cross-grained stone, whose unusual colour suggested a thin growth
of moss.</p>

<p>We rode along this beautiful place for about seven miles, to a
low watershed, crossed by a wall of granite slivers, now little
more than a shapeless heap, but once no doubt a barrier. It ran
from cliff to cliff, and even far up the hill-sides, wherever the
slopes were not too steep to climb. In the centre, where the road
passed, had been two small enclosures like pounds. I asked Khallaf
the purpose of the wall. He replied that he had been in Damascus
and Constantinople and Cairo, and had many friends among the great
men of Egypt. Did I know any of the English there? Khallaf seemed
curious about my intentions and my history. He tried to trip me in
Egyptian phrases. When I answered in the dialect of Aleppo he spoke
of prominent Syrians of his acquaintance. I knew them, too; and he
switched off into local politics, asking careful questions,
delicately and indirectly, about the Sherif and his sons, and what
I thought Feisal was going to do. I understood less of this than
he, and parried inconsequentially. Tafas came to my rescue, and
changed the subject. Afterwards we knew that Khallaf was in Turkish
pay, and used to send frequent reports of what came past Bir ibn
Hassani for the Arab forces.</p>

<p>Across the wall we were in an affluent of Wadi Safra, a more
wasted and stony valley among less brilliant hills. It ran into
another, far down which to the west lay a cluster of dark
palm-trees, which the Arabs said was Jedida, one of the slave
villages in Wadi Safra. We turned to the right, across another
saddle, and then downhill for a few miles to a corner of tall
cliffs. We rounded this and found ourselves suddenly in Wadi Safra,
the valley of our seeking, and in the midst of Wasta, its largest
village. Wasta seemed to be many nests of houses, clinging to the
hillsides each side the torrent-bed on banks of alluvial soil, or
standing on detritus islands between the various deep-swept
channels whose sum made up the parent valley.</p>

<p>Riding between two or three of these built-up islands, we made
for the far bank of the valley. On our way was the main bed of the
winter floods, a sweep of white shingle and boulders, quite flat.
Down its middle, from palm-grove on the one side to palm-grove on
the other, lay a reach of clear water, perhaps two hundred yards
long and twelve feet wide, sand-bottomed, and bordered on each
brink by a ten-foot lawn of thick grass and flowers. On it we
halted a moment to let our camels put their heads down and drink
their fill, and the relief of the grass to our eyes after the
day-long hard glitter of the pebbles was so sudden that
involuntarily I glanced up to see if a cloud had not covered the
face of the sun.</p>

<p>We rode up the stream to the garden from which it ran sparkling
in a stone-lined channel; and then we turned along the mud wall of
the garden in the shadow of its palms, to another of the detached
hamlets. Tafas led the way up its little street (the houses were so
low that from our saddles we looked down upon their clay roofs),
and near one of the larger houses stopped and beat upon the door of
an uncovered court. A slave opened to us, and we dismounted in
privacy. Tafas haltered the camels, loosed their girths, and
strewed before them green fodder from a fragrant pile beside the
gate. Then he led me into the guest-room of the house, a dark clean
little mud-brick place, roofed with half palm-logs under hammered
earth. We sat down on the palm-leaf mat which ran along the dais.
The day in this stifling valley had grown very hot; and gradually
we lay back side by side. Then the hum of the bees in the gardens
without, and of the flies hovering over our veiled faces within,
lulled us into sleep.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<p>Before we awoke, a meal of bread and dates had been prepared for
us by the people of the house. The dates were new, meltingly sweet
and good, like none I had ever tasted. The owner of the property, a
Harbi, was, with his neighbours, away serving Feisal; and his women
and children were tenting in the hills with the camels. At the
most, the tribal Arabs of Wadi Safra lived in their villages five
months a year. For the other seasons the gardens were entrusted to
slaves, negroes like the grown lads who brought in the tray to us,
and whose thick limbs and plump shining bodies looked curiously out
of place among the birdlike Arabs. Khallaf told me these blacks
were originally from Africa, brought over as children by their
nominal Takruri fathers, and sold during the pilgrimage, in Mecca.
When grown strong they were worth from fifty to eighty pounds
apiece, and were looked after carefully as befitted their price.
Some became house or body servants with their masters; but the
majority were sent out to the palm villages of these feverish
valleys of running water, whose climate was too bad for Arab
labour, but where they flourished and built themselves solid
houses, and mated with women slaves, and did all the manual work of
the holding.</p>

<p>They were very numerous&mdash;for instance, there were thirteen
villages of them side by side in this Wadi Safra&mdash;so they
formed a society of their own, and lived much at their pleasure.
Their work was hard, but the supervision loose, and escape easy.
Their legal status was bad, for they had no appeal to tribal
justice, or even to the Sherifs courts; but public opinion and
self-interest deprecated any cruelty towards them, and the tenet of
the faith that to enlarge a slave is a good deed, meant in practice
that nearly all gained freedom in the end. They made pocket-money
during their service, if they were ingenious. Those I saw had
property, and declared themselves contented. They grew melons,
marrows, cucumber, grapes and tobacco for their own account, in
addition to the dates, whose surplus was sent across to the Sudan
by sailing dhow, and there exchanged for corn, clothing and the
luxuries of Africa or Europe.</p>

<p>After the midday heat was passed we mounted again, and rode up
the clear, slow rivulet till it was hidden within the palm-gardens,
behind their low boundary walls of sun-dried clay. In and out
between the tree roots were dug little canals a foot or two deep,
so contrived that the stream might be let into them from the stone
channel and each tree watered in its turn. The head of water was
owned by the community, and shared out among the landowners for so
many minutes or hours daily or weekly according to the traditional
use. The water was a little brackish, as was needful for the best
palms; but it was sweet enough in the wells of private water in the
groves. These wells were very frequent, and found water three or
four feet below the surface.</p>

<p>Our way took us through the central village and its market
street. There was little in the shops; and all the place felt
decayed. A generation ago Wasta was populous (they said of a
thousand houses); but one day there rolled a huge wall of water
down Wadi Safra, the embankments of many palm-gardens were
breached, and the palm trees swept away. Some of the islands on
which houses had stood for centuries were submerged, and the mud
houses melted back again into mud, killing or drowning the
unfortunate slaves within. The men could have been replaced, and
the trees, had the soil remained; but the gardens had been built up
of earth carefully won from the normal freshets by years of labour,
and this wave of water&mdash;eight feet deep, running in a race for
three days&mdash;reduced the plots in its track to their primordial
banks of stones.</p>

<p>A little above Wasta we came to Kharma, a tiny settlement with
rich palm-groves, where a tributary ran in from the north. Beyond
Kharma the valley widened somewhat, to an average of perhaps four
hundred yards, with a bed of fine shingle and sand, laid very
smooth by the winter rains. The walls were of bare red and black
rock, whose edges and ridges were sharp as knife blades, and
reflected the sun like metal. They made the freshness of the trees
and grass seem luxurious. We now saw parties of Feisal's soldiers,
and grazing herds of their saddle camels. Before we reached Harhra
every nook in the rocks or clump of trees was a bivouac. They cried
cheery greetings to Tafas, who came to life again, waving back and
calling to them, while he pressed on quickly to end his duty
towards me.</p>

<p>Hamra opened on our left. It seemed a village of about one
hundred houses, buried in gardens among mounds of earth some twenty
feet in height. We forded a little stream, and went up a walled
path between trees to the top of one of these mounds, where we made
our camels kneel by the yard-gate of a long, low house. Tafas said
something to a slave who stood there with silver-hilted sword in
hand. He led me to an inner court, on whose further side, framed
between the uprights of a black doorway, stood a white figure
waiting tensely for me. I felt at first glance that this was the
man I had come to Arabia to seek&mdash;the leader who would bring
the Arab Revolt to full glory. Feisal looked very tall and
pillar-like, very slender, in his long white silk robes and his
brown head-cloth bound with a brilliant scarlet and gold cord. His
eyelids were dropped; and his black beard and colourless face were
like a mask against the strange, still watchfulness of his body.
His hands were crossed in front of him on his dagger.</p>

<p>I greeted him. He made way for me into the room, and sat down on
his carpet near the door. As my eyes grew accustomed to the shade,
they saw that the little room held many silent figures, looking at
me or at Feisal steadily. He remained staring down at his hands,
which were twisting slowly about his dagger. At last he inquired
softly how I had found the journey. I spoke of the heat, and he
asked how long from Rabegh, commenting that I had ridden fast for
the season.</p>

<p>'And do you like our place here in Wadi Safra?'</p>

<p>Well; but it is far from Damascus.'</p>

<p>The word had fallen like a sword in their midst. There was a
quiver. Then everybody present stiffened where he sat, and held his
breath for a silent minute. Some, perhaps, were dreaming of far off
success: others may have thought it a reflection on their late
defeat. Feisal at length lifted his eyes, smiling at me, and said,
'Praise be to God, there are Turks nearer us than that'. We all
smiled with him; and I rose and excused myself for the moment.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<p>Under tall arcades of palms with ribbed and groined branches, in
a soft meadow, I found the trim camp of Egyptian Army soldiers with
Nafi Bey, their Egyptian major, sent lately from the Sudan by Sir
Reginald Wingate to help the Arab rebellion. They comprised a
mountain battery and some machine-guns, and looked smarter than
they felt. Nafi himself was an amiable fellow, kind and hospitable
to me in spite of weak health and his resentment at having been
sent so far away into the desert to serve in an unnecessary and
toilsome war.</p>

<p>Egyptians, being home-loving persons and comfortable, found
strangeness always a misery. In this bad instance they suffered
hardship for a philanthropic end, which made it harder. They were
fighting the Turks, for whom they had a sentimental regard, on
behalf of the Arabs, an alien people speaking a language kindred to
their own, but appearing therefore all the more unlike in
character, and crude in life. The Arabs seemed hostile to the
material blessings of civilization rather than appreciative of
them. They met with a ribald hoot well-meaning attempts to furnish
their bareness.</p>

<p>Englishmen being sure of their own absolute excellence would
persist in help without grumbling overmuch; but the Egyptians lost
faith. They had neither that collective sense of duty towards their
State, nor that feeling of individual obligation to push struggling
humanity up its road. The vicarious policemanship which was the
strongest emotion of Englishmen towards another man's muddle, in
their case was replaced by the instinct to pass by as discreetly
far as possible on the other side. So, though all was well with
these soldiers, and they had abundant rations and good health and
no casualties, yet they found fault with the handling of the
universe, and hoped this unexpected Englishman had come to set it
right.</p>

<p>Feisal was announced with Maulud el Mukhlus, the Arab zealot of
Tekrit, who, for rampant nationalism had been twice degraded in the
Turkish Army, and had spent an exile of two years in Nejd as a
secretary with ibn Rashid. He had commanded the Turkish cavalry
before Shaiba, and had been taken by us there. As soon as he heard
of the rebellion of the Sherif he had volunteered for him, and had
been the first regular officer to join Feisal. He was now nominally
his A.D.C.</p>

<p>Bitterly he complained that they were in every way ill-equipped.
This was the main cause of their present plight. They got thirty
thousand pounds a month from the Sherif, but little flour and rice,
little barley, few rifles, insufficient ammunition, no
machine-guns, no mountain guns, no technical help, no
information.</p>

<p>I stopped Maulud there and said that my coming was expressly to
learn what they lacked and to report it, but that I could work with
them only if they would explain to me their general situation.
Feisal agreed, and began to sketch to me the history of their
revolt from its absolute beginning.</p>

<p>The first rush on Medina had been a desperate business. The
Arabs were ill-armed and short of ammunition, the Turks in great
force, since Fakhri's detachment had just arrived and the troops to
escort von Stotzingen to Yemen were still in the town. At the
height of the crisis the Beni Ali broke; and the Arabs were thrust
out beyond the walls. The Turks then opened fire on them with their
artillery; and the Arabs, unused to this new arm, became terrified.
The Ageyl and Ateiba got into safety and refused to move out again.
Feisal and Ali ibn el Hussein vainly rode about in front of their
men in the open, to show them that the bursting shells were not as
fatal as they sounded. The demoralization deepened.</p>

<p>Sections of Beni Ali tribesmen approached the Turkish command
with an offer to surrender, if their villages were spared. Fakhri
played with them, and in the ensuing lull of hostilities surrounded
the Awali suburb with his troops: then suddenly he ordered them to
carry it by assault and to massacre every living thing within its
walls. Hundreds of the inhabitants were raped and butchered, the
houses fired, and living and dead alike thrown back into the
flames. Fakhri and his men had served together and had learned the
arts of both the slow and the fast kill upon the Armenians in the
North.</p>

<p>This bitter taste of the Turkish mode of war sent a shock across
Arabia; for the first rule of Arab war was that women were
inviolable: the second that the lives and honour of children too
young to fight with men were to be spared: the third, that property
impossible to carry off should be left undamaged. The Arabs with
Feisal perceived that they were opposed to new customs, and fell
back out of touch to gain time to readjust themselves. There could
no longer be any question of submission: the sack of Awali had
opened blood feud upon blood feud, and put on them the duty of
fighting to the end of their force: but it was plain now that it
would be a long affair, and that with muzzle-loading guns for sole
weapons, they could hardly expect to win.</p>

<p>So they fell back from the level plains about Medina into the
hills across the Sultani-road, about Aar and Raha and Bir Abbas,
where they rested a little, while Ali and Feisal sent messenger
after messenger down to Rabegh, their sea-base, to learn when fresh
stores and money and arms might be expected. The revolt had begun
haphazard, on their father's explicit orders, and the old man, too
independent to take his sons into his full confidence, had not
worked out with them any arrangements for prolonging it. So the
reply was only a little food. Later some Japanese rifles, most of
them broken, were received. Such barrels as were still whole were
so foul that the too-eager Arabs burst them on the first trial. No
money was sent up at all: to take its place Feisal filled a decent
chest with stones, had it locked and corded carefully, guarded on
each daily march by his own slaves, and introduced meticulously
into his tent each night. By such theatricals the brothers tried to
hold a melting force.</p>

<p>At last Ali went down to Rabegh to inquire what was wrong with
the organization. He found that Hussein Mabeirig, the local chief,
had made up his mind that the Turks would be victorious (he had
tried conclusions with them twice himself and had the worst of it),
and accordingly decided theirs was the best cause to follow. As the
stores for the Sherif were landed by the British he appropriated
them and stored them away secretly in his own houses. Ali made a
demonstration, and sent urgent messages for his half-brother Zeid
to join him from Jidda with reinforcements. Hussein, in fear,
slipped off to the hills, an outlaw. The two Sherifs took
possession of his villages. In them they found great stores of
arms, and food enough for their armies for a month. The temptation
of a spell of leisured ease was too much for them: they settled
down in Rabegh.</p>

<p>This left Feisal alone up country, and he soon found himself
isolated, in a hollow situation, driven to depend upon his native
resources. He bore it for a time, but in August took advantage of
the visit of Colonel Wilson to the newly-conquered Yenbo, to come
down and give a full explanation of his urgent needs. Wilson was
impressed with him and his story, and at once promised him a
battery of mountain guns and some maxims, to be handled by men and
officers of the Egyptian Army garrison in the Sudan. This explained
the presence of Nafi Bey and his units.</p>

<p>The Arabs rejoiced when they came, and believed they were now
equals of the Turk; but the four guns were twenty-year-old Krupps,
with a range of only three thousand yards; and their crews were not
eager enough in brain and spirit for irregular fighting. However,
they went foward with the mob and drove in the Turkish outposts,
and then their supports, until Fakhri becoming seriously alarmed,
came down himself, inspected the front, and at once reinforced the
threatened detachment at Bir Abbas to some three thousand strong.
The Turks had field guns and howitzers with them, and the added
advantage of high ground for observation. They began to worry the
Arabs by indirect fire, and nearly dropped a shell on Feisal's tent
while all the head men were conferring within. The Egyptian gunners
were asked to return the fire and smother the enemy guns. They had
to plead that their weapons were useless, since they could not
carry the nine thousand yards. They were derided; and the Arabs ran
back again into the defiles.</p>

<p>Feisal was deeply discouraged. His men were tired. He had lost
many of them. His only effective tactics against the enemy had been
to chase in suddenly upon their rear by fast mounted charges, and
many camels had been killed, or wounded or worn out in these
expensive measures. He demurred to carrying the whole war upon his
own neck while Abdulla delayed in Mecca, and Ali and Zeid at
Rabegh. Finally he withdrew the bulk of his forces, leaving the
Harb sub-tribes who lived by Bir Abbas to keep up pressure on the
Turkish supply columns and communications by a repeated series of
such raids as those which he himself found impossible to
maintain.</p>

<p>Yet he had no fear that the Turks would again come forward
against him suddenly. His failure to make any impression on them
had not imbued him with the smallest respect for them. His late
retirement to Hamra was not forced: it was a gesture of disgust
because he was bored by his obvious impotence, and was determined
for a little while to have the dignity of rest.</p>

<p>After all, the two sides were still untried. The armament of the
Turks made them so superior at long range that the Arabs never got
to grips. For this reason most of the hand-to-hand fighting had
taken place at night, when the guns were blinded. To my ears they
sounded oddly primitive battles, with torrents of words on both
sides in a preliminary match of wits. After the foulest insults of
the languages they knew would come the climax, when the Turks in
frenzy called the Arabs 'English', and the Arabs screamed back
'German' at them. There were, of course, no Germans in the Hejaz,
and I was the first Englishman; but each party loved cursing, and
any epithet would sting on the tongues of such artists.</p>

<p>I asked Feisal what his plans were now. He said that till Medina
fell they were inevitably tied down there in Hejaz dancing to
Fakhri's tune. In his opinion the Turks were aiming at the
recapture of Mecca. The bulk of their strength was now in a mobile
column, which they could move towards Rabegh by a choice of routes
which kept the Arabs in constant alarm. A passive defence of the
Subh hills had shown that the Arabs did not shine as passive
resisters. When the enemy moved they must be countered by an
offensive.</p>

<p>Feisal meant to retire further yet, to the Wadi Yenbo border of
the great Juheina tribe. With fresh levies from them he would march
eastwards towards the Hejaz Railway behind Medina, at the moment
when Abdulla was advancing by the lava-desert to attack Medina from
the east. He hoped that Ali would go up simultaneously from Rabegh,
while Zeid moved into Wadi Safra to engage the big Turkish force at
Bir Abbas, and keep it out of the main battle. By this plan Medina
would be threatened or attacked on all sides at once. Whatever the
success of the attack, the concentration from three sides would at
least break up the prepared Turkish push-outwards on the fourth,
and give Rabegh and the southern Hejaz a breathing space to equip
themselves for effective defence, or counter-attack.</p>

<p>Maulud, who had sat fidgeting through our long, slow talk, could
no longer restrain himself and cried out, 'Don't write a history of
us. The needful thing is to fight and fight and kill them. Give me
a battery of Schneider mountain guns, and machine-guns, and I will
finish this off for you. We talk and talk and do nothing.' I
replied as warmly; and Maulud, a magnificent fighter, who regarded
a battle won as a battle wasted if he did not show some wound to
prove his part in it, took me up. We wrangled while Feisal sat by
and grinned delightedly at us.</p>

<p>This talk had been for him a holiday. He was encouraged even by
the trifle of my coming; for he was a man of moods, flickering
between glory and despair, and just now dead-tired. He looked years
older than thirty-one; and his dark, appealing eyes, set a little
sloping in his face, were bloodshot, and his hollow cheeks deeply
lined and puckered with reflection. His nature grudged thinking,
for it crippled his speed in action: the labour of it shrivelled
his features into swift lines of pain. In appearance he was tall,
graceful and vigorous, with the most beautiful gait, and a royal
dignity of head and shoulders. Of course he knew it, and a great
part of his public expression was by sign and gesture.</p>

<p>His movements were impetuous. He showed himself hot-tempered and
sensitive, even unreasonable, and he ran off soon on tangents.
Appetite and physical weakness were mated in him, with the spur of
courage. His personal charm, his imprudence, the pathetic hint of
frailty as the sole reserve of this proud character made him the
idol of his followers. One never asked if he were scrupulous; but
later he showed that he could return trust for trust, suspicion for
suspicion. He was fuller of wit than of humour.</p>

<p>His training in Abdul Hamid's entourage had made him past-master
in diplomacy. His military service with the Turks had given him a
working knowledge of tactics. His life in Constantinople and in the
Turkish Parliament had made him familiar with European questions
and manners. He was a careful judge of men. If he had the strength
to realize his dreams he would go very far, for he was wrapped up
in his work and lived for nothing else; but the fear was that he
would wear himself out by trying to seem to aim always a little
higher than the truth, or that he would die of too much action. His
men told me how, after a long spell of fighting, in which he had to
guard himself, and lead the charges, and control and encourage
them, he had collapsed physically and was carried away from his
victory, unconscious, with the foam flecking his lips.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, here, as it seemed, was offered to our hand, which
had only to be big enough to take it, a prophet who, if veiled,
would give cogent form to the idea behind the activity of the Arab
revolt. It was all and more than we had hoped for, much more than
our halting course deserved. The aim of my trip was fulfilled.</p>

<p>My duty was now to take the shortest road to Egypt with the
news: and the knowledge gained that evening in the palm wood grew
and blossomed in my mind into a thousand branches, laden with fruit
and shady leaves, beneath which I sat and half-listened and saw
visions, while the twilight deepened, and the night; until a line
of slaves with lamps came down the winding paths between the palm
trunks, and with Feisal and Maulud we walked back through the
gardens to the little house, with its courts still full of waiting
people, and to the hot inner room in which the familiars were
assembled; and there we sat down together to the smoking bowl of
rice and meat set upon the food-carpet for our supper by the
slaves.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<p>So mixed was the company, Sherifs, Meccans, sheikhs of the
Juheina and Ateiba, Mesopotamians, Ageyl, that I threw apples of
discord, inflammatory subjects of talk amongst them, to sound their
mettle and beliefs without delay. Feisal, smoking innumerable
cigarettes, kept command of the conversation even at its hottest,
and it was fine to watch him do it. He showed full mastery of tact,
with a real power of disposing men's feelings to his wish. Storrs
was as efficient; but Storrs paraded his strength, exhibiting all
the cleverness and machinery, the movements of his hands which made
the creatures dance. Feisal seemed to govern his men unconsciously:
hardly to know how he stamped his mind on them, hardly to care
whether they obeyed. It was as great art as Storrs'; and it
concealed itself, for Feisal was born to it.</p>

<p>The Arabs loved him openly: indeed, these chance meetings made
clear how to the tribes the Sherif and his sons were heroic. Sherif
Hussein (Sayidna as they called him) was outwardly so clean and
gentle-mannered as to seem weak; but this appearance hid a crafty
policy, deep ambition, and an un-Arabian foresight, strength of
character and obstinacy. His interest in natural history reinforced
his sporting instincts, and made him (when he pleased) a fair copy
of a Beduin prince, while his Circassian mother had endowed him
with qualities foreign to both Turk and Arab, and he displayed
considerable astuteness in turning now one, now another of his
inherited assets to present advantage.</p>

<p>Yet the school of Turkish politics was so ignoble that not even
the best could graduate from it unaffected. Hussein when young had
been honest, outspoken...and he learned not merely to suppress his
speech, but to use speech to conceal his honest purpose. The art,
over-indulged, became a vice from which he could not free himself.
In old age ambiguity covered his every communication. Lake a cloud
it hid his decision of character, his worldly wisdom, his cheerful
strength. Many denied <i>him</i> such qualities: but history gave
proof.</p>

<p>One instance of his worldly wisdom was the upbringing of his
sons. The Sultan had made them live in Constantinople to receive a
Turkish education. Sherif Hussein saw to it that the education was
general and good. When they came back to the Hejaz as young
effendis in European clothes with Turkish manners, the father
ordered them into Arab dress; and, to rub up their Arabic, gave
them Meccan companions and sent them out into the wilds, with the
Camel Corps, to patrol the pilgrim roads.</p>

<p>The young men thought it might be an amusing trip, but were
dashed when their father forbade them special food, bedding, or
soft-padded saddles. He would not let them back to Mecca, but kept
them out for months in all seasons guarding the roads by day and by
night, handling every variety of man, and learning fresh methods of
riding and fighting. Soon they hardened, and became self-reliant,
with that blend of native intelligence and vigour which so often
comes in a crossed stock. Their formidable family group was admired
and efficient, but curiously isolated in their world. They were
natives of no country, lovers of no private plot of ground. They
had no real confidants or ministers; and no one of them seemed open
to another, or to the father, of whom they stood in awe.</p>

<p>The debate after supper was an animated one. In my character as
a Syrian I made sympathetic reference to the Arab leaders who had
been executed in Damascus by Jemal Pasha. They took me up sharply:
the published papers had disclosed that these men were in touch
with foreign Governments, and ready to accept French or British
suzerainty as the price of help. This was a crime against Arab
nationality, and Jemal had only executed the implied sentence.
Feisal smiled, almost winked, at me. 'You see,' he explained, 'we
are now of necessity tied to the British. We are delighted to be
their friends, grateful for their help, expectant of our future
profit. But we are not British subjects. We would be more at ease
if they were not such disproportionate allies.'</p>

<p>I told a story of Abdulla el Raashid, on the way up to Hamra. He
had groaned to me of the British sailors coming ashore each day at
Rabegh. 'Soon they will stay nights, and then they will live here
always, and take the country.' To cheer him I had spoken of
millions of Englishmen now ashore in France, and of the French not
afraid.</p>

<p>Whereat he had turned on me scornfully, asking if I meant to
compare France with the land of Hejazi?</p>

<p>Feisal mused a little and said, I am not a Hejazi by upbringing;
and yet, by God, I am jealous for it. And though I know the British
do not want it, yet what can I say, when they took the Sudan, also
not wanting it? They hunger for desolate lands, to build them up;
and so, perhaps, one day Arabia will seem to them precious. Your
good and my good, perhaps they are different, and either forced
good or forced evil will make a people cry with pain. Does the ore
admire the flame which transforms it? There is no reason for
offence, but a people too weak are clamant over their little own.
Our race will have a cripple's temper till it has found its
feet.'</p>

<p>The ragged, lousy tribesmen who had eaten with us astonished me
by their familiar understanding of intense political nationality,
an abstract idea they could hardly have caught from the educated
classes of the Hejaz towns, from those Hindus, Javanese,
Bokhariots, Sudanese, Turks, out of sympathy with Arab ideals, and
indeed just then suffering A little from the force of local
sentiment, springing too high after its sudden escape from Turkish
control. Sherif Hussein had had the worldly wisdom to base his
precepts on the instinctive belief of the Arabs that they were of
the salt of the earth and self-sufficient. Then, enabled by his
alliance with us to back his doctrine by arms and money, he was
assured of success.</p>

<p>Of course, this success was not level throughout. The great body
of Sherifs, eight hundred or nine hundred of them, understood his
nationalist doctrine and were his missionaries, successful
missionaries thanks to the revered descent from the Prophet, which
gave them the power to hold men's minds, and to direct their
courses into the willing quietness of eventual obedience.</p>

<p>The tribes had followed the smoke of their racial fanaticism.
The towns might sigh for the cloying inactivity of Ottoman rule:
the tribes were convinced that they had made a free and Arab
Government, and that each of them was It. They were independent and
would enjoy themselves&mdash;a conviction and resolution which
might have led to anarchy, if they had not made more stringent the
family tie, and the bonds of kin-responsibility. But this entailed
a negation of central power. The Sherif might have legal
sovereignty abroad, if he hiked the high-sounding toy; but home
affairs were to be customary. The problem of the foreign
theorists&mdash;Is Damascus to rule the Hejaz, or can Hejaz rule
Damascus?' did not trouble them at all, for they would not have it
set. The Semites' idea of nationality was the independence of clans
and villages, and their ideal of national union was episodic
combined resistance to an intruder. Constructive policies, an
organized state, an extended empire, were not so much beyond their
sight as hateful in it. They were fighting to get rid of Empire,
not to win it.</p>

<p>The feeling of the Syrians and Mesopotamians in these Arab
armies was indirect. They believed that by fighting in the local
ranks, even here in Hejaz, they were vindicating the general rights
of all Arabs to national existence; and without envisaging one
State, or even a confederation of States, they were definitely
looking northward, wishing to add an autonomous Damascus and Bagdad
to the Arab family. They were weak in material resources, and even
after success would be, since their world was agricultural and
pastoral, without minerals, and could never be strong in modern
armaments. Were it otherwise, we should have had to pause before
evoking in the strategic centre of the Middle East new national
movements of such abounding vigour.</p>

<p>Of religious fanaticism there was little trace. The Sherif
refused in round terms to give a religious twist to his rebellion.
His fighting creed was nationality. The tribes knew that the Turks
were Moslems, and thought that the Germans were probably true
friends of Islam. They knew that the British were Christians, and
that the British were their allies. In the circumstances, their
religion would not have been of much help to them, and they had put
it aside. 'Christian fights Christian, so why should not
Mohammedans do the same? What we want is a Government which speaks
our own language of Arabic and will let us live in peace. Also we
hate those Turks.'</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<p>Next morning I was up early and out among Feisal's troops
towards the side of Kheif, by myself, trying to feel the pulse of
their opinions in a moment, by such tricks as those played upon
their chiefs the night before. Time was of the essence of my
effort, for it was necessary to gain in ten days the impressions
which would ordinarily have been the fruit of weeks of observing in
my crab-fashion, that sideways-slipping affair of the senses.
Normally I would go along all day, with the sounds immediate, but
blind to every detail, only generally aware that there were things
red, or things grey, or clear things about me. To-day my eyes had
to be switched straight to my brain, that I might note a thing or
two the more clearly by contrast with the former mistiness. Such
things were nearly always shapes: rocks and trees, or men's bodies
in repose or movement: not small things like flowers, nor qualities
like colour.</p>

<p>Yet here was strong need of a lively reporter. In this drab war
the least irregularity was a joy to all, and McMahon's strongest
course was to exploit the latent imagination of the General Staff.
I believed in the Arab movement, and was confident, before ever I
came, that in it was the idea to tear Turkey into pieces; but
others in Egypt lacked faith, and had been taught nothing
intelligent of the Arabs in the field. By noting down something of
the spirit of these romantics in the hills about the Holy Cities I
might gain the sympathy of Cairo for the further measures necessary
to help them.</p>

<p>The men received me cheerfully. Beneath every great rock or hush
they sprawled like lazy scorpions, resting from the heat, and
refreshing their brown limbs with the early coolness of the shaded
stone. Because of my khaki they took me for a Turk-trained officer
who had deserted to them, and were profuse in good-humoured but
ghastly suggestions of how they should treat me. Most of them were
young, though the term 'fighting man' in the Hejaz meant anyone
between twelve and sixty sane enough to shoot. They were a
tough-looking crowd, dark-coloured, some negroid. They were
physically thin, but exquisitely made, moving with an oiled
activity altogether delightful to watch. It did not seem possible
that men could be hardier or harder. They would ride immense
distances day after day, run through sand and over rocks bare-foot
in the heat for hours without pain, and climb their hills like
goats. Their clothing was mainly a loose shirt, with sometimes
short cotton drawers, and a head-shawl usually of red cloth, which
acted towel or handkerchief or sack as required. They were
corrugated with bandoliers, and fired joy-shots when they
could.</p>

<p>They were in wild spirits, shouting that the war might last ten
years. It was the fattest time the hills had ever known. The Sherif
was feeding not only the fighting men, but their families, and
paying two pounds a month for a man, four for a camel. Nothing else
would have performed the miracle of keeping a tribal army in the
field for five months on end. It was our habit to sneer at Oriental
soldiers' love of pay; but the Hejaz campaign was a good example of
the limitations of that argument. The Turks were offering great
bribes, and obtaining little service&mdash;no active service. The
Arabs took their money, and gave gratifying assurances in exchange;
yet these very tribes would be meanwhile in touch with Feisal, who
obtained service for his payment. The Turks cut the throats of
their prisoners with knives, as though they were butchering sheep.
Feisal offered a reward of a pound a head for prisoners, and had
many carried in to him unhurt. He also paid for captured mules or
rifles.</p>

<p>The actual contingents were continually shifting, in obedience
to the rule of flesh. A family would own a rifle, and the sons
serve in turn for a few days each. Married men alternated between
camp and wife, and sometimes a whole clan would become bored and
take a rest. Consequently the paid men were more than those
mobilized; and policy often gave to great sheikhs, as wages, money
that was a polite bribe for friendly countenance. Feisal's eight
thousand men were one in ten camel-corps and the rest hill-men.
They served only under their tribal sheikhs, and near home,
arranging their own food and transport. Nominally each sheikh had a
hundred followers. Sherifs acted as group leaders, in virtue of
their privileged position, which raised them above the jealousies
which shackled the tribesmen.</p>

<p>Blood feuds were nominally healed, and really suspended in the
Sherifian area: Billi and Juheina, Ateiba and Ageyl living and
fighting side by side in Feisal's army. All the same, the members
of one tribe were shy of those of another, and within the tribe no
man would quite trust his neighbour. Each might be, usually was,
wholehearted against the Turk, but perhaps not quite to the point
of failing to work off a family grudge upon a family enemy in the
field. Consequently they could not attack. One company of Turks
firmly entrenched in open country could have defied the entire army
of them; and a pitched defeat, with its casualties, would have
ended the war by sheer horror.</p>

<p>I concluded that the tribesmen were good for defence only. Their
acquisitive recklessness made them keen on booty, and whetted them
to tear up railways, plunder caravans, and steal camels; but they
were too free-minded to endure command, or to fight in team. A man
who could fight well by himself made generally a bad soldier, and
these champions seemed to me no material for our drilling; but if
we strengthened them by light automatic guns of the Lewis type, to
be handled by themselves, they might be capable of holding their
hills and serving as an efficient screen behind which we could
build up, perhaps at Rabegh, an Arab regular mobile column, capable
of meeting a Turkish force (distracted by guerilla warfare) on
terms, and of defeating it piecemeal. For such a body of real
soldiers no recruits would be forthcoming from Hejaz. It would have
to be formed of the heavy unwarlike Syrian and Mesopotamian
towns-folk already in our hands, and officered by Arabic-speaking
officers trained in the Turkish army, men of the type and history
of Aziz el Masri or Maulud. They would eventually finish the war by
striking, while the tribesmen skirmished about, and hindered and
distracted the Turks by their pin-prick raids.</p>

<p>The Hejaz war, meanwhile, would be one of dervishes against
regular troops. It was the fight of a rocky, mountainous, barren
country (reinforced by a wild horde of mountaineers) against an
enemy so enriched in equipment by the Germans as almost to have
lost virtue for rough-and-tumble war. The hill-belt was a paradise
for snipers; and Arabs were artists in sniping. Two or three
hundred determined men knowing the ranges should hold any section
of them; because the slopes were too steep for escalade. The
valleys, which were the only practicable roads, for miles and miles
were not so much valleys as chasms or gorges, sometimes two hundred
yards across, but sometimes only twenty, full of twists and turns,
one thousand or four thousand feet deep, barren of cover, and
flanked each side by pitiless granite, basalt and porphyry, not in
polished slopes, but serrated and split and piled up in thousands
of jagged heaps of fragments as hard as metal and nearly as
sharp.</p>

<p>It seemed to my unaccustomed eyes impossible that, without
treachery on the part of the mountain tribes, the Turks could dare
to break their way through. Even with treachery as an ally, to pass
the hills would be dangerous. The enemy would never be sure that
the fickle population might not turn again; and to have such a
labyrinth of defiles in the rear, across the communications, would
be worse than having it in front. Without the friendship of the
tribes, the Turks would own only the ground on which their soldiers
stood; and lines so long and complex would soak up thousands of men
in a fortnight, and leave none in the battle-front.</p>

<p>The sole disquieting feature was the very real success of the
Turks in frightening the Arabs by artillery. Aziz el Masri in the
Turk-Italian war in Tripoli had found the same terror, but had
found also that it wore off. We might hope that the same would
happen here; but for the moment the sound of a fired cannon sent
every man within earshot behind cover. They thought weapons
destructive in proportion to their noise. They were not afraid of
bullets, not indeed overmuch of dying: just the manner of death by
shell-fire was unendurable. It seemed to me that their moral
confidence was to be restored only by having guns, useful or
useless, but noisy, on their side. From the magnificent Feisal down
to the most naked stripling in the army the theme was artillery,
artillery, artillery.</p>

<p>When I told them of the landing of the five-inch howitzers at
Rabegh they rejoiced. Such news nearly balanced in their minds the
check of their last retreat down Wadi Safra. The guns would be of
no real use to them: indeed, it seemed to me that they would do the
Arabs positive harm; for their virtues lay in mobility and
intelligence, and by giving them guns we hampered their movements
and efficiency. Only if we did not give them guns they would
quit.</p>

<p>At these close quarters the bigness of the revolt impressed me.
This well-peopled province, from Una Lejj to Kunfida, more than a
fortnight's camel march, had suddenly changed its character from a
rout of casual nomad pilferers to an eruption against Turkey,
fighting her, not certainly in our manner, but fiercely enough, in
spite of the religion which was to raise the East against us in a
holy war. Beyond anything calculable in figures, we had let loose a
passion of anti-Turkish feeling which, embittered as it had been by
generations of subjection, might die very hard. There was among the
tribes in the fighting zone a nervous enthusiasm common, I suppose,
to all national risings, but strangely disquieting to one from a
land so long delivered that national freedom had become like the
water in our mouths, tasteless.</p>

<p>Later I saw Feisal again, and promised to do my best for him. My
chiefs would arrange a base at Yenbo, where the stores and supplies
he needed would be put ashore for his exclusive use. We would try
to get him officer-volunteers from among the prisoners of war
captured in Mesopotamia or on the Canal. We would form gun crews
and machine-gun crews from the rank and file in the internment
camps, and provide them with such mountain guns and light
machine-guns as were obtainable in Egypt. Lastly, I would advise
that British Army officers, professionals, be sent down to act as
advisers and liaison officers with him in the field.</p>

<p>This time our talk was of the pleasantest, and ended in warm
thanks from him, and an invitation to return as soon as might be. I
explained that my duties in Cairo excluded field work, but perhaps
my chiefs would let me pay a second visit later on, when his
present wants were filled and his movement was going forward
prosperously. Meanwhile I would ask for facilities to go down to
Yenbo, for Egypt, that I might get things on foot promptly. He at
once appointed me an escort of fourteen Juheina Sherifs, all
kinsmen of Mohamed Ali ibn Beidawi, the Emir of the Juheina. They
were to deliver me intact in Yenbo to Sheikh Abd el Kadir el Abdo,
its Governor.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<p>Leaving Hamra as dusk fell, we marched back down Wadi Safra
until opposite Kharma, where we turned to the right up the side
valley. It was closely grown with stiff brushwood, through which we
drove our camels strenuously, having tucked up the streamers of our
saddle-bags to save them from being shredded by the thorns. Two
miles later we began to climb the narrow pass of Dhifran, which
gave evidence even by night of labour expended on the road. It had
been artificially smoothed, and the stones piled at each side into
a heavy wall of protection against the rush of water in the rains.
Parts had been graded, and were at times carried on a causeway
built seemingly six or eight feet high, of great blocks of uncut
stone: but it had been breached at every turn by torrents, and was
in terrible ruin.</p>

<p>The ascent lasted perhaps for a mile; and the steep descent on
the other side was about the same. Then we got to the level and
found ourselves in a much broken country of ridges, with an
intricate net of wadies whose main flow was apparently towards the
south-west. The going was good for our camels. We rode for about
seven miles in the dark, and came to a well, Bir el Murra, in a
valley bed under a very low bluff, on whose head the square courses
of a small fort of ashlar stood out against the starry sky.
Conceivably both fort and causeway had been built by an Egyptian
Mameluke for the passage of his pilgrim-caravan from Yenbo.</p>

<p>We halted there for the night, sleeping for six hours, a long
luxury upon the road, though this rest was broken twice by
challenges from half-seen mounted parties who had found our
bivouac. Afterwards we wandered among more small ridges until the
dawn showed gentle valleys of sand with strange hills of lava
hemming us about. The lava here was not the blue-black cinder-stone
of the fields about Rabegh: it was rust-coloured, and piled in huge
crags of flowing surface and bent and twisted texture, as though
played with oddly while yet soft. The sand, at first a carpet about
the foot of the dolerite, gradually gained on it. The hills got
lower, with the sand banked up against them in greater drifts, till
even the crests were sand-spattered, and at last drowned beyond
sight. So, as the sun became high and painfully fierce, we led out
upon a waste of dunes, rolling southward for miles down hill to the
misty sea, where it lay grey-blue in the false distance of the
heat.</p>

<p>The dunes were narrow. By half-past seven we were on a staring
plain of glassy sand mixed with shingle, overspread by tall scrub
and thorn bushes, with some good acacia trees. We rode very fast
across this, myself in some discomfort; for I was not a skilled
rider: the movement exhausted me, while sweat ran down my forehead
and dripped smartingly into my gritty, sun-cracked eyelids. Sweat
was actually welcome when a drop fell from the end of a tuft of
hair, to strike on the cheek cold and sudden and unexpected like a
splash, but these refreshments were too few to pay for the pain of
heat. We pressed on, while the sand yielded to pure shingle, and
that again hardened into the bed of a great valley, running down by
shallow, interwoven mouths towards the sea.</p>

<p>We crossed over a rise, and from the far side opened a wide
view, which was the delta of Wadi Yenbo, the largest valley of
Northern Hejaz. It seemed a vivid copse of tamarisk and thorn. To
the right, some miles up the valley, showed darkly the palm-groves
of Nakhi Mubarak, a village and gardens of the Beni Ibrahim
Juheina. In the distance, ahead of us, lay the massive Jebel
Rudhwa, brooding always so instantly over Yenbo, though more than
twenty miles away. We had seen it from Masturah, for it was one of
the great hills of Hejaz, the more wonderful because it lifted
itself in one clear edge from flat Tehama to crest. My companions
felt at home in its protection; so, as the plain was now dancing
with unbearable heat, we took shade under the branches of a leafy
acacia beside the path, and slumbered through the middle day.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we watered our camels at a brackish little
water hole in the sand bed of a branch watercourse, before a trim
hedge of the feathery tamarisk, and then pushed on for two more
happy hours. At last we halted for the night in typical Tehama
country of bare slowly-swelling sand and shingle ridges, with
shallow valleys.</p>

<p>The Sherifs lit a fire of aromatic wood to bake bread and boil
coffee; and we slept sweetly with the salt sea air cool on our
chafed faces. We rose at two in the morning, and raced our camels
over a featureless plain of hard shingle and wet sand to Yenbo,
which stood up with walls and towers on a reef of coral rag twenty
feet above our level. They took me straight through the gates by
crumbling, empty streets&mdash;Yenbo had been half a city of the
dead since the Hejaz Railway opened&mdash;to the house of Abd el
Kader, Feisal's agent, a well-informed, efficient, quiet and
dignified person, with whom we had had correspondence when he was
postmaster in Mecca, and the Survey in Egypt had been making stamps
for the new State. He had just been transferred here.</p>

<p>With Abd el Kader, in his picturesque rambling house looking
over the deserted square, whence so many Medina caravans had
started, I stayed four days waiting for the ship, which seemed as
if it might fail me at the rendezvous. However, at last the
<i>Suva</i> appeared, with Captain Boyle, who took me back to
Jidda. It was my first meeting with Boyle. He had done much in the
beginning of the revolt, and was to do much more for the future:
but I failed to make a good return impression. I was travel-stained
and had no baggage with me. Worst of all I wore a native
head-cloth, put on as a compliment to the Arabs. Boyle
disapproved.</p>

<p>Our persistence in the hat (due to a misunderstanding of the
ways of heat-stroke) had led the East to see significance in it,
and after long thought their wisest brains concluded that
Christians wore the hideous thing that its broad brim might
interpose between their weak eyes and the uncongenial sight of God.
So it reminded Islam continually that God was miscalled and
misliked by Christians. The British thought this prejudice
reprehensible (quite unlike our hatred of a head-cloth), one to be
corrected at any price. If the people would not have us hatted,
they should not have us any way. Now as it happened I had been
educated in Syria before the war to wear the entire Arab outfit
when necessary without strangeness, or sense of being socially
compromised. The skirts were a nuisance in running up stairs, but
the head-cloth was even convenient in such a climate. So I had
accepted it when I rode inland, and must now cling to it under fire
of naval disapproval, till some shop should sell me a cap.</p>

<p>In Jidda was the <i>Euryalus</i>, with Admiral Wemyss, bound for
Port Sudan that Sir Rosslyn might visit Sir Reginald Wingate at
Khartum. Sir Reginald, as Sirdar of the Egyptian Army, had been put
in command of the British military side of the Arab adventure in
place of Sir Henry McMahon, who continued to direct its politics;
and it was necessary for me to see him, to impart my impressions to
him. So I begged the Admiral for a passage over sea, and a place in
his train to Khartum. This he readily granted, after
cross-questioning me himself at length.</p>

<p>I found that his active mind and broad intelligence had engaged
his interest in the Arab Revolt from the beginning. He had come
down again and again in his flagship to lend a hand when things
were critical, and had gone out of his way twenty times to help the
shore, which properly was Army business. He had given the Arabs
guns and machine-guns, landing parties and technical help, with
unlimited transport and naval co-operation, always making a real
pleasure of requests, and fulfilling them in overflowing
measure.</p>

<p>Had it not been for Admiral Wemyss' good will, and prescience,
and the admirable way in which Captain Boyle carried out his
wishes, the jealousy of Sir Archibald Murray might have wrecked the
Sherifs rebellion at its start. As it was, Sir Rosslyn Wemyss acted
godfather till the Arabs were on their feet; when he went to
London; and Allenby, coming out fresh to Egypt, found the Arabs a
factor on his battle front, and put the energies and resources of
the Army at their disposal. This was opportune, and a fortunate
twist of the whirligig; for Admiral Wemyss' successor in the naval
command in Egypt was not considered helpful by the other services,
though apparently he treated them no worse than he treated his own
subordinates. A hard task, of course, to succeed Wemyss.</p>

<p>In Port Sudan we saw two British officers of the Egyptian Army
waiting to embark for Rabegh. They were to command the Egyptian
troops in Hejaz, and to do their best to help Aziz el Masri
organize the Arab Regular Force which was going to end the war from
Rabegh. This was my first meeting with Joyce and Davenport, the two
Englishmen to whom the Arab cause owed the greater part of its
foreign debt of gratitude. Joyce worked for long beside me. Of
Davenport's successes in the south we heard by constant report.</p>

<p>Khartum felt cool after Arabia, and nerved me to show Sir
Reginald Wingate my long reports written in those days of waiting
at Yenbo. I urged that the situation seemed full of promise. The
main need was skilled assistance; and the campaign should go
prosperously if some regular British officers, professionally
competent and speaking Arabic, were attached to the Arab leaders as
technical advisers, to keep us in proper touch.</p>

<p>Wingate was glad to hear a hopeful view. The Arab Revolt had
been his dream for years. While I was at Khartum chance gave him
the power to play the main part in it; for the workings against Sir
Henry McMahon came to a head, were successful, and ended in his
recall to England. Sir Reginald Wingate was ordered down to Egypt
in his stead. So after two or three comfortable days in Khartum,
resting and reading the <i>Morte D'Arthur</i> in the hospitable
palace, I went down towards Cairo, feeling that the responsible
person had all my news. The Nile trip became a holiday.</p>

<p>Egypt was, as usual, in the throes of a Rabegh question. Some
aeroplanes were being sent there; and it was being argued whether
to send a brigade of troops after them or not. The head of the
French Military Mission at Jidda, Colonel Bremond (Wilson's
counterpart, but with more authority; for he was a practising light
in native warfare, a success in French Africa, and an ex-chief of
staff of a Corps on the Somme) strongly urged the landing of Allied
forces in Hejaz. To tempt us he had brought to Suez some artillery,
some machine-guns, and some cavalry and infantry, all Algerian
Moslem rank and file, with French officers. These added to the
British troops would give the force an international flavour.</p>

<p>Bremond's specious appreciation of the danger of the state of
affairs in Arabia gained upon Sir Reginald. Wingate was a British
General, commander of a nominal expeditionary force, the Hejaz
Force, which in reality comprised a few liaison officers and a
handful of storemen and instructors. If Bremond got his way he
would be G.O.C. of a genuine brigade of mixed British and French
troops, with all its pleasant machinery of responsibility and
despatches, and its prospect of increment and official recognition.
Consequently he wrote a guarded despatch, half-tending towards
direct interference.</p>

<p>As my experience of Arab feeling in the Harb country had given
me strong opinions on the Rabegh question (indeed, most of my
opinions were strong), I wrote for General Clayton, to whose Arab
Bureau I was now formally transferred, a violent memorandum on the
whole subject. Clayton was pleased with my view that the tribes
might defend Rabegh for months if lent advice and guns, but that
they would certainly scatter to their tents again as soon as they
heard of the landing of foreigners in force. Further, that the
intervention-plans were technically unsound, for a brigade would be
quite insufficient to defend the position, to forbid the
neighbouring water-supplies to the Turks, and to block their road
towards Mecca. I accused Colonel Bremond of having motives of his
own, not military, nor taking account of Arab interests and of the
importance of the revolt to us; and quoted his words and acts in
Hejaz as evidence against him. They gave just plausible colour to
my charge.</p>

<p>Clayton took the memorandum to Sir Archibald Murray, who, liking
its acidity and force, promptly wired it all home to London as
proof that the Arab experts asking this sacrifice of valuable
troops from him were divided about its wisdom and honesty, even in
their own camp. London asked for explanations; and the atmosphere
slowly cleared, though in a less acute form the Rabegh question
lingered for two months more.</p>

<p>My popularity with the Staff in Egypt, due to the sudden help I
had lent to Sir Archibald's prejudices, was novel and rather
amusing. They began to be polite to me, and to say that I was
observant, with a pungent style, and character. They pointed out
how good of them it was to spare me to the Arab cause in its
difficulties. I was sent for by the Commander-in-Chief, but on my
way to him was intercepted by a waiting and agitated aide, and led
first into the presence of the Chief of Staff, General Lynden Bell.
To such an extent had he felt it his duty to support Sir Archibald
in his whimsies that people generally confounded the two as one
enemy. So I was astonished when, as I came in, he jumped to his
feet, leaped forward, and gripped me by the shoulder, hissing, 'Now
you're not to frighten him: don't you forget what I say!'</p>

<p>My face probably showed bewilderment, for his one eye turned
bland and he made me sit down, and talked nicely about Oxford, and
what fun undergrads had, and the interest of my report of life in
Feisal's ranks, and his hope that I would go back there to carry on
what I had so well begun, mixing these amiabilities with remarks of
how nervous the Commander-in-Chief was, and how worried about
everything, and the need there was for me to give him a reassuring
picture of affairs, and yet not a rosy picture, since they could
not afford excursions either way.</p>

<p>I was hugely amused, inwardly, and promised to be good, but
pointed out that my object was to secure the extra stores and arms
and officers the Arabs needed, and how for this end I must enlist
the interest, and, if necessary (for I would stick at nothing in
the way of duty), even the excitement of the Commander-in-Chief;
whereupon General Lynden Bell took me up, saying that supplies were
his part, and in them he did everything without reference, and he
thought he might at once, here and now, admit his new determination
to do all he could for us.</p>

<p>I think he kept his word and was fair to us thereafter. I was
very soothing to his chief.</p>

<i>This was hazardous, as the promised British military experts had

<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<p>Clayton a few days later told me to return to Arabia and Feisal.
This being much against my grain I urged my complete unfitness for
the job: said I hated responsibility&mdash;obviously the position
of a conscientious adviser would be responsible&mdash;and that in
all my We objects had been gladder to me than persons, and ideas
than objects. So the duty of succeeding with men, of disposing them
to any purpose, would be doubly hard to me. They were not my
medium: I was not practised in that technique. I was unlike a
soldier: hated soldiering. Of course, I had read the usual books
(too many books), Clausewitz and Jomini, Mahan and Foch, had played
at Napoleon's campaigns, worked at Hannibal's tactics, and the wars
of Belisarius, like any other man at Oxford; but I had never
thought myself into the mind of a real commander compelled to fight
a campaign of his own.</p>

<p>Last of all I reminded Clayton, relevantly, that the Sirdar had
telegraphed to London for certain regular officers competent to
direct the Arab war. The reply was that they might be months
arriving, and meanwhile Feisal must be linked to us, and his needs
promptly notified to Egypt. So I had to go; leaving to others the
Arab Bulletin I had founded, the maps I wished to draw, and the
file of the war-changes of the Turkish Army, all fascinating
activities in which my training helped me; to take up a role for
which I felt no inclination. As our revolt succeeded, onlookers
have praised its leadership: but behind the scenes lay all the
vices of amateur control, experimental councils, divisions,
whimsicality.</p>

<p>My journey was to Yenbo, now the special base of Feisal's army,
where Garland single-handed was teaching the Sherifians how to blow
up railways with dynamite, and how to keep army stores in
systematic order. The first activity was the better. Garland was an
enquirer in physics, and had years of practical knowledge of
explosives. He had his own devices for mining trains and felling
telegraphs and cutting metals; and his knowledge of Arabic and
freedom from the theories of the ordinary sapper-school enabled him
to teach the art of demolition to unlettered Beduin in a quick and
ready way. His pupils admired a man who was never at a loss.</p>

<p>Incidentally he taught me to be familiar with high explosive.
Sappers handled it like a sacrament, but Garland would shovel a
handful of detonators into his pocket, with a string of primers,
fuse, and fusees, and jump gaily on his camel for a week's ride to
the Hejaz Railway. His health was poor and the climate made him
regularly ill. A weak heart troubled him after any strenuous effort
or crisis; but he treated these troubles as freely as he did
detonators, and persisted till he had derailed the first train and
broken the first culvert in Arabia. Shortly afterwards he died.</p>

<p>Things in Hejaz had changed a good deal in the elapsed month.
Pursuing his former plan, Feisal had moved to Wadi Yenbo, and was
trying to make safe his rear before going up to attack the railway
in the grand manner. To relieve him of the burdensome Harb tribes,
his young half-brother Zeid was on the way up from Rabegh to Wadi
Safra, as a nominal subordinate of Sherif Ali. The advanced Harb
clans were efficiently harrying the Turkish communications between
Medina and Bir Abbas. They sent in to Feisal nearly every day a
little convoy of captured camels, or rifles picked up after an
engagement, or prisoners, or deserters.</p>

<p>Rabegh, shaken by the first appearance of Turkish aeroplanes on
November the seventh, had been reassured by the arrival of a flight
of four British aeroplanes, B.E. machines, under Major Ross, who
spoke Arabic so adeptly and was so splendid a leader that there
could be no two minds as to the wise direction of his help. More
guns came in week by week, till there were twenty-three, mostly
obsolete, and of fourteen patterns. Ali had about three thousand
Arab infantry; of whom two thousand were regulars in khaki, under
Aziz el Masri. With them were nine hundred camel corps, and three
hundred Egyptian troops. French gunners were promised.</p>

<p>Sherif Abdulla had at last left Mecca, on November the twelfth.
A fortnight later he was much where he had meant to be, south,
east, and north-east of Medina, able to cut off its supplies from
Kasim and Kuweit. Abdulla had about four thousand men with him, but
only three machine-guns, and ten inefficient mountain guns captured
at Taif and Mecca. Consequently he was not strong enough to carry
out his further plan of a concerted attack on Medina with Ali and
Feisal. He could only blockade it, and for this purpose posted
himself at Henakiyeh, a desert place, eighty miles north-east of
Medina, where he was too far away to be very useful.</p>

<p>The matter of the stores in the Yenbo base was being well
bandied. Garland had left the checking and issuing of them to Abd
el Kader, Feisal's governor, who was systematic and quick. His
efficiency was a great comfort to us, since it enabled us to keep
our attention on more active things. Feisal was organizing his
peasants, his slaves, and his paupers into formal battalions, an
irregular imitation of the new model army of Aziz at Rabegh.
Garland held bombing classes, fired guns, repaired machine-guns,
wheels, and harness, and was armourer for them all. The feeling was
busy and confident.</p>

<p>Feisal, who had not yet acted on our reminders of the importance
of Wejh, was imagining an expedition of the Juheina to take it.
Meanwhile he was in touch with the Billi, the numerous tribe with
headquarters in Wejh, and he hoped for support from them. Their
paramount Sheikh, Suleiman Rifada, was temporizing, being really
hostile; for the Turks had made him Pasha and decorated him; but
his cousin Hamid was in arms for the Sherif, and had just captured
a gratifying little caravan of seventy camels on the way from El
Ula, with stores for the Turkish garrison of Wejh. As I was
starting for Kheif Hussein to press the Wejh plan again on Feisal,
news came in of a Turkish repulse near Bir ibn Hassani. A
reconnaissance of their cavalry and camel corps had been pushed too
far into the hills, and the Arabs had caught it and scattered it.
Better and better yet.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<p>So I made a happy start with my sponsor for the journey, Sherif
Abd el Kerim el Beidawi, half-brother of Mohammed, Emir of the
Juheina, but, to my astonishment, of pure Abyssinian type. They
told me later that his mother had been a slave-girl married by the
old Emir late in life. Abd el Kerim was a man of middle height,
thin and coal black, but debonaire, twenty-six years old; though he
looked less, and had only a tiny tuft of beard on his sharp chin.
He was restless and active, endowed with an easy, salacious humour.
He hated the Turks, who had despised him for his colour (Arabs had
little colour-feeling against Africans: it was the Indian who
evoked their race-dislike), and was very merry and intimate with
me. With him were three or four of his men, all well mounted; and
we had a rapid journey, for Abd el Kerim was a famous rider who
took pride in covering his stages at three times the normal speed.
It was not my camel, and the weather was cool and clouded, with a
taste of rain. So I had no objection.</p>

<p>After starting, we cantered for three unbroken hours. That had
shaken down our bellies far enough for us to hold more food, and we
stopped and ate bread and drank coffee till sunset, while Abd el
Kerim rolled about his carpet in a dog-fight with one of the men.
When he was exhausted he sat up; and they told stories and japed,
till they were breathed enough to get up and dance. Everything was
very free, very good-tempered, and not at all dignified.</p>

<p>When we re-started, an hour's mad race in the dusk brought us to
the end of the Tehama, and to the foot of a low range of rock and
sand. A month ago, coming from Hamra, we had passed south of this:
now we crossed it, going up Wadi Agida, a narrow, winding, sandy
valley between the hills. Because it had run in flood a few days
earlier, the going was firm for our panting camels; but the ascent
was steep and we had to take it at walking pace. This pleased me,
but so angered Abd el Kerim, that when, in a short hour, we reached
the watershed he thrust his mount forward again and led us at
break-neck speed down hill in the yielding night (a fair road,
fortunately, with sand and pebbles underfoot) for half an hour,
when the land flattened out, and we came to the outlying
plantations of Nakhl Mubarak, chief date-gardens of the southern
Juheina.</p>

<p>As we got near we saw through the palm-trees flame, and the
flame-lit smoke of many fires, while the hollow ground re-echoed
with the roaring of thousands of excited camels, and volleying of
shots or shoutings in the darkness of lost men, who sought through
the crowd to rejoin their friends. As we had heard in Yenbo that
the Nakhl were deserted, this tumult meant something strange,
perhaps hostile. We crept quietly past an end of the grove and
along a narrow street between man-high mud walls, to a silent group
of houses. Abd el Kerim forced the courtyard door of the first on
our left, led the camels within, and hobbled them down by the walls
that they might remain unseen. Then he slipped a cartridge into the
breech of his rifle and stole off on tiptoe down the street towards
the noise to find out what was happening. We waited for him, the
sweat of the ride slowly drying in our clothes as we sat there in
the chill night, watching.</p>

<p>He came back after half an hour to say that Feisal with his
camel corps had just arrived, and we were to go down and join him.
So we led the camels out and mounted; and rode in file down another
lane on a bank between houses, with a sunk garden of palms on our
right. Its end was filled with a solid crowd of Arabs and camels,
mixed together in the wildest confusion, and all crying aloud. We
pressed through them, and down a ramp suddenly into the bed of Wadi
Yenbo, a broad, open space: how broad could only be guessed from
the irregular lines of watch-fires glimmering over it to a great
distance. Also it was very damp; with slime, the relic of a shallow
flood two days before, yet covering its stones. Our camels found it
slippery under foot and began to move timidly.</p>

<p>We had no opportunity to notice this, or indeed anything, just
now, except the mass of Feisal's army, filling the valley from side
to side. There were hundreds of fires of thorn-wood, and round them
were Arabs making coffee or eating, or sleeping muffled like dead
men in their cloaks, packed together closely in the confusion of
camels. So many camels in company made a mess indescribable,
couched as they were or tied down all over the camping ground, with
more ever coming in, and the old ones leaping up on three legs to
join them, roaring with hunger and agitation. Patrols were going
out, caravans being unloaded, and dozens of Egyptian mules bucking
angrily over the middle of the scene.</p>

<p>We ploughed our way through this din, and in an island of calm
at the very centre of the valley bed found Sherif Feisal. We halted
our camels by his side. On his carpet, spread barely over the
stones, he was sitting between Sherif Sharraf, the Kaimmakam both
of the Imaret and of Taif, his cousin, and Maulud, the rugged,
slashing old Mesopotamian patriot, now acting as his A.D.C. In
front of him knelt a secretary taking down an order, and beyond him
another reading reports aloud by the light of a silvered lamp which
a slave was holding. The night was windless, the air heavy, and the
unshielded flame poised there stiff and straight.</p>

<p>Feisal, quiet as ever, welcomed me with a smile until he could
finish his dictation. After it he apologized for my disorderly
reception, and waved the slaves back to give us privacy. As they
retired with the onlookers, a wild camel leaped into the open space
in front of us, plunging and trumpeting. Maulud dashed at its head
to drag it away; but it dragged him instead; and, its load of grass
ropes for camel fodder coming untied, there poured down over the
taciturn Sharraf, the lamp, and myself, an avalanche of hay. 'God
be praised,' said Feisal gravely, 'that it was neither butter nor
bags of gold.' Then he explained to me what unexpected things had
happened in the last twenty-four hours on the battle front.</p>

<p>The Turks had slipped round the head of the Arab barrier forces
in Wadi Safra by a side road in the hills, and had cut their
retreat. The Harb, in a panic, had melted into the ravines on each
side, and escaped through them in parties of twos and threes,
anxious for their threatened families. The Turkish mounted men
poured down the empty valley and over the Dhifran Pass to Bir Said,
where Ghalib Bey, their commander, nearly caught the unsuspecting
Zeid asleep in his tent. However, warning came just in time. With
the help of Sherif Abdulla ibn Thawab, an old Harith campaigner,
Emir Zeid held up the enemy attack for long enough to get some of
his tents and baggage packed on camels and driven away. Then he
escaped himself; but his force melted into a loose mob of fugitives
riding wildly through the night towards Yenbo.</p>

<p>Thereby the road to Yenbo was laid open to the Turks, and Feisal
had rushed down here only an hour before our arrival, with five
thousand men, to protect his base until something properly
defensive could be arranged. His spy system was breaking down: the
Harb, having lost their wits in the darkness, were bringing in wild
and contradictory reports from one side and another about the
strength of the Turks and their movements and intention. He had no
idea whether they would strike at Yenbo or be content with holding
the passes from Wadi Yenbo into Wadi Safra while they threw the
bulk of their forces down the coast towards Rabegh and Mecca. The
situation would be serious either way: the best that could happen
would be if Feisal's presence here attracted them, and caused them
to lose more days trying to catch his field army while we
strengthened Yenbo. Meanwhile, he was doing all he could, quite
cheerfully; so I sat down and listened to the news; or to the
petitions, complaints and difficulties being brought in and settled
by him summarily.</p>

<p>Sharraf beside me worked a busy tooth-stick back and forward
along his gleaming jaws, speaking only once or twice an hour, in
reproof of too-urgent suitors. Maulud ever and again leaned over to
me, round Feisal's neutral body, eagerly repeating for our joint
benefit any word of a report which might be turned to favour the
launching of an instant and formal counter-attack.</p>

<p>This lasted till half-past four in the morning. It grew very
cold as the damp of the valley rose through the carpet and soaked
our clothes. The camp gradually stilled as the tired men and
animals went one by one to sleep; a white mist collected softly
over them and in it the fires became slow pillars of smoke.
Immediately behind us, rising out of the bed of mist, Jebel Rudhwa,
more steep and rugged than ever, was brought so close by the hushed
moonlight that it seemed hanging over our heads.</p>

<p>Feisal at last finished the urgent work. We ate half-a-dozen
dates, a frigid comfort, and curled up on the wet carpet. As I lay
there in a shiver, I saw the Biasha guards creep up and spread
their cloaks gently over Feisal, when they were sure that he was
sleeping.</p>

<p>An hour later we got up stiffly in the false dawn (too cold to
go on pretending and lying down) and the slaves lit a fire of
palm-ribs to warm us, while Sharraf and myself searched for food
and fuel enough for the moment. Messengers were still coming in
from all sides with evil rumours of an immediate attack; and the
camp was not far off panic. So Feisal decided to move to another
position, partly because we should be washed out of this one if it
rained anywhere in the hills, and partly to occupy his men's minds
and work off their restlessness.</p>

<p>When his drums began to beat, the camels were loaded hurriedly.
After the second signal everyone leaped into the saddle and drew
off to left or right, leaving a broad lane up which Feisal rode, on
his mare, with Sharraf a pace behind him, and then Ali, the
standard-bearer, a splendid wild man from Nejd, with his hawk's
face framed in long plaits of jet-black hair falling downward from
his temples. Ali was dressed garishly, and rode a tall camel.
Behind him were all the mob of sherifs and sheikhs and
slaves&mdash;and myself&mdash;pell-mell. There were eight hundred
in the bodyguard that morning.</p>

<p>Feisal rode up and down looking for a place to camp, and at last
stopped on the further side of a little open valley just north of
Nakhl Mubarak village; though the houses were so buried in the
trees that few of them could be seen from outside. On the south
bank of this valley, beneath some rocky knolls, Feisal pitched his
two plain tents. Sharraf had his personal tent also; and some of
the other chiefs came and lived by us. The guard put up their
booths and shelters; and the Egyptian gunners halted lower down on
our side, and dressed their twenty tents beautifully in line, to
look very military. So in a little while we were populous, if
hardly imposing in detail.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<p>We stayed here two days, most of which I spent in Feisal's
company, and so got a deeper experience of his method of command,
at an interesting season when the morale of his men was suffering
heavily from the scare reports brought in, and from the defection
of the Northern Harb. Feisal, fighting to make up their lost
spirits, did it most surely by lending of his own to everyone
within reach. He was accessible to all who stood outside his tent
and waited for notice; and he never cut short petitions, even when
men came in chorus with their grief in a song of many verses, and
sang them around us in the dark. He listened always, and, if he did
not settle the case himself, called Sharraf or Faiz to arrange it
for him. This extreme patience was a further lesson to me of what
native headship in Arabia meant.</p>

<p>His self-control seemed equally great. When Mirzuk el Tikheimi,
his guest-master, came in from Zeid to explain the shameful story
of their rout, Feisal just laughed at him in public and sent him
aside to wait while he saw the sheikhs of the Harb and the Ageyl
whose carelessness had been mainly responsible for the disaster.
These he rallied gently, chaffing them for having done this or
that, for having inflicted such losses, or lost so much. Then he
called back Mirzuk and lowered the tent-flap: a sign that there was
private business to be done. I thought of the meaning of Feisal's
name (the sword flashing downward in the stroke) and feared a
scene, but he made room for Mirzuk on his carpet, and said, 'Come!
tell us more of your 'nights' and marvels of the battle: amuse us.'
Mirzuk, a good-looking, clever lad (a little too sharp-featured)
falling into the spirit of the thing, began, in his broad, Ateibi
twang, to draw for us word-pictures of young Zeid in flight; of the
terror of Ibn Thawab, that famous brigand; and, ultimate disgrace,
of how the venerable el Hussein, father of Sherif Ali, the Harithi,
had lost his coffee-pots!</p>

<p>Feisal, in speaking, had a rich musical voice, and used it
carefully upon his men. To them he talked in tribal dialect, but
with a curious, hesitant manner, as though faltering painfully
among phrases, looking inward for the just word. His thought,
perhaps, moved only by a little in front of his speech, for the
phrases at last chosen were usually the simplest, which gave an
effect emotional and sincere. It seemed possible, so thin was the
screen of words, to see the pure and the very brave spirit shining
out.</p>

<p>At other times he was full of humour&mdash;that invariable
magnet of Arab goodwill. He spoke one night to the Rifaa sheikhs
when he sent them forward to occupy the plain this side of Bir el
Fagir, a tangled country of acacia and tamarisk thickets on the
imperceptible watershed of the long depression uniting Bruka and
Bir Said. He told them gently that the Turks were coming on, and
that it was their duty to hold them up and give God the credit of
their victory; adding that this would become impossible if they
went to sleep. The old men&mdash;and in Arabia elders mattered more
than youths&mdash;broke out into delighted speech, and, after
saying that God would give him a victory, or rather two victories,
capped their wishes with a prayer that his life might be prolonged
in the accumulation of an unprecedented number of victories. What
was better, they kept effective watch all night, in the strength of
his exhortation.</p>

<p>The routine of our life in camp was simple. Just before daybreak
the army Imam used to climb to the head of the little hill above
the sleeping army, and thence utter an astounding call to prayer.
His voice was harsh and very powerful, and the hollow, like a
sounding-board, threw echoes at the hills which returned them with
indignant interest. We were effectually roused, whether we prayed
or cursed. As soon as he ended, Feisal's Imam cried gently and
musically from just outside the tent. In a minute, one of Feisal's
five slaves (all freed men, but refusing discharge till it was
their pleasure: since it was good and not unprofitable to be my
lord's servant) came round to Sharraf and myself with sweetened
coffee. Sugar for the first cup in the chill of dawn was considered
fit.</p>

<p>An hour or so later, the flap of Feisal's sleeping tent would be
thrown back: his invitation to callers from the household. There
would be four or five present; and after the morning's news a tray
of breakfast would be carried in. The staple of this was dates in
Wadi Yenbo; sometimes Feisal's Circassian grandmother would send
him a box of her famous spiced cakes from Mecca; and sometimes
Hejris, the body slave, would give us odd biscuits and cereals of
his own trying. After breakfast we would play with bitter coffee
and sweet tea in alternation, while Feisal's correspondence was
dealt with by dictation to his secretaries. One of these was Faiz
el Ghusein the adventurous; another was the Imam, a sad-faced
person made conspicuous in the army by the baggy umbrella hanging
from his saddle-bow. Occasionally a man was given private audience
at this hour, but seldom; as the sleeping tent was strictly for the
Sherif s own use. It was an ordinary bell tent, furnished with
cigarettes, a camp-bed, a fairly good Kurd rug, a poor Shirazi, and
the delightful old Baluch prayer-carpet on which he prayed.</p>

<p>At about eight o'clock in the morning, Feisal would buckle on
his ceremonial dagger and walk across to the reception tent, which
was floored with two horrible kilims. Feisal would sit down at the
end of the tent facing the open side, and we with our backs against
the wall, in a semicircle out from him. The slaves brought up the
rear, and clustered round the open wall of the tent to control the
besetting suppliants who lay on the sand in the tent-mouth, or
beyond, waiting their turn. If possible, business was got through
by noon, when the Emir liked to rise.</p>

<p>We of the household, and any guests, then reassembled in the
living tent; and Hejris and Salem carried in the luncheon tray, on
which were as many dishes as circumstances permitted. Feisal was an
inordinate smoker, but a very light eater, and he used to
make-believe with his fingers or a spoon among the beans, lentils,
spinach, rice, and sweet cakes till he judged that we had had
enough, when at a wave of his hand the tray would disappear, as
other slaves walked forward to pour water for our fingers at the
tent door. Fat men, like Mohammed Ibn Shefia, made a comic
grievance of the Emir's quick and delicate meals, and would have
food of their own prepared for them when they came away. After
lunch we would talk a little, while sucking up two cups of coffee,
and savouring two glasses full of syrup-like green tea. Then till
two in the afternoon the curtain of the living tent was down,
signifying that Feisal was sleeping, or reading, or doing private
business. Afterwards he would sit again in the reception tent till
he had finished with all who wanted him. I never saw an Arab leave
him dissatisfied or hurt&mdash;a tribute to his tact and to his
memory; for he seemed never to halt for loss of a fact, nor to
stumble over a relationship.</p>

<p>If there were time after second audience, he would walk with his
friends, talking of horses or plants, looking at camels, or asking
someone the names of the visible land features. The sunset prayer
was at times public, though Feisal was not outwardly very pious.
After it he saw people individually in the living tent, planning
the night's reconnaissances and patrols&mdash;for most of the
field-work was done after dark. Between six and seven there was
brought in the evening meal, to which all present in headquarters
were called by the slaves. It resembled the lunch, except the cubes
of boiled mutton were sorted through the great tray of rice,
<i>medfa el suhur</i>, the mainstay of appetite. We observed
silence till all had eaten.</p>

<p>This meal ended our day, save for the stealthy offering by a
barefooted slave of a tray of tea-glasses at protracted intervals.
Feisal did not sleep till very late, and never betrayed a wish to
hasten our going. In the evening he relaxed as far as possible and
avoided avoidable work. He would send out for some local sheikh to
tell stories of the district, and histories of the tribe and its
genealogy; or the tribal poets would sing us their war narratives:
long traditional forms with stock epithets, stock sentiments, stock
incidents grafted afresh on the efforts of each generation. Feisal
was passionately fond of Arabic poetry, and would often provoke
recitations, judging and rewarding the best verses of the night.
Very rarely he would play chess, with the unthinking directness of
a fencer, and brilliantly. Sometimes, perhaps for my benefit, he
told stories of what he had seen in Syria, and scraps of Turkish
secret history, or family affairs. I learned much of the men and
parties in the Hejaz from his lips.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>

<p>Suddenly Feisal asked me if I would wear Arab clothes like his
own while in the camp. I should find it better for my own part,
since it was a comfortable dress in which to live Arab-fashion as
we must do. Besides, the tribesmen would then understand how to
take me. The only wearers of khaki in their experience had been
Turkish officers, before whom they took up an instinctive defence.
If I wore Meccan clothes, they would behave to me as though I were
really one of the leaders; and I might slip in and out of Feisal's
tent without making a sensation which he had to explain away each
time to strangers. I agreed at once, very gladly; for army uniform
was abominable when camel-riding or when sitting about on the
ground; and the Arab things, which I had learned to manage before
the war, were cleaner and more decent in the desert. Hejris was
pleased, too, and exercised his fancy in fitting me out in splendid
white silk and gold-embroidered wedding garments which had been
sent to Feisal lately (was it a hint?) by his great-aunt in Mecca.
I took a stroll in the new looseness of them round the palm-gardens
of Mubarak and Bruka, to accustom myself to their feel.</p>

<p>These villages were pleasant little places, built of mud brick
on the high earth mounds encircling the palm-gardens. Nakhl Mubarak
lay to the north, and Bruka just south of it across a thorny
valley. The houses were small, mud-washed inside, cool, and very
clean, furnished with a mat or two, a coffee mortar, and food pots
and trays. The narrow streets were shaded by an occasional
well-grown tree. The earth embankments round the cultivated areas
were sometimes fifty feet in height, and had been for the most part
artificially formed from the surplus earth dug out between the
trees, from household rubbish and from stones gathered out of the
Wadi.</p>

<p>The banks were to defend the crops from flood. Wadi Yenbo
otherwise would soon have filled the gardens, since these, to be
irrigable, must be below the valley floor. The narrow plots were
divided by fences of palm-ribs or by mud walls, with narrow streams
of sweet water in raised channels round them. Each garden gate was
over water, with a bridge of three or four parallel palm-logs built
up to it for the passage of donkeys or camels. Each plot had a mud
sluice, scooped away when its turn for watering came. The palms,
regularly planted in ordered lines and well cared for, were the
main crop; but between them were grown barley, radishes, marrows,
cucumbers, tobacco and henna. Villages higher up Wadi Yenbo were
cool enough to grow grapes.</p>

<p>Feisal's stand in Nakhl Mubarak could in the nature of things
only be a pause, and I felt that I had better get back to Yenbo, to
think seriously about our amphibious defence of this port, the Navy
having promised its every help. We settled that I should consult
Zeid, and act with him as seemed best. Feisal gave me a magnificent
bay camel for the trip back. We marched through the Agida hills by
a new road, Wadi Messarih, because of a scare of Turkish patrols on
the more direct line. Bedr ibn Shefia was with me; and we did the
distance gently in a single stage of six hours, getting to Yenbo
before dawn. Being tired after three strenuous days of little sleep
among constant alarms and excitements I went straight to Garland's
empty house (he was living on board ship in the harbour) and fell
asleep on a bench; but afterwards I was called out again by the
news that Sherif Zeid was coming, and went down to the walls to see
the beaten force ride in.</p>

<p>There were about eight hundred of them, quiet, but in no other
way mortified by their shame. Zeid himself seemed finely
indifferent. As he entered the town he turned and cried to Abd el
Kadir, the Governor, riding behind him, Why, your town is ruinous!
I must telegraph to my father for forty masons to repair the public
buildings.' And this actually he did. I had telegraphed to Captain
Boyle that Yenbo was gravely threatened, and Boyle at once replied
that his fleet would be there in time, if not sooner. This
readiness was an opportune consolation: worse news came along next
day. The Turks, by throwing a strong force forward from Bir Said
against Nakhl Mubarak, had closed with Feisal's levies while they
were yet unsteady. After a short fight, Feisal had broken off,
yielded his ground, and was retreating here. Our war seemed
entering its last act. I took my camera, and from the parapet of
the Medina gate got a fine photograph of the brothers coming in.
Feisal had nearly two thousand men with him, but none of the
Juheina tribesmen. It looked like treachery and a real defection of
the tribes, things which both of us had ruled out of court as
impossible.</p>

<p>I called at once at his house and he told me the history. The
Turks had come on with three battalions and a number of
mule-mounted infantry and camelry. Their command was in the hands
of Ghalib Bey, who handled his troops with great keenness, acting
as he did under the eye of the Corps Commander. Fakhru Pasha
privately accompanied the expedition, whose guide and go-between
with the Arabs was Dakhil-Allah el Kadhi, the hereditary law-giver
of the Juheina, a rival of Sherif Mohammed Ali el Beidawi, and
after him the second man in the tribe.</p>

<p>They got across Wadi Yenbo to the groves of Bruka in their first
onset, and thus threatened the Arab communications with Yenbo. They
were also able to shell Nakhl Mubarak freely with their seven guns.
Feisal was not a whit dismayed, but threw out the Juheina on his
left to work down the great valley. His centre and right he kept in
Nakhl Mubarak, and he sent the Egyptian artillery to take post in
Jebel Agida, to deny that to the Turks. Then he opened fire on
Bruka with his own two fifteen-pounders.</p>

<p>Rasim, a Syrian officer, formerly a battery commander in the
Turkish Army, was fighting these two guns; and he made a great
demonstration with them. They had been sent down as a gift from
Egypt, anyhow, old rubbish thought serviceable for the wild Arabs,
just as the sixty thousand rifles supplied the Sherif were
condemned weapons, relics of the Gallipoli campaign. So Rasim had
no sights, nor range-finder, no range tables, no high
explosive.</p>

<p>His distance might have been six thousand yards; but the fuses
of his shrapnel were Boer War antiquities, full of green mould,
and, if they burst, it was sometimes short in the air, and
sometimes grazing. However, he had no means of getting his
ammunition away if things went wrong, so he blazed off at speed,
shouting with laughter at this fashion of making war; and the
tribesmen seeing the commandant so merry took heart of grace
themselves. 'By God,' said one, 'those are the real guns: the
Importance of their noise!' Rasim swore that the Turks were dying
in heaps; and the Arabs charged forward warmly, at his word.</p>

<p>Things were going well; and Feisal had the hope of a decisive
success when suddenly his left wing in the valley wavered, halted;
finally it turned its back on the enemy and retired tumultuously to
the camping ground. Feisal, in the centre, galloped to Rasim and
cried that the Juheina had broken and he was to save the guns.
Rasim yoked up the teams and trotted away to Wadi Agida, wherein
the Egyptians were taking counsel avidly with one another. After
him streamed the Ageyl and the Atban, the men of Ibn Shefia, the
Harb and Biasha. Feisal and his household composed the rear, and in
deliberate procession they moved down towards Yenbo, leaving the
Juheina with the Turks on the battlefield.</p>

<p>As I was still hearing of this sad end, and cursing with him the
traitor Beidawi brothers, there was a stir about the door, and Abd
el Kerim broke through the slaves, swung up to the dais, kissed
Feisal's head-rope in salutation, and sat down beside us. Feisal
with a gasping stare at him said, 'How?' and Abd el Kerim explained
their dismay at the sudden flight of Feisal, and how he with his
brother and their gallant men had fought the Turks for the whole
night, alone, without artillery, till the palm-groves became
untenable and they too had been driven through Wadi Agida. His
brother, with half the manhood of the tribe, was just entering the
gate. The others had fallen back up Wadi Yenbo for water.</p>

<p>'And why did you retire to the camp-ground behind us during the
battle?' asked Feisal. 'Only to make ourselves a cup of coffee,'
said Abd el Kerim. We had fought from sunrise and it was dusk: we
were very tired and thirsty.' Feisal and I lay back and laughed:
then we went to see what could be done to save the town.</p>

<p>The first step was simple. We sent all the Juheina back to Wadi
Yenbo with orders to mass at Kheif, and keep up a steady pressure
on the Turkish line of communications. They were also to push
sniping parties down the Agida hills. This diversion would hold up
so many of the Turks that they would be unable to bring against
Yenbo a force superior in number to the defenders, who in addition
had the advantage of a good position. The town on the top of its
flat reef of coral rose perhaps twenty feet above the sea, and was
compassed by water on two sides. The other two sides looked over
flat stretches of sand, soft in places, destitute of cover for
miles, and with no fresh water upon them anywhere. In daylight, if
defended by artillery and machine-gun fire, they should be
impregnable.</p>

<p>The artillery was arriving every minute; for Boyle, as usual far
better than his word, had concentrated five ships on us in less
than twenty-four hours. He put the monitor M.31, whose shallow
draught fitted her for the job, in the end of the south-eastern
creek of the harbour, whence she could rake the probable direction
of a Turkish advance with her six-inch guns. Crocker, her captain,
was very anxious to let off those itching guns. The larger ships
were moored to fire over the town at longer range, or to rake the
other flank from the northern harbour. The searchlights of
<i>Dufferin</i> and M.31 crossed on the plain beyond the town.</p>

<p>The Arabs, delighted to count up the quantity of vessels in the
harbour, were prepared to contribute their part to the night's
entertainment. They gave us good hope there would be no further
panic: but to reassure them fully they needed some sort of rampart
to defend, mediaeval fashion: it was no good digging trenches,
partly because the ground was coral rock, and, besides, they had no
experience of trenches and might not have manned them confidently.
So we took the crumbling, salt-riddled wall of the place, doubled
it with a second, packed earth between the two, and raised them
till our sixteenth-century bastions were rifle-proof at least, and
probably proof against the Turkish mountain guns. Outside the
bastions we put barbed wire, festooned between cisterns on the rain
catchments beyond the walls. We dug in machine-gun nests in the
best angles, and manned them with Feisal's regular gunners. The
Egyptians, like everyone else given a place in the scheme, were
gratifyingly happy. Garland was engineer-in-chief and chief
adviser.</p>

<p>After sun-down the town quivered with suppressed excitement. So
long as the day lasted there had been shouts and joy-shots and wild
bursts of frenzy among the workmen; but when dark came they went
back to feed and a hush fell. Nearly everyone sat up that night.
There was one alarm about eleven o'clock. Our outposts had met the
enemy only three miles outside the town. Garland, with a crier,
went through the few streets, and called the garrison. They tumbled
straight out and went to their places in dead silence without a
shot or a loose shout. The seamen on the minaret sent warning to
the ships, whose combined searchlights began slowly to traverse the
plain in complex intersections, drawing pencils of wheeling light
across the flats which the attacking force must cross. However, no
sign was made and no cause given us to open fire.</p>

<p>Afterwards, old Dakhil Allah told me he had guided the Turks
down to rush Yenbo in the dark that they might stamp out Feisal's
army once for all; but their hearts had failed them at the silence
and the blaze of lighted ships from end to end of the harbour, with
the eerie beams of the searchlights revealing the bleakness of the
glacis they would have to cross. So they turned back: and that
night, I believe, the Turks lost their war. Personally, I was on
the <i>Suva</i>, to be undisturbed, and sleeping splendidly at
last; so I was grateful to Dakhil Allah for the prudence which he
preached the Turks, as though we might perhaps have won a glorious
victory, I was ready to give much more for just that eight hours'
unbroken rest.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

<p>Next day the crisis had passed: the Turks had clearly failed.
The Juheina were active in their flank position from Wadi Yenbo.
Garland's architectural efforts about the town became impressive.
Sir Archibald Murray, to whom Feisal had appealed for a
demonstration in Sinai to prevent further withdrawals of Turks for
service at Medina, sent back an encouraging reply, and everybody
was breathing easily. A few days later Boyle dispersed the ships,
promising another lightning concentration upon another warning; and
I took the opportunity to go down to Rabegh, where I met Colonel
Bremond, the great bearded chief of the French Military Mission,
and the only real soldier in Hejaz. He was still using his French
detachment in Suez as a lever to move a British Brigade into
Rabegh; and, since he suspected I was not wholly of his party, he
made an effort to convert me.</p>

<p>In the course of the argument which followed, I said something
about the need of soon attacking Medina; for, with the rest of the
British, I believed that the fall of Medina was a necessary
preliminary to any further progress of the Arab Revolt. He took me
up sharply, saying that it was in no wise proper for the Arabs to
take Medina. In his view, the Arab Movement had attained its
maximum utility by the mere rebellion in Mecca; and military
operations against Turkey were better in the unaided hands of Great
Britain and France. He wished to land Allied troops at Rabegh,
because it would quench the ardour of the tribes by making the
Sherif suspect in their eyes. The foreign troops would then be his
main defence, and his preservation be our work and option, until at
the end of the war, when Turkey was defeated, the victorious Powers
could extract Medina by treaty from the Sultan, and confer it upon
Hussein, with the legal sovereignty of Hejaz, as his rewards for
faithful service.</p>

<p>I had not his light confidence in our being strong enough to
dispense with small allies; so I said shortly that my opinions were
opposed to his. I laid the greatest weight on the immediate
conquest of Medina, and was advising Feisal to seize Wejh, in order
to prolong his threat against the railway. In sum, to my mind, the
Arab Movement would not justify its creation if the enthusiasm of
it did not carry the Arabs into Damascus.</p>

<p>This was unwelcome to him; for the Sykes-Picot Treaty of 1916
between France and England had been drawn by Sykes for this very
eventuality; and, to reward it, stipulated the establishment of
independent Arab states in Damascus, Aleppo and Mosul, districts
which would otherwise fall to the unrestricted control of France.
Neither Sykes nor Picot had believed the thing really possible; but
I knew that it was, and believed that after it the vigour of the
Arab Movement would prevent the creation&mdash;by us or
others&mdash;in Western Asia of unduly 'colonial' schemes of
exploitation.</p>

<p>Bremond took refuge in his technical sphere, and assured me, on
his honour as a staff-officer, that for Feisal to leave Yenbo and
go to Wejh was military suicide; but I saw no force in the
arguments which he threw at me volubly; and told him so. It was a
curious interview, that, between an old soldier and a young man in
fancy dress; and it left a bad taste in my mouth. The Colonel, like
his countrymen, was a realist in love, and war. Even in situations
of poetry the French remained incorrigible prose-writers, seeing by
the directly-thrown light of reason and understanding, not through
the half-closed eye, mistily, by things' essential radiance, in the
manner of the imaginative British: so the two races worked ill
together on a great undertaking. However, I controlled myself
enough not to tell any Arab of the conversation, but sent a full
account of it to Colonel Wilson, who was shortly coming up to see
Feisal for a discussion of the Wejh prospect in all its
bearings.</p>

<p>Before Wilson arrived the centre of Turkish gravity changed
abruptly. Fakhri Pashi had seen the hopelessness of attacking
Yenbo, or of driving after the intangible Juheina in Kheif Hussein.
Also he was being violently bombed in Nakhl Mubarak itself by a
pair of British seaplanes which did hardy flights over the desert
and got well into the enemy on two occasions, despite their
shrapnel.</p>

<p>Consequently he decided to fall back in a hurry on Bir Said,
leaving a small force there to check the Juheina, and to move down
the Sultani road towards Rabegh with the bulk of his men. These
changes were no doubt partly impelled by the unusual vigour of Ali
at Rabegh. As soon as Ali had heard of Zeid's defeat he had sent
him reinforcements and guns; and when Feisal himself collapsed he
decided to move north with all his army, to attack the Turks in
Wadi Safra and draw them off Yenbo. Ali had nearly seven thousand
men; and Feisal felt that if the move was synchronized with one on
his part, Fakhri's force might be crushed between them in the
hills. He telegraphed, suggesting this, asking for a delay of a few
days till his shaken men were ready.</p>

<p>Ali was strung up and would not wait. Feisal therefore rushed
Zeid out to Masahali in Wadi Yenbo to make preparations. When these
were complete he sent Zeid on to occupy Bir Said, which was done
successfully. He then ordered the Juheina forward in support. They
demurred; for ibn Beidawi was jealous of Feisal's growing power
among his tribes, and wanted to keep himself indispensable. Feisal
rode unattended to Nakhl Mubarak, and in one night convinced the
Juheina that he was their leader. Next morning they were all
moving, while he went on to collect the northern Harb on the Tasha
Pass to interrupt the Turkish retreat in Wadi Safra. He had nearly
six thousand men; and if Ali took the southern bank of the valley
the weak Turks would be between two fires.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it did not happen. When actually on the move he
heard from Ali that, after a peaceful recovery of Bir ibn Hassani,
his men had been shaken by false reports of disloyalty among the
Subh, and had fallen back in rapid disorder to Babegh.</p>

<p>In this ominous pause Colonel Wilson came up to Yenbo to
persuade us of the necessity of an immediate operation against
Wejh. An amended plan had been drawn up whereby Feisal would take
the whole force of the Juheina, and his permanent battalions,
against Wejh with the maximum of naval help. This strength would
make success reasonably sure, but it left Yenbo empty and
defenceless. For the moment Feisal dreaded incurring such a risk.
He pointed out, not unreasonably, that the Turks in his
neighbourhood were still mobile; that Ali's force had proved
hollow, unlikely to defend even Babegh against serious attack; and
that, as Babegh was the bulwark of Mecca, sooner than see it lost
he must throw away Yenbo and ferry himself and men thither to die
fighting on its beach.</p>

<p>To reassure him, Wilson painted the Babegh force in warm
colours. Feisal checked his sincerity by asking for his personal
word that the Babegh garrison, with British naval help, would
resist enemy attack till Wejh fell. Wilson looked for support round
the silent deck of the <i>Dufferin</i> (on which we were
conferring), and nobly gave the required assurance: a wise gamble,
since without it Feisal would not move; and this diversion against
Wejh, the only offensive in the Arabs' power, was their last chance
not so much of securing a convincing siege of Medina, as of
preventing the Turkish capture of Mecca. A few days later he
strengthened himself by sending Feisal direct orders from his
father, the Sherif, to proceed to Wejh at once, with all his
available troops.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Babegh situation grew worse. The enemy in Wadi
Safra and the Sultani road were estimated at nearly five thousand
men. The Harb of the north were suppliant to them for preservation
of their palm-groves. The Harb of the south, those of Hussein
Mabeirig, notoriously waited their advance to attack the Sherifians
in the rear. At a conference of Wilson, Bremond, Joyce, Boss and
others, held in Babegh on Christmas Eve, it was decided to lay out
on the beach by the aerodrome a small position, capable of being
held under the ship's guns by the Egyptians, the Flying Corps and a
seamen's landing party from the <i>Minerva</i>, for the few hours
needed to embark or destroy the stores. The Turks were advancing
step by step; and the place was not in condition to resist one
well-handled battalion supported by field artillery.</p>

<p>However, Fakhri was too slow. He did not pass Bir el Sheikh in
any force till near the end of the first week in January, and seven
days later was still not ready to attack Khoreiba, where Ali had an
outpost of a few hundred men. The patrols were in touch; and an
assault was daily expected, but as regularly delayed.</p>

<p>In truth the Turks were meeting with unguessed difficulties.
Their headquarters were faced by a heavy sick rate among the men,
and a growing weakness of the animals: both symptoms of overwork
and lack of decent food. Always the activity of the tribesmen
behind their back hampered them. Clans might sometimes fall away
from the Arab cause, but did not therefore become trustworthy
adherents of the Turks, who soon found themselves in ubiquitously
hostile country. The tribal raids in the first fortnight of January
caused them average daily losses of forty camels and some twenty
men killed and wounded, with corresponding expense in stores.</p>

<p>These raids might occur at any point from ten miles seaward of
Medina itself for the next seventy miles through the hills. They
illustrated the obstacles in the way of the new Turkish Army with
its half-Germanized complexity of equipment, when, from a distant
railhead with no made roads, it tried to advance through extremely
rugged and hostile country. The administrative developments of
scientific war had clogged its mobility and destroyed its dash; and
troubles grew in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression
for each new mile its commanding officers put between themselves
and Medina, their ill-found, insecure and inconvenient base.</p>

<p>The situation was so unpromising for the Turks that Fakhri was
probably half glad when the forthcoming sudden moves of Abdulla and
Feisal in the last days of 1916 altered the strategic conception of
the Hejaz war, and hurried the Mecca expedition (after January the
eighteenth 1917) back from the Sultani and the Fara and the Gaha
roads, back from Wadi Safra, to hold a passive defence of trenches
within sight of the walls of Medina: a static position which
endured till the Armistice ended the war and involved Turkey in the
dismal surrender of the Holy City and its helpless garrison.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>

<p>Feisal was a fine, hot workman, whole-heartedly doing a thing
when he had agreed to it. He had pledged his word that he would go
at once to Wejh; so he and I sat down together on new-year's day
for consideration of what this move meant to us and to the Turks.
Around us, stretching up and down the Wadi Yenbo for miles, in
little groups round palm-gardens, under the thicker trees, and in
all the side tributaries, wherever there was shelter from the sun
and rain, or good grazing for the camels, were the soldiers of our
army. The mountaineers, half-naked footmen, had grown few. Most of
the six thousand present were mounted men of substance. Their
coffee hearths were outlined from afar by the camel saddles,
pitched in circles round the fire as elbow-rests for men reclining
between meals. The Arabs' physical perfection let them lie relaxed
to the stony ground like lizards, moulding themselves to its
roughness in corpse-like abandon.</p>

<p>They were quiet but confident. Some, who had been serving Feisal
for six months or more, had lost that pristine heat of eagerness
which had so thrilled me in Hamra; but they had gained experience
in compensation; and staying-power in the ideal was fatter and more
important for us than an early fierceness. Their patriotism was now
conscious; and their attendance grew more regular as the distance
from their tomes increased. Tribal independence of orders was still
maintained; but they had achieved a mild routine in camp life and
on the march. When the Sherif came near they fell into a ragged
line, and together made the bow and sweep of the arm to the lips,
which was the official salute. They did not oil their guns: they
said lest the sand clog them; also they had no oil, and it was
better rubbed in to soften wind-chaps on their skin; but the guns
were decently kept, and some of the owners could shoot at long
range.</p>

<p>In mass they were not formidable, since they had no corporate
spirit, nor discipline nor mutual confidence. The smaller the unit
the better its performance. A thousand were a mob, ineffective
against a company of trained Turks: but three or four Arabs in
their hills would stop a dozen Turks. Napoleon remarked this of the
Mamelukes. We were yet too breathless to turn our hasty practice
into principle: our tactics were empirical snatchings of the first
means to escape difficulty. But we were learning like our men.</p>

<p>From the battle of Nakhl Mubarak we abandoned the brigading of
Egyptian troops with irregulars. We embarked the Egyptian officers
and men, after turning over their complete equipment to Rasim,
Feisal's gunner, and Abdulla el Deleimi, his machine-gun officer.
They built up Arab companies out of local material, with a
stiffening of Turk-trained Syrian and Mesopotamian deserters.
Maulud, the fire-eating A.D.C., begged fifty mules off me, put
across them fifty of his trained infantrymen, and told them they
were cavalry. He was a martinet, and a born mounted officer, and by
his spartan exercises the much-beaten mule-riders grew painfully
into excellent soldiers, instantly obedient and capable of formal
attack. They were prodigies in the Arab ranks. We telegraphed for
another fifty mules, to double the dose of mounted infantry, since
the value of so tough a unit for reconnaissance was obvious.</p>

<p>Feisal suggested taking nearly all the Juheina to Wejh with him
and adding to them enough of the Harb and Billi, Ateiba and Ageyl
to give the mass a many-tribed character. We wanted this march,
which would be in its way a closing act of the war in Northern
Hejaz, to send a rumour through the length and breadth of Western
Arabia. It was to be the biggest operation of the Arabs in their
memory; dismissing those who saw it to their homes, with a sense
that their world had changed indeed; so that there would be no more
silly defections and jealousies of clans behind us in future, to
cripple us with family politics in the middle of our fighting.</p>

<p>Not that we expected immediate opposition. We bothered to take
this unwieldy mob with us to Wejh, in the teeth of efficiency and
experience, just because there was no fighting in the bill. We had
intangible assets on our side. In the first place, the Turks had
now engaged their surplus strength in attacking Rabegh, or rather
in prolonging their occupied area so as to attack Rabegh. It would
take them days to transfer back north. Then the Turks were stupid,
and we reckoned on their not hearing all at once of our move, and
on their not believing its first tale, and not seeing till later
what chances it had given them. If we did our march in three weeks
we should probably take Wejh by surprise. Lastly, we might develop
the sporadic raiding activity of the Harb into conscious
operations, to take booty, if possible, in order to be
self-supporting; but primarily to lock up large numbers of Turks in
defence positions. Zeid agreed to go down to Rabegh to organize
similar pin-pricks in the Turks' rear. I gave him letters to the
captain of the <i>Dufferin</i>, the Yenbo guardship, which would
ensure him a quick passage down: for all who knew of the Wejh
scheme were agog to help it.</p>

<p>To exercise my own hand in the raiding genre I took a test party
of thirty-five Mahamid with me from Nakhl Mubarak, on the second
day of 1917, to the old blockhouse-well of my first journey from
Rabegh to Yenbo. When dark came we dismounted, and left our camels
with ten men to guard them against possible Turkish patrols. The
rest of us climbed up Dhifran: a painful climb, for the hills were
of knife-sharp strata turned on edge and running in oblique lines
from crest to foot. They gave abundance of broken surface, but no
sure grip, for the stone was so minutely cracked that any segment
would come away from its matrix, in the hand.</p>

<p>The head of Dhifran was cold and misty, and time dragged till
dawn. We disposed ourselves in crevices of the rock, and at last
saw the tips of bell-tents three hundred yards away beneath us to
the right, behind a spur. We could not get a full view, so
contented ourselves with putting bullets through their tops. A
crowd of Turks turned out and leaped like stags into their
trenches. They were very fast targets, and probably suffered
little. In return they opened rapid fire in every direction, and
made a terrific row; as if signalling the Hamra force to turn out
in their help. As the enemy were already more than ten to one, the
reinforcements might have prevented our retreat: so we crawled
gently back till we could rush down into the first valley, where we
fell over two scared Turks, unbuttoned, at their morning exercise.
They were ragged, but something to show, and we dragged them
homeward, where their news proved useful.</p>

<p>Feisal was still nervous over abandoning Yenbo, hitherto his
indispensable base, and the second sea-port of Hejaz: and when
casting about for further expedients to distract the Turks from its
occupation we suddenly remembered Sidi Abdulla in Henakiyeh. He had
some five thousand irregulars, and a few guns and machine-guns, and
the reputation of his successful (if too slow) siege of Taif. It
seemed a shame to leave him wasting in the middle of the
wilderness. A first idea was that he might come to Kheibar, to
threaten the railway north of Medina: but Feisal improved my plan
vastly, by remembering Wadi Ais, the historic valley of springs and
palm-villages flowing through the impregnable Juheina hills from
behind Rudhwa eastward to the Hamdh valley near Hedia. It lay just
one hundred kilometres north of Medina, a direct threat on Fakhri's
railway communications with Damascus. From it Abdulla could keep up
his arranged blockade of Medina from the east, against caravans
from the Persian Gulf. Also it was near Yenbo, which could easily
feed him there with munitions and supplies.</p>

<p>The proposal was obviously an inspiration and we sent off Raja
el Khuluwi at once to put it to Abdulla. So sure were we of his
adopting it that we urged Feisal to move away from Wadi Yenbo
northward on the first stage to Wejh, without waiting a reply.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>

<p>He agreed, and we took the wide upper road through Wadi
Messarih, for Owais, a group of wells about fifteen miles to the
north of Yenbo. The hills were beautiful to-day. The rains of
December had been abundant, and the warm sun after them had
deceived the earth into believing it was spring. So a thin grass
had come up in all the hollows and flat places. The blades (single,
straight and very slender) shot up between the stones. If a man
bent over from his saddle and looked downward he would see no new
colour in the ground; but, by looking forward, and getting a
distant slope at a flat angle with his eye, he could feel a lively
mist of pale green here and there over the surface of slate-blue
and brown-red rock. In places the growth was strong, and our
painstaking camels had become prosperous, grazing on it.</p>

<p>The starting signal went, but only for us and the Ageyl. The
other units of the army, standing each man by his couched camel,
lined up beside our road, and, as Feisal came near, saluted him in
silence. He called back cheerfully, 'Peace upon you', and each head
sheikh returned the phrase. When we had passed they mounted, taking
the time from their chiefs, and so the forces behind us swelled
till there was a line of men and camels winding along the narrow
pass towards the watershed for as far back as the eye reached.</p>

<p>Feisal's greetings had been the only sounds before we reached
the crest of the rise where the valley opened out and became a
gentle forward slope of soft shingle and flint bedded in sand: but
there ibn Dakhil, the keen sheikh of Russ, who had raised this
contingent of Ageyl two years before to aid Turkey, and had brought
it over with him intact to the Sherif when the revolt came, dropped
back a pace or two, marshalled our following into a broad column of
ordered ranks, and made the drums strike up. Everyone burst out
singing a full-throated song in honour of Emir Feisal and his
family.</p>

<p>The march became rather splendid and barbaric. First rode Feisal
in white, then Sharraf at his right in red head-cloth and
henna-dyed tunic and cloak, myself on his left in white and
scarlet, behind us three banners of faded crimson silk with gilt
spikes, behind them the drummers playing a march, and behind them
again the wild mass of twelve hundred bouncing camels of the
bodyguard, packed as closely as they could move, the men in every
variety of coloured clothes and the camels nearly as brilliant in
their trappings. We filled the valley to its banks with our
flashing stream.</p>

<p>At the mouth of Messarih, a messenger rode up with letters to
Feisal from Abd el Kader, in Yenbo. Among them was one three days
old for me from the <i>Dufferin</i> to say that she would not
embark Zeid till she had seen me and heard details of the local
situation. She was in the Sherm, a lonely creek eight miles up the
coast from the port, where the officers could play cricket on the
beach without the plague of flies pervading Yenbo. Of course, they
cut themselves off from news by staying so far away: it was a point
of old friction between us. Her well-meaning commander had not the
breadth of Boyle, the fiery politician and revolutionary
constitutionalist, nor the brain of Linberry, of the
<i>Hardinge</i>, who filled himself with the shore gossip of every
port he touched, and who took pains to understand the nature of all
classes on his beat.</p>

<p>Apparently I had better race off to <i>Dufferin</i> and regulate
affairs. Zeid was a nice fellow, but would assuredly do something
quaint in his enforced holiday; and we needed peace just then.
Feisal sent some Ageyl with me and we made speed for Yenbo: indeed,
I got there in three hours, leaving my disgusted escort (who said
they would wear out neither camels nor bottoms for my impatience)
half way back on the road across the plain so wearily well known to
me. The sun, which had been delightful overhead in the hills, now,
in the evening, shone straight into our faces with a white fury,
before which I had to press my hand as shield over my eyes. Feisal
had given me a racing camel (a present from the Emir of Nejd to his
father), the finest and roughest animal I had ridden. Later she
died of overwork, mange, and necessary neglect on the road to
Akaba.</p>

<p>On arrival in Yenbo things were not as expected. Zeid had been
embarked, and the <i>Dufferin</i> had started that morning for
Rabegh. So I sat down to count what we needed of naval help on the
way to Wejh, and to scheme out means of transport. Feisal had
promised to wait at Owais till he got my report that everything was
ready.</p>

<p>The first check was a conflict between the civil and military
powers. Abd el Kader, the energetic but temperamental governor, had
been cluttered up with duties as our base grew in size, till Feisal
added to him a military commandant, Tewfik Bey, a Syrian from
Horns, to care for ordnance stores. Unfortunately, there was no
arbiter to define ordnance stores. That morning they fell out over
empty arms-chests. Abd el Kadir locked the store and went to lunch.
Tewfik came down to the quay with four men, a machine-gun and a
sledge hammer, and opened the door. Abd el Kader got into a boat,
rowed out to the British guardship&mdash;the tiny
<i>Espiegle</i>&mdash;and told her embarrassed but hospitable
captain that he had come to stay. His servant brought him food from
the shore and he slept the night in a camp-bed on the
quarter-deck.</p>

<p>I wanted to hurry, so began to solve the deadlock by making Abd
el Kadir write to Feisal for his decision and by making Tewfik hand
over the store to me. We brought the trawler <i>Arethusa</i> near
the sloop, that Abd el Kader might direct the loading of the
disputed chests from his ship, and lastly brought Tewfik off to the
<i>Espiegle</i> for a temporary reconciliation. It was made easy by
an accident, for, as Tewfik saluted his guard of honour at the
gangway (not strictly regular, this guard, but politic), his face
beamed and he said: This ship captured me at Kurna, pointing to the
trophy of the nameplate of the Turkish gunboat <i>Marmaris</i>,
which the <i>Espiegle</i> had sunk in action on the Tigris. Abd el
Kadir was as interested in the tale as Tewfik, and the trouble
ceased.</p>

<p>Sharraf came into Yenbo next day as Emir, in Feisal's place. He
was a powerful man, perhaps the most capable of all the Sherifs in
the army, but devoid of ambition: acting out of duty, not from
impulse. He was rich, and had been for years chief justice of the
Sherifs court. He knew and handled tribesmen better than any man,
and they feared him, for he was severe and impartial, and his face
was sinister, with a left eyebrow which drooped (the effect of an
old blow) and gave him an air of forbidding hardness. The surgeon
of the <i>Suva</i> operated on the eye and repaired much of the
damage, but the face remained one to rebuke liberties or weakness.
I found him good to work with, very clear-headed, wise and kind,
with a pleasant smile-his mouth became soft then, while his eyes
remained terrible-and a determination to do fittingly, always.</p>

<p>We agreed that the risk of the fall of Yenbo while we hunted
Wejh was great, and that it would be wise to empty it of stores.
Boyle gave me an opportunity by signalling that either
<i>Dufferin</i> or <i>Hardinge</i> would be made available for
transport. I replied that as difficulties would be severe I
preferred <i>Hardinge</i>! Captain Warren, whose ship intercepted
the message, felt it superfluous, but it brought along
<i>Hardinge</i> in the best temper two days later. She was an
Indian troop-ship, and her lowest troop-deck had great square ports
along the water level. Linberry opened these for us, and we stuffed
straight in eight thousand rifles, three million rounds of
ammunition, thousands of shells, quantities of rice and flour, a
shed-full of uniforms, two tons of high explosive, and all our
petrol, pell-mell. It was like posting letters in a box. In no time
she had taken a thousand tons of stuff.</p>

<p>Boyle came in eager for news. He promised the <i>Hardinge</i> as
depot ship throughout, to land food and water whenever needed, and
this solved the main difficulty. The Navy were already collecting.
Half the Red Sea Fleet would be present. The admiral was expected
and landing parties were being drilled on every ship. Everyone was
dyeing white duck khaki-coloured, or sharpening bayonets, or
practising with rifles.</p>

<p>I hoped silently, in their despite, that there would be no
fighting. Feisal had nearly ten thousand men, enough to fill the
whole Billi country with armed parties and carry off everything not
too heavy or too hot. The Billi knew it, and were now profuse in
their loyalties to the Sherif, completely converted to Arab
nationality.</p>

<p>It was sure that we would take Wejh: the fear was lest numbers
of Feisal's host die of hunger or thirst on the way. Supply was my
business, and rather a responsibility. However, the country to Urn
Lejj, half way, was friendly: nothing tragic could happen so far as
that: therefore, we sent word to Feisal that all was ready, and he
left Owais on the very day that Abdulla replied welcoming the Ais
plan and promising an immediate start thither. The same day came
news of my relief. Newcombe, the regular colonel being sent to
Hejaz as chief of our military mission, had arrived in Egypt, and
his two staff officers, Cox and Vickery, were actually on their way
down the Red Sea, to join this expedition.</p>

<p>Boyle took me to Um Lejj in the <i>Suva</i>, and we went ashore
to get the news. The sheikh told us that Feisal would arrive
to-day, at Bir el Waheidi, the water supply, four miles inland. We
sent up a message for him and then walked over to the fort which
Boyle had shelled some months before from the <i>Fox</i>. It was
just a rubble barrack, and Boyle looked at the ruins and said: I'm
rather ashamed of myself for smashing such a potty place.' He was a
very professional officer, alert, businesslike and official;
sometimes a little intolerant of easy-going things and people.
Red-haired men are seldom patient. 'Ginger Boyle', as they called
him, was warm.</p>

<p>While we were looking over the ruins four grey ragged elders of
the village came up and asked leave to speak. They said that some
months before a sudden two-funnelled ship had come up and destroyed
their fort. They were now required to re-build it for the police of
the Arab Government. Might they ask the generous captain of this
peaceable one-funnelled ship for a little timber, or for other
material help towards the restoration? Boyle was restless at their
long speech, and snapped at me, What is it? What do they want?' I
said, 'Nothing; they were describing the terrible effect of the
<i>Fox's</i> bombardment.' Boyle looked round him for a moment and
smiled grimly, 'It's a fair mess'.</p>

<p>Next day Vickery arrived. He was a gunner, and in his ten years'
service in the Sudan had learned Arabic, both literary and
colloquial, so well that he would quit us of all need of an
interpreter. We arranged to go up with Boyle to Feisal's camp to
make the timetable for the attack, and after lunch Englishmen and
Arabs got to work and discussed the remaining march to Wejh.</p>

<p>We decided to break the army into sections: and that these
should proceed independently to our concentration place of Abu
Zereibat in Hamdh, after which there was no water before Wejh; but
Boyle agreed that the <i>Hardinge</i> should take station for a
single night in Sherm Habban&mdash;supposed to be a possible
harbour&mdash;and land twenty tons of water for us on the beach. So
that was settled.</p>

<p>For the attack on Wejh we offered Boyle an Arab landing party of
several hundred Harb and Juheina peasantry and freed men, under
Saleh ibn Shefia, a negroid boy of good courage (with the faculty
of friendliness) who kept his men in reasonable order by
conjurations and appeals, and never minded how much his own dignity
was outraged by them or by us. Boyle accepted them and decided to
put them on another deck of the many-stomached <i>Hardinge</i>.
They, with the naval party, would land north of the town, where the
Turks had no post to block a landing, and whence Wejh and its
harbour were best turned.</p>

<p>Boyle would have at least six ships, with fifty guns to occupy
the Turks' minds, and a seaplane ship to direct the guns. We would
be at Abu Zereibat on the twentieth of the month: at Habban for the
<i>Hardinge</i>'s water on the twenty-second: and the landing party
should go ashore at dawn on the twenty-third, by which time our
mounted men would have closed all roads of escape from the
town.</p>

<p>The news from Rabegh was good; and the Turks had made no attempt
to profit by the nakedness of Yenbo. These were our hazards, and
when Boyle's wireless set them at rest we were mightily encouraged.
Abdulla was almost in Ais: we were half-way to Wejh: the initiative
had passed to the Arabs. I was so joyous that for a moment I forgot
my self-control, and said exultingly that in a year we would be
tapping on the gates of Damascus. A chill came over the feeling in
the tent and my hopefulness died. Later, I heard that Vickery had
gone to Boyle and vehemently condemned me as a braggart and
visionary; but, though the outburst was foolish, it was not an
impossible dream, for five months later I was in Damascus, and a
year after that I was its <i>de facto</i> Governor.</p>

<p>Vickery had disappointed me, and I had angered him. He knew I
was militarily incompetent and thought me politically absurd. I
knew he was the trained soldier our cause needed, and yet he seemed
blind to its power. The Arabs nearly made shipwreck through this
blindness of European advisers, who would not see that rebellion
was not war: indeed, was more of the nature of peace&mdash;a
national strike perhaps. The conjunction of Semites, an idea, and
an armed prophet held illimitable possibilities; in skilled hands
it would have been, not Damascus, but Constantinople which was
reached in 1918.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV</h3>

<p>Early next morning, having seen that the <i>Hardinge</i> was
unloading without friction, I went ashore to Sheikh Yusuf, and
found him helping his Bisha police, the frightened villagers and a
squad of old Maulud's men to throw a quick barricade across the end
of the main street. He told me that fifty wild mules, without
halter or bridle or saddle, had been loosed on shore that morning
from a ship. By luck rather than skill they had been stampeded into
the market-place: the exits were now safely barred, and there they
must remain, ramping about the stalls, till Maulud, to whom they
were addressed, invented saddlery in the wilderness. This was the
second batch of fifty mules for the mounted unit, and by the chance
of our fear at Yenbo we, fortunately, had spare ropes and bits
enough for them on board the <i>Hardinge</i>. So by noon the shops
were again open, and the damage paid for.</p>

<p>I went up to Feisal's camp, which was busy. Some of the tribes
were drawing a month's wages; all were getting eight days' food;
tents and heavy baggage were being stored; and the last arrangement
for the march being made. I sat and listened to the chatter of the
staff: Faiz el Ghusein, Beduin sheikh, Turkish official, chronicler
of the Armenian massacres, now secretary; Nesib el Bekri, Damascene
land-owner, and Feisal's host in Syria, now exiled from his country
with a death-sentence over him; Sami, Nesib's brother, graduate of
the Law School, and now assistant paymaster; Shefik el Eyr,
ex-journalist, now assistant secretary, a little white-faced man,
and furtive, with a whispering manner, honest in his patriotism,
but in life perverse, and so a nasty colleague.</p>

<p>Hassan Sharaf, the headquarters' doctor, a noble man who had put
not merely his life, but his purse to service in the Arab cause,
was plaintive with excess of disgust at finding his phials smashed
and their drugs confounded in the bottom of his chest. Shefik
rallying him, said, 'Do you expect a rebellion to be comfortable?'
and the contrast with the pale misery of their manner delighted us.
In hardships the humour of triteness outweighed a whole world of
wit.</p>

<p>With Feisal in the evening we talked of the coming marches. The
first stage was short: to Semna, where were palm-groves and wells
of abundant water. After that there was choice of ways, to be
determined only when our scouts returned with reports as to ponded
rainwater. By the coast, the straight road, it was sixty dry miles
to the next well, and our multitude of footmen would find that
long.</p>

<p>The army at Bir el Waheida amounted to five thousand one hundred
camel-riders, and five thousand three hundred men on foot, with
four Krupp mountain guns, and ten machine-guns: and for transport
we had three hundred and eighty baggage camels. Everything was cut
to the lowest, far below the standard of the Turks. Our start was
set for January the eighteenth just after noon, and punctually by
lunch-time Feisal's work was finished. We were a merry party:
Feisal himself, relaxed after responsibility, Abd el Kerim, never
very serious, Sherif Jabar, Nasib and Sami, Shefik, Hassan Sharaf
and myself. After lunch the tent was struck. We went to our camels,
where they were couched in a circle, saddled and loaded, each held
short by the slave standing on its doubled foreleg. The kettle
drummer, waiting beside ibn Dakhil, who commanded the bodyguard,
rolled his drum seven or eight times, and everything became still.
We watched Feisal. He got up from his rug, on which he had been
saying a last word to Abd el Kerim, caught the saddle-pommels in
his hands, put his knee on the side and said aloud, 'Make God your
agent'. The slave released the camel, which sprang up. When it was
on its feet Feisal passed his other leg across its back, swept his
skirts and his cloak under him by a wave of the arm, and settled
himself in the saddle.</p>

<p>As his camel moved we had jumped for ours, and the whole mob
rose together, some of the beasts roaring, but the most quiet, as
trained she-camels should be. Only a young animal, a male or
ill-bred, would grumble on the road, and self-respecting Beduins
did not ride such, since the noise might give them away by night or
in surprise attacks. The camels took their first abrupt steps, and
we riders had quickly to hook our legs round the front cantles, and
pick up the head-stalls to check the pace. We then looked where
Feisal was, and tapped our mounts' heads gently round, and pressed
them on the shoulders with our bare feet till they were in line
beside him. Ibn Dakhil came up, and after a glance at the country
and the direction of march passed a short order for the Ageyl to
arrange themselves in wings, out to right and left of us for two or
three hundred yards, camel marching by camel in line as near as the
accidents underfoot permitted. The manoeuvre was neatly done.</p>

<p>These Ageyl were Nejd townsmen, the youth of Aneyza, Boreida or
Russ, who had contracted for service as regular camel corps for a
term of years. They were young, from sixteen to twenty-five, and
nice fellows, large-eyed, cheery, a bit educated, catholic,
intelligent, good companions on the road. There was seldom a heavy
one. Even in repose (when most Eastern faces emptied themselves of
life) these lads remained keen-looking and handsome. They talked a
delicate and elastic Arabic, and were mannered, often foppish, in
habit. The docility and reasonableness of their town-bred minds
made them look after themselves and their masters without
reiterated instructions. Their fathers dealt in camels, and they
had followed the trade from infancy; consequently they wandered
instinctively, like Beduin; while the decadent softness in their
nature made them biddable, tolerant of the harshness and physical
punishment which in the East were the outward proofs of discipline.
They were essentially submissive; yet had the nature of soldiers,
and fought with brains and courage when familiarly led.</p>

<p>Not being a tribe, they had no blood enemies, but passed freely
in the desert: the carrying trade and chaffer of the interior lay
in their hands. The gains of the desert were poor, but enough to
tempt them abroad, since the conditions of their home-life were
uncomfortable. The Wahabis, followers of a fanatical Moslem heresy,
had imposed their strict rules on easy and civilized Kasim. In
Kasim there was but little coffee-hospitality, much prayer and
fasting, no tobacco, no artistic dalliance with women, no silk
clothes, no gold and silver head-ropes or ornaments. Everything was
forcibly pious or forcibly puritanical.</p>

<p>It was a natural phenomenon, this periodic rise at intervals of
little more than a century, of ascetic creeds in Central Arabia.
Always the votaries found their neighbours' beliefs cluttered with
inessential things, which became impious in the hot imagination of
their preachers. Again and again they had arisen, had taken
possession, soul and body, of the tribes, and had dashed themselves
to pieces on the urban Semites, merchants and concupiscent men of
the world. About their comfortable possessions the new creeds ebbed
and flowed like the tides or the changing seasons, each movement
with the seeds of early death in its excess of Tightness. Doubtless
they must recur so long as the causes&mdash;sun, moon, wind, acting
in the emptiness of open spaces, weigh without check on the
unhurried and uncumbered minds of the desert-dwellers.</p>

<p>However, this afternoon the Ageyl were not thinking of
<i>God</i>, but of us, and as ibn Dakhil ranged them to the right
and left they fell eagerly into rank. There came a warning patter
from the drums and the poet of the right wing burst into strident
song, a single invented couplet, of Feisal and the pleasures he
would afford us at Wejh. The right wing listened to the verse
intently, took it up and sang it together once, twice and three
times, with pride and self-satisfaction and derision. However,
before they could brandish it a fourth time the poet of the left
wing broke out in extempore reply, in the same metre, in answering
rhyme, and capping the sentiment. The left wing cheered it in a
roar of triumph, the drums tapped again, the standard-bearers threw
out their great crimson banners, and the whole guard, right, left
and centre, broke together into the rousing regimental chorus,</p>

<p>I've lost Britain, and I've lost Gaul, I've lost Rome, and,
worst of all, I've lost Lalage&mdash;'</p>

<p>only it was Nejd they had lost, and the women of the Maabda, and
their future lay from Jidda towards Suez. Yet it was a good song,
with a rhythmical beat which the camels loved, so that they put
down their heads, stretched their necks out far and with lengthened
pace shuffled forward musingly while it lasted.</p>

<p>Our road to-day was easy for them, since it was over firm sand
slopes, long, slowly-rising waves of dunes, bare-backed, but for
scrub in the folds, or barren palm-trees solitary in the moist
depressions. Afterwards in a broad flat, two horsemen came
cantering across from the left to greet Feisal. I knew the first
one, dirty old blear-eyed Mohammed Ali el Beidawi, Emir of the
Juheina: but the second looked strange. When he came nearer I saw
he was in khaki uniform, with a cloak to cover it and a silk
head-cloth and head-rope, much awry. He looked up, and there was
Newcombe's red and peeling face, with straining eyes and vehement
mouth, a strong, humorous grin between the jaws. He had arrived at
Um Lejj this morning, and hearing we were only just off, had seized
Sheikh Yu-suf's fastest horse and galloped after us.</p>

<p>I offered him my spare camel and an introduction to Feisal, whom
he greeted like an old school-friend; and at once they plunged into
the midst of things, suggesting, debating, planning at lightning
speed. Newcombe's initial velocity was enormous, and the freshness
of the day and the life and happiness of the Army gave inspiration
to the march and brought the future bubbling out of us without
pain.</p>

<p>We passed Ghowashia, a ragged grove of palms, and marched over a
lava-field easily, its roughnesses being drowned in sand just deep
enough to smooth them, but not deep enough to be too soft. The tops
of the highest lava-piles showed through. An hour later we came
suddenly to a crest which dropped as a sand slope, abrupt and swept
and straight enough to be called a sand-cliff, into a broad
splendid valley of rounded pebbles. This was Semna, and our road
went down the steep, through terraces of palms.</p>

<p>The wind had been following our march, and so it was very still
and warm at bottom of the valley in lee of the great bank of sand.
Here was our water, and here we would halt till the scouts returned
from seeking rain-pools in front of us; for so Abd el Kerim, our
chief guide, had advised. We rode the four hundred yards across the
valley and up the further slopes till we were safe from floods, and
there Feisal tapped his camel lightly on the neck till she sank to
her knees with a scrape of shingle pushed aside, and settled
herself. Hejris spread the carpet for us, and with the other
Sherifs we sat and jested while the coffee was made hot.</p>

<p>I maintained against Feisal the greatness of Ibrahim Pasha,
leader of Milli-Kurds, in North Mesopotamia. When he was to march,
his women rose before dawn, and footing noiselessly overhead on the
taut tentcloth, unskewered the strips of it, while others beneath
held and removed the poles till all was struck and divided into
camel-loads, and loaded. Then they drove off, so that the Pasha
awoke alone on his pallet in the open air where at night he had
lain down in the rich inner compartment of his palace-tent.</p>

<p>He would get up at leisure and drink coffee on his carpet: and
afterwards the horses would be brought, and they would ride towards
the new camping ground. But if on his way he thirsted he would
crisp his fingers to the servants, and the coffee man would ride up
beside him with his pots ready and his brazier burning on a copper
bracket of the saddle, to serve the cup on the march without
breaking stride; and at sunset they would find the women waiting in
the erected tent, as it had been on the evening before.</p>

<p>To-day had a grey weather, so strange after the many thronging
suns, that Newcombe and I walked stooping to look where our shadows
had gone, as we talked of what I hoped, and of what he wanted.</p>

<p>They were the same thing, so we had brain-leisure to note Semna
and its fine groves of cared-for palms between little hedges of
dead thorn; with here and there huts of reed and palm-rib, to
shelter the owners and their families at times of fertilization and
harvest. In the lowest gardens and in the valley bed were the
shallow wood-lined wells, whose water was, they said, fairly sweet
and never-failing: but so little fluent that to water our host of
camels took the night.</p>

<p>Feisal wrote letters from Semna to twenty-five leaders of the
Billi and Howeitat and Beni Atiyeh, saying that he with his army
would be instantly in Wejh and they must see to it. Mohammed Ali
bestirred himself, and since almost all our men were of his tribe,
was useful in arranging the detachments and detailing them their
routes for the morrow. Our water-scouts had come in, to report
shallow pools at two points well-spaced on the coast road. After
cross-questioning them we decided to send four sections that way,
and the other five by the hills: in such a fashion we thought we
should arrive soonest and safest at Abu Zereibat.</p>

<p>The route was not easy to decide with the poor help of the Musa
Juheina, our informants. They seemed to have no unit of time
smaller than the half-day, or of distance between the span and the
stage; and a stage might be from six to sixteen hours according to
the man's will and camel. Intercommunication between our units was
hindered because often there was no one who could read or write, in
either. Delay, confusion, hunger and thirst marred this expedition.
These might have been avoided had time let us examine the route
beforehand. The animals were without food for nearly three days,
and the men marched the last fifty miles on half a gallon of water,
with nothing to eat. It did not in any way dim their spirit, and
they trotted into Wejh gaily enough, hoarsely singing, and
executing mock charges: but Feisal said that another hot and barren
midday would have broken both their speed and their energy.</p>

<p>When business ended, Newcombe and I went off to sleep in the
tent Feisal had lent us as a special luxury. Baggage conditions
were so hard and important for us that we rich took pride in faring
like the men, who could not transport unnecessary things: and never
before had I had a tent of my own. We pitched it at the very edge
of a bluff of the foothills; a bluff no wider than the tent and
rounded, so that the slope went straight down from the pegs of the
door-flap. There we found sitting and waiting for us Abd el Kerim,
the young Beidawi Sherif, wrapped up to the eyes in his head-cloth
and cloak, since the evening was chill and threatened rain. He had
come to ask me for a mule, with saddle and bridle. The smart
appearance of Maulud's little company in breeches and puttees, and
their fine new animals in the market at Um Lejj, had roused his
desire.</p>

<p>I played with his eagerness, and put him off, advancing a
condition that he should ask me after our successful arrival at
Wejh; and with this he was content. We hungered for sleep, and at
last he rose to go, but, chancing to look across the valley, saw
the hollows beneath and about us winking with the faint camp-fires
of the scattered contingents. He called me out to look, and swept
his arm round, saying half-sadly, 'We are no longer Arabs but a
People'.</p>

<p>He was half-proud too, for the advance on Wejh was their biggest
effort; the first time in memory that the manhood of a tribe, with
transport, arms, and food for two hundred miles, had left its
district and marched into another's territory without the hope of
plunder or the stimulus of blood feud. Abd el Kerim was glad that
his tribe had shown this new spirit of service, but also sorry; for
to him the joys of life were a fast camel, the best weapons, and a
short sharp raid against his neighbour's herd: and the gradual
achievement of Feisal's ambition was making such joys less and less
easy for the responsible.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>

<p>During the morning it rained persistently; and we were glad to
see more water coming to us, and so comfortable in the tents at
Semna that we delayed our start till the sun shone again in the
early afternoon. Then we rode westward down the valley in the fresh
light. First behind us came the Ageyl. After them Abd el Kerim led
his Gufa men, about seven hundred of them mounted, with more than
that number following afoot. They were dressed in white, with large
head-shawls of red and black striped cotton, and they waved green
palm-branches instead of banners.</p>

<p>Next to them rode Sherif Mohammed Ali abu Sharrain, an old
patriarch with a long, curling grey beard and an upright carriage
of himself. His three hundred riders were Ashraf, of the Aiaishi
(Juheina) stock, known Sherifs, but only acknowledged in the mass,
since they had not inscribed pedigrees. They wore rusty-red tunics
henna-dyed, under black cloaks, and carried swords. Each had a
slave crouched behind him on the crupper to help him with rifle and
dagger in the fight, and to watch his camel and cook for him on the
road. The slaves, as befitted slaves of poor masters, were very
little dressed. Their strong, black legs gripped the camels' woolly
sides as in a vice, to lessen the shocks inevitable on their bony
perches, while they had knotted up their rags of shirts into the
plaited thong about their loins to save them from the fouling of
the camels and their staling on the march. Semna water was
medicinal, and our animals' dung flowed like green soup down their
hocks that day.</p>

<p>Behind the Ashraf came the crimson banner of our last tribal
detachment, the Rifaa, under Owdi ibn Zuweid, the old wheedling
sea-pirate who had robbed the Stotzingen Mission and thrown their
wireless and their Indian servants into the sea at Yenbo. The
sharks presumably refused the wireless, but we had spent fruitless
hours dragging for it in the harbour. Owdi still wore a long, rich,
fur-lined German officer's greatcoat, a garment little suited to
the climate but, as he insisted, magnificent booty. He had about a
thousand men, three-quarters of them on foot, and next him marched
Rasim, the gunner commandant, with his four old Krupp guns on the
pack-mules, just as we had lifted them from the Egyptian Army.</p>

<p>Rasim was a sardonic Damascene, who rose laughing to every
crisis and slunk about sore-headed with grievances when things went
well. On this day there were dreadful murmurings, for alongside him
rode Abdulla el Deleimi, in charge of machine-guns, a quick,
clever, superficial but attractive officer, much of the
professional type, whose great joy was to develop some rankling
sorrow in Rasim till it discharged full blast on Feisal or myself.
To-day I helped him by smiling to Rasim that we were moving at
intervals of a quarter-day in echelon of sub-tribes. Rasim looked
over the new-washed underwood, where raindrops glistened in the
light of the sun setting redly across the waves below a ceiling of
clouds, and looked too at the wild mob of Beduins racing here and
there on foot after birds and rabbits and giant lizards and jerboas
and one another: and assented sourly, saying that he too would
shortly become a sub-tribe, and echelon himself half a day to one
side or other, and be quit of flies.</p>

<p>At first starting a man in the crowd had shot a hare from the
saddle, but because of the risk of wild shooting Feisal had then
forbidden it, and those later put up by our camels' feet were
chased with sticks. We laughed at the sudden commotion in the
marching companies: cries, and camels swerving violently, their
riders leaping off and laying out wildly with their canes to kill
or to be pickers-up of a kill. Feisal was happy to see the army win
so much meat, but disgusted at the shameless Juheina appetite for
lizards and jerboas.</p>

<p>We rode over the flat sand, among the thorn trees, which here
were plentiful and large, till we came out on the sea-beach and
turned northward along a broad, well-beaten track, the Egyptian
pilgrim road. It ran within fifty yards of the sea, and we could go
up it thirty or forty singing files abreast. An old lava-bed half
buried in sand jutted out from the hills four or five miles inland,
and made a promontory. The road cut across this, but at the near
side were some mud flats, on which shallow reaches of water burned
in the last light of the west. This was our expected stage, and
Feisal signalled the halt. We got off our camels and stretched
ourselves, sat down or walked before supper to the sea and bathed
by hundreds, a splashing, screaming, mob of fish-like naked men of
all earth's colours.</p>

<p>Supper was to look forward to, as a Juheina that afternoon had
shot a gazelle for Feisal. Gazelle meat we found better than any
other in the desert, because this beast, however barren the land
and dry the water-holes, seemed to own always a fat juicy body.</p>

<p>The meal was the expected success. We retired early, feeling too
full: but soon after Newcombe and myself had stretched out in our
tent we were quickened by a wave of excitement travelling up the
lines; running camels, shots, and shouts. A breathless slave thrust
his head under the flap crying, 'News! news! Sherif Bey is taken'.
I jumped up and ran through the gathering crowd to Feisal's tent,
which was already beset by friends and servants. With Feisal sat,
portentously and unnaturally collected in the din, Raja, the
tribesman who had taken to Abdulla word to move into Wadi Ais.
Feisal was radiant, his eyes swollen with joy, as he jumped up and
shouted to me through the voices, 'Abdulla has captured Eshref
Bey'. Then I knew how big and good the event was.</p>

<p>Eshref was a notorious adventurer in the lower levels of Turkish
politics. In his boyhood, near his Smyrna home, he had been just a
brigand, but with years he became a revolutionary, and when he was
finally captured Abd el Hamid exiled him to Medina for five
coloured years. At first he was closely confined there, but one day
he broke the privy window and escaped to Shehad, the bibulous Emir,
in his suburb of Awali. Shahad was, as usual, at war with the Turks
and gave him sanctuary; but Eshref, finding ME dull, at last
borrowed a fine mare and rode to the Turkish barracks. On its
square was the officer-son of his enemy the Governor drilling a
company of gendarmes. He galloped him down, slung him across his
saddle, and made away before the astonished police could
protest.</p>

<p>He took to Jebel Ohod, an uninhabited place, driving his
prisoner before him, calling him his ass, and lading upon him
thirty loaves and the skins of water necessary for their
nourishment. To recover his son, the Pasha gave Eshref liberty on
parole and five hundred pounds. He bought camels, a tent, and a
wife, and wandered among the tribes till the Young Turk revolution.
Then he reappeared in Constantinople and became a bravo, doing
Enver's murders. His services earned the appointment of inspector
of refugee-relief in Macedonia, and he retired a year later with an
assured income from landed estate.</p>

<p>When war broke out he went down to Medina with funds, and
letters from the Sultan to Arabian neutrals; his mission being to
open communications with the isolated Turkish garrison in Yemen.
His track on the first stage of the journey had happened to cross
Abdulla's, on his way to Wadi Ais, near Kheibar, and some of the
Arabs, watching their camels during a midday halt, had been stopped
by Eshref's men and questioned. They said they were Heteym, and
Abdulla's army a supply caravan going to Medina. Eshref released
one with orders to bring the rest for examination, and this man
told Abdulla of soldiers camped up on the hill.</p>

<p>Abdulla was puzzled and sent horsemen to investigate. A minute
later he was startled by the sudden chatter of a machine-gun. He
leaped to the conclusion that the Turks had sent out a flying
column to cut him off, and ordered his mounted men to charge them
desperately. They galloped over the machine-gun, with few
casualties, and scattered the Turks. Eshref fled on foot to the
hill-top. Abdulla offered a reward of a thousand pounds for him;
and near dusk he was found, wounded, and captured by Sherif Fauzan
el Harith, in a stiff fight.</p>

<p>In the baggage were twenty thousand pounds in coin, robes of
honour, costly presents, some interesting papers, and camel loads
of rifles and pistols. Abdulla wrote an exultant letter to Fakhri
Pasha (telling him of the capture), and nailed it to an uprooted
telegraph pole between the metals, when he crossed the railway next
night on his unimpeded way to Wadi Ais. Raja had left him there,
camped in quiet and in ease. The news was a double fortune for
us.</p>

<p>Between the joyful men slipped the sad figure of the Imam, who
raised his hand. Silence fell for an instant. Hear me,' he said,
and intoned an ode in praise of the event, to the effect that
Abdulla was especially favoured, and had attained quickly to the
glory which Feisal was winning slowly but surely by hard work. The
poem was creditable as the issue of only sixteen minutes, and the
poet was rewarded in gold. Then Feisal saw a gaudy jewelled dagger
at Raja's belt. Raja stammered it was Eshref's. Feisal threw him
his own and pulled the other off, to give it in the end to Colonel
Wilson. What did my brother say to Eshref?' Is this your return for
our hospitality?' While Eshref had replied like Suckling, 'I can
fight, Whether I am the wrong or right, Devoutly!'</p>

<p>'How many millions did the Arabs get?' gasped greedy old
Mohammed Ali, when he heard of Abdulla to the elbows in the
captured chest, flinging gold by handfuls to the tribes. Raja was
everywhere in hot demand, and he slept a richer man that night,
deservedly, for Abdulla's march to Ais made the Medina situation
sure. With Murray pressing in Sinai, Feisal nearing Wejh, and
Abdulla between Wejh and Medina, the position of the Turks in
Arabia became defensive only. The tide of our ill-fortune had
turned; and the camp seeing our glad faces was noisy until
dawn.</p>

<p>Next day we rode easily. A breakfast suggested itself, upon our
finding some more little water-pools, in a bare valley flowing down
from El Sukhur, a group of three extraordinary hills like granite
bubbles blown through the earth. The journey was pleasant, for it
was cool; there were a lot of us; and we two Englishmen had a tent
in which we could shut ourselves up and be alone. A weariness of
the desert was the living always in company, each of the party
hearing all that was said and seeing all that was done by the
others day and night. Yet the craving for solitude seemed part of
the delusion of self-sufficiency, a factitious making-rare of the
person to enhance its strangeness in its own estimation. To have
privacy, as Newcombe and I had, was ten thousand times more restful
than the open life, but the work suffered by the creation of such a
bar between the leaders and men. Among the Arabs there were no
distinctions, traditional or natural, except the unconscious power
given a famous sheikh by virtue of his accomplishment; and they
taught me that no man could be their leader except he ate the
ranks' food, wore their clothes, lived level with them, and yet
appeared better in himself.</p>

<p>In the morning we pressed towards Abu Zereibat with the early
sun incandescent in a cloudless sky, and the usual eye-racking
dazzle and dance of sunbeams on polished sand or polished flint.
Our path rose slightly at a sharp limestone ridge with eroded
flanks, and we looked over a sweeping fall of bare, black gravel
between us and the sea, which now lay about eight miles to the
westward: but invisible.</p>

<p>Once we halted and began to feel that a great depression lay in
front of us; but not till two in the afternoon after we had crossed
a basalt outcrop did we look out over a trough fifteen miles
across, which was Wadi Hamdh, escaped from the hills. On the
north-west spread the great delta through which Hamdh spilled
itself by twenty mouths; and we saw the dark lines, which were
thickets of scrub in the flood channels of the dried beds, twisting
in and out across the flat from the hill-edge beneath us, till they
were lost in the sun-haze thirty miles away beyond us to our left,
near the invisible sea. Behind Hamdh rose sheer from the plain a
double hill, Jebel Raal: hog-backed but for a gash which split it
in the middle. To our eyes, sated with small things, it was a fair
sight, this end of a dry river longer than the Tigris; the greatest
valley in Arabia, first understood by Doughty, and as yet
unexplored; while Raal was a fine hill, sharp and distinctive,
which did honour to the Hamdh.</p>

<p>Full of expectation we rode down the gravel slopes, on which
tufts of grass became more frequent, till at three o'clock we
entered the Wadi itself. It proved a bed about a mile wide, filled
with clumps of <i>asla</i> bushes, round which clung sandy hillocks
each a few feet high. Their sand was not pure, but seamed with
lines of dry and brittle clay, last indications of old flood
levels. These divided them sharply into layers, rotten with salty
mud and flaking away, so that our camels sank in, fetlock-deep,
with a crunching noise like breaking pastry. The dust rose up in
thick clouds, thickened yet more by the sunlight held in them; for
the dead air of the hollow was a-dazzle.</p>

<p>The ranks behind could not see where they were going, which was
difficult for them, as the hillocks came closer together, and the
river-bed slit into a maze of shallow channels, the work of partial
floods year after year. Before we gained the middle of the valley
everything was over-grown by brushwood, which sprouted sideways
from the mounds and laced one to another with tangled twigs as dry,
dusty and brittle as old bone. We tucked in the streamers of our
gaudy saddle-bags, to prevent their being jerked off by the bushes,
drew cloaks tight over our clothes, bent our heads down to guard
our eyes and crashed through like a storm amongst reeds. The dust
was blinding and choking, and the snapping of the branches,
grumbles of the camels, shouts and laughter of the men, made a rare
adventure.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI</h3>

<p>Before we quite reached the far bank the ground suddenly cleared
at a clay bottom, in which stood a deep brown water-pool, eighty
yards long and about fifteen yards wide. This was the flood-water
of Abu Zereibat, our goal. We went a few yards further, through the
last scrub, and reached the open north bank where Feisal had
appointed the camp. It was a huge plain of sand and flints, running
to the very feet of Raal, with room on it for all the armies of
Arabia. So we stopped our camels, and the slaves unloaded them and
set up the tents; while we walked back to see the mules, thirsty
after their long day's march, rush with the foot-soldiers into the
pond, kicking and splashing with pleasure in the sweet water. The
abundance of fuel was an added happiness, and in whatever place
they chose to camp each group of friends had a roaring
fire&mdash;very welcome, as a wet evening mist rose eight feet out
of the ground and our woollen cloaks stiffened and grew cold with
its silver beads in their coarse woof.</p>

<p>It was a black night, moonless, but above the fog very brilliant
with stars. On a little mound near our tents we collected and
looked over the rolling white seas of fog. Out of it arose
tent-peaks, and tall spires of melting smoke, which became luminous
underneath when the flames licked higher into the clean air, as if
driven by the noises of the unseen army. Old Auda ibn Zuweid
corrected me gravely when I said this to him, telling me, 'It is
not an army, it is a world which is moving on Wejh'. I rejoiced at
his insistence, for it had been to create this very feeling that we
had hampered ourselves with an unwieldy crowd of men on so
difficult a march.</p>

<p>That evening the Billi began to come in to us shyly, and swear
fealty, for the Hamdh Valley was their boundary. Amongst them Hamid
el Bifada rode up with a numerous company to pay his respects to
Feisal. He told us that his cousin, Suleiman Pasha, the paramount
of the tribe, was at Abu Ajaj, fifteen miles north of us, trying
desperately for once to make up the mind which had chopped and
balanced profitably throughout a long life. Then, without warning
or parade, Sherif Nasir of Medina came in. Feisal leaped up and
embraced him, and led him over to us.</p>

<p>Nasir made a splendid impression, much as we had heard, and much
as we were expecting of him. He was the opener of roads, the
forerunner of Feisal's movement, the man who had fired his first
shot in Medina, and who was to fire our last shot at Muslimieh
beyond Aleppo on the day that Turkey asked for an armistice, and
from beginning to end <i>all</i> that could be told of him was
good.</p>

<p>He was a brother of Shehad, the Emir of Medina. Their family was
descended from Hussein, the younger of Ali's children, and they
were the only descendants of Hussein considered Ashraf, not Saada.
They were Shias, and had been since the days of Kerbela, and in
Hejaz were respected only second to the Emirs of Mecca. Nasir
himself was a man of gardens, whose lot had been unwilling war
since boyhood. He was now about twenty-seven. His low, broad
forehead matched his sensitive eyes, while his weak pleasant mouth
and small chin were clearly seen through a clipped black beard.</p>

<p>He had been up here for two months, containing Wejh, and his
last news was that the outpost of Turkish camel corps upon our road
had withdrawn that morning towards the main defensive position.</p>

<p>We slept late the following day, to brace ourselves for the
necessary hours of talk. Feisal carried most of this upon his own
shoulders. Nasir supported him as second in command, and the
Beidawi brothers sat by to help. The day was bright and warm,
threatening to be hot later, and Newcombe and I wandered about
looking at the watering, the men, and the constant affluence of
newcomers. When the sun was high a great cloud of dust from the
east heralded a larger party and we walked back to the tents to see
Mirzuk el Tikheimi, Feisal's sharp, mouse-featured guest-master,
ride in. He led his clansmen of the Juheina past the Emir at a
canter, to make a show. They stifled us with their dust, for his
van of a dozen sheikhs carrying a large red flag and a large white
flag drew their swords and charged round and round our tents. We
admired neither their riding nor their mares: perhaps because they
were a nuisance to us.</p>

<p>About noon the Wuld Mohammed Harb, and the mounted men of the
ibn Shefia battalion came in: three hundred men, under Sheikh Salih
and Mohammed ibn Shefia. Mohammed was a tubby, vulgar little man of
fifty-five, common-sensible and energetic. He was rapidly making a
name for himself in the Arab army, for he would get done any manual
work. His men were the sweepings of Wadi Yenbo, landless and
without family, or labouring Yenbo townsmen, hampered by no
inherited dignity. They were more docile than any other of our
troops except the white-handed Ageyl who were too beautiful to be
made into labourers.</p>

<p>We were already two days behind our promise to the Navy, and
Newcombe decided to ride ahead this night to Habban. There he would
meet Boyle and explain that we must fail the <i>Hardinge</i> at the
rendezvous, but would be glad if she could return there on the
evening of the twenty-fourth, when we should arrive much in need of
water. He would also see if the naval attack could not be delayed
till the twenty-fifth to preserve the joint scheme.</p>

<p>After dark there came a message from Suleiman Rifada, with a
gift-camel for Feisal to keep if he were friendly, and to send back
if hostile. Feisal was vexed, and protested his inability to
understand so feeble a man. Nasir asserted, 'Oh, it's because he
eats fish. Fish swells the head, and such behaviour follows'. The
Syrians and Mesopotamians, and men of Jidda and Yenbo laughed
loudly, to shew that they did not share this belief of the upland
Arab, that a man of his hands was disgraced by tasting the three
mean foods&mdash;chickens, eggs and fish. Feisal said, with mock
gravity, 'You insult the company, we Wee fish'. Others protested,
We abandon it, and take refuge in God', and Mirzuk to change the
current said, 'Suleiman is an unnatural birth, neither raw nor
ripe'.</p>

<p>In the morning, early, we marched in a straggle for three hours
down Wadi Hamdh. Then the valley went to the left, and we struck
out across a hollow, desolate, featureless region. To-day was cold:
a hard north wind drove into our faces down the grey coast. As we
marched we heard intermittent heavy firing from the direction of
Wejh, and feared that the Navy had lost patience and were acting
without us. However, we could not make up the days we had wasted,
so we pushed on for the whole dull stage, crossing affluent after
affluent of Hamdh. The plain was striped with these wadies, all
shallow and straight and bare, as many and as intricate as the
veins in a leaf. At last we re-entered Hamdh, at Kurna, and though
its clay bottoms held only mud, decided to camp.</p>

<p>While we were settling in there was a sudden rush. Camels had
been seen pasturing away to the east, and the energetic of the
Juheina streamed out, captured them, and drove them in. Feisal was
furious, and shouted to them to stop, but they were too excited to
hear him. He snatched his rifle, and shot at the nearest man; who,
in fear, tumbled out of his saddle, so that the others checked
their course. Feisal had them up before him, laid about the
principals with his camel-stick, and impounded the stolen camels
and those of the thieves <i>till</i> the whole tally was complete.
Then he handed the beasts back to their Billi owners. Had he not
done so it would have involved the Juheina in a private war with
the Billi, our hoped-for allies of the morrow, and might have
checked extension beyond Wejh. Our success lay in bond to such
trifles.</p>

<p>Next morning we made for the beach, and up it to Habban at four
o'clock. The <i>Hardinge</i> was duly there, to our relief, and
landing water: although the shallow bay gave little shelter, and
the rough sea rolling in made boat-work hazardous. We reserved
first call for the mules, and gave what water was left to the more
thirsty of the footmen; but it was a difficult night, and crowds of
suffering men lingered jostling about the tanks in the rays of the
searchlight, hoping for another drink, if the sailors should
venture in again.</p>

<p>I went on board, and heard that the naval attack had been
carried out as though the land army were present, since Boyle
feared the Turks would run away if he waited. As a matter of fact,
the day we reached Abu Zereibat, Ahmed Tewflk Bey, Turkish
Governor, had addressed the garrison, saying that Wejh must be held
to the last drop of blood. Then at dusk he had got on to his camel
and ridden off to the railway with the few mounted men fit for
flight. The two hundred infantry determined to do his abandoned
duty against the landing party; but they were outnumbered three to
one, and the naval gun-fire was too heavy to let them make proper
use of their positions. So far as the <i>Hardinge</i> knew, the
fighting was not ended, but Wejh town had been occupied by seamen
and Saleh's Arabs.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII</h3>

<p>Profitable rumours excited the army, which began to trickle off
northward soon after midnight. At dawn we rallied the various
contingents in Wadi Miya, twelve miles south of the town, and
advanced on it in order, meeting a few scattered Turks, of whom one
party put up a short resistance. The Ageyl dismounted, to strip off
their cloaks, head-cloths and shirts; and went on in brown
half-nakedness, which they said would ensure clean wounds if they
were hit: also their precious clothes would not be damaged. Ibn
Dakhil in command obtained a quiet regularity of obedience. They
advanced by alternate companies, in open order, at intervals of
four or five yards, with even-numbered companies in support, making
good use of the poor cover which existed.</p>

<p>It was pretty to look at the neat, brown men in the sunlit sandy
valley, with the turquoise pool of salt water in the midst to set
off the crimson banners which two standard bearers carried in the
van. They went along in a steady lope, covering the ground at
nearly six miles an hour, dead silent, and reached and climbed the
ridge without a shot fired. So we knew the work had been finished
for us and trotted forward to find the boy Saleh, son of ibn
Shefia, in possession of the town. He told us that his casualties
had been nearly twenty killed; and later we heard that a British
lieutenant of the Air Service had been mortally wounded in a
seaplane reconnaissance, and one British seaman hurt in the
foot.</p>

<p>Vickery, who had directed the battle, was satisfied, but I could
not share his satisfaction. To me an unnecessary action, or shot,
or casualty, was not only waste but sin. I was unable to take the
professional view that all successful actions were gains. Our
rebels were not materials, like soldiers, but friends of ours,
trusting our leadership. We were not in command nationally, but by
invitation; and our men were volunteers, individuals, local men,
relatives, so that a death was a personal sorrow to many in the
army. Even from the purely military point of view the assault
seemed to me a blunder.</p>

<p>The two hundred Turks in Wejh had no transport and no food, and
if left alone a few days must have surrendered. Had they escaped,
it would not have mattered the value of an Arab life. We wanted
Wejh as a base against the railway and to extend our front; the
smashing and killing in it had been wanton.</p>

<p>The place was inconveniently smashed. Its townspeople had been
warned by Feisal of the coming attack, and advised either to
forestall it by revolt or to clear out; but they were mostly
Egyptians from Kosseir, who preferred the Turks to us, and decided
to wait the issue; so the Shefia men and the Biasha found the
houses packed with fair booty and made a sweep of it. They robbed
the shops, broke open doors, searched every room, smashed chests
and cupboards, tore down all fixed fittings, and slit each mattress
and pillow for hidden treasure; while the fire of the fleet punched
large holes in every prominent wall or building.</p>

<p>Our main difficulty was the landing of stores. The <i>Fox</i>
had sunk the local lighters and rowing boats and there was no sort
of quay; but the resourceful <i>Hardinge</i> thrust herself into
the harbour (which was wide enough but much too short) and landed
our stuff in her own cutters. We raised a tired working party of
ibn Shefia followers, and with their clumsy or languid help got
enough food into the place for the moment's needs. The townspeople
had returned hungry, and furious at the state of what had been
their property; and began their revenge by stealing everything
unguarded, even slitting open the rice-bags on the beach and
carrying away quantities in their held-up skirts. Feisal corrected
this by making the pitiless Maulud Town-governor. He brought in his
rough-riders and in one day of wholesale arrest and summary
punishment persuaded everyone to leave things alone. After that
Wejh had the silence of fear.</p>

<p>Even in the few days which elapsed before I left for Cairo the
profits of our spectacular march began to come in. The Arab
movement had now no opponent in Western Arabia, and had passed
beyond danger of collapse. The vexed Rabegh question died: and we
had learnt the first rules of Beduin warfare. When regarded
backward from our benefits of new knowledge the deaths of those
regretted twenty men in the Wejh streets seemed not so terrible.
Vickery's impatience was justified, perhaps, in cold blood.</p>

So on recovery I did little to the railway, but went back to Wejh
with novel ideas. I tried to make the others admit them, and adopt

Medina. So I decided to slip off to Akaba by myself on test of my
own theory.</blockquote>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>

<p>In Cairo the yet-hot authorities promised gold, rifles, mules,
more machine-guns, and mountain guns; but these last, of course, we
never got. The gun question was an eternal torment. Because of the
hilly, trackless country, field guns were no use to us; and the
British Army had no mountain guns except the Indian ten-pounder,
which was serviceable only against bows and arrows. Bremond had
some excellent Schneider sixty-fives at Suez, with Algerian
gunners, but he regarded them principally as his lever to move
allied troops into Arabia. When we asked him to send them down to
us with or without men, he would reply, first that the Arabs would
not treat the crews properly, and then that they would not treat
the guns properly. His price was a British brigade for Rabegh; and
we would not pay it.</p>

<p>He feared to make the Arab Army formidable&mdash;an argument one
could understand&mdash;but the case of the British Government was
incomprehensible. It was not ill-will, for they gave us all else we
wanted; nor was it niggardliness, for their total help to the
Arabs, in materials and money, exceeded ten millions. I believe it
was sheer stupidity. But it was maddening to be unequal to many
enterprises and to fail in others, for the technical reason that we
could not keep down the Turkish artillery because its guns
outranged ours by three or four thousand yards. In the end,
happily, Bremond over-reached himself, after keeping his batteries
idle for a year at Suez. Major Cousse, his successor, ordered them
down to us, and by their help we entered Damascus. During that idle
year they had been, to each Arab officer who entered Suez, a silent
incontrovertible proof of French malice towards the Arab
movement.</p>

<p>We received a great reinforcement to our cause in Jaafar Pasha,
a Bagdadi officer from the Turkish Army. After distinguished
service in the German and Turkish armies, he had been chosen by
Enver to organize the levies of the Sheikh el Senussi. He went
there by submarine, made a decent force of the wild men, and showed
tactical ability against the British in two battles. Then he was
captured and lodged in the citadel at Cairo with the other officer
prisoners of war. He escaped one night, slipping down a
blanket-rope towards the moat; but the blankets failed under the
strain, and in the fall he hurt his ankle, and was re-taken
helpless. In hospital he gave his parole, and was enlarged after
paying for the torn blanket. But one day he read in an Arabic
newspaper of the Sherif s revolt, and of the execution by the Turks
of prominent Arab Nationalists&mdash;his friends&mdash;and realized
that he had been on the wrong side.</p>

<p>Feisal had heard of him, of course, and wanted him as
commander-in-chief of his regular troops, whose improvement was now
our main effort. We knew that Jaafar was one of the few men with
enough of reputation and personality to weld their difficult and
reciprocally disagreeable elements into an army. King Hussein,
however, would not have it. He was old and narrow, and disliked
Mesopotamians and Syrians: Mecca must deliver Damascus. He refused
the services of Jaafar. Feisal had to accept him on his own
responsibility.</p>

<p>In Cairo were Hogarth and George Lloyd, and Storrs and Deedes,
and many old friends. Beyond them the circle of Arabian
well-wishers was now strangely increased. In the army our shares
rose as we showed profits. Lynden Bell stood firmly our friend and
swore that method was coming out of the Arab madness. Sir Archibald
Murray realized with a sudden shock that more Turkish troops were
fighting the Arabs than were fighting him, and began to remember
how he had always favoured the Arab revolt. Admiral Wemyss was as
ready to help now as he had been in our hard days round Rabegh. Sir
Reginald Wingate, High Commissioner in Egypt, was happy in the
success of the work he had advocated for years. I grudged him this
happiness; for McMahon, who took the actual risk of starting it,
had been broken just before prosperity began. However, that was
hardly Wingate's fault.</p>

<p>In the midst of my touching the slender stops of all these
quills there came a rude surprise. Colonel Bremond called to
felicitate me on the capture of Wejh, saying that it confirmed his
belief in my military talent and encouraged him to expect my help
in an extension of our success. He wanted to occupy Akaba with an
Anglo-French force and naval help. He pointed out the importance of
Akaba, the only Turkish port left in the Red Sea, the nearest to
the Suez Canal, the nearest to the Hejaz Railway, on the left flank
of the Beersheba army; suggesting its occupation by a composite
brigade, which should advance up Wadi Itm for a crushing blow at
Maan. He began to enlarge on the nature of the ground.</p>

<p>I told him that I knew Akaba from before the war, and felt that
his scheme was technically impossible. We could take the beach of
the gulf; but our forces there, as unfavourably placed as on a
Gallipoli beach, would be under observation and gun-fire from the
coastal hills: and these granite hills, thousands of feet high,
were impracticable for heavy troops: the passes through them being
formidable defiles, very costly to assault or to cover. In my
opinion, Akaba, whose importance was all and more than he said,
would be best taken by Arab irregulars descending from the interior
without naval help.</p>

<p>Bremond did not tell me (but I knew) that he wanted the landing
at Akaba to head off the Arab movement, by getting a mixed force in
front of them (as at Rabegh), so that they might be confined to
Arabia, and compelled to waste their efforts against Medina. The
Arabs still feared that the Sherif s alliance with us was based on
a secret agreement to sell them at the end, and such a Christian
invasion would have confirmed these fears and destroyed their
cooperation. For my part, I did not tell Bremond (but he knew) that
I meant to defeat his efforts and to take the Arabs soon into
Damascus. It amused me, this childishly-conceived rivalry of vital
aims, but he ended his talk ominously by saying that, anyhow, he
was going down to put the scheme to Feisal in Wejh.</p>

<p>Now, I had not warned Feisal that Bremond was a politician.
Newcombe was in Wejh, with his friendly desire to get moves on. We
had not talked over the problem of Akaba. Feisal knew neither its
terrain nor its tribes. Keenness and ignorance would lend an ear
favourable to the proposal. It seemed best for me to hurry down
there and put my side on its guard, so I left the same afternoon
for Suez and sailed that night. Two days later, in Wejh, I
explained myself; so that when Bremond came after ten days and
opened his heart, or part of it, to Feisal, his tactics were
returned to him with improvements.</p>

<p>The Frenchman began by presenting six Hotchkiss automatics
complete with instructors. This was a noble gift; but Feisal took
the opportunity to ask him to increase his bounty by a battery of
the quick-firing mountain guns at Suez, explaining that he had been
sorry to leave the Yenbo area for Wejh, since Wejh was so much
further from his objective&mdash;Medina&mdash;but it was really
impossible for him to assault the Turks (who had French artillery)
with rifles or with the old guns supplied him by the British Army.
His men had not the technical excellence to make a bad tool prevail
over a good one. He had to exploit his only
advantages&mdash;numbers and mobility&mdash;and, unless his
equipment could be improved, there was no saying where this
protraction of his front might end!</p>

<p>Bremond tried to turn it off by belittling guns as useless for
Hejaz warfare (quite right, this, practically). But it would end
the war at once if Feisal made his men climb about the country like
goats and tear up the railway. Feisal, angry at the metaphor
(impolite in Arabic), looked at Bremond's six feet of comfortable
body, and asked if he had ever tried to 'goat' himself. Bremond
referred gallantly to the question of Akaba, and the real danger to
the Arabs in the Turks remaining there: insisting that the British,
who had the means for an expedition thither, should be pressed to
undertake it. Feisal, in reply, gave him a geographical sketch of
the land behind Akaba (I recognized the less dashing part of it
myself) and explained the tribal difficulties and the food
problem&mdash;all the points which made it a serious obstacle. He
ended by saying that, after the cloud of orders, counter-orders and
confusion over the allied troops for Rabegh, he really had not the
face to approach Sir Archibald Murray so soon with another request
for an excursion.</p>

<p>Bremond had to retire from the battle in good order, getting in
a Parthian shot at me, where I sat spitefully smiling, by begging
Feisal to insist that the British armoured cars in Suez be sent
down to Wejh. But even this was a boomerang, since they had
started! After he had gone, I returned to Cairo for a cheerful
week, in which I gave my betters much good advice. Murray, who had
growlingly earmarked Tullibardine's brigade for Akaba, approved me
still further when I declared against that side-show too. Then to
Wejh.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX</h3>

<p>Life in Wejh was interesting. We had now set our camp in order.
Feisal pitched his tents (here an opulent group: living tents,
reception tents, staff tents, guest tents, servants') about a mile
from the sea, on the edge of the coral shelf which ran up gently
from the beach till it ended in a steep drop facing east and south
over broad valleys radiating star-like from the land-locked
harbour. The tents of soldiers and tribesmen were grouped in these
sandy valleys, leaving the chill height for ourselves; and very
delightful in the evening we northerners found it when the breeze
from the sea carried us a murmur of the waves, faint and far off,
like the echo of traffic up a by-street in London.</p>

<p>Immediately beneath us were the Ageyl, an irregular close group
of tents. South of these were Rasim's artillery; and by him for
company, Abdulla's machine-gunners, in regular lines, with their
animals picketed out in those formal rows which were incense to the
professional officer and convenient if space were precious. Further
out the market was set plainly on the ground, a boiling swell of
men always about the goods. The scattered tents and shelters of the
tribesmen filled each gully or windless place. Beyond the last of
them lay open country, with camel-parties coming in and out by the
straggling palms of the nearest, too-brackish well. As background
were the foothills, reefs and clusters like ruined castles, thrown
up craggily to the horizon of the coastal range.</p>

<p>As it was the custom in Wejh to camp wide apart, very wide
apart, my life was spent in moving back and forth, to Feisal's
tents, to the English tents, to the Egyptian Army tents, to the
town, the port, the wireless station, tramping all day restlessly
up and down these coral paths in sandals or barefoot, hardening my
feet, getting by slow degrees the power to walk with little pain
over sharp and burning ground, tempering my already trained body
for greater endeavour.</p>

<p>Poor Arabs wondered why I had no mare; and I forbore to puzzle
them by incomprehensible talk of hardening myself, or confess I
would rather walk than ride for sparing of animals: yet the first
was true and the second true. Something hurtful to my pride,
disagreeable, rose at the sight of these lower forms of life. Their
existence struck a servile reflection upon our human kind: the
style in which a God would look on us; and to make use of them, to
lie under an avoidable obligation to them, seemed to me shameful.
It was as with the negroes, tom-tom playing themselves to red
madness each night under the ridge. Their faces, being clearly
different from our own, were tolerable; but it hurt that they
should possess exact counterparts of all our bodies.</p>

<p>Feisal, within, laboured day and night at his politics, in which
so few of us could help. Outside, the crowd employed and diverted
us with parades, joy-shooting, and marches of victory. Also there
were accidents. Once a group, playing behind our tents, set off a
seaplane bomb, dud relic of Boyle's capture of the town. In the
explosion their limbs were scattered about the camp, marking the
canvas with red splashes which soon turned a dull brown and then
faded pale. Feisal had the tents changed and ordered the bloody
ones to be destroyed: the frugal slaves washed them. Another day a
tent took fire, and part-roasted three of our guests. The camp
crowded round and roared with laughter till the fire died down, and
then, rather shamefacedly, we cared for their hurts. The third day,
a mare was wounded by a faffing joy-bullet, and many tents were
pierced.</p>

<p>One night the Ageyl mutinied against their commandant, ibn
Dakhil, for fining them too generally and flogging them too
severely. They rushed his tent, howling and shooting, threw his
things about and beat his servants. That not being enough to blunt
their fury, they began to remember Yenbo, and went off to kill the
Ateiba. Feisal from our bluff saw their torches and ran barefoot
amongst them, laying on with the flat of his sword like four men.
His fury delayed them while the slaves and horsemen, calling for
help, dashed downhill with rushes and shouts and blows of sheathed
swords. One gave him a horse on which he charged down the
ringleaders, while we dispersed groups by firing Very lights into
their clothing. Only two were killed and thirty wounded. Ibn Dakhil
resigned next day.</p>

<p>Murray had given us two armoured-cars, Rolls-Royces, released
from the campaign in East Africa. Gilman and Wade commanded, and
their crews were British, men from the A.S.C. to drive and from the
Machine Gun Corps to shoot. Having them in Wejh made things more
difficult for us, because the food we had been eating and the water
we had been drinking were at once medically condemned; but English
company was a balancing pleasure, and the occupation of pushing
cars and motor-bicycles through the desperate sand about Wejh was
great. The fierce difficulty of driving across country gave the men
arms like boxers, so that they swung their shoulders professionally
as they walked. With time they became skilled, developing a style
and art of sand-driving, which got them carefully over the better
ground and rushed them at speed over soft places. One of these soft
places was the last twenty miles of plain in front of Jebel Raal.
The cars used to cross it in little more than half an hour, leaping
from ridge to ridge of the dunes and swaying dangerously around
their curves. The Arabs loved the new toys. Bicycles they called
devil-horses, the children of cars, which themselves were sons and
daughters of trains. It gave us three generations of mechanical
transport.</p>

<p>The Navy added greatly to our interests in Wejh. The
<i>Espiegle</i> was sent by Boyle as station ship, with the
delightful orders to 'do everything in her power to co-operate in
the many plans which would be suggested to her by Colonel Newcombe,
while letting it be clearly seen that she was conferring a favour'.
Her commander Fitzmaurice (a good name in Turkey), was the soul of
hospitality and found quiet amusement in our work on shore. He
helped us in a thousand ways; above all in signalling; for he was a
wireless expert, and one day at noon the <i>Northbrook</i> came in
and landed an army wireless set, on a light lorry, for us. As there
was no one to explain it, we were at a loss; but Fitzmaurice raced
ashore with half his crew, ran the car to a fitting site, rigged
the masts professionally, started the engine, and connected up to
such effect that before sunset he had called the astonished
<i>Northbrook</i> and held a long conversation with her operator.
The station increased the efficiency of the base at Wejh and was
busy day and night, filling the Red Sea with messages in three
tongues, and twenty different sorts of army cypher-codes.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX</h3>

<p>Fakhri Pasha was still playing our game. He held an entrenched
line around Medina, just far enough out to make it impossible for
the Arabs to shell the city. (Such an attempt was never made or
imagined. ) The other troops were being distributed along the
railway, in strong garrisons at all water stations between Medina
and Tebuk, and in smaller posts between these garrisons, so that
daily patrols might guarantee the track. In short, he had fallen
back on as stupid a defensive as could be conceived. Garland had
gone south-east from Wejh, and Newcombe north-east, to pick holes
in it with high explosives. They would cut rails and bridges, and
place automatic mines for running trains.</p>

<p>The Arabs had passed from doubt to violent optimism, and were
promising exemplary service. Feisal enrolled most of the Billi, and
the Moahib, which made him master of Arabia between the railway and
the sea. He then sent the Juheina to Abdulla in Wadi Ais.</p>

<p>He could now prepare to deal solemnly with the Hejaz Railway;
but with a practice better than my principles, I begged him first
to delay in Wejh and set marching an intense movement among the
tribes beyond us, that in the future our revolt might be extended,
and the railway threatened from Tebuk (our present limit of
influence) northward as far as Maan. My vision of the course of the
Arab war was still purblind. I had not seen that the preaching was
victory and the fighting a delusion. For the moment, I roped them
together, and, as Feisal fortunately liked changing men's minds
rather than breaking railways, the preaching went the better.</p>

<p>With his northern neighbours, the coastal Howeitat, he had
already made a beginning: but we now sent to the Beni Atiyeh, a
stronger people to the north-east; and gained a great step when the
chief, Asi ibn Atiyeh, came in and swore allegiance. His main
motive was jealousy of his brothers, so that we did not expect from
him active help; but the bread and salt with him gave us freedom of
movement across his tribe's territory. Beyond lay various tribes
owning obedience to Nuri Shaalan, the great Emir of the Ruwalla,
who, after the Sherif and ibn Saud and ibn Rashid, was the fourth
figure among the precarious princes of the desert.</p>

<p>Nuri was an old man, who had ruled his Anazeh tribesmen for
thirty years. His was the chief family of the Rualla, but Nuri had
no precedence among them at birth, nor was he loved, nor a great
man of battle. His headship had been acquired by sheer force of
character. To gain it he had killed two of his brothers. Later he
had added Sherarat and others to the number of his followers, and
in all their desert his word was absolute law. He had none of the
wheedling diplomacy of the ordinary sheikh; a word, and there was
an end of opposition, or of his opponent. All feared and obeyed
him; to use his roads we must have his countenance.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this was easy. Feisal had secured it years ago, and
had retained it by interchange of gifts from Medina and Yenbo. Now,
from Wejh, Faiz el Ghusein went up to him and on the way crossed
ibn Dughmi, one of the chief men of the Ruwalla, coming down to us
with the desirable gift of some hundreds of good baggage camels.
Nuri, of course, still kept friendly with the Turks. Damascus and
Bagdad were his markets, and they could have half-starved his tribe
in three months, had they suspected him; but we knew that when the
moment came we should have his armed help, and till then anything
short of a breach with Turkey.</p>

<p>His favour would open to us the Sirhan, a famous roadway,
camping ground, and chain of water-holes, which in a series of
linked depressions extended from Jauf, Nun's capital, in the
south-east, northwards to Azrak, near Jebel Druse, in Syria. It was
the freedom of the Sirhan we needed to reach the tents of the
Eastern Howeitat, those famous abu Tayi, of whom Auda, the greatest
fighting man in northern Arabia, was chief. Only by means of Auda
abu Tayi could we swing the tribes from Maan to Akaba so violently
in our favour that they would help us take Akaba and its hills from
their Turkish garrisons: only with his active support could we
venture to thrust out from Wejh on the long trek to Maan. Since our
Yenbo days we had been longing for him and trying to win him to our
cause.</p>

<p>We made a great step forward at Wejh; ibn Zaal, his cousin and a
war-leader of the abu Tayi, arrived on the seventeenth of February,
which was in all respects a fortunate day. At dawn there came in
five chief men of the Sherarat from the desert east of Tebuk,
bringing a present of eggs of the Arabian ostrich, plentiful in
their little-frequented desert. After them, the slaves showed in
Dhaif-Allah, abu Tiyur, a cousin of Hamd ibn Jazi, paramount of the
central Howeitat of the Maan plateau. These were numerous and
powerful; splendid fighters; but blood enemies of their cousins,
the nomad abu Tayi, because of an old-grounded quarrel between Auda
and Hamd. We were proud to see them coming thus far to greet us,
yet not content, for they were less fit than the abu Tayi for our
purposed attack against Akaba.</p>

<p>On their heels came a cousin of Nawwaf, Nuri Shaalan's eldest
son, with a mare sent by Nawwaf to Feisal. The Shaalan and the
Jazi, being hostile, hardened eyes at one another; so we divided
the parties and improvised a new guest-camp. After the Rualla, was
announced the abu Tageiga chief of the sedentary Howeitat of the
coast. He brought his tribe's respectful homage and the spoils of
Dhaba and Moweilleh, the two last Turkish outlets on the Red Sea.
Room was made for him on Feisal's carpet, and the warmest thanks
rendered him for his tribe's activity; which carried us to the
borders of Akaba, by tracks too rough for operations of force, but
convenient for preaching, and still more so for getting news.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, ibn Zaal arrived, with ten other of Auda's
chief followers. He kissed Feisal's hand once for Auda and then
once for himself, and, sitting back, declared that he came from
Auda to present his salutations and to ask for orders. Feisal, with
policy, controlled his outward joy, and introduced him gravely to
his blood enemies, the Jazi Howeitat. Ibn Zaal acknowledged them
distantly. Later, we held great private conversations with him and
dismissed him with rich gifts, richer promises, and Feisal's own
message to Auda that his mind would not be smooth till he had seen
him face to face in Wejh. Auda was an immense chivalrous name, but
an unknown quantity to us, and in so vital a matter as Akaba we
could not afford a mistake. He must come down that we might weigh
him, and frame our future plans actually in his presence, and with
his help.</p>

<p>Except that all its events were happy, this day was not
essentially unlike Feisal's every day. The rush of news made my
diary fat. The roads to Wejh swarmed with envoys and volunteers and
great sheikhs riding in to swear allegiance. The contagion of their
constant passage made the lukewarm Billi ever more profitable to
us. Feisal swore new adherents solemnly on the Koran between his
hands, 'to wait while he waited, march when he marched, to yield
obedience to no Turk, to deal kindly with all who spoke Arabic
(whether Bagdadi, Aleppine, Syrian, or pure-blooded) and to put
independence above life, family, and goods'.</p>

<p>He also began to confront them at once, in his presence, with
their tribal enemies, and to compose their feuds. An account of
profit and loss would be struck between the parties, with Feisal
modulating and interceding between them, and often paying the
balance, or contributing towards it from his own funds, to hurry on
the pact. During two years Feisal so laboured daily, putting
together and arranging in their natural order the innumerable tiny
pieces which made up Arabian society, and combining them into his
one design of war against the Turks. There was no blood feud left
active in any of the districts through which he had passed, and he
was Court of Appeal, ultimate and unchallenged, for western
Arabia.</p>

<p>He showed himself worthy of this achievement. He never gave a
partial decision, nor a decision so impracticably just that it must
lead to disorder. No Arab ever impugned his judgements, or
questioned his wisdom and competence in tribal business. By
patiently sifting out right and wrong, by his tact, his wonderful
memory, he gained authority over the nomads from Medina to Damascus
and beyond. He was recognized as a force transcending tribe,
superseding blood chiefs, greater than jealousies. The Arab
movement became in the best sense national, since within it all
Arabs were at one, and for it private interests must be set aside;
and in this movement chief place, by right of application and by
right of ability, had been properly earned by the man who filled it
for those few weeks of triumph and longer months of disillusion
after Damascus had been set free.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI</h3>

<p>Urgent messages from Clayton broke across this cheerful work
with orders to wait in Wejh for two days and meet the <i>Nur El
Bahr</i>, an Egyptian patrol ship, coming down with news. I was not
well and waited with more excellent grace. She arrived on the
proper day, and disembarked MacRury, who gave me a copy of long
telegraphic instructions from Jemal Pasha to Fakhri in Medina.
These, emanating from Enver and the German staff in Constantinople,
ordered the instant abandonment of Medina, and evacuation of the
troops by route march in mass, first to Hedia, thence to El Ula,
thence to Tebuk, and finally to Maan, where a fresh rail-head and
entrenched position would be constituted.</p>

<p>This move would have suited the Arabs excellently; but our army
of Egypt was perturbed at the prospect of twenty-five thousand
Anatolian troops, with far more than the usual artillery of a
corps, descending suddenly on the Beersheba front. Clayton, in his
letter, told me the development was to be treated with the utmost
concern, and every effort made to capture Medina, or to destroy the
garrison when they came out. Newcombe was on the line, doing a
vigorous demolition-series, so that the moment's responsibility
fell on me. I feared that little could be done in time, for the
message was days old, and the evacuation timed to begin at
once.</p>

<p>We told Feisal the frank position, and that Allied interests in
this case demanded the sacrifice, or at least the postponement of
immediate advantage to the Arabs. He rose, as ever, to a
proposition of honour, and agreed instantly to do his best. We
worked out our possible resources and arranged to move them into
contact with the railway. Sherif Mastur, an honest, quiet old man,
and Rasim, with tribesmen, mule-mounted infantry, and a gun, were
to proceed directly to Fagair, the first good water-base north of
Wadi Ais, to hold up our first section of railway, from Abdulla's
area northward.</p>

<p>Ali ibn el Hussein, from Jeida, would attack the next section of
line northward from Mastur. We told ibn Mahanna to get close to El
Ula, and watch it. We ordered Sherif Nasir to stay near Kalaat el
Muadhdham, and keep his men in hand for an effort. I wrote asking
Newcombe to come in for news. Old Mohammed Ali was to move from
Dhaba to an oasis near Tebuk, so that if the evacuation got so far
we should be ready. All our hundred and fifty miles of line would
thus be beset, while Feisal himself, at Wejh, stood ready to bring
help to whatever sector most needed him.</p>

<p>My part was to go off to Abdulla in Wadi Ais, to find out why he
had done nothing for two months, and to persuade him, if the Turks
came out, to go straight at them. I hoped we might deter them from
moving by making so many small raids on this lengthy line that
traffic would be seriously disorganized, and the collection of the
necessary food-dumps for the army at each main stage be
impracticable. The Medina force, being short of animal transport,
could carry little with them. Enver had instructed them to put guns
and stores on trains; and to enclose these trains in their columns
and march together up the railway. It was an unprecedented
manoeuvre, and if we gained ten days to get in place, and they then
attempted anything so silly, we should have a chance of destroying
them all.</p>

<p>Next day I left Wejh, ill and unfit for a long march, while
Feisal in his haste and many preoccupations had chosen me a
travelling party of queer fellows. There were four Rifaa and one
Merawi Ju-heina as guides, and Arslan, a Syrian soldier-servant,
who prepared bread and rice for me and acted besides as butt to the
Arabs; four Ageyl, a Moor, and an Ateibi, Suleiman. The camels,
thin with the bad grazing of this dry Billi territory, would have
to go slowly.</p>

<p>Delay after delay took place in our starting, until nine at
night, and then we moved unwillingly: but I was determined to get
clear of Wejh somehow before morning. So we went four hours and
slept. Next day we did two stages of five hours each, and camped at
Abu Zereibat, in our old ground of the winter. The great pool had
shrunk little in the two months, but was noticeably more salt. A
few weeks later it was unfit to drink. A shallow well near by was
said to afford tolerable water. I did not look for it, since boils
on my back and heavy fever made painful the jolting of the camel,
and I was tired.</p>

<p>Long before dawn we rode away, and having crossed Hamdh got
confused in the broken surfaces of Agunna, an area of low hills.
When day broke we recovered direction and went over a watershed
steeply down into El Khubt, a hill-locked plain extending to the
Sukhur, the granite bubbles of hills which had been prominent on
our road up from Um Lejj. The ground was luxuriant with colocynth,
whose runners and fruits looked festive in the early light. The
Ju-heina said both leaves and stalks were excellent food for such
horses as would eat them, and defended from thirst for many hours.
The Ageyl said that the best aperient was to drink camel-milk from
cups of the scooped-out rind. The Ateibi said that he was
sufficiently moved if he just rubbed the juice of the fruit on the
soles of his feet. The Moor Hamed said that the dried pith made
good tinder. On one point however they were all agreed, that the
whole plant was useless or poisonous as fodder for camels.</p>

<p>This talk carried us across the Khubt, a pleasant three miles,
and through a low ridge into a second smaller section. We now saw
that, of the Sukhur, two stood together to the north-east, great
grey striated piles of volcanic rock, reddish coloured where
protected from the burning of the sun and the bruising of sandy
winds. The third Sakhara, which stood a little apart, was the
bubble rock which had roused my curiosity. Seen from near by, it
more resembled a huge football half-buried in the ground. It, too,
was brown in colour. The south and east faces were quite smooth and
unbroken, and its regular, domed head was polished and shining and
had fine cracks running up and over it like stitched seams:
altogether one of the strangest hills in Hejaz, a country of
strange hills. We rode gently towards it, through a thin shower of
rain which came slanting strangely and beautifully across the
sunlight.</p>

<p>Our path took up between the Sakhara and the Sukhur by a narrow
gorge with sandy floor and steep bare walls. Its head was rough. We
had to scramble up shelves of coarse-faced stone, and along a great
fault in the hill-side between two tilted red reefs of hard rock.
The summit of the pass was a knife-edge, and from it we went down
an encumbered gap, half-blocked by one fallen boulder which had
been hammered over with the tribal marks of all the generations of
men who had used this road. Afterwards there opened tree-grown
spaces, collecting grounds in winter for the sheets of rain which
poured off the glazed sides of the Sukhur. There were granite
outcrops here and there, and a fine silver sand underfoot in the
still damp water-channels. The drainage was towards Heiran.</p>

<p>We then entered a wild confusion of granite shards, piled up
haphazard into low mounds, in and out of which we wandered any way
we could find practicable going for our hesitating camels. Soon
after noon this gave place to a broad wooded valley, up which we
rode for an hour, till our troubles began again; for we had to
dismount and lead our animals up a narrow hill-path with broken
steps of rock so polished by long years of passing feet that they
were dangerous in wet weather. They took us over a great shoulder
of the hills and down among more small mounds and valleys, and
afterwards by another rocky zigzag descent into a torrent-bed. This
soon became too confined to admit the passage of laden camels, and
the path left it to cling precariously to the hill-side with a
cliff above and cliff below. After fifteen minutes of this we were
glad to reach a high saddle on which former travellers had piled
little cairns of commemoration and thankfulness. Of such a nature
had been the road-side cairns of Masturah, on my first Arabian
journey, from Rabegh to Feisal.</p>

<p>We stopped to add one to the number, and then rode down a sandy
valley into Wadi Hanbag, a large, well-wooded tributary of Hamdh.
After the broken country in which we had been prisoned for hours,
the openness of Hanbag was refreshing. Its clean white bed swept on
northward through the trees in a fine curve under precipitous hills
of red and brown, with views for a mile or two up and down its
course. There were green weeds and grass growing on the lower
sand-slopes of the tributary, and we stopped there for half an hour
to let our starved camels eat the juicy, healthy stuff.</p>

<p>They had not so enjoyed themselves since Bir el Waheidi, and
tore at it ravenously, stowing it away unchewed inside them,
pending a fit time for leisurely digestion. We then crossed the
valley to a great branch opposite our entry. This Wadi Eitan was
also beautiful. Its shingle face, without loose rocks, was
plentifully grown over with trees. On the right were low hills, on
the left great heights called the Jidhwa, in parallel ridges of
steep broken granite, very red now that the sun was setting amid
massed cloud-banks of boding rain.</p>

<p>At last we camped, and when the camels were unloaded and driven
out to pasture, I lay down under the rocks and rested. My body was
very sore with headache and high fever, the accompaniments of a
sharp attack of dysentery which had troubled me along the march and
had laid me out twice that day in short fainting fits, when the
more difficult parts of the climb had asked too much of my
strength. Dysentery of this Arabian coast sort used to fall like a
hammer blow, and crush its victims for a few hours, after which the
extreme effects passed off; but it left men curiously tired, and
subject for some weeks to sudden breaks of nerve.</p>

<p>My followers had been quarrelling all day; and while I was lying
near the rocks a shot was fired. I paid no attention; for there
were hares and birds in the valley; but a little later Suleiman
roused me and made me follow him across the valley to an opposite
bay in the rocks, where one of the Ageyl, a Boreida man, was lying
stone dead with a bullet through his temples. The shot must have
been fired from close by; because the skin was burnt about one
wound. The remaining Ageyl were running frantically about; and when
I asked what it was Ali, their head man, said that Hamed the Moor
had done the murder. I suspected Suleiman, because of the feud
between the Atban and Ageyl which had burned up in Yenbo and Wejh;
but Ali assured me that Suleiman had been with him three hundred
yards further up the valley gathering sticks when the shot was
fired. I sent all out to search for Hamed, and crawled back to the
baggage, feeling that it need not have happened this day of all
days when I was in pain.</p>

<p>As I lay there I heard a rustle, and opened my eyes slowly upon
Hamed's back as he stooped over his saddle-bags, which lay just
beyond my rock. I covered him with a pistol and then spoke. He had
put down his rifle to lift the gear; and was at my mercy till the
others came. We held a court at once; and after a while Hamed
confessed that, he and Salem having had words, he had seen red and
shot him suddenly. Our inquiry ended. The Ageyl, as relatives of
the dead man, demanded blood for blood. The others supported them;
and I tried vainly to talk the gentle Ali round. My head was aching
with fever and I could not think; but hardly even in health, with
all eloquence, could I have begged Hamed off; for Salem had been a
friendly fellow and his sudden murder a wanton crime.</p>

<p>Then rose up the horror which would make civilized man shun
justice like a plague if he had not the needy to serve him as
hangmen for wages. There were other Moroccans in our army; and to
let the Ageyl kill one in feud meant reprisals by which our unity
would have been endangered. It must be a formal execution, and at
last, desperately, I told Hamed that he must die for punishment,
and laid the burden of his killing on myself. Perhaps they would
count me not qualified for feud. At least no revenge could lie
against my followers; for I was a stranger and kinless.</p>

<p>I made him enter a narrow gully of the spur, a dank twilight
place overgrown with weeds. Its sandy bed had been pitted by
trickles of water down the cliffs in the late rain. At the end it
shrank to a crack a few inches wide. The walls were vertical. I
stood in the entrance and gave him a few moments' delay which he
spent crying on the ground. Then I made him rise and shot him
through the chest. He fell down on the weeds shrieking, with the
blood coming out in spurts over his clothes, and jerked about till
he rolled nearly to where I was. I fired again, but was shaking so
that I only broke his wrist. He went on calling out, less loudly,
now lying on his back with his feet towards me, and I leant forward
and shot him for the last time in the thick of his neck under the
jaw. His body shivered a little, and I called the Ageyl, who buried
him in the gully where he was. Afterwards the wakeful night dragged
over me, till, hours before dawn, I had the men up and made them
load, in my longing to be set free of Wadi Kitan. They had to lift
me into the saddle.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII</h3>

<p>Dawn found us crossing a steep short pass out of Wadi Kitan into
the main drainage valley of these succeeding hills. We turned aside
into Wadi Reimi, a tributary, to get water. There was no proper
well, only a seepage hole in the stony bed of the valley; and we
found it partly by our noses: though the taste, while as foul, was
curiously unlike the smell. We refilled our water-skins. Arslan
baked bread, and we rested for two hours. Then we went on through
Wadi Amk, an easy green valley which made comfortable marching for
the camels.</p>

<p>When the Amk turned westward we crossed it, going up between
piles of the warped grey granite (like cold toffee) which was
common up-country in the Hejaz. The defile culminated at the foot
of a natural ramp and staircase: badly broken, twisting, and
difficult for camels, but short. Afterwards we were in an open
valley for an hour, with low hills to the right and mountains to
the left. There were water pools in the crags, and Merawin tents
under the fine trees which studded the flat. The fertility of the
slopes was great: on them grazed flocks of sheep and goats. We got
milk from the Arabs: the first milk my Ageyl had been given in the
two years of drought.</p>

<p>The track out of the valley when we reached its head was
execrable, and the descent beyond into Wadi Marrakh almost
dangerous; but the view from the crest compensated us. Wadi
Marrakh, a broad, peaceful avenue, ran between two regular straight
walls of hills to a circus four miles off where valleys from left,
right and front seemed to meet. Artificial heaps of uncut stone
were piled about the approach. As we entered it, we saw that the
grey hill-walls swept back on each side in a half-circle. Before
us, to the south, the curve was barred across by a straight wall or
step of blue-black lava, standing over a little grove of thorn
trees. We made for these and lay down in their thin shade, grateful
in such sultry air for any pretence of coolness.</p>

<p>The day, now at its zenith, was very hot; and my weakness had so
increased that my head hardly held up against it. The puffs of
feverish wind pressed like scorching hands against our faces,
burning our eyes. My pain made me breathe in gasps through the
mouth; the wind cracked my lips and seared my throat till I was too
dry to talk, and drinking became sore; yet I always needed to
drink, as my thirst would not let me lie still and get the peace I
longed for. The flies were a plague.</p>

<p>The bed of the valley was of fine quartz gravel and white sand.
Its glitter thrust itself between our eyelids; and the level of the
ground seemed to dance as the wind moved the white tips of stubble
grass to and fro. The camels loved this grass, which grew in tufts,
about sixteen inches high, on slate-green stalks. They gulped down
great quantities of it until the men drove them in and couched them
by me. At the moment I hated the beasts, for too much food made
their breath stink; and they rumblingly belched up a new mouthful
from their stomachs each time they had chewed and swallowed the
last, till a green slaver flooded out between their loose lips over
the side teeth, and dripped down their sagging chins.</p>

<p>Lying angrily there, I threw a stone at the nearest, which got
up and wavered about behind my head: finally it straddled its back
legs and staled in wide, bitter jets; and I was so far gone with
the heat and weakness and pain that I just lay there and cried
about it unhelping. The men had gone to make a fire and cook a
gazelle one of them had fortunately shot; and I realized that on
another day this halt would have been pleasant to me; for the hills
were very strange and their colours vivid. The base had the warm
grey of old stored sunlight; while about their crests ran narrow
veins of granite-coloured stone, generally in pairs, following the
contour of the skyline like the rusted metals of an abandoned
scenic railway. Arslan said the hills were combed like cocks, a
sharper observation.</p>

<p>After the men had fed we re-mounted, and easily climbed the
first wave of the lava flood. It was short, as was the second, on
the top of which lay a broad terrace with an alluvial plot of sand
and gravel in its midst. The lava was a nearly clean floor of
iron-red rock-cinders, over which were scattered fields of loose
stone. The third and other steps ascended to the south of us: but
we turned east, up Wadi Gara.</p>

<p>Gara had, perhaps, been a granite valley down whose middle the
lava had flowed, slowly filling it, and arching itself up in a
central heap. On each side were deep troughs, between the lava and
the hill-side. Rain water flooded these as often as storms burst in
the hills. The lava flow, as it coagulated, had been twisted like a
rope, cracked, and bent back irregularly upon itself. The surface
was loose with fragments through which many generations of camel
parties had worn an inadequate and painful track.</p>

<p>We struggled along for hours, going slowly, our camels wincing
at every stride as the sharp edges slipped beneath their tender
feet. The paths were only to be seen by the droppings along them,
and by the slightly bluer surfaces of the rubbed stones. The Arabs
declared them impassable after dark, which was to be believed, for
we risked laming our beasts each time our impatience made us urge
them on. Just before five in the afternoon, however, the way got
easier. We seemed to be near the head of the valley, which grew
narrow. Before us on the right, an exact cone-crater, with tidy
furrows scoring it from lip to foot, promised good going; for it
was made of black ash, clean as though sifted, with here and there
a bank of harder soil, and cinders. Beyond it was another
lava-field, older perhaps than the valleys, for its stones were
smoothed, and between them were straths of flat earth, rank with
weeds. In among these open spaces were Beduin tents, whose owners
ran to us when they saw us coming; and, taking our head-stalls with
hospitable force, led us in.</p>

<p>They proved to be Sheikh Fahad el Hansha and his men: old and
garrulous warriors who had marched with us to Wejh, and had been
with Garland on that great occasion when his first automatic mine
had succeeded under a troop train near Toweira station. Fahad would
not hear of my resting quietly outside his tent, but with the
reckless equality of the desert men urged me into an unfortunate
place inside among his own vermin. There he plied me with bowl
after bowl of diuretic camel-milk between questions about Europe,
my home tribe, the English camel-pasturages, the war in the Hejaz
and the wars elsewhere, Egypt and Damascus, how Feisal was, why did
we seek Abdulla, and by what perversity did I remain Christian,
when their hearts and hands waited to welcome me to the Faith?</p>

<p>So passed long hours till ten at night, when the guest-sheep was
carried in, dismembered royally over a huge pile of buttered rice.
I ate as manners demanded, twisted myself up in my cloak, and
slept; my bodily exhaustion, after those hours of the worst
imaginable marching, proofing me against the onslaught of lice and
fleas. The illness, however, had stimulated my ordinarily sluggish
fancy, which ran riot this night in dreams of wandering naked for a
dark eternity over interminable lava (like scrambled egg gone
iron-blue, and very wrong), sharp as insect-bites underfoot; and
with some horror, perhaps a dead Moor, always climbing after
us.</p>

<p>In the morning we woke early and refreshed, with our clothes
stinging-full of fiery points feeding on us. After one more bowl of
milk proffered us by the eager Fahad, I was able to walk unaided to
my camel and mount her actively. We rode up the last piece of Wadi
Gara to the crest, among cones of black cinders from a crater to
the south. Thence we turned to a branch valley, ending in a steep
and rocky chimney, up which we pulled our camels.</p>

<p>Beyond we had an easy descent into Wadi Murrmiya, whose middle
bristled with lava like galvanized iron, on each side of which
there were smooth sandy beds, good going. After a while we came to
a fault in the flow, which served as a track to the other side. By
it we crossed over, finding the lava pocketed with soils apparently
of extreme richness, for in them were leafy trees and lawns of real
grass, starred with flowers, the best grazing of all our ride,
looking the more wonderfully green because of the blue-black
twisted crusts of rock about. The lava had changed its character.
Here were no piles of loose stones, as big as a skull or a man's
hand, rubbed and rounded together; but bunched and crystallized
fronds of metallic rock, altogether impassable for bare feet.</p>

<p>Another watershed conducted us to an open place where the
Jeheina had ploughed some eight acres of the thin soil below a
thicket of scrub. They said there were like it in the neighbourhood
other fields, silent witnesses to the courage and persistence of
the Arabs.</p>

<p>It was called Wadi Chetl, and after it was another broken river
of lava, the worst yet encountered. A shadowy path zigzagged across
it. We lost one camel with a broken fore-leg, the result of a
stumble in a pot-hole; and the many bones which lay about showed
that we were not the only party to suffer misfortune in the
passage. However, this ended our lava, according to the guides, and
we went thence forward along easy valleys with finally a long run
up a gentle slope till dusk. The going was so good and the cool of
the day so freshened me that we did not halt at nightfall, after
our habit, but pushed on for an hour across the basin of Murrmiya
into the basin of Wadi Ais, and there, by Tleih, we stopped for our
last camp in the open.</p>

<p>I rejoiced that we were so nearly in, for fever was heavy on me.
I was afraid that perhaps I was going to be really ill, and the
prospect of falling into the well-meaning hands of tribesmen in
such a state was not pleasant. Their treatment of every sickness
was to burn holes in the patient's body at some spot believed to be
the complement of the part affected. It was a cure tolerable to
such as had faith in it, but torture to the unbelieving: to incur
it unwillingly would be silly, and yet certain; for the Arabs' good
intentions, selfish as their good digestions, would never heed a
sick man's protesting.</p>

<p>The morning was easy, over open valleys and gentle rides into
Wadi Ais. We arrived at Abu Markha, its nearest watering-place,
just a few minutes after Sherif Abdulla had dismounted there, and
while he was ordering his tents to be pitched in an acacia glade
beyond the well. He was leaving his old camp at Bir el Amri, lower
down the valley, as he had left Murabba, his camp before, because
the ground had been fouled by the careless multitude of his men and
animals. I gave him the documents from Feisal, explaining the
situation in Medina, and the need we had of haste to block the
railway. I thought he took it coolly; but, without argument, went
on to say that I was a little tired after my journey, and with his
permission would lie down and sleep a while. He pitched me a tent
next his great marquee, and I went into it and rested myself at
last. It had been a struggle against faintness day-long in the
saddle to get here at all: and now the strain was ended with the
delivery of my message, I felt that another hour would have brought
the breaking point.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII</h3>

<p>About ten days I lay in that tent, suffering a bodily weakness
which made my animal self crawl away and hide till the shame was
passed. As usual in such circumstances my mind cleared, my senses
became more acute, and I began at last to think consecutively of
the Arab Revolt, as an accustomed duty to rest upon against the
pain. It should have been thought out long before, but at my first
landing in Hejaz there had been a crying need for action, and we
had done what seemed to instinct best, not probing into the why,
nor formulating what we really wanted at the end of all. Instinct
thus abused without a basis of past knowledge and reflection had
grown intuitive, feminine, and was now bleaching my confidence; so
in this forced inaction I looked for the equation between my
book-reading and my movements, and spent the intervals of uneasy
sleeps and dreams in plucking at the tangle of our present.</p>

<p>As I have shown, I was unfortunately as much in command of the
campaign as I pleased, and was untrained. In military theory I was
tolerably read, my Oxford curiosity having taken me past Napoleon
to Clausewitz and his school, to Caemmerer and Moltke, and the
recent Frenchmen. They had all seemed to be one-sided; and after
looking at Jomini and Willisen, I had found broader principles in
Saxe and Guibert and the eighteenth century. However, Clausewitz
was intellectually so much the master of them, and his book so
logical and fascinating, that unconsciously I accepted his
finality, until a comparison of Kuhne and Foch disgusted me with
soldiers, wearied me of their officious glory, making me critical
of all their light. In any case, my interest had been abstract,
concerned with the theory and philosophy of warfare especially from
the metaphysical side.</p>

<p>Now, in the field everything had been concrete, particularly the
tiresome problem of Medina; and to distract myself from that I
began to recall suitable maxims on the conduct of modern,
scientific war. But they would not fit, and it worried me.
Hitherto, Medina had been an obsession for us all; but now that I
was ill, its image was not clear, whether it was that we were near
to it (one seldom liked the attainable), or whether it was that my
eyes were misty with too constant staring at the butt. One
afternoon I woke from a hot sleep, running with sweat and pricking
with flies, and wondered what on earth was the good of Medina to
us? Its harmfulness had been patent when we were at Yenbo and the
Turks in it were going to Mecca: but we had changed all that by our
march to Wejh. To-day we were blockading the railway, and they only
defending it. The garrison of Medina, reduced to an inoffensive
size, were sitting in trenches destroying their own power of
movement by eating the transport they could no longer feed. We had
taken away their power to harm us, and yet wanted to take away
their town. It was not a base for us like Wejh, nor a threat like
Wadi Ais. What on earth did we want it for?</p>

<p>The camp was bestirring itself after the torpor of the midday
hours; and noises from the world outside began to filter in to me
past the yellow lining of the tent-canvas, whose every hole and
tear was stabbed through by a long dagger of sunlight. I heard the
stamping and snorting of the horses plagued with flies where they
stood in the shadow of the trees, the complaint of camels, the
ringing of coffee mortars, distant shots. To their burden I began
to drum out the aim in war. The books gave it pat&mdash;the
destruction of the armed forces of the enemy by the one
process-battle. Victory could he purchased only by blood. This was
a hard saying for us. As the Arabs had no organized forces, a
Turkish Foch would have no aim? The Arabs would not endure
casualties. How would our Clausewitz buy his victory? Von der Goltz
had seemed to go deeper, saying it was necessary not to annihilate
the enemy, but to break his courage. Only we showed no prospect of
ever breaking anybody's courage.</p>

<p>However, Goltz was a humbug, and these wise men must be talking
metaphors; for we were indubitably winning our war; and as I
pondered slowly, it dawned on me that we had won the Hejaz war. Out
of every thousand square miles of Hejaz nine hundred and
ninety-nine were now free. Did my provoked jape at Vickery, that
rebellion was more like peace than like war, hold as much truth as
haste? Perhaps in war the absolute did rule, but for peace a
majority was good enough. If we held the rest, the Turks were
welcome to the tiny fraction on which they stood, till peace or
Doomsday showed them the futility of clinging to our
window-pane.</p>

<p>I brushed off the same flies once more from my face patiently,
content to know that the Hejaz War was won and finished with: won
from the day we took Wejh, if we had had wit to see it. Then I
broke the thread of my argument again to listen. The distant shots
had grown and tied themselves into long, ragged volleys. They
ceased. I strained my ears for the other sounds which I knew would
follow. Sure enough across the silence came a rustle like the
dragging of a skirt over the flints, around the thin walls of my
tent. A pause, while the camel-riders drew up: and then the soggy
tapping of canes on the thick of the beasts' necks to make them
kneel.</p>

<p>They knelt without noise: and I timed it in my memory: first the
hesitation, as the camels, looking down, felt the soil with one
foot for a soft place; then the muffled thud and the sudden
loosening of breath as they dropped on their fore-legs, since this
party had come far and were tired; then the shuffle as the hind
legs were folded in, and the rocking as they tossed from side to
side thrusting outward with their knees to bury them in the cooler
subsoil below the burning flints, while the riders, with a quick
soft patter of bare feet, like birds over the ground, were led off
tacitly either to the coffee hearth or to Abdulla's tent, according
to their business. The camels would rest there, uneasily switching
their tails across the shingle till their masters were free and
looked to their stabling.</p>

<p>I had made a comfortable beginning of doctrine, but was left
still to find an alternative end and means of war. Ours seemed
unlike the ritual of which Foch was priest; and I recalled him, to
see a difference in land between <i>him</i> and us. In his modern
war&mdash;absolute war he called it&mdash;two nations professing
incompatible philosophies put them to the test of force.
Philosophically, it was idiotic, for while opinions were arguable,
convictons needed shooting to be cured; and the struggle could end
only when the supporters of the one immaterial principle had no
more means of resistance against the supporters of the other. It
sounded like a twentieth-century restatement of the wars of
religion, whose logical end was utter destruction of one creed, and
whose protagonists believed that God's judgement would prevail.
This might do for France and Germany, but would not represent the
British attitude. Our Army was not intelligently maintaining a
philosophic conception in Flanders or on the Canal. Efforts to make
our men hate the enemy usually made them hate the fighting. Indeed
Foch had knocked out his own argument by saying that such war
depended on levy in mass, and was impossible with professional
armies; while the old army was still the British ideal, and its
manner the ambition of our ranks and our files. To me the Foch war
seemed only an exterminative variety, no more absolute than
another. One could as explicably call it 'murder war'. Clausewitz
enumerated all sorts of war...personal wars, joint-proxy duels, for
dynastic reasons...expulsive wars, in party politics...commercial
wars, for trade objects...two wars seemed seldom alike. Often the
parties did not know their aim, and blundered till the march of
events took control. Victory in general habit leaned to the
clear-sighted, though fortune and superior intelligence could make
a sad muddle of nature's 'inexorable' law.</p>

<p>I wondered why Feisal wanted to fight the Turks, and why the
Arabs helped him, and saw that their aim was geographical, to
extrude the Turk from all Arabic-speaking lands in Asia. Their
peace ideal of liberty could exercise itself only so. In pursuit of
the ideal conditions we might kill Turks, because we disliked them
very much; but the killing was a pure luxury. If they would go
quietly the war would end. If not, we would urge them, or try to
drive them out. In the last resort, we should be compelled to the
desperate course of blood and the maxims of 'murder war', but as
cheaply as could be for ourselves, since the Arabs fought for
freedom, and that was a pleasure to be tasted only by a man alive.
Posterity was a chilly thing to work for, no matter how much a man
happened to love his own, or other people's already-produced
children.</p>

<p>At this point a slave slapped my tent-door, and asked if the
Emir might call. So I struggled into more clothes, and crawled over
to his great tent to sound the depth of motive in him. It was a
comfortable place, luxuriously shaded and carpeted deep in strident
rugs, the aniline-dyed spoils of Hussein Mabeirig's house in
Rabegh. Abdulla passed most of his day in it, laughing with his
friends, and playing games with Mohammed Hassan, the court jester.
I set the ball of conversation rolling between him and Shakir and
the chance sheikhs, among whom was the fire-hearted Ferhan el Aida,
the son of Doughty's Motlog; and I was rewarded, for Abdulla's
words were definite. He contrasted his hearers' present
independence with their past servitude to Turkey, and roundly said
that talk of Turkish heresy, or the immoral doctrine of
<i>yeni-turan</i>, or the illegitimate Caliphate was beside the
point. It was Arab country, and the Turks were in it: that was the
one issue. My argument preened itself.</p>

<p>The next day a great complication of boils developed out, to
conceal my lessened fever, and to chain me down yet longer in
impotence upon my face in this stinking tent. When it grew too hot
for dreamless dozing, I picked up my tangle again, and went on
ravelling it out, considering now the whole house of war in its
structural aspect, which was strategy, in its arrangements, which
were tactics, and in the sentiment of its inhabitants, which was
psychology; for my personal duty was command, and the commander,
like the master architect, was responsible for all.</p>

<p>The first confusion was the false antithesis between strategy,
the aim in war, the synoptic regard seeing each part relative to
the whole, and tactics, the means towards a strategic end, the
particular steps of its staircase. They seemed only points of view
from which to ponder the elements of war, the Algebraical element
of things, a Biological element of lives, and the Psychological
element of ideas.</p>

<p>The algebraical element looked to me a pure science, subject to
mathematical law, inhuman. It dealt with known variables, fixed
conditions, space and time, inorganic things like hills and
climates and railways, with mankind in type-masses too great for
individual variety, with all artificial aids and the extensions
given our faculties by mechanical invention. It was essentially
formulable.</p>

<p>Here was a pompous, professorial beginning. My wits, hostile to
the abstract, took refuge in Arabia again. Translated into Arabic,
the algebraic factor would first take practical account of the area
we wished to deliver, and I began idly to calculate how many square
miles: sixty: eighty: one hundred: perhaps one hundred and forty
thousand square miles. And how would the Turks defend all that? No
doubt by a trench line across the bottom, if we came like an army
with banners; but suppose we were (as we might be) an influence, an
idea, a thing intangible, invulnerable, without front or back,
drifting about like a gas? Armies were like plants, immobile,
firm-rooted, nourished through long stems to the head. We might be
a vapour, blowing where we listed. Our kingdoms lay in each man's
mind; and as we wanted nothing material to live on, so we might
offer nothing material to the killing. It seemed a regular soldier
might be helpless without a target, owning only what he sat on, and
subjugating only what, by order, he could poke his rifle at.</p>

<p>Then I figured out how many men they would need to sit on all
this ground, to save it from our attack-in-depth, sedition putting
up her head in every unoccupied one of those hundred thousand
square miles. I knew the Turkish Army exactly, and even allowing
for their recent extension of faculty by aeroplanes and guns and
armoured trains (which made the earth a smaller battlefield) still
it seemed they would have need of a fortified post every four
square miles, and a post could not be less than twenty men. If so,
they would need six hundred thousand men to meet the ill-wills of
all the Arab peoples, combined with the active hostility of a few
zealots.</p>

<p>How many zealots could we have? At present we had nearly fifty
thousand: sufficient for the day. It seemed the assets in this
element of war were ours. If we realized our raw materials and were
apt with them, then climate, railway, desert, and technical weapons
could also be attached to our interests. The Turks were stupid; the
Germans behind them dogmatical. They would believe that rebellion
was absolute like war, and deal with it on the analogy of war.
Analogy in human things was fudge, anyhow; and war upon rebellion
was messy and slow, like eating soup with a knife.</p>

<p>This was enough of the concrete; so I sheered off [GREEK-see
'Greek image 2' below], the mathematical element, and plunged into
the nature of the biological factor in command. Its crisis seemed
to be the breaking point, life and death, or less finally, wear and
tear. The war-philosophers had properly made an art of it, and had
elevated one item, 'effusion of blood', to the height of an
essential, which became humanity in battle, an act touching every
side of our corporal being, and very warm. A line of variability,
Man, persisted like leaven through its estimates, making them
irregular. The components were sensitive and illogical, and
generals guarded themselves by the device of a reserve, the
significant medium of their art. Goltz had said that if you knew
the enemy's strength, and he was fully deployed, then you could
dispense with a reserve: but this was never. The possibility of
accident, of some flaw in materials was always in the general's
mind, and the reserve unconsciously held to meet it.</p>

<p>The 'felt' element in troops, not expressible in figures, had to
be guessed at by the equivalent of Plato's [GREEK-see 'Greek image
3' below], and the greatest commander of men was he whose
intuitions most nearly happened. Nine-tenths of tactics were
certain enough to be teachable in schools; but the irrational tenth
was like the kingfisher flashing across the pool, and in it lay the
test of generals. It could be ensued only by instinct (sharpened by
thought practising the stroke) until at the crisis it came
naturally, a reflex. There had been men whose [GREEK-see 'Greek
image 3' below] so nearly approached perfection that by its road
they reached the certainty of [GREEK-see 'Greek image 2' above].
The Greeks might have called such genius for command [GREEK-see
'Greek image 4' below]; had they bothered to rationalize
revolt.</p>

<p>My mind seesawed back to apply this to ourselves, and at once
knew that it was not bounded by mankind, that it applied also to
materials. In Turkey things were scarce and precious, men less
esteemed than equipment. Our cue was to destroy, not the Turk's
army, but his minerals. The death of a Turkish bridge or rail,
machine or gun or charge of high explosive, was more profitable to
us than the death of a Turk. In the Arab Army at the moment we were
chary both of materials and of men. Governments saw men only in
mass; but our men, being irregulars, were not formations, but
individuals. An individual death, like a pebble dropped in water,
might make but a brief hole; yet rings of sorrow widened out
therefrom. We could not afford casualties.</p>

<p>Materials were easier to replace. It was our obvious policy to
be superior in some one tangible branch; gun-cotton or machine-guns
or whatever could be made decisive. Orthodoxy had laid down the
maxim, applied to men, of being superior at the critical point and
moment of attack. We might be superior in equipment in one dominant
moment or respect; and for both things and men we might give the
doctrine a twisted negative side, for cheapness' sake, and be
weaker than the enemy everywhere except in that one point or
matter. The decision of what was critical would always be ours.
Most wars were wars of contact, both forces striving into touch to
avoid tactical surprise. Ours should be a war of detachment. We
were to contain the enemy by the silent threat of a vast unknown
desert, not disclosing ourselves till we attacked. The attack might
be nominal, directed not against him, but against his stuff; so it
would not seek either his strength or his weakness, but his most
accessible material. In railway-cutting it would be usually an
empty stretch of rail; and the more empty, the greater the tactical
success. We might turn our average into a rule (not a law, since
war was antinomian) and develop a habit of never engaging the
enemy. This would chime with the numerical plea for never affording
a target. Many Turks on our front had no chance all the war to fire
on us, and we were never on the defensive except by accident and in
error.</p>

<p>The corollary of such a rule was perfect 'intelligence', so that
we could plan in certainty. The chief agent must be the general's
head; and his understanding must be faultless, leaving no room for
chance. Morale, if built on knowledge, was broken by ignorance.
When we knew all about the enemy we should be comfortable. We must
take more pains in the service of news than any regular staff.</p>

<p>I was getting through my subject. The algebraical factor had
been translated into terms of Arabia, and fitted like a glove. It
promised victory. The biological factor had dictated to us a
development of the tactical line most in accord with the genius of
our tribesmen. There remained the psychological element to build up
into an apt shape. I went to Xenophon and stole, to name it, his
word <i>diathetics</i>, which had been the art of Cyrus before he
struck.</p>

<p>Of this our 'propaganda' was the stained and ignoble offspring.
It was the pathic, almost the ethical, in war. Some of it concerned
the crowd, an adjustment of its spirit to the point where it became
useful to exploit in action, and the pre-direction of this changing
spirit to a certain end. Some of it concerned the individual, and
then it became a rare art of human kindness, transcending, by
purposed emotion, the gradual logical sequence of the mind. It was
more subtle than tactics, and better worth doing, because it dealt
with uncontrollables, with subjects incapable of direct command. It
considered the capacity for mood of our men, their complexities and
mutability, and the cultivation of whatever in them promised to
profit our intention. We had to arrange their minds in order of
battle just as carefully and as formally as other officers would
arrange their bodies. And not only our own men's minds, though
naturally they came first. We must also arrange the minds of the
enemy, so far as we could reach them; then those other minds of the
nation supporting us behind the firing line, since more than half
the battle passed there in the back; then the minds of the enemy
nation waiting the verdict; and of the neutrals looking on; circle
beyond circle.</p>

<p>There were many humiliating material limits, but no moral
impossibilities; so that the scope of our diathetical activities
was unbounded. On it we should mainly depend for the means of
victory on the Arab front: and the novelty of it was our advantage.
The printing press, and each newly-discovered method of
communication favoured the intellectual above the physical,
civilization paying the mind always from the body's funds. We
kindergarten soldiers were beginning our art of war in the
atmosphere of the twentieth century, receiving our weapons without
prejudice. To the regular officer, with the tradition of forty
generations of service behind him, the antique arms were the most
honoured. As we had seldom to concern ourselves with what our men
did, but always with what they thought, the diathetic for us would
be more than half the command. In Europe it was set a little aside,
and entrusted to men outside the General Staff. In Asia the regular
elements were so weak that irregulars could not let the
metaphysical weapon rust unused.</p>

<p>Battles in Arabia were a mistake, since we profited in them only
by the ammunition the enemy fired off. Napoleon had said it was
rare to find generals willing to fight battles; but the curse of
this war was that so few would do anything else. Saxe had told us
that irrational battles were the refuges of fools: rather they
seemed to me impositions on the side which believed itself weaker,
hazards made unavoidable either by lack of land room or by the need
to defend a material property dearer than the lives of soldiers. We
had nothing material to lose, so our best line was to defend
nothing and to shoot nothing. Our cards were speed and time, not
hitting power. The invention of bully beef had profited us more
than the invention of gunpowder, but gave us strategical rather
than tactical strength, since in Arabia range was more than force,
space greater than the power of armies.</p>

<p>I had now been eight days lying in this remote tent, keeping my
ideas general, till my brain, sick of unsupported thinking, had to
be dragged to its work by an effort of will, and went off into a
doze whenever that effort was relaxed. The fever passed: my
dysentery ceased; and with restored strength the present again
became actual to me. Facts concrete and pertinent thrust themselves
into my reveries; and my inconstant wit bore aside towards all
these roads of escape. So I hurried into line my shadowy
principles, to have them once precise before my power to evoke them
faded.</p>

<p>It seemed to me proven that our rebellion had an unassailable
base, guarded not only from attack, but from the fear of attack. It
had a sophisticated alien enemy, disposed as an army of occupation
in an area greater than could be dominated effectively from
fortified posts. It had a friendly population, of which some two in
the hundred were active, and the rest quietly sympathetic to the
point of not betraying the movements of the minority. The active
rebels had the virtues of secrecy and self-control, and the
qualities of speed, endurance and independence of arteries of
supply. They had technical equipment enough to paralyse the enemy's
communications. A province would be won when we had taught the
civilians in it to die for our ideal of freedom. The presence of
the enemy was secondary. Final victory seemed certain, if the war
lasted long enough for us to work it out.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV</h3>

<p>Obviously I was well again, and I remembered the reason of my
journey to Wadi Ais. The Turks meant to march out of Medina, and
Sir Archibald Murray wanted us to attack them in professional form.
It was irksome that he should come butting into our show from
Egypt, asking from us alien activities. Yet the British were the
bigger; and the Arabs lived only by grace of their shadow. We were
yoked to Sir Archibald Murray, and must work with him, to the point
of sacrificing our non-essential interests for his, if they would
not be reconciled. At the same time we could not possibly act
alike. Feisal might be a free gas: Sir Archibald's army, probably
the most cumbrous in the world, had to be laboriously pushed
forward on its belly. It was ridiculous to suppose it could keep
pace with ethical conceptions as nimble as the Arab Movement:
doubtful even if it would understand them. However, perhaps by
hindering the railway we could frighten the Turks off their plan to
evacuate Medina, and give them reason to remain in the town on the
defensive: a conclusion highly serviceable to both Arabs and
English, though possibly neither would see it, yet.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I wandered into Abdulla's tent, announcing my
complete recovery and an ambition to do something to the Hejaz
railway. Here were men, guns, machine-guns, explosives and
automatic mines: enough for a main effort. But Abdulla was
apathetic. He wanted to talk about the Royal families of Europe, or
the Battle of the Somme: the slow march of his own war bored him.
However, Sherif Shakir, his cousin and second in command, was fired
to enthusiasm, and secured us licence to do our worst. Shakir loved
the Ateiba, and swore they were the best tribe on earth; so we
settled to take mostly Ateiba with us. Then we thought we might
have a mountain gun, one of the Egyptian Army Krupp veterans, which
had been sent by Feisal to Abdulla from Wejh as a present.</p>

<p>Shakir promised to collect the force, and we agreed that I
should go in front (gently, as befitted my weakness) and search for
a target. The nearest and biggest was Aba el Naam Station. With me
went Raho, Algerian officer in the French Army, and member of
Bremond's mission, a very hard-working and honest fellow. Our guide
was Mohammed el Kadhi, whose old father, Dakhil-Allah, hereditary
lawman of the Juheina, had guided the Turks down to Yenbo last
December. Mohammed was eighteen, solid and silent natured. Sherif
Fauzan el Harith, the famous warrior who had captured Eshref at
Janbila, escorted us, with about twenty Ateiba and five or six
Juheina adventurers.</p>

<p>We left on March the twenty-sixth, while Sir Archibald Murray
was attacking Gaza; and rode down Wadi Ais; but after three hours
the heat proved too much for me, and we stopped by a great sidr
tree (lote or jujube, but the fruit was scarce) and rested under it
the midday hours. Sidr trees cast heavy shade: there was a cool
east wind, and few flies. Wadi Ais was luxuriant with thorn trees
and grass, and its air full of white butterflies and scents of wild
flowers; so that we did not remount till late in the afternoon, and
then did only a short march, leaving Wadi Ais by the right, after
passing in an angle of the valley a ruined terrace and cistern.
Once there had been villages in this part, with the underground
waters carefully employed in their frequent gardens; but now it was
waste.</p>

<p>The following morning we had two hours' rough riding around the
spurs of Jebel Serd into Wadi Turaa, a historic valley, linked by
an easy pass to Wadi Yenbo. We spent this midday also under a tree,
near some Juheina tents, where Mohammed guested while we slept.
Then we rode on rather crookedly for two more hours, and camped
after dark. By ill luck an early spring scorpion stung me severely
on the left hand while I lay down to sleep. The place swelled up;
and my arm became stiff and sore.</p>

<p>At five next morning, after a long night, we restarted, and
passed through the last hills, out into the Jurf, an undulating
open space which ran up southward to Jebel Antar, a crater with a
split and castellated top, making it a landmark. We turned
half-right in the plain, to get under cover of the low hills which
screened it from Wadi Hamdh, in whose bed the railway lay. Behind
these hills we rode southward till opposite Aba el Naam. There we
halted to camp, close to the enemy but quite in safety. The
hill-top commanded them; and we climbed it before sunset for a
first view of the station.</p>

<p>The hill was, perhaps, six hundred feet high and steep, and I
made many stages of it, resting on my way up: but the sight from
the top was good. The railway was some three miles off. The station
had a pair of large, two-storied houses of basalt, a circular
watertower, and other buildings. There were bell-tents, huts and
trenches, but no sign of guns. We could see about three hundred men
in all.</p>

<p>We had heard that the Turks patrolled their neighbourhood
actively at night. A bad habit this: so we sent off two men to lie
by each blockhouse, and fire a few shots after dark. The enemy,
thinking it a prelude to attack, stood-to in their trenches all
night, while we were comfortably sleeping; but the cold woke us
early with a restless dawn wind blowing across the Jurf, and
singing in the great trees round our camp. As we climbed to our
observation point the sun conquered the clouds and an hour later it
grew very hot.</p>

<p>We lay like lizards in the long grass round the stones of the
foremost cairn upon the hill-top, and saw the garrison parade.
Three hundred and ninety-nine infantry, little toy men, ran about
when the bugle sounded, and formed up in stiff lines below the
black building till there was more bugling: then they scattered,
and after a few minutes the smoke of cooking fires went up. A herd
of sheep and goats in charge of a little ragged boy issued out
towards us. Before he reached the foot of the hills there came a
loud whistling down the valley from the north, and a tiny,
picture-book train rolled slowly into view across the hollow
sounding bridge and halted just outside the station, panting out
white puffs of steam.</p>

<p>The shepherd lad held on steadily, driving his goats with shrill
cries up our hill for the better pasture on the western side. We
sent two Juheina down behind a ridge beyond sight of the enemy, and
they ran from each side and caught him. The lad was of the outcast
Heteym, pariahs of the desert, whose poor children were commonly
sent on hire as shepherds to the tribes about them. This one cried
continually, and made efforts to escape as often as he saw his
goats straying uncared-for about the hill. In the end the men lost
patience and tied him up roughly, when he screamed for terror that
they would kill him. Fauzan had great ado to make him quiet, and
then questioned him about his Turkish masters. But all his thoughts
were for the flock: his eyes followed them miserably while the
tears made edged and crooked tracks down his dirty face.</p>

<p>Shepherds were a class apart. For the ordinary Arab the hearth
was a university, about which their world passed and where they
heard the best talk, the news of their tribe, its poems, histories,
love tales, lawsuits and bargainings. By such constant sharing in
the hearth councils they grew up masters of expression,
dialecticians, orators, able to sit with dignity in any gathering
and never at a loss for moving words. The shepherds missed the
whole of this. From infancy they followed their calling, which took
them in all seasons and weathers, day and night, into the hills and
condemned them to loneliness and brute company. In the wilderness,
among the dry bones of nature, they grew up natural, knowing
nothing of man and his affairs; hardly sane in ordinary talk; but
very wise in plants, wild animals, and the habits of their own
goats and sheep, whose milk was their chief sustenance. With
manhood they became sullen, while a few turned dangerously savage,
more animal than man, haunting the flocks, and finding the
satisfaction of their adult appetites in them, to the exclusion of
more licit affections.</p>

<p>For hours after the shepherd had been suppressed only the sun
moved in our view. As it climbed we shifted our cloaks to filter
its harshness, and basked in luxurious warmth. The restful hill-top
gave me back something of the sense-interests which I had lost
since I had been ill I was able to note once more the typical hill
scenery, with its hard stone crests, its sides of bare rock, and
lower slopes of loose sliding screens, packed, as the base was
approached, solidly with a thin dry soil. The stone itself was
glistening, yellow, sunburned stuff; metallic in ring, and brittle;
splitting red or green or brown as the case might be. From every
soft place sprouted thorn-bushes; and there was frequent grass,
usually growing from one root in a dozen stout blades, knee-high
and straw-coloured: the heads were empty ears between
many-feathered arrows of silvery down. With these, and with a
shorter grass, whose bottle-brush heads of pearly grey reached only
to the ankle, the hill-sides were furred white and bowed themselves
lowly towards us with each puff of the casual wind.</p>

<p>Verdure it was not, but excellent pasturage; and in the valleys
were bigger tufts of grass, coarse, waist-high and bright green
when fresh though they soon faded to the burned yellow of ordinary
life. They grew thickly in all the beds of water-ribbed sand and
shingle, between the occasional thorn trees, some of which stood
forty feet in height. The sidr trees, with their dry, sugary fruit,
were rare. But bushes of browned tamarisk, tall broom, other
varieties of coarse grass, some flowers, and everything which had
thorns, flourished about our camp, and made it a rich sample of the
vegetation of the Hejaz highlands. Only one of the plants profited
ourselves, and that was the hemeid: a sorrel with fleshy
heart-shaped leaves, whose pleasant acidity stayed our thirst.</p>

<p>At dusk we climbed down again with the goat-herd prisoner, and
what we could gather of his flock. Our main body would come this
night; so that Fauzan and I wandered out across the darkling plain
till we found a pleasant gun-position in some low ridges not two
thousand yards from the station. On our return, very tired, fires
were burning among the trees. Shakir had just arrived, and his men
and ours were roasting goat-flesh contentedly. The shepherd was
tied up behind my sleeping place, because he had gone frantic when
his charges were unlawfully slaughtered. He refused to taste the
supper; and we only forced bread and rice into him by the threat of
dire punishment if he insulted our hospitality. They tried to
convince him that we should take the station next day and kill his
masters; but he would not be comforted, and afterwards, for fear
lest he escape, had to be lashed to his tree again.</p>

<p>After supper Shakir told me that he had brought only three
hundred men instead of the agreed eight or nine hundred. However,
it was his war, and therefore his tune, so we hastily modified the
plans. We would not take the station; we would frighten it by a
frontal artillery attack, while we mined the railway to the north
and south, in the hope of trapping that halted train. Accordingly
we chose a party of Garland-trained dynamiters who should blow up
something north of the bridge at dawn, to seal that direction;
while I went off with high explosive and a machine-gun with its
crew to lay a mine to the south of the station, the probable
direction from which the Turks would seek or send help, in their
emergency.</p>

<p>Mohammed el Khadi guided us to a deserted bit of line just
before midnight. I dismounted and fingered its thrilling rails for
the first time during the war. Then, in an hour's busy work, we
laid the mine, which was a trigger action to fire into twenty
pounds of blasting gelatine when the weight of the locomotive
overhead deflected the metals. Afterwards we posted the
machine-gunners in a little bush-screened watercourse, four hundred
yards from and fully commanding the spot where we hoped the train
would be derailed. They were to hide there; while we went on to cut
the telegraph, that isolation might persuade Aba el Naam to send
their train for reinforcements, as our main attack developed.</p>

<p>So we rode another half-hour, and then turned in to the line,
and again were fortunate to strike an unoccupied place. Unhappily
the four remaining Juheina proved unable to climb a telegraph pole,
and I had to struggle up it myself. It was all I could do, after my
illness; and when the third wire was cut the flimsy pole shook so
that I lost grip, and came slipping down the sixteen feet upon the
stout shoulders of Mohammed, who ran in to break my fall, and
nearly got broken himself. We took a few minutes to breathe, but
afterwards were able to regain our camels. Eventually we arrived in
camp just as the others had saddled up to go forward.</p>

<p>Our mine-laying had taken four hours longer than we had planned
and the delay put us in the dilemma either of getting no rest, or
of letting the main body march without us. Finally by Shakir's will
we let them go, and fell down under our trees for an hour's sleep,
without which I felt I should collapse utterly. The time was just
before daybreak, an hour when the uneasiness of the air affected
trees and animals, and made even men-sleepers turn over sighingly.
Mohammed, who wanted to see the fight, awoke. To get me up he came
over and cried the morning prayer-call in my ear, the raucous voice
sounding battle, murder, and sudden death across my dreams. I sat
up and rubbed the sand out of red-rimmed aching eyes, as we
disputed vehemently of prayer and sleep. He pleaded that there was
not a battle every day, and showed the cuts and bruises sustained
during the night in helping me. By my blackness and blueness I
could feel for him, and we rode off to catch the army, after
loosing the still unhappy shepherd boy, with advice to wait for our
return.</p>

<p>A band of trodden untidiness in a sweep of gleaming
water-rounded sand showed us the way, and we arrived just as the
guns opened fire. They did excellently, and crashed in all the top
of one building, damaged the second, hit the pump-room, and holed
the water-tank. One lucky shell caught the front waggon of the
train in the siding, and it took fire furiously. This alarmed the
locomotive, which uncoupled and went off southward. We watched her
hungrily as she approached our mine, and when she was on it there
came a soft cloud of dust and a report and she stood still. The
damage was to the front part, as she was reversed and the charge
had exploded late; but, while the drivers got out, and jacked up
the front wheels and tinkered at them, we waited and waited in vain
for the machine-gun to open fire. Later we learned that the
gunners, afraid of their loneliness, had packed up and marched to
join us when we began shooting. Half an hour after, the repaired
engine went away towards Jebel Antar, going at a foot pace and
clanking loudly; but going none the less.</p>

<p>Our Arabs worked in towards the station, under cover of the
bombardment, while we gnashed our teeth at the machine-gunners.
Smoke clouds from the fire trucks screened the Arab advance which
wiped out one enemy outpost, and captured another. The Turks
withdrew their surviving detachments to the main position, and
waited rigorously in their trenches for the assault, which they
were in no better spirit to repel than we were to deliver. With our
advantages in ground the place would have been a gift to us, if
only we had had some of Feisal's men to charge home.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the wood, tents and trucks in the station were
burning, and the smoke was too thick for us to shoot, so we broke
off the action. We had taken thirty prisoners, a mare, two camels
and some more sheep; and had killed and wounded seventy of the
garrison, at a cost to ourselves of one man slightly hurt. Traffic
was held up for three days of repair and investigation. So we did
not wholly fail.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXV</h3>

<p>We left two parties in the neighbourhood to damage the line on
the next day and the next, while we rode to Abdullah's camp on
April the first. Shakir, splendid in habit, held a grand parade on
entry, and had thousands of joy-shots fired in honour of his
partial victory. The easy-going camp made carnival.</p>

<p>In the evening I went wandering in the thorn-grove behind the
tents, till I began to see through the thick branches a wild light,
from bursts of raw flame; and across the flame and smoke came the
rhythm of drums, in tune with hand-clapping, and the deep roar of a
tribal chorus. I crept up quietly, and saw an immense fire, ringed
by hundreds of Ataiba sitting on the ground one by the other,
gazing intently on Shakir, who, upright and alone in their midst,
performed the dance of their song. He had put off his cloak, and
wore only his white head-veil and white robes: the powerful
firelight was reflected by these and by his pale, ravaged face. As
he sang he threw back his head, and at the close of each phrase
raised his hands, to let the full sleeves run back upon his
shoulders, while he waved his bare arms weirdly. The tribe around
him beat time with their hands, or bayed out the refrains at his
nod. The grove of trees where I stood outside the circle of light
was thronged with Arabs of stranger tribes, whispering, and
watching the Atban.</p>

<p>In the morning we determined on another visit to the line, for
fuller trial of the automatic mine-action which had half-failed at
Aba el Naam. Old Dakhil-Allah said that he would come with me
himself on this trip; the project of looting a train had tempted
him. With us went some forty of the Juheina, who seemed to me
stouter men than the high-bred Ateiba. However, one of the chiefs
of the Ataiba, Sultan el Abbud, a boon friend of Abdulla and
Shakir, refused to be left behind. This good-tempered but
hare-brained fellow, sheikh of a poor section of the tribe, had had
more horses killed under him in battle than any other Ateibi
warrior. He was about twenty-six and a great rider; full of quips
and fond of practical jokes, very noisy: tall and strong, with a
big, square head, wrinkled forehead, and deep-set bright eyes. A
young moustache and beard hid his ruthless jaw and the wide,
straight mouth, with white teeth gleaming and locked like a
wolfs.</p>

<p>We took a machine-gun and its soldier-crew of thirteen with us,
to settle our train when caught. Shakir, with his grave courtesy to
the Emir's guest, set us on our road for the first half-hour. This
time we kept to the Wadi Ais almost to its junction with Hamdh,
finding it very green and full of grazing, since it had flooded
twice already in this winter. At last we bore off to the right over
a ditch on to a flat, and there slept in the sand, rather
distressed by a shower of rain which sent little rills over the
ground about midnight: but the next morning was bright and hot, and
we rode into the huge plain where the three great valleys, Tubja,
Ais and Jizil, flowed into and became one with Hamdh. The course of
the main stream was overgrown by asla wood, just as at Abu
Zereibat, with the same leprous bed of hummocky sand-blisters: but
the thicket was only two hundred yards broad, and beyond it the
plain with its grained intricacy of shallow torrent-beds stretched
for yet further miles. At noon we halted by a place like a
wilderness garden, waist deep in juicy grass and flowers, upon
which our happy camels gorged themselves for an hour and then sat
down, full and astonished.</p>

<p>The day seemed to be hotter and hotter: the sun drew close, and
scorched us without intervening air. The clean, sandy soil was so
baked that my bare feet could not endure it, and I had to walk in
sandals, to the amusement of the Juheina, whose thick soles were
proof even against slow fire. As the afternoon passed on the light
became dim, but the heat steadily increased with an oppression and
sultriness which took me by surprise. I kept turning my head to see
if some mass was not just behind me, shutting off the air.</p>

<p>There had been long rolls of thunder all morning in the hills,
and the two peaks, Serd and Jasim, were wrapped in folds of dark
blue and yellow vapour, which looked motionless and substantial. At
last I saw that part of the yellow cloud off Serd was coming slowly
against the wind in our direction, raising scores of dust devils
before its feet.</p>

<p>The cloud was nearly as high as the hill. While it approached,
two dust-spouts, tight and symmetrical chimneys, advanced, one on
the right and one on the left of its front. Dakhil-Allah
responsibly looked ahead and to each side for shelter, but saw
none. He warned me that the storm would be heavy.</p>

<p>When it got near, the wind, which had been scorching our faces
with its hot breathlessness, changed suddenly; and, after waiting a
moment, blew bitter cold and damp upon our backs. It also increased
greatly in violence, and at the same time the sun disappeared,
blotted out by thick rags of yellow air over our heads. We stood in
a horrible light, ochreous and fitful. The brown wall of cloud from
the hills was now very near, rushing changelessly upon us with a
loud grinding sound. Three minutes later it struck, wrapping about
us a blanket of dust and stinging grains of sand, twisting and
turning in violent eddies, and yet advancing eastward at the speed
of a strong gale.</p>

<p>We had put our camels' backs to the storm, to march before it:
but these internal whirling winds tore our tightly-held cloaks from
our hands, filled our eyes, and robbed us of all sense of direction
by turning our camels right or left from their course. Sometimes
they were blown completely round: once we clashed helplessly
together in a vortex, while large bushes, tufts of grass, and even
a small tree were torn up by the roots in dense waves of the soil
about them, and driven against us, or blown over our heads with
dangerous force. We were never blinded&mdash;it was always possible
to see for seven or eight feet to each side&mdash;but it was risky
to look out, as, in addition to the certain sand-blast, we never
knew if we should not meet a flying tree, a rush of pebbles, or a
spout of grass-laden dust.</p>

<p>This storm lasted for eighteen minutes, and then leaped forward
from us as suddenly as it had come. Our party was scattered over a
square mile or more, and before we could rally, while we, our
clothes and our camels were yet smothered in dust, yellow and heavy
with it from head to foot, down burst torrents of thick rain and
muddied us to the skin. The valley began to run in plashes of
water, and Dakhil-Allah urged us across it quickly. The wind
chopped once more, this time to the north, and the rain came
driving before it in harsh sheets of spray. It beat through our
woollen cloaks in a moment, and moulded them and our shirts to our
bodies, and chilled us to the bone.</p>

<p>We reached the hill-barrier in mid-afternoon, but found the
valley bare and shelterless, colder than ever. After riding up it
for three or four miles we halted, and climbed a great crag to see
the railway which, they said, lay just beyond. On the height the
wind was so terrible that we could not cling to the wet slippery
rocks against the slapping and bellying of our cloaks and skirts. I
took mine off, and climbed the rest of the way half-naked, more
easily, and hardly colder than before. But the effort proved
useless, the air being too thick for observation. So I worked down,
cut and bruised, to the others; and dressed numbly. On our way back
we suffered the only casualty of this trip. Sultan had insisted on
coming with us, and his Ateibi servant, who must follow him though
he had no head for heights, slipped in one bad place with a fall of
forty feet to the stones, and plunged down headlong.</p>

<p>When we got back my hands and feet were too broken to serve me
longer, and I lay down and shivered for an hour or so while the
others buried the dead man in a side valley. On their return they
met suddenly an unknown rider on a camel, crossing their track. He
fired at them. They fired back, snap-shooting through the rain, and
the evening swallowed him. This was disquieting, for surprise was
our main ally, and we could only hope that he would not return to
warn the Turks that there were raiders in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>After the heavy camels with the explosives caught us, we mounted
again to get closer to the line; but we had no more than started
when brazenly down the visible wind in the misted valley came the
food-call of Turkish bugles. Dakhil-Allah thrust his ear forward in
the direction of the sound, and understood that over there lay
Madahrij, the small station below which we meant to operate. So we
steered on the hateful noise, hateful because it spoke of supper
and of tents, whereas we were shelterless, and on such a night
could not hope to make ourselves a fire and bake bread from the
flour and water in our saddle-bags, and consequently must go
hungry.</p>

<p>We did not reach the railway till after ten o'clock at night, in
conditions of invisibility which made it futile to choose a
machine-gun position. At random I pitched upon kilometre 1,121 from
Damascus for the mine. It was a complicated mine, with a central
trigger to fire simultaneous charges thirty yards apart: and we
hoped in this way to get the locomotive whether it was going north
or south. Burying the mine took four hours, for the rain had caked
the surface and rotted it. Our feet made huge tracks on the flat
and on the bank, as though a school of elephants had been dancing
there. To hide these marks was out of the question, so we did the
other thing, trampling about for hundreds of yards, even bringing
up our camels to help, until it looked as though half an army had
crossed the valley, and the mine-place was no better and no worse
than the rest. Then we went back a safe distance, behind some
miserable mounds, and cowered down in the open, waiting for day.
The cold was intense. Our teeth chattered, and we trembled and
hissed involuntarily, while our hands drew in like claws.</p>

<p>At dawn the clouds had disappeared, and a red sun promised, over
the very fine broken hills beyond the railway. Old Dakhil-Allah,
our active guide and leader in the night, now took general charge,
and sent us out singly and in pairs to all the approaches of our
hiding-place. He himself crawled up the ridge before us to watch
events upon the railway through his glasses. I was praying that
there might be no events till the sun had gained power and warmed
me, for the shivering fit still jerked me about. However, soon the
sun was up and unveiled, and things improved. My clothes were
drying. By noon it was nearly as hot as the day before, and we were
gasping for shade, and thicker clothes, against the sun.</p>

<p>First of all, though, at six in the morning, Dakhil-Allah
reported a trolley, which came from the south, and passed over the
mine harmlessly&mdash;to our satisfaction, for we had not laid a
beautiful compound charge for just four men and a sergeant. Then
sixty men sallied out from Madahrij. This disturbed us till we saw
that they were to replace five telegraph poles blown down by the
storm of the afternoon before. Then at seven-thirty a patrol of
eleven men went down the line: two inspecting each rail minutely,
three marching each side of the bank looking for cross-tracks, and
one, presumably the N.C.O., walking grandly along the metals with
nothing to do.</p>

<p>However, to-day, they did find something, when they crossed our
footprints about kilometre 1,121. They concentrated there upon the
permanent way, stared at it, stamped, wandered up and down,
scratched the ballast; and thought exhaustively. The time of their
search passed slowly for us: but the mine was well hidden, so that
eventually they wandered on contentedly towards the south, where
they met the Hedia patrol, and both parties sat together in the
cool shade of a bridge-arch, and rested after their labours.
Meanwhile the train, a heavy train, came along from the south. Nine
of its laden trucks held women and children from Medina, civil
refugees being deported to Syria, with their household stuff. It
ran over the charges without explosion. As artist I was furious; as
commander deeply relieved: women and children were not proper
spoil.</p>

<p>The Juheina raced to the crest where Dakhil-Allah and myself lay
hidden, when they heard the train coming, to see it blown in
pieces. Our stone headwork had been built for two, so that the
hilltop, a bald cone conspicuously opposite the working party,
became suddenly and visibly populous. This was too much for the
nerves of the Turks, who fled back into Madahrij, and thence, at
about five thousand yards, opened a brisk rifle fire. They must
also have telephoned to Hedia, which soon came to Me: but since the
nearest outpost on that side was about six miles off, its garrisons
held their fire, and contented themselves with selections on the
bugle, played all day. The distance made it grave and
beautiful.</p>

<p>Even the rifle shooting did us no harm; but the disclosure of
ourselves was unfortunate. At Madahrij were two hundred men, and at
Hedia eleven hundred, and our retreat was by the plain of Hamdh on
which Hedia stood. Their mounted troops might sally out and cut our
rear. The Juheina had good camels, and so were safe; but the
machine-gun was a captured German sledge-Maxim: a heavy load for
its tiny mule. The servers were on foot, or on other mules: their
top speed would be only six miles an hour, and their fighting
value, with a single gun, not high. So after a council of war we
rode back with them half-way through the hills, and there dismissed
them, with fifteen Juheina, towards Wadi Ais.</p>

<p>This made us mobile, and Dakhil-Allah, Sultan, Mohammed and I
rode back with the rest of our party for another look at the line.
The sunlight was now terrific, with faint gusts of scorching heat
blowing up at us out of the south. We took refuge about ten o'clock
under some spacious trees, where we baked bread and lunched, in
nice view of the line, and shaded from the worst of the sun. About
us, over the gravel, circles of pale shadow from the crisping
leaves ran to and fro, like grey, indeterminate bugs, as the
slender branches dipped reluctantly in the wind. Our picnic annoyed
the Turks, who shot or trumpeted at us incessantly through the
middle day and till evening, while we slept in turn.</p>

<p>About five they grew quiet, and we mounted and rode slowly
across the open valley towards the railway. Madahrij revived in a
paroxysm of fire, and all the trumpets of Hedia blared again. The
monkey-pleasure of pulling large and impressive legs was upon us.
So when we reached the line we made our camels kneel down beside
it, and, led by Dakhil-Allah as Imam, performed a sunset prayer
quietly between the rails. It was probably the first prayer of the
Juheina for a year or so, and I was a novice, but from a distance
we passed muster, and the Turks stopped shooting in bewilderment
This was the first and last time I ever prayed in Arabia as a
Moslem.</p>

<p>After the prayer it was still much too light to hide our
actions: so we sat round on the embankment smoking, till dusk, when
I tried to go off by myself and dig up the mine, to learn, for
service on the next occasion, why it had failed. However, the
Juheina were as interested in that as I. Along they came in a swarm
and clustered over the metals during the search. They brought my
heart into my throat, for it took me an hour to find just where the
mine was hidden. Laying a Garland mine was shaky work, but
scrabbling in pitch darkness up and down a hundred yards of
railway, feeling for a hair-trigger buried in the ballast, seemed,
at the time, an almost uninsurable occupation. The two charges
connected with it were so powerful that they would have rooted out
seventy yards of track; and I saw visions of suddenly blowing up,
not only myself, but my whole force, every moment. To be sure, such
a feat would have properly completed the bewilderment of the
Turks!</p>

<p>At last I found it, and ascertained by touch that the lock had
sunk one-sixteenth of an inch, due to bad setting by myself or
because the ground had subsided after the rain. I firmed it into
its place. Then, to explain ourselves plausibly to the enemy, we
began blowing up things to the north of the mine. We found a little
four-arch bridge and put it into the air. Afterwards we turned to
rails and cut about two hundred: and while the men were laying and
lighting charges I taught Mohammed to climb a splintery pole;
together we cut the wires, and with their purchase dragged down
other poles. All was done at speed, for we feared lest Turks come
after us: and when our explosive work was finished we ran back like
hares to our camels, mounted them, and trotted without interruption
down the windy valley once more to the plain of Hamdh.</p>

<p>There we were in safety, but old Dakhil-Allah was too pleased
with the mess we had made of the line to go soberly. When we were
on the sandy flat he beat up his camel into a canter, and we
pounded madly after him through the colourless moonlight. The going
was perfect, and we never drew rein for three hours, till we
over-rode our machine-gun and its escort camping on the road home.
The soldiers heard our rout yelling through the night, thought us
enemies of sorts, and let fly at us with their Maxim: but it jammed
after half a belt, and they, being tailors from Mecca, were unhandy
with it. So no one was hurt, and we captured them mirthfully.</p>

<p>In the morning we slept lazily long, and breakfasted at Rubiaan,
the first well in Wadi Ais. Afterwards we were smoking and talking,
about to bring in the camels, when suddenly we felt the distant
shock of a great explosion behind us on the railway. We wondered if
the mine had been discovered or had done its duty. Two scouts had
been left to report, and we rode slowly; for them, and because the
rain two days ago had brought down Wadi Ais once more in flood, and
its bed was all flecked over with shallow pools of soft, grey
water, between banks of silvery mud, which the current had rippled
into fish-scales. The warmth of the sun made the surface like fine
glue, on which our helpless camels sprawled comically, or went down
with a force and completeness surprising in such dignified beasts.
Their tempers were roughened each time by our fit of mirth.</p>

<p>The sunlight, the easy march and the expectation of the scouts'
news made everything gay, and we developed social virtues: but our
limbs, stiff from the exertions of yesterday, and our abundant
food, determined us to fall short of Abu Markha for the night. So,
near sunset, we chose a dry terrace in the valley to sleep upon. I
rode up it first and turned and looked at the men reined in below
me in a group, upon their bay camels like copper statues in the
fierce light of the setting sun; they seemed to be burning with an
inward flame.</p>

<p>Before bread was baked the scouts arrived, to tell us that at
dawn the Turks had been busy round our damages; and a little later
a locomotive with trucks of rails, and a crowded labour gang on
top, had come up from Hedia, and had exploded the mine fore and aft
of its wheels. This was everything we had hoped, and we rode back
to Abdullah's camp on a morning of perfect springtime, in a singing
company. We had proved that a well-laid mine would fire; and that a
well-laid mine was difficult even for its maker to discover. These
points were of importance; for Newcombe, Garland and Hornby were
now out upon the railway, harrying it: and mines were the best
weapon yet discovered to make the regular working of their trains
costly and uncertain for our Turkish enemy.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI</h3>

<p>Despite his kindness and charm, I could not like Abdullah or his
camp: perhaps because I was not sociable, and these people had no
personal solitude: perhaps because their good humour showed me the
futility of my more than Palomides' pains, not merely to seem
better than myself, but to make others better. Whereas nothing was
futile in the atmosphere of higher thinking and responsibility
which ruled at Feisal's. Abdulla passed his merry day in the big
cool tent accessible only to friends, limiting suppliants or new
adherents or the hearing of disputes to one public session in the
afternoon. For the rest he read the papers, ate carefully, slept.
Especially he played games, either chess with his staff or
practical jokes with Mohammed Hassan. Mohammed, nominally
Muedhdhin, was really court fool. A tiresome old fool I found him,
as my illness left me less even than usual in jesting mood.</p>

<p>Abdullah and his friends, Shakir, Fauzan, and the two sons of
Hamza among the Sherifs, with Sultan el Abbud and Hoshan, from the
Ateiba, and ibn Mesfer, the guest-master, would spend much of the
day and all the evening hours tormenting Mohammed Hassan. They
stabbed him with thorns, stoned him, dropped sun-heated pebbles
down his back, set him on fire. Sometimes the jest would be
elaborate, as when they laid a powder trail under the rugs, and
lured Mohammed Hassan to sit on its end. Once Abdullah shot a
coffee-pot off his head thrice from twenty yards, and then rewarded
his long-suffering servility with three months' pay.</p>

<p>Abdullah would sometimes ride a little, or shoot a little, and
return exhausted to his tent for massage; and afterwards reciters
would be introduced to soothe his aching head. He was fond of
Arabic verses and exceptionally well read. The local poets found
him a profitable audience. He was also interested in history and
letters, and would have grammatical disputations in his tent and
adjudge money prizes.</p>

<p>He affected to have no care for the Hejaz situation, regarding
the autonomy of the Arabs as assured by the promises of Great
Britain to his father, and leaning at ease against this prop. I
longed to tell him that the half-witted old man had obtained from
us no concrete or unqualified undertaking of any sort, and that
their ship might founder on the bar of his political stupidity; but
that would have been to give away my English masters, and the
mental tug of war between honesty and loyalty, after swaying a
while, settled again expediently into deadlock.</p>

<p>Abdulla professed great interest in the war in Europe, and
studied it closely in the Press. He was also acquainted with
Western politics, and had learned by rote the courts and ministries
of Europe, even to the name of the Swiss President. I remarked
again how much the comfortable circumstance that we still had a
King made for the reputation of England in this world of Asia.
Ancient and artificial societies like this of the Sherifs and
feudal chieftains of Arabia found a sense of honourable security
when dealing with us in such proof that the highest place in our
state was not a prize for merit or ambition.</p>

<p>Time slowly depressed my first, favourable, opinion of Abdulla's
character. His constant ailments, which once aroused compassion,
became fitter for contempt when their causes were apparent in
laziness and self-indulgence, and when he was seen to cherish them
as occupations of his too-great leisure. His casual attractive fits
of arbitrariness now seemed feeble tyranny disguised as whims; his
friendliness became caprice; his good humour love of pleasure. The
leaven of insincerity worked through all the fibres of his being.
Even his simplicity appeared false upon experience; and inherited
religious prejudice was allowed rule over the keenness of his mind
because it was less trouble to him than uncharted thought. His
brain often betrayed its intricate pattern, disclosing idea twisted
tightly over idea into a strong cord of design; and thus his
indolence marred his scheming, too. The webs were constantly
unravelling through his carelessness in leaving them unfinished.
Yet they never separated into straight desires, or grew into
effective desires. Always he watched out of the corner of his bland
and open eye our returns to his innocent-sounding questions,
reading an insect-subtlety of significant meaning into every
hesitation or uncertainty or honest mistake.</p>

<p>One day I entered to find him sitting upright and wide-eyed with
a spot of red in either cheek. Sergeant Frost, his old tutor, had
just come from Colonel Bremond, innocent bearer of a letter which
pointed out how the British were wrapping up the Arabs on all
sides&mdash;at Aden, at Gaza, at Bagdad&mdash;and hoped that
Abdulla realized his situation. He asked hotly what I thought of
it. In answer, I fell back on artifice, and replied in a pretty
phrase that I hoped he would suspect our honesty when he found us
backbiting our allies in private letters. The delicately poisoned
Arabic pleased him, and he paid us the edged compliment of saying
that he knew we were sincere, since otherwise we would not be
represented at Jeddah by Colonel Wilson. There, characteristically,
his subtlety hanged itself, not perceiving the double subtlety
which negatived him. He did not understand that honesty might be
the best-paying cat's paw of rogues, and Wilson, too, downright
readily or quickly to suspect evil in the dignitaries above
him.</p>

<p>Wilson never told even a half-truth. If instructed to inform the
King diplomatically that the subsidy of the month could not at
present be increased, he would ring up Mecca and say, 'Lord, Lord,
there is no more money'. As for lying, he was not merely incapable
of it, but also shrewd enough to know that it was the worst gambit
against players whose whole life had passed in a mist of deceits,
and whose perceptions were of the finest. The Arab leaders showed a
completeness of instinct, a reliance upon intuition, the
unperceived foreknown, which left our centrifugal minds gasping.
Like women, they understood and judged quickly, effortlessly,
unreasonably. It almost seemed as though the Oriental exclusion of
woman from politics had conferred her particular gifts upon the
men. Some of the speed and secrecy of our victory, and its
regularity, might perhaps be ascribed to this double endowment's
offsetting and emphasizing the rare feature that from end to end of
it there was nothing female in the Arab movement, but the
camels.</p>

<p>The outstanding figure of Abdulla's entourage was Sherif Shakir,
a man of twenty-nine, and companion since boyhood of the four
Emirs. His mother was Circassian, as had been his grandmother. From
them he obtained his fair complexion; but the flesh of his face was
torn away by smallpox. From its white ruin two restless eyes looked
out, very bright and big; for the faintness of his eyelashes and
eyebrows made his stare directly disconcerting. His figure was
tall, slim, almost boyish from the continual athletic activity of
the man. His sharp, decided, but pleasant voice frayed out if he
shouted. His manner while delightfully frank, was abrupt, indeed
imperious; with a humour as cracked as his cackling laugh.</p>

<p>This bursting freedom of speech seemed to respect nothing on
earth except King Hussein: towards himself he exacted deference,
more so than did Abdulla, who was always playing tricks with his
companions, the bevy of silk-clad fellows who came about him when
he would be easy. Shakir joined wildly in the sport, but would
smartingly punish a liberty. He dressed simply, but very cleanly,
and, like Abdulla, spent public hours with toothpick and
toothstick. He took no interest in books and never wearied his head
with meditation, but was intelligent and interesting in talk. He
was devout, but hated Mecca, and played backgammon while Abdulla
read the Koran. Yet by fits he would pray interminably.</p>

<p>In war he was the man at arms. His feats made him the darling of
the tribes. He, in return, described himself as a Bedawi, and an
Ateibi, and imitated them. He wore his black hair in plaits down
each side of his face, and kept it glossy with butter, and strong
by frequent washings in camel urine. He encouraged nits, in
deference to the Beduin proverb that a deserted head showed an
ungenerous mind: and wore the <i>brim</i>, a plaited girdle of thin
leathern thongs wrapped three or four times round the loins to
confine and support the belly. He owned splendid horses and camels:
was considered the finest rider in Arabia: ready for a match with
anyone.</p>

<p>Shakir gave me the sense that he preferred a fit of energy to
sustained effort: but there was balance and shrewdness behind his
mad manner. Sherif Hussein had used him on embassies to Cairo
before the war, to arrange private business with the Khedive of
Egypt. The Beduin figure must have looked strange in the stucco
splendour of the Abdin. Abdulla had unlimited admiration for Shakir
and tried to see the world with his eyes of gay carelessness.
Between them they seriously complicated my mission to Wadi Ais.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVII</h3>

<p>Of the tactical situation, Abdulla made very little, pretending
pettishly that it was Feisal's business. He had come to Wadi Ais to
please his younger brother, and there he would stay. He would not
go on raids himself, and hardly encouraged those who did. I
detected jealousy of Feisal in this, as if he wished ostentatiously
to neglect military operations to prevent unbecoming comparison
with his brother's performance. Had Shakir not helped me in the
first instance, I might have had delay and difficulty in getting
started, though Abdulla would have ceded in time and graciously
permitted anything not calling directly upon his own energies.
However, there were now two parties on the railway, with reliefs
enough to do a demolition of some sort every day or so. Much less
interference than this would suffice to wreck the working of
trains, and by making the maintenance of the Turkish garrison at
Medina just a shade less difficult than its evacuation would serve
the interests of British and Arab alike. So I judged my work in
Wadi Ais sufficiently done, and well done.</p>

<p>I longed to get north again quit of this relaxing camp. Abdulla
might let me do all I wanted, but would do nothing of his own:
whereas for me the best value of the revolt lay in the things which
the Arabs attempted without our aid. Feisal was the working
enthusiast with the one idea of making his ancient race justify its
renown by winning freedom with its own hands. His lieutenants Nasir
or Sharraf or Ali ibn el Hussein seconded his plans with head and
heart, so that my part became only synthetic. I combined their
loose showers of sparks into a firm flame: transformed their series
of unrelated incidents into a conscious operation.</p>

<p>We left on the morning of April the tenth, after pleasant
farewells from Abdulla. My three Ageyl were again with me; and
Arslan, the little Syrian Punch-figure, very conscious of Arab
dress, and of the droll outlook and manners of all Bedouins. He
rode disgracefully and endured sorrow the whole way at the uneasy
steps of his camels: but he salved his self-respect by pointing out
that in Damascus no decent man would ride a camel, and his humour
by showing that in Arabia no one but a Damascene would ride so bad
a camel as his. Mohammed el Kadhi was our guide, with six
Juheina.</p>

<p>We marched up Wadi Tleih as we had come, but branched off to the
right, avoiding the lava. We had brought no food, so stopped at
some tents for hospitality of their rice and millet. This
springtime in the hills was the time of plenty for the Arabs, whose
tents were full of sheep-milk and goat-milk and camel-milk, with
everyone well fed and well looking. Afterwards we rode, in weather
like a summer's day in England, for five hours down a narrow,
flood-swept valley, Wadi Osman, which turned and twisted in the
hills hut gave an easy road. The last part of the march was after
dark, and when we stopped, Arslan was missing. We fired volleys and
lit fires hoping he would come upon us; but till dawn there was no
sign, and the Juheina ran back and forward in doubting search.
However, he was only a mile behind, fast asleep under a tree.</p>

<p>A short hour later we stopped at the tents of a wife of
Dakhil-Allah, for a meal. Mohammed allowed himself a bath, a fresh
braiding of his luxuriant hair, and clean clothes. They took very
long about the food, and it was not till near noon that at last it
came: a great bowl of saffron-rice, with a broken lamb littered
over it. Mohammed, who felt it his duty in my honour to be dainty
in service, arrested the main dish, and took from it the fill of a
small copper basin for him and me. Then he waved the rest of the
camp on to the large supply. Mohammed's mother knew herself old
enough to be curious about me. She questioned me about the women of
the tribe of Christians and their way of life, marvelling at my
white skin, and the horrible blue eyes which looked, she said, like
the sky shining through the eye-sockets of an empty skull.</p>

<p>Wadi Osman to-day was less irregular in course, and broadened
slowly. After two hours and a half it twisted suddenly to the right
through a gap, and we found ourselves in Hamdh, in a narrow,
cliff-walled gorge. As usual, the edges of the bed of hard sand
were bare; and the middle bristled with hamdla-asla trees, in grey,
salty, bulging scabs. Before us were flood-pools of sweet water,
the largest of them nearly three hundred feet long, and sharply
deep. Its narrow bed was cut into the light impervious clay.
Mohammed said its water would remain till the year's end, but would
soon turn salt and useless.</p>

<p>After drinks we bathed in it, and found it full of little silver
fish like sardines: all ravenous. We loitered after bathing,
prolonging our bodily pleasure; and remounting in the dark, rode
for six miles, till sleepy. Then we turned away to higher ground
for the night's camp. Wadi Hamdh differed from the other wild
valleys of Hejaz, in its chill air. This was, of course, most
obvious at night, when a white mist, glazing the valley with a salt
sweat, lifted itself some feet up and stood over it motionless. But
even by day, and in sunshine the Hamdh felt damp and raw and
unnatural.</p>

<p>Next morning we started early and passed large pools in the
valley; but only a few were fit to drink: the rest had gone green
and brackish with the little white fish floating, dead and pickled,
in them. Afterwards we crossed the bed, and struck northward over
the plain of Ugila, where Ross, our flight commander from Wejh, had
lately made an aerodrome. Arab guards were sitting by his petrol,
and we breakfasted from them, and afterwards went along Wadi Methar
to a shady tree, where we slept four hours.</p>

<p>In the afternoon everyone was fresh, and the Juheina began to
match their camels against one another. At first it was two and
two, but the others joined, till they were six abreast. The road
was bad, and finally, one lad cantered his animal into a heap of
stones. She slipped, so that he crashed off and broke an arm. It
was a misfortune: but Mohammed coolly tied him up with rags and
camel-girths, and left him at ease under a tree to rest a little
before riding back to Ugila for the night. The Arabs were casual
about broken bones. In a tent at Wadi Ais I had seen a youth whose
forearm had set crookedly; realizing this, he had dug into himself
with a dagger till he had bared the bone, re-broken it, and set it
straight; and there he lay, philosophically enduring the flies,
with his left forearm huge under healing mosses and clay, waiting
for it to be well.</p>

<p>In the morning we pushed on to Khauthila, a well, where we
watered the camels. The water was impure and purged them. We rode
again in the evening for another eight miles, intending to race
straight through to Wejh in a long last day. So we got up soon
after midnight, and before daylight were coming down the long slope
from Raal into the plain, which extended across the mouths of Hamdh
into the sea. The ground was scarred with motor tracks, exciting a
lively ambition in the Juheina to hurry on and see the new wonders
of Feisal's army. Fired by this, we did a straight march of eight
hours, unusually long for these Hejaz Bedouin.</p>

<p>We were then reasonably tired, both men and camels, since we had
had no food after breakfast the day before. Therefore it seemed fit
to the boy Mohammed to run races. He jumped from his camel, took
off his clothes, and challenged us to race to the clump of thorns
up the slope in front, for a pound English. Everybody took the
offer, and the camels set off in a mob. The distance, about
three-quarters of a mile, uphill, over heavy sand, proved probably
more than Mohammed had bargained for. However, he showed surprising
strength and won, though by inches: then he promptly collapsed,
bleeding from mouth and nose. Some of our camels were good, and
they went their fastest when pitted against one another.</p>

<p>The air here was very hot and heavy for natives of the hills,
and I feared there might be consequences of Mohammed's exhaustion:
but after we had rested an hour and made him a cup of coffee he got
going again and did the six remaining hours into Wejh as cheerfully
as ever; continuing to play the little pranks which had brightened
our long march from Abu Markha. If one man rode quietly behind
another's camel, poked his stick suddenly up its rump, and
screeched, it mistook him for an excited male, and plunged off at a
mad gallop, very disconcerting to the rider. A second good game was
to cannon one galloping camel with another, and crash it into a
near tree. Either the tree went down (valley trees in the light
Hejaz soil were notably unstable things) or the rider was scratched
and torn; or, best of all, he was swept quite out of his saddle,
and left impaled on a thorny branch, if not dropped violently to
the ground. This counted as a bull, and was very popular with
everyone but him.</p>

<p>The Bedu were odd people. For an Englishman, sojourning with
them was unsatisfactory unless he had patience wide and deep as the
sea. They were absolute slaves of their appetite, with no stamina
of mind, drunkards for coffee, milk or water, gluttons for stewed
meat, shameless beggars of tobacco. They dreamed for weeks before
and after their rare sexual exercises, and spent the intervening
days titillating themselves and their hearers with bawdy tales. Had
the circumstances of their lives given them opportunity they would
have been sheer sensualists. Their strength was the strength of men
geographically beyond temptation: the poverty of Arabia made them
simple, continent, enduring. If forced into civilized life they
would have succumbed like any savage race to its diseases,
meanness, luxury, cruelty, crooked dealing, artifice; and, like
savages, they would have suffered them exaggeratedly for lack of
inoculation.</p>

<p>If they suspected that we wanted to drive them either they were
mulish or they went away. If we comprehended them, and gave time
and trouble to make things tempting to them, then they would go to
great pains for our pleasure. Whether the results achieved were
worth the effort, no man could tell. Englishmen, accustomed to
greater returns, would not, and, indeed, could not, have spent the
time, thought and tact lavished every day by sheikhs and emirs for
such meagre ends. Arab processes were clear, Arab minds moved
logically as our own, with nothing radically incomprehensible or
different, except the premiss: there was no excuse or reason,
except our laziness and ignorance, whereby we could call them
inscrutable or Oriental, or leave them misunderstood.</p>

<p>They would follow us, if we endured with them, and played the
game according to their rules. The pity was, that we often began to
do so, and broke down with exasperation and threw them over,
blaming them for what was a fault in our own selves. Such
strictures like a general's complaint of bad troops, were in
reality a confession of our faulty foresight, often made falsely
out of mock modesty to show that, though mistaken, we had at least
the wit to know our fault.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h3>

<p>Cleanliness made me stop outside Wejh and change my filthy
clothes. Feisal, when I reported, led me into the inner tent to
talk. It seemed that everything was well. More cars had arrived
from Egypt: Yenbo was emptied of its last soldiers and stores: and
Sharraf himself had come up, with an unexpected unit, a new
machine-gun company of amusing origin. We had left thirty sick and
wounded men in Yenbo when we marched away; also heaps of broken
weapons, with two British armourer-sergeants repairing them. The
sergeants, who found time hang heavily, had taken mended maxims and
patients and combined them into a machine-gun company so thoroughly
trained by dumb show that they were as good as the best we had.</p>

<p>Rabegh also was being abandoned. The aeroplanes from it had
flown up here and were established. Their Egyptian troops had been
shipped after them, with Joyce and Goslett and the Rabegh staff,
who were now in charge of things at Wejh. Newcombe and Hornby were
up country tearing at the railway day and night, almost with their
own hands for lack of helpers. The tribal propaganda was marching
forward: all was for the best, and I was about to take my leave
when Suleiman, the guest-master, hurried in and whispered to
Feisal, who turned to me with shining eyes, trying to be calm, and
said, 'Auda is here'. I shouted, 'Auda abu Tayi', and at that
moment the tent-flap was drawn back, before a deep voice which
boomed salutations to Our Lord, the Commander of the Faithful.
There entered a tall, strong figure, with a haggard face,
passionate and tragic. This was Auda, and after him followed
Mohammed, his son, a child in looks, and only eleven years old in
truth.</p>

<p>Feisal had sprung to his feet. Auda caught his hand and kissed
it, and they drew aside a pace or two and looked at each
other&mdash;a splendidly unlike pair, typical of much that was best
in Arabia, Feisal the prophet, and Auda the warrior, each filling
his part to perfection, and immediately understanding and liking
the other. They sat down. Feisal introduced us one by one, and Auda
with a measured word seemed to register each person.</p>

<p>We had heard much of Auda, and were banking to open Akaba with
his help; and after a moment I knew, from the force and directness
of the man, that we would attain our end. He had come down to us
like a knight-errant, chafing at our delay in Wejh, anxious only to
be acquiring merit for Arab freedom in his own lands. If his
performance was one-half his desire, we should be prosperous and
fortunate. The weight was off all minds before we went to
supper.</p>

<p>We were a cheerful party; Nasib, Faiz, Mohammed el Dheilan
Auda's politic cousin, Zaal his nephew, and Sherif Nasir, resting
in Wejh for a few days between expeditions. I told Feisal odd
stories of Abdulla's camp, and the joy of breaking railways.
Suddenly Auda scrambled to his feet with a loud 'God forbid', and
flung from the tent. We stared at one another, and there came a
noise of hammering outside. I went after to learn what it meant,
and there was Auda bent over a rock pounding his false teeth to
fragments with a stone. 'I had forgotten,' he explained, 'Jemal
Pasha gave me these. I was eating my Lord's bread with Turkish
teeth!' Unfortunately he had few teeth of his own, so that
henceforward eating the meat he loved was difficulty and
after-pain, and he went about half-nourished till we had taken
Akaba, and Sir Reginald Wingate sent him a dentist from Egypt to
make an Allied set.</p>

<p>Auda was very simply dressed, northern fashion, in white cotton
with a red Mosul head-cloth. He might be over fifty, and his black
hair was streaked with white; but he was still strong and straight,
loosely built, spare, and as active as a much younger man. His face
was magnificent in its lines and hollows. On it was written how
truly the death in battle of Annad, his favourite son, cast sorrow
over all his life when it ended his dream of handing on to future
generations the greatness of the name of Abu Tayi. He had large
eloquent eyes, like black velvet in richness. His forehead was low
and broad, his nose very high and sharp, powerfully hooked: his
mouth rather large and mobile: his beard and moustaches had been
trimmed to a point in Howeitat style, with the lower jaw shaven
underneath.</p>

<p>Centuries ago the Howeitat came from Hejaz, and their nomad
clans prided themselves on being true Bedu. Auda was their master
type. His hospitality was sweeping; except to very hungry souls,
inconvenient. His generosity kept him always poor, despite the
profits of a hundred raids. He had married twenty-eight times, had
been wounded thirteen times; whilst the battles he provoked had
seen all his tribesmen hurt and most of his relations killed. He
himself had slain seventy-five men, Arabs, with his own hand in
battle: and never a man except in battle. Of the number of dead
Turks he could give no account: they did not enter the register.
His Toweiha under him had become the first fighters of the desert,
with a tradition of desperate courage, a sense of superiority which
never left them while there was life and work to do: but which had
reduced them from twelve hundred men to less than five hundred, in
thirty years, as the standard of nomadic fighting rose.</p>

<p>Auda raided as often as he had opportunity, and as widely as he
could. He had seen Aleppo, Basra, Wejh, and Wadi Dawasir on his
expeditions: and was careful to be at enmity with nearly all tribes
in the desert, that he might have proper scope for raids. After his
robber-fashion, he was as hard-headed as he was hot-headed, and in
his maddest exploits there would be a cold factor of possibility to
lead him through. His patience in action was extreme: and he
received and ignored advice, criticism, or abuse, with a smile as
constant as it was very charming. If he got angry his face worked
uncontrollably, and he burst into a fit of shaking passion, only to
be assuaged after he had killed: at such times he was a wild beast,
and men escaped his presence. Nothing on earth would make him
change his mind or obey an order to do the least thing he
disapproved; and he took no heed of men's feelings when his face
was set.</p>

<p>He saw life as a saga. All the events in it were significant:
all personages in contact with him heroic. His mind was stored with
poems of old raids and epic tales of fights, and he overflowed with
them on the nearest listener. If he lacked listeners he would very
likely sing them to himself in his tremendous voice, deep and
resonant and loud. He had no control over his lips, and was
therefore terrible to his own interests and hurt his friends
continually. He spoke of himself in the third person, and was so
sure of his fame that he loved to shout out stories against
himself. At times he seemed taken by a demon of mischief, and in
public assembly would invent and utter on oath appalling tales of
the private life of his hosts or guests: and yet with all this he
was modest, as simple as a child, direct, honest, kind-hearted, and
warmly loved even by those to whom he was most
embarrassing&mdash;his friends.</p>

<p>Joyce lived near the beach, beside the spread lines of the
Egyptian troops, in an imposing array of large tents and small
tents, and we talked over things done or to do. Every effort was
still directed against the railway. Newcombe and Garland were near
Muadhdham with Sherif Sharraf and Maulud. They had many Billi, the
mule-mounted infantry, and guns and machine-guns, and hoped to take
the fort and railway station there. Newcombe meant then to move ahl
Feisal's men forward very close to Medain Salih, and, by taking and
holding a part of the line, to cut off Medina and compel its early
surrender. Wilson was coming up to help in this operation, and
Davenport would take as many of the Egyptian army as he could
transport, to reinforce the Arab attack.</p>

<p>All this programme was what I had believed necessary for the
further progress of the Arab Revolt when we took Wejh. I had
planned and arranged some of it myself. But now, since that happy
fever and dysentery in Abdulla's camp had given me leisure to
meditate upon the strategy and tactics of irregular war, it seemed
that not merely the details but the essence of this plan were
wrong. It therefore became my business to explain my changed ideas,
and if possible to persuade my chiefs to follow me into the new
theory.</p>

<p>So I began with three propositions. Firstly, that irregulars
would not attack places, and so remained incapable of forcing a
decision. Secondly, that they were as unable to defend a line or
point as they were to attack it. Thirdly, that their virtue lay in
depth, not in face.</p>

<p>The Arab war was geographical, and the Turkish Army an accident.
Our aim was to seek the enemy's weakest material link and bear only
on that till time made their whole length fail. Our largest
resources, the Beduin on whom our war must be built, were unused to
formal operations, but had assets of mobility, toughness,
self-assurance, knowledge of the country, intelligent courage. With
them dispersal was strength. Consequently we must extend our front
to its maximum, to impose on the Turks the longest possible passive
defence, since that was, materially, their most costly form of
war.</p>

<p>Our duty was to attain our end with the greatest economy of
life, since life was more precious to us than money or time. If we
were patient and superhuman-skilled, we could follow the direction
of Saxe and reach victory without battle, by pressing our
advantages mathematical and psychological. Fortunately our physical
weakness was not such as to demand this. We were richer than the
Turks in transport, machine-guns, cars, high explosive. We could
develop a highly mobile, highly equipped striking force of the
smallest size, and use it successively at distributed points of the
Turkish line, to make them strengthen their posts beyond the
defensive minimum of twenty men. This would be a short cut to
success.</p>

<p>We must not take Medina. The Turk was harmless there. In prison
in Egypt he would cost us food and guards. We wanted him to stay at
Medina, and every other distant place, in the largest numbers. Our
ideal was to keep his railway just working, but only just, with the
maximum of loss and discomfort. The factor of food would confine
him to the railways, but he was welcome to the Hejaz Railway, and
the Trans-Jordan railway, and the Palestine and Syrian railways for
the duration of the war, so long as he gave us the other nine
hundred and ninety-nine thousandths of the Arab world. If he tended
to evacuate too soon, as a step to concentrating in the small area
which his numbers could dominate effectually, then we should have
to restore his confidence by reducing our enterprises against him.
His stupidity would be our ally, for he would like to hold, or to
think he held, as much of his old provinces as possible. This pride
in his imperial heritage would keep him in his present absurd
position&mdash;all flanks and no front.</p>

<p>In detail I criticized the ruling scheme. To hold a middle point
of the railway would be expensive for the holding force might be
threatened from each side. The mixture of Egyptian troops with
tribesmen was a moral weakness. If there were professional soldiers
present, the Beduin would stand aside and watch them work, glad to
be excused the leading part. Jealousy, superadded to inefficiency,
would be the outcome. Further, the Billi country was very dry, and
the maintenance of a large force up by the line technically
difficult.</p>

<p>Neither my general reasoning, however, nor my particular
objections had much weight. The plans were made, and the
preparations advanced. Everyone was too busy with his own work to
give me specific authority to launch out on mine. All I gained was
a hearing, and a qualified admission that my counter-offensive
might be a useful diversion. I was working out with Auda abu Tayi a
march to the Howeitat in their spring pastures of the Syrian
desert. From them we might raise a mobile camel force, and rush
Akaba from the eastward without guns or machine-guns.</p>

<p>The eastern was the unguarded side, the line of least
resistance, the easiest for us. Our march would be an extreme
example of a turning movement, since it involved a desert journey
of six hundred miles to capture a trench within gunfire of our
ships: but there was no practicable alternative, and it was so
entirely in the spirit of my sick-bed ruminations that its issue
might well be fortunate, and would surely be instructive. Auda
thought all things possible with dynamite and money, and that the
smaller clans about Akaba would join us. Feisal, who was already in
touch with them, also believed that they would help if we won a
preliminary success up by Maan and then moved in force against the
port. The Navy raided it while we were thinking, and their captured
Turks gave us such useful information that I became eager to go off
at once.</p>

<p>The desert route to Akaba was so long and so difficult that we
could take neither guns nor machine-guns, nor stores nor regular
soldiers. Accordingly the element I would withdraw from the railway
scheme was only my single self; and, in the circumstances, this
amount was negligible, since I felt so strongly against it that my
help there would have been half-hearted. So I decided to go my own
way, with or without orders. I wrote a letter full of apologies to
Clayton, telling him that my intentions were of the best: and
went.</p>

<h3>CHAPTERS XXXIX TO LIV</h3>

<blockquote><i>The port of Akaba was naturally so strong that it
could be taken only by surprise from inland: but the opportune
adherence to Feisal of Auda Abu Tayi made us hope to enrol enough
tribesmen in the eastern desert for such a descent upon the
coast.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Nasir, Auda, and I set off together on the long ride. Hitherto
Feisal had been the public leader: but his remaining in Wejh threw
the ungrateful load of this northern expedition upon myself. I
accepted it and its dishonest implication as our only means of
victory. We tricked the Turks and entered Akaba with good
fortune.</i>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX</h3>

<p>By May the ninth all things were ready, and in the glare of
mid-afternoon we left Feisal's tent, his good wishes sounding after
us from the hill-top as we marched away. Sherif Nasir led us: his
lucent goodness, which provoked answering devotion even from the
depraved, made him the only leader (and a benediction) for forlorn
hopes. When we broke our wishes to him he had sighed a little, for
he was body-weary after months of vanguard-service, and mind-weary
too, with the passing of youth's careless years. He feared his
maturity as it grew upon him, with its ripe thought, its skill, its
finished art; yet which lacked the poetry of boyhood to make living
a full end of life. Physically, he was young yet: but his changeful
and mortal soul was ageing quicker than his body-going to die
before it, like most of ours.</p>

<p>Our short stage was to the fort of Sebeil, inland Wejh, where
the Egyptian pilgrims used to water. We camped by their great brick
tank, in shade of the fort's curtain-wall, or of the palms, and put
to rights the deficiencies which this first march had shown. Auda
and his kinsmen were with us; also Nesib el Bekri, the politic
Damascene, to represent Feisal to the villagers of Syria. Nesib had
brains and position, and the character of a previous, successful,
desert-journey: his cheerful endurance of adventure, rare among
Syrians, marked him out as our fellow, as much as his political
mind, his ability, his persuasive good-humoured eloquence, and the
patriotism which often overcame his native passion for the
indirect. Nesib chose Zeki, a Syrian officer, as his companion. For
escort we had thirty-five Ageyl, under ibn Dgheithir, a man walled
into his own temperament: remote, abstracted, self-sufficient.
Feisal made up a purse of twenty thousand pounds in gold&mdash;all
he could afford and more than we asked for&mdash;to pay the wages
of the new men we hoped to enrol, and to make such advances as
should stimulate the Howeitat to swiftness.</p>

<p>This inconvenient load of four hundredweight of gold we shared
out between us, against the chance of accident upon the road.
Sheikh Yusuf, now back in charge of supply, gave us each a half-bag
of flour, whose forty-five pounds were reckoned a man's pinched
ration for six weeks. This went slung on the riding-saddle, and
Nasir took enough on baggage camels to distribute a further
fourteen pounds per man when we had marched the first fortnight,
and had eaten room for it in our bags.</p>

<p>We had a little spare ammunition and some spare rifles as
presents; and loaded six camels with light packs of blasting
gelatine for rails or trains or bridges in the north. Nasir, a
great Emir in his own place, also carried a good tent in which to
receive visitors, and a camel load of rice for their entertainment:
but the last we ate between us with huge comfort, as the unrelieved
dietary of water&mdash;bread and water, week after week, grew
uninspiring. Being beginners in this style of travelling, we did
not know that dry flour, the lightest food, was therefore the best
for a long journey. Six months later neither Nasir nor myself
wasted transport and trouble on the rice-luxury.</p>

<p>My Ageyl&mdash;Mukheymer, Merjan, Ali&mdash;had been
supplemented by Mohammed, a blowsy obedient peasant boy from some
village in Hauran, and by Gasim, of Maan, a fanged and yellow-faced
outlaw, who fled into the desert to the Howeitat, after killing a
Turkish official in a dispute over cattle tax. Crimes against
tax-gatherers had a sympathetic aspect for all of us, and this gave
Gasim a specious rumour of geniality, which actually was far from
truth.</p>

<p>We seemed a small party to win a new province, and so apparently
others thought; for presently Lamotte, Bremond's representative
with Feisal, rode up to take a farewell photograph of us. A little
later Yusuf arrived, with the good doctor, and Shefik, and Nesib's
brothers, to wish us success on our march. We joined in a spacious
evening meal, whose materials the prudent Yusuf had brought with
him. His not-slender heart perhaps misgave him at the notion of a
bread supper: or was it the beautiful desire to give us a last
feast before we were lost in the wilderness of pain and evil
refreshment?</p>

<p>After they had gone we loaded up, and started before midnight on
another stage of our journey to the oasis of Kurr. Nasir, our
guide, had grown to know this country nearly as well as he did his
own.</p>

<p>While we rode through the moonlit and starry night, his memory
was dwelling very intimately about his home. He told me of their
stone-paved house whose sunk halls had vaulted roofs against the
summer heat, and of the gardens planted with every kind of fruit
tree, in shady paths about which they could walk at ease, mindless
of the sun. He told me of the wheel over the well, with its
machinery of leathern trip-buckets, raised by oxen upon an inclined
path of hard-trodden earth; and of how the water from its reservoir
slid in concrete channels by the borders of the paths; or worked
fountains in the court beside the great vine-trellised swimming
tank, lined with shining cement, within whose green depth he and
his brother's household used to plunge at midday.</p>

<p>Nasir, though usually merry, had a quick vein of suffering in
him, and to-night he was wondering why he, an Emir of Medina, rich
and powerful and at rest in that garden-palace, had thrown up all
to become the weak leader of desperate adventures in the desert.
For two years he had been outcast, always fighting beyond the front
line of Feisal's armies, chosen for every particular hazard, the
pioneer in each advance; and, meanwhile, the Turks were in his
house, wasting his fruit trees and chopping down his palms. Even,
he said, the great well, which had sounded with the creak of the
bullock wheels for six hundred years, had fallen silent; the
garden, cracked with heat, was becoming waste as the bund hills
over which we rode.</p>

<p>After four hours' march we slept for two, and rose with the sun.
The baggage camels, weak with the cursed mange of Wejh, moved
slowly, grazing all day as they went. We riders, light-mounted,
might have passed them easily; but Auda, who was regulating our
marches, forbade, because of the difficulties in front, for which
our animals would need all the fitness we could conserve in them.
So we plodded soberly on for six hours in great heat. The summer
sun in this country of white sand behind Wejh could dazzle the eyes
cruelly, and the bare rocks each side our path threw off waves of
heat which made our heads ache and swim. Consequently, by eleven of
the forenoon we were mutinous against Auda's wish still to hold on.
So we halted and lay under trees till half-past two, each of us
trying to make a solid, though shifting shadow for himself by means
of a doubled blanket caught across the thorns of overhanging
boughs.</p>

<p>We rode again, after this break, for three gentle hours over
level bottoms, approaching the walls of a great valley; and found
the green garden of El Kurr lying just in front of us. White tents
peeped from among the palms. While we dismounted, Rasim and
Abdulla, Mahmud, the doctor, and even old Maulud, the cavalryman,
came out to welcome us. They told us that Sherif Sharraf, whom we
wished to meet at Abu Raga, our next stopping place, was away
raiding for a few days. This meant that there was no hurry, so we
made holiday at El Kurr for two nights.</p>

<p><b>Auda Abu Tayi</b>

<p>It contented me: for the trouble of boils and fever which had
shackled me in Wadi Ais had come afresh, more strongly, making each
journey a pain, and each rest a blessed relaxation of my will
strong to go on&mdash;a chance to add patience to a scant reserve.
So I lay still, and received into my mind the sense of peace, the
greenness and the presence of water which made this garden in the
desert beautiful and haunting, as though pre-visited. Or was it
merely that long ago we had seen fresh grass growing in the
spring?</p>

<p>The inhabitant of Kurr, the only sedentary Belluwi, hoary
Dhaif-Allah, laboured day and night with his daughters in the
little terraced plot which he had received from his ancestors. It
was built out of the south edge of the valley in a bay defended
against flood by a massive wall of unhewn stone. In its midst
opened the well of clear cold water, above which stood a
balance-cantilever of mud and rude poles. By this Dhaif-Allah,
morning and evening when the sun was low, drew up great bowls of
water and spilled them into clay runnels contrived through his
garden among the tree roots. He grew low palms, for their spreading
leaves shaded his plants from the sun which otherwise might in that
stark valley wither them, and raised young tobacco (his most
profitable crop); with smaller plots of beans and melons, cucumbers
and egg-plants, in due season.</p>

<p>The old man lived with his women in a brushwood hut beside the
well, and was scornful of our politics, demanding what more to eat
or drink these sore efforts and bloody sacrifices would bring. We
gently teased him with notions of liberty; with freedom of the Arab
countries for the Arabs. 'This Garden, Dhaif-Allah, should it not
be your very own?' However, he would not understand, but stood up
to strike himself proudly on the chest, crying, 'I&mdash;I am
Kurr'.</p>

<p>He was free and wanted nothing for others; and only his garden
for himself. Nor did he see why others should not become rich in a
like frugality. His felt skull-cap, greased with sweat to the
colour and consistence of lead, he boasted had been his
grandfather's, bought when Ibrahim Pasha was in Wejh a century
before: his other necessary garment was a shirt, and annually, with
his tobacco, he would buy the shirt of the new year for himself;
one for each of his daughters, and one for the old woman&mdash;his
wife.</p>

<p>Still we were grateful to him, for, besides that he showed an
example of contentment to us slaves of unnecessary appetite, he
sold vegetables and on them, and on the tinned bounty of Rasim and
Abdulla and Mahmud, we lived richly. Each evening round the fires
they had music, not the monotonous open-throated roaring of the
tribes, nor the exciting harmony of the Ageyl, but the falsetto
quarter tones and trills of urban Syria. Maulud had musicians in
his unit; and bashful soldiers were brought up each evening to play
guitars and sing cafe songs of Damascus or the love verses of their
villages. In Abdulla's tent, where I was lodged, distance, the
ripple of the fragrant out-pouring water, and the tree-leaves
softened the music, so that it became dully pleasant to the
ear.</p>

<p>Often, too, Nesib el Bekri would take out his manuscript of the
songs of Selim el Jezairi, that fierce unscrupulous revolutionary
who, in his leisure moments between campaigns, the Staff College,
and the bloody missions he fulfilled for the Young Turks, his
masters, had made up verses in the common speech of the people
about the freedom which was coming to his race. Nesib and his
friends had a swaying rhythm in which they would chant these songs,
putting all hope and passion into the words, their pale Damascus
faces moon-large in the firelight, sweating. The soldier camp would
grow dead silent till the stanza ended, and then from every man
would come a sighing, longing echo of the last note. Only old
Dhaif-Allah went on splashing out his water, sure that after we had
finished with our silliness someone would yet need and buy his
greenstuff.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XL</h3>

<p>To townsmen this garden was a memory of the world before we went
mad with war and drove ourselves into the desert: to Auda there was
an indecency of exhibition in the plant-richness, and he longed for
an empty view. So we cut short our second night in paradise, and at
two in the morning went on up the valley. It was pitch dark, the
very stars in the sky being unable to cast light into the depths
where we were wandering. To-night Auda was guide, and to make us
sure of him he lifted up his voice in an interminable Tio, ho, ho'
song of the Howeitat; an epic chanted on three bass notes, up and
down, back and forward, in so round a voice that the words were
indistinguishable. After a little we thanked him for the singing,
since the path went away to the left, and our long line followed
his turn by the echoes of his voice rolling about the torn black
cliffs in the moonlight.</p>

<p>On this long journey Sherif Nasir and Auda's sour-smiling
cousin, Mohammed el Dheilan, took pains with my Arabic, giving me
by turn lessons in the classical Medina tongue, and in the vivid
desert language. At the beginning my Arabic had been a halting
command of the tribal dialects of the Middle Euphrates (a not
impure form), but now it became a fluent mingling of Hejaz slang
and north-tribal poetry with household words and phrases from the
limpid Nejdi, and book forms from Syria. The fluency had a lack of
grammar, which made my talk a perpetual adventure for my hearers.
Newcomers imagined I must be the native of some unknown illiterate
district; a shot-rubbish ground of disjected Arabic parts of
speech.</p>

<p>However, as yet I understood not three words of Auda's, and
after half an hour his chant tired me, while the old moon climbed
slowly up the sky, sailed over the topmost hills and threw a
deceitful light, less sure than darkness, into our valley. We
marched until the early sun, very trying to those who had ridden
all night, opposed us.</p>

<p>Breakfast was off our own flour, thus lightening at last, after
days of hospitality, our poor camels' food-load. Sharraf being not
yet in Abu Raga, we made no more of haste than water-difficulties
compelled; and, after food, again put up our blanket roofs and lay
till afternoon, fretfully dodging after their unstable shadow,
getting moist with heat and the constant pricking of flies.</p>

<p>At last Nasir gave the marching signal, and we went on up the
defile, with slightly pompous hills each side, for four hours; when
we agreed to camp again in the valley bed. There was abundant
brushwood for fuel; and up the cliff on our right were rock-pools
of fresh water, which gave us a delicious drink. Nasir was wrought
up; he commanded rice for supper, and the friends to feed with
us.</p>

<p>Our rule of march was odd and elaborate. Nasir, Auda, and Nesib
were so many separate, punctilious houses, admitting the supremacy
of Nasir only because I lived with him as a guest and furnished
them with the example of respect. Each required to be consulted on
the details of our going, and where and when we should halt. This
was inevitable with Auda, a child of battle who had never known a
master, since, as a tiny boy, he had first ridden his own camel. It
was advisable with Nesib, a Syrian of the queasy Syrian race;
jealous; hostile to merit, or to its acknowledgement.</p>

<p>Such people demanded a war-cry and banner from outside to
combine them, and a stranger to lead them, one whose supremacy
should be based on an idea: illogical, undeniable, discriminant:
which instinct might accept and reason find no rational basis to
reject or approve. For this army of Feisal's the conceit was that
an Emir of Mecca, a descendant of the prophet, a Sherif, was an
otherworldly dignitary whom sons of Adam might reverence without
shame. This was the binding assumption of the Arab movement; it was
this which gave it an effective, if imbecile unanimity.</p>

<p>In the morning we rode at five. Our valley pinched together, and
we went round a sharp spur, ascending steeply. The track became a
bad goat-path, zigzagging up a hill-side too precipitous to climb
except on all fours. We dropped off our camels and led them by the
head-stalls. Soon we had to help each other, a man urging the
camels from behind, another pulling them from the front,
encouraging them over the worst places, adjusting their loads to
ease them.</p>

<p>Parts of the track were dangerous, where rocks bulged out and
narrowed it, so that the near half of the load grazed and forced
the animal to the cliff-edge. We had to re-pack the food and
explosives; and, in spite of all our care, lost two of our feeble
camels in the pass. The Howeitat killed them where they lay broken,
stabbing a keen dagger into the throat-artery near the chest, while
the neck was strained tight by pulling the head round to the
saddle. They were at once cut up and shared out as meat.</p>

<p>The head of the pass we were glad to find not a range but a
spacious plateau which sloped slowly before us to the east. The
first yards were rough and rocky, overgrown with low mats of thorns
like ling; but afterwards we came to a valley of white shingle, in
whose bed a Beduin woman was filling her water-skin with a copper
cup, ladling milky water, quite pure and sweet, from a little hole
a foot wide, scraped elbow deep in the pebbles. This was Abu Saad,
and for its name's sake and for its water, and the joints of red
meat bumping on our saddles, we settled we would stay here one
night, filling up yet more of the time which must be filled before
Sharraf came back from his expedition against the railway.</p>

<p>So we rode on four more miles, to camp under spreading trees, in
close-grown thickets of thorn-scrub, hollow underneath like booths.
By day these made tent-ribs for our blankets stretched against the
masterful sun. At night they were bowers for our sleeping-places.
We had learned to sleep with nothing overhead but moon and stars,
and nothing either side to keep distant the winds and noises of the
night; and by contrast it was strange, but quieting, to rest within
walls, with a roof above; even though walls and roof were only
interlacing twigs making a darker mesh against the star-scattered
sky.</p>

<p>For myself, I was ill again; a fever increasing upon me, and my
body very sore with boils and the rubbing of my sweaty saddle. When
Nasir, without my prompting, had halted at the half-stage, I turned
and thanked him warmly, to his astonishment. We were now on the
limestone of the Shefa crest. Before us lay a great dark
lava-field, and short of it a range of red and black banded
sandstone cliffs with conical tops. The air on the high tableland
was not so warm; and morning and evening there blew across us a
free current which was refreshing after the suspended stillness of
the valleys.</p>

<p>We breakfasted on our camel meat, and started more gaily the
next morning down a gently-falling plateau of red sandstone. Then
we came to the first break of surface, a sharp passage to the
bottom of a shrub-grown, sandy valley, on each side of which
sandstone precipices and pinnacles, gradually growing in height as
we went down, detached themselves sharply against the morning sky.
It was shadowed in the bottom, and the air tasted wet and decayed,
as though sap was drying out into it. The edges of the cliffs about
us were clipped strangely, like fantastic parapets. We wound on,
ever deeper into the earth until, half an hour later, by a sharp
corner we entered Wadi Jizil, the main gutter of these sandstone
regions, whose end we had seen near Hedia.</p>

<p>Jizil was a deep gorge some two hundred yards in width, full of
tamarisk sprouting from the bed of drifted sand, as well as from
the soft twenty-foot banks, heaped up wherever an eddy in flood or
wind had laid the heavier dust under the returns of cliffs. The
walls each side were of regular bands of sandstone, streaked red in
many shades. The union of dark cliffs, pink floors, and pale green
shrubbery was beautiful to eyes sated with months of sunlight and
sooty shadow. When evening came, the declining sun crimsoned one
side of the valley with its glow, leaving the other in purple
gloom.</p>

<p>Our camp was on some swelling dunes of weedy sand in an elbow of
the valley, where a narrow cleft had set up a back-wash and scooped
out a basin in which a brackish remnant of last winter's flood was
caught. We sent a man for news up the valley to an oleander thicket
where we saw the white peaks of Sharraf's tents. They expected him
next day; so we passed two nights in this strange-coloured, echoing
place. The brackish pool was fit for our camels, and in it we
bathed at noon. Then we ate and slept generously, and wandered in
the nearer valleys to see the horizontal stripes of pink and brown
and cream and red which made up the general redness of the cliffs,
delighting in the varied patterns of thin pencillings of lighter or
darker tint which were drawn over the plain body of rock. One
afternoon I spent behind some shepherd's fold of sandstone blocks
in warm soft air and sunlight, with a low burden of the wind
plucking at the rough wall-top above my head. The valley was
instinct with peace, and the wind's continuing noise made even it
seem patient.</p>

<p>My eyes were shut and I was dreaming, when a youthful voice made
me see an anxious Ageyli, a stranger, Daud, squatting by me. He
appealed for my compassion. His friend Farraj had burned their tent
in a frolic, and Saad, captain of Sharraf's Ageyl was going to beat
him in punishment. At my intercession he would be released. Saad
happened, just then, to visit me, and I put it to him, while Daud
sat watching us, his mouth slightly, eagerly, open; his eyelids
narrowed over large, dark eyes, and his straight brows furrowed
with anxiety. Daud's pupils, set a little in from the centre of the
eyeball, gave him an air of acute readiness.</p>

<p>Saad's reply was not comforting. The pair were always in
trouble, and of late so outrageous in their tricks that Sharraf,
the severe, had ordered an example to be made of them. All he could
do for my sake was to let Daud share the ordained sentence. Daud
leaped at the chance, kissed my hand and Saad's and ran off up the
valley; while Saad, laughing, told me stories of the famous pair.
They were an instance of the eastern boy and boy affection which
the segregation of women made inevitable. Such friendships often
led to manly loves of a depth and force beyond our flesh-steeped
conceit. When innocent they were hot and unashamed. If sexuality
entered, they passed into a give and take, unspiritual relation,
like marriage.</p>

<p>Next day Sharraf did not come. Our morning passed with Auda
talking of the march in front, while Nasir with forefinger and
thumb flicked sputtering matches from the box across his tent at
us. In the midst of our merriment two bent figures, with pain in
their eyes, but crooked smiles upon their lips, hobbled up and
saluted. These were Daud the hasty and his love-fellow, Farraj; a
beautiful, soft-framed, girlish creature, with innocent, smooth
face and swimming eyes. They said they were for my service. I had
no need of them; and objected that after their beating they could
not ride. They replied they had now come bare-backed. I said I was
a simple man who disliked servants about him. Daud turned away,
defeated and angry; but Farraj pleaded that we must have men, and
they would follow me for company and out of gratitude. While the
harder Daud revolted, he went over to Nasir and knelt in appeal,
all the woman of him evident in his longing. At the end, on Nasir's
advice, I took them both, mainly because they looked so young and
clean.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLI</h3>

<p>Sharraf delayed to come until the third morning, but then we
heard him loudly, for the Arabs of his raiding force fired slow
volleys of shots into the air, and the echoes were thrown about the
windings of the valley till even the barren hills seemed to join in
the salute. We dressed in our cleanest to go and call on him. Auda
wore the splendours he had bought at Wejh: a mouse-coloured
greatcoat of broadcloth with velvet collar, and yellow
elastic-sided boots: these below his streaming hair and ruined face
of a tired tragedian! Sharraf was kind to us, for he had captured
prisoners on the line and blown up rails and a culvert. One piece
of his news was that in Wadi Diraa, on our road, were pools of
rain-water, new fallen and sweet. This would shorten our waterless
march to Fejr by fifty miles, and remove its danger of thirst; a
great benefit, for our total water carriage came to about twenty
gallons, for fifty men; too slender a margin of safety.</p>

<p>Next day we left Abu Raga near mid-afternoon, not sorry, for
this beautiful place had been unhealthy for us and fever had
bothered us during our three days in its confined bed. Auda led us
up a tributary valley which soon widened into the plain of the
Shegg&mdash;a sand flat. About it, in scattered confusion, sat
small islands and pinnacles of red sandstone, grouped like seracs,
wind-eroded at the bases till they looked very fit to fall and
block the road; which wound in and out between them, through
narrows seeming to give no passage, but always opening into another
bay of blind alleys. Through this maze Auda led unhesitatingly;
digging along on his camel, elbows out, hands poised swaying in the
air by his shoulders.</p>

<p>There were no footmarks on the ground, for each wind swept like
a great brush over the sand surface, stippling the traces of the
last travellers till the surface was again a pattern of innumerable
tiny virgin waves. Only the dried camel droppings, which were
lighter than the sand and rounded like walnuts, escaped over its
ripples.</p>

<p>They rolled about, to be heaped in corners by the skirling
winds. It was perhaps by them, as much as by his unrivalled
road-sense, that Auda knew the way. For us, the rock shapes were
constant speculation and astonishment; their granular surfaces and
red colour and the curved chiselling of the sand-blast upon them
softened the sunlight, to give our streaming eyes relief.</p>

<p>In the mid-march we perceived five or six riders coming from the
railway. I was in front with Auda, and we had that delicious
thrill: fiend or enemy?' of meeting strangers in the desert, whilst
we circumspectly drew across to the vantage side which kept the
rifle-arm free for a snap shot; but when they came nearer we saw
they were of the Arab forces. The first, riding loosely on a
hulking camel, with the unwieldy Manchester-made timber saddle of
the British Camel Corps, was a fair-haired, shaggy-bearded
Englishman in tattered uniform. This we guessed must be Hornby,
Newcombe's pupil, the wild engineer who vied with him in smashing
the railway. After we had exchanged greetings, on this our first
meeting, he told me that Newcombe had lately gone to Wejh to talk
over his difficulties with Feisal and make fresh plans to meet
them.</p>

<p>Newcombe had constant difficulties owing to excess of zeal, and
his habit of doing four times more than any other Englishman would
do; ten times what the Arabs thought needful or wise. Hornby spoke
little Arabic; and Newcombe not enough to persuade, though enough
to give orders; but orders were not in place inland. The persistent
pair would cling for weeks to the railway edge, almost without
helpers, often without food, till they had exhausted either
explosives or camels and had to return for more. The barrenness of
the hills made their trips hungry for camels, and they wore out
Feisal's best animals in turn. In this Newcombe was chief sinner,
for his journeys were done at the trot; also, as a surveyor, he
could not resist a look from each high hill over the country he
crossed, to the exasperation of his escort who must either leave
him to his own courses (a lasting disgrace to abandon a companion
of the road), or founder their own precious and irreplaceable
camels in keeping pace with him. 'Newcombe is like fire,' they used
to complain; Tie burns friend and enemy'; and they admired his
amazing energy with nervous shrinking lest they should be his next
friendly victims.</p>

<p>Arabs told me Newcombe would not sleep except head on rails, and
that Hornby would worry the metals with his teeth when gun-cotton
failed. These were legends, but behind them lay a sense of their
joint insatiate savagery in destroying till there was no more to
destroy. Four Turkish labour battalions they kept busy, patching
culverts, relaying sleepers, jointing new rails; and gun-cotton had
to come in increasing tons to Wejh to meet their appetites. They
were wonderful, but their too-great excellence discouraged our
feeble teams, making them ashamed to exhibit their inferior talent:
so Newcombe and Hornby remained as individualists, barren of the
seven-fold fruits of imitation.</p>

<p>At sunset we reached the northern limit of the ruined sandstone
land, and rode up to a new level, sixty feet higher than the old,
blue-black and volcanic, with a scattered covering of worn
basalt-blocks, small as a man's hand, neatly bedded like cobble
paving over a floor of fine, hard, black cinder-debris of
themselves. The rain in its long pelting seemed to have been the
agent of these stony surfaces by washing away the lighter dust from
above and between, till the stones, set closely side by side and as
level as a carpet, covered all the face of the plain and shielded
from direct contact with weather the salty mud which filled the
interstices of the lava flow beneath. It grew easier going, and
Auda ventured to carry on after the light had failed, marching upon
the Polar Star.</p>

<p>It was very dark; a pure night enough, but the black stone
underfoot swallowed the light of the stars, and at seven o'clock,
when at last we halted, only four of our party were with us. We had
reached a gentle valley, with a yet damp, soft, sandy bed, full of
thorny brushwood, unhappily useless as camel food. We ran about
tearing up these bitter bushes by the roots and heaping them in a
great pyre, which Auda lit. When the fire grew hot a long black
snake wormed slowly out into our group; we must have gathered it,
torpid, with the twigs. The flames went shining across the dark
flat, a beacon to the heavy camels which had lagged so much to-day
that it was two hours before the last group arrived, the men
singing their loudest, partly to encourage themselves and their
hungry animals over the ghostly plain, partly so that we might know
them friends. We wished their slowness slower, because of our warm
fire. In the night some of our camels strayed and our people had to
go looking for them so long, that it was nearly eight o'clock, and
we had baked bread and eaten, before again we started. Our track
lay across more lava-field, but to our morning strength the stones
seemed rarer, and waves or hard surfaces of laid sand often drowned
them smoothly with a covering as good to march on as a tennis
court. We rode fast over this for six or seven miles, and then
turned west of a low cinder-crater across the flat, dark, stony
watershed which divided Jizil from the basin in which the railway
ran. These great water systems up here at their springing were
shallow, sandy beds, scoring involved yellow lines across the
blue-black plain. From our height the lie of the land was patent
for miles, with the main features coloured in layers, like a
map.</p>

<p>We marched steadily till noon, and then sat out on the bare
ground till three; an uneasy halt made necessary by our fear that
the dejected camels, so long accustomed only to the sandy tracks of
the coastal plain, might have their soft feet scorched by the
sun-baked stones, and go lame with us on the road. After we
mounted, the going became worse, and we had continually to avoid
large fields of piled basalt, or deep yellow watercourses which cut
through the crust into the soft stone beneath. After a while red
sandstone again cropped out in crazy chimneys, from which the
harder layers projected knife-sharp in level shelves beyond the
soft, crumbling rock. At last these sandstone ruins became
plentiful, in the manner of yesterday, and stood grouped about our
road in similar chequered yards of light and shade. Again we
marvelled at the sureness with which Auda guided our little party
through the mazy rocks.</p>

<p>They passed, and we re-entered volcanic ground. Little pimply
craters stood about, often two or three together, and from them
spines of high, broken basalt led down like disordered causeways
across the barren ridges; but these craters looked old, not sharp
and well-kept like those of Ras Gara, near Wadi Ais, but worn and
degraded, sometimes nearly to surface level by a great bay broken
into their central hollow. The basalt which ran out from them was a
coarse bubbled rock, like Syrian dolerite. The sand-laden winds had
ground its exposed surfaces to a pitted smoothness like
orange-rind, and the sunlight had faded out its blue to a hopeless
grey.</p>

<p>Between craters the basalt was strewn in small tetrahedra, with
angles rubbed and rounded, stone tight to stone like tesseract upon
a bed of pink-yellow mud. The ways worn across such flats by the
constant passage of camels were very evident, since the slouching
tread had pushed the blocks to each side of the path, and the thin
mud of wet weather had run into these hollows and now inlaid them
palely against the blue. Less-used roads for hundreds of yards were
like narrow ladders across the stone-fields, for the tread of each
foot was filled in with clean yellow mud, and ridges or bars of the
blue-grey stone remained between each stepping place. After a
stretch of such stone-laying would be a field of jet-black basalt
cinders, firm as concrete in tie sun-baked mud, and afterwards a
valley of soft, black sand, with more crags of weathered sandstone
rising from the blackness, or from waves of the wind-blown red and
yellow grains of their own decay.</p>

<p>Nothing in the march was normal or reassuring. We felt we were
in an ominous land, incapable of life, hostile even to the passing
of life, except painfully along such sparse roads as time had laid
across its face. We were forced into a single file of weary camels,
picking a hesitant way step by step through the boulders for hour
after hour. At last Auda pointed ahead to a fifty-foot ridge of
large twisted blocks, lying coursed one upon the other as they had
writhed and shrunk in their cooling. There was the limit of lava;
and he and I rode on together and saw in front of us an open
rolling plain (Wadi Aish) of fine scrub and golden sand, with green
bushes scattered here and there. It held a very little water in
holes which someone had scooped after the rainstorm of three weeks
ago. We camped by them and drove our unladen camels out till
sunset, to graze for the first adequate time since Abu Raga.</p>

<p>While they were scattered over the land, mounted men appeared on
the horizon to the east, making towards the water. They came on too
quickly to be honest, and fired at our herdsmen; but the rest of us
ran at once upon the scattered reefs and knolls, shooting or
shouting. Hearing us so many they drew off as fast as their camels
would go; and from the ridge in the dusk we saw them, a bare dozen
in all, scampering away towards the line. We were glad to see them
avoid us so thoroughly. Auda thought they were a Shammar
patrol.</p>

<p>At dawn we saddled up for the short stage to Diraa, the water
pools of which Sharraf had told us. The first miles were through
the grateful sand and scrub of Wadi Aish, and afterwards we crossed
a simple lava flat. Then came a shallow valley, more full of
sandstone pillars and mushrooms and pinnacles than anywhere
yesterday. It was a mad country, of nine-pins from ten to sixty
feet in height. The sand-paths between them were wide enough for
one only, and our long column wound blindly through, seldom a dozen
of us having common sight at once. This ragged thicket of stone was
perhaps a third of a mile in width, and stretched like a red copse
to right and left across our path.</p>

<p>Beyond it a graded path over black ledges of rotten stone led us
to a plateau strewn with small, loose, blue-black basalt shards.
After a while we entered Wadi Diraa and marched down its bed for an
hour or more, sometimes over loose grey stone, sometimes along a
sandy bottom between low lips of rock. A deserted camp with empty
sardine tins gave proof of Newcombe and Hornby. Behind were the
limpid pools, and we halted there till afternoon; for we were now
quite near the railway, and had to drink our stomachs full and fill
our few water-skins, ready for the long dash to Fejr.</p>

<p>In the halt Auda came down to see Farraj and Daud dress my camel
with butter for relief against the intolerable itch of mange which
had broken out recently on its face. The dry pasturage of the Billi
country and the infected ground of Wejh had played havoc with our
beasts. In ahl Feisal's stud of riding-camels there was not one
healthy; in our little expedition every camel was weakening daily.
Nasir was full of anxiety lest many break down in the forced march
before us and leave their riders stranded in the desert.</p>

<p>We had no medicines for mange and could do little for it in
spite of our need. However, the rubbing and anointing did make my
animal more comfortable, and we repeated it as often as Farraj or
Daud could find butter in our party. These two boys were giving me
great satisfaction. They were brave and cheerful beyond the average
of Arab servant-kind. As their aches and pains wore off they showed
themselves active, good riders, and willing workmen. I liked their
freedom towards myself and admired their instinctive understanding
with one another against the demands of the world.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLII</h3>

<p>By a quarter to four we were in the saddle, going down Wadi
Diraa, into steep and high ridges of shifting sand, sometimes with
a cap of harsh red rock jutting from them. After a while, three or
four of us, in advance of the main body, climbed a sand-peak on
hands and knees to spy out the railway. There was no air, and the
exercise was more than we required; but our reward was immediate,
for the line showed itself quiet and deserted-looking, on a green
flat at the mouth of the deep valley down which the rest of the
company was marching circumspectly with ready weapons.</p>

<p>We checked the men at the bottom of their narrow sand-fold,
whilst we studied the railway. Everything was indeed peaceful and
empty, even to the abandoned blockhouse in a rich patch of rank
grass and weeds between us and the line. We ran to the edge of the
rock-shelf, leaped out from it into the fine dry sand, and rolled
down in a magnificent slide till we came to an abrupt and rather
bruising halt in the level ground beside the column. We mounted, to
hurry our camels out to the grazing, and leaving them there ran
over to the railway and shouted the others on.</p>

<p>This unmolested crossing was blessed, for Sharraf had warned us
seriously against the enemy patrols of mule-riding infantry and
camel corps, reinforced from the entrenched posts by infantry on
trolleys mounting machine-guns. Our riding-beasts we chased into
the grass to feed for a few minutes, while the heavy camels marched
over the valley, the line, and the farther flat, till sheltered in
the sand and rock mouths of the country beyond the railway.
Meanwhile the Ageyl amused us by fixing gun-cotton or gelatine
charges about our crossing-place to as many of the rails as we had
time to reach, and when our munching camels had been dragged away
into safety on the far side of the line, we began, in proper order,
to light the fuses, filling the hollow valley with the echoes of
repeated bursts.</p>

<p>Auda had not before known dynamite, and with a child's first
pleasure was moved to a rush of hasty poetry on its powerful glory.
We cut three telegraph wires, and fastened the free ends to the
saddles of six riding-camels of the Howeitat. The astonished team
struggled far into the eastern valleys with the growing weight of
twanging, tangling wire and the bursting poles dragging after them.
At last they could no longer move. So we cut them loose and rode
laughing after the caravan.</p>

<p>For five miles we proceeded in the growing dusk, between ridges
which seemed to run down like fingers from some knuckle in front of
us. At last their rise and fall became too sharp to be crossed with
safety by our weak animals in the dark, and we halted. The baggage
and the bulk of our riders were still ahead of us, keeping the
advantage they had gained while we played with the railway. In the
night we could not find them, for the Turks were shouting hard and
shooting at shadows from their stations on the line behind us; and
we judged it prudent to keep quiet ourselves, not lighting fires
nor sending up signals to attract attention.</p>

<p>However, ibn Dgheithir, in charge of the main body, had left a
connecting file behind, and so before we had fallen asleep, two men
came in to us, and reported that the rest were securely camped in
the hidden fold of a steep sand-bank a little further on. We threw
our saddle-bags again across our camels, and plodded after our
guides in the murky dark (to-night was almost the last night of the
moon) till we reached their hushed picket on the ridge, and bedded
ourselves down beside them without words.</p>

<p>In the morning Auda had us afoot before four, going uphill, till
at last we climbed a ridge, and plunged over, down a sand slope.
Into it our camels sank knee-deep, held upright despite themselves
by its clinging. They were able to make forward only by casting
themselves on and down its loose face, breaking their legs out of
it by their bodies' weight. At the bottom we found ourselves in the
head-courses of a valley, which trended towards the railway.
Another half-hour took us to the springing of this, and we breasted
the low edge of the plateau which was the watershed between Hejaz
and Sirhan. Ten yards more, and we were beyond the Red Sea slope of
Arabia, fairly embarked upon the mystery of its central
drainage.</p>

<p>Seemingly it was a plain, with an illimitable view downhill to
the east, where one gentle level after another slowly modulated
into a distance only to be called distance because it was a softer
blue, and more hazy. The rising sun flooded this falling plain with
a perfect level of light, throwing up long shadows of almost
imperceptible ridges, and the whole life and play of a complicated
ground-system&mdash;but a transient one; for, as we looked at it,
the shadows drew in towards the dawn, quivered a last moment behind
their mother-banks, and went out as though at a common signal. Full
morning had begun: the river of sunlight, sickeningly in the
full-face of us moving creatures, poured impartially on every stone
of the desert over which we had to go.</p>

<p>Auda struck out north-eastward, aiming for a little saddle which
joined the low ridge of Ugula to a lofty hill on the divide, to our
left or north about three miles away. We crossed the saddle after
four miles, and found beneath our feet little shallow runnels of
water-courses in the ground. Auda pointed to them, saying that they
ran to Nebk in Sirhan, and that we would follow their swelling bed
northward and eastward to the Howeitat in their summer camp.</p>

<p>A little later we were marching over a low ridge of slivers of
sandstone with the nature of slate, sometimes quite small, but
other times great slabs ten feet each way and, perhaps, four inches
thick. Auda ranged up beside my camel, and pointing with his
riding-stick told me to write down on my map the names and nature
of the land. The valleys on our left were the Seyal Abu Arad,
rising in Selhub, and fed by many successors from the great divide,
as it prolonged itself northward to Jebel Rufeiya by Tebuk. The
valleys on our right were the Siyul el Kelb, from Ugula, Agidat el
Jemelein, Lebda and the other ridges which bent round us in a
strung bow eastward and north-eastward carrying the great divide as
it were in a foray out across the plain. These two water systems
united fifty miles before us in Fejr, which was a tribe, its well,
and the valley of its well. I cried Auda mercy of his names,
swearing I was no writer-down of unspoiled countries, or pandar to
geographical curiosity; and the old man, much pleased, began to
tell me personal notes and news of the chiefs with us, and in front
upon our line of march. His prudent talk whiled away the slow
passage of abominable desolation.</p>

<p>The Fejr Bedouin, whose property it was, called our plain El
Houl because it was desolate; and to-day we rode in it without
seeing signs of life; no tracks of gazelle, no lizards, no
burrowing of rats, not even any birds. We, ourselves, felt tiny in
it, and our urgent progress across its immensity was a stillness or
immobility of futile effort. The only sounds were the hollow
echoes, like the shutting down of pavements over vaulted places, of
rotten stone slab on stone slab when they tilted under our camels'
feet; and the low but piercing rustle of the sand, as it crept
slowly westward before the hot wind along the worn sandstone, under
the harder overhanging caps which gave each reef its eroded,
rind-like shape.</p>

<p>It was a breathless wind, with the furnace taste sometimes known
in Egypt when a khamsin came; and, as the day went on and the sun
rose in the sky it grew stronger, more filled with the dust of the
Nefudh, the great sand desert of Northern Arabia, close by us over
there, but invisible through the haze. By noon it blew a half-gale,
so dry that our shrivelled lips cracked open, and the skin of our
faces chapped; while our eyelids, gone granular, seemed to creep
back and bare our shrinking eyes. The Arabs drew their head-clothes
tightly across their noses, and pulled the brow-folds forward like
vizors with only a narrow, loose-flapping slit of vision.</p>

<p>At this stifling price they kept their flesh unbroken, for they
feared the sand particles which would wear open the chaps into a
painful wound: but, for my own part, I always rather liked a
khamsin, since its torment seemed to fight against mankind with
ordered conscious malevolence, and it was pleasant to outface it so
directly, challenging its strength, and conquering its extremity.
There was pleasure also in the salt sweat-drops which ran singly
down the long hair over my forehead, and dripped like ice-water on
my cheek. At first, I played at catching them in my mouth; but, as
we rode further into the desert and the hours passed, the wind
became stronger, thicker in dust, more terrible in heat. All
semblance of friendly contest passed. My camel's pace became
sufficient increase to the irritation of the choking waves, whose
dryness broke my skin and made my throat so painful that for three
days afterwards I could eat little of our stodgy bread. When
evening at last came to us I was content that my burned face still
felt the other and milder air of darkness.</p>

<p>We plodded on all the day (even without the wind forbidding us
there could have been no more luxury-halts under the shadow of
blankets, if we would arrive unbroken men with strong camels at el
Fejr), and nothing made us widen an eye or think a thought till
after three in the afternoon. Then, above two natural tumuli, we
came to a cross-ridge swelling at last into a hill. Auda huskily
spat extra names at me.</p>

<p>Beyond it a long slope, slow degrees of a washed gravel surface
with stripings of an occasional torrent-bed, went down westward.
Auda and I trotted ahead together for relief against the
intolerable slowness of the caravan. This side the sunset glow a
modest wall of hills barred our way to the north. Shortly
afterwards the Seil abu Arad, turning east, swept along our front
in a bed a fair mile wide; it was inches deep with scrub as dry as
dead wood, which crackled and split with little spurts of dust when
we began to gather it for a fire to show the others where we had
made the halt. We gathered and gathered vigorously, till we had a
great cock ready for lighting. Then we found that neither of us had
a match.</p>

<p>The mass did not arrive for an hour or more, when the wind had
altogether died away, and the evening, calm and black and full of
stars, had come down on us. Auda set a watch through the night, for
this district was in the line of raiding parties, and in the hours
of darkness there were no friends in Arabia. We had covered about
fifty miles this day; all we could at a stretch, and enough
according to our programme. So we halted the night hours; partly
because our camels were weak and ill, and grazing meant much to
them, and partly because the Howeitat were not intimate with this
country, and feared to lose their way if they should ride too
boldly without seeing.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIII</h3>

<p>Before dawn the following day we started down the bed of Seil
Abu Arad till the white sun came up over the Zibliyat hills ahead
of us. We turned more north to cut off an angle of the valley, and
halted for half an hour till we saw the main body coming. Then
Auda, Nasir and myself, unable longer to endure passively the
hammer strokes of the sun upon our bowed heads, pushed forward at a
jerky trot. Almost at once we lost sight of the others in the
lymph-like heat-vapour throbbing across the flat: but the road was
evident, down the scrubby bed of Wadi Fejr.</p>

<p>At the height of noon we reached the well of our desire. It was
about thirty feet deep, stone-steyned, seemingly ancient. The water
was abundant, slightly brackish, but not ill-tasting when drunk
fresh: though it soon grew foul in a skin. The valley had flooded
in some burst of rain the year before, and therefore contained much
dry and thirsty pasturage: to this we loosed our camels. The rest
came up, and drew water and baked bread. We let the camels crop
industriously till nightfall, then watered them again, and pounded
them under the bank a half-mile from the water, for the night: thus
leaving the well unmolested in case raiders should need it in the
dark hours. Yet our sentries heard no one.</p>

<p>As usual we were off before dawn, though we had an easy march
before us; but the heated glare of the desert became so painful
that we designed to pass the midday in some shelter. After two
miles the valley spread out, and later we came to a low, broken
cliff on the east bank opposite the mouth of Seil Raugha. Here the
country looked more green, and we asked Auda to fetch us game. He
sent Zaal one way and rode westward himself across the open plain
which stretched beyond view, while we turned in to the cliffs and
found beneath their fallen crags and undercut ledges abundant shady
nooks, cool against the sun and restful for our unaccustomed
eyes.</p>

<p>The hunters returned before noon, each with a good gazelle. We
had filled our water-skins at Fejr, and could use them up, for the
water of Abu Ajaj was near: so there was feasting on bread and meat
in our stone dens. These indulgences, amid the slow fatigue of long
unbroken marches, were grateful to the delicate townsfolk among us:
to myself, and to Zeki, and Nesib's Syrian servants, and in a
lesser degree to Nesib himself. Nasir's courtesy as host, and his
fount of native kindliness made him exquisite in attention to us
whenever the road allowed. To his patient teaching I owed most of
my later competence to accompany tribal Arabs on the march without
ruining their range and speed.</p>

<p>We rested till two in the afternoon, and reached our stage,
Khabr Ajaj, just before sunset, after a dull ride over a duller
plain which prolonged Wadi Fejr to the eastward for many miles. The
pool was of this year's rain, already turned thick; and brackish;
but good for camels and just possible for men to drink. It lay in a
shallow double depression by Wadi Fejr, whose flood had filled it
two feet deep over an area two hundred yards across. At its north
end was a low sandstone dump. We had thought to find Howeitat here;
but the ground was grazed bare and the water fouled by their
animals, while they themselves were gone. Auda searched for their
tracks, but could find none: the wind-storms had swept the
sand-face into clean new ripples. However, since they had come down
here from Tubaik, they must have gone on and out into Sirhan: so,
if we went away northward, we should find them.</p>

<p>The following day, despite the interminable lapse of time, was
only our fourteenth from Wejh; and its sun rose upon us again
marching. In the afternoon we at last left Wadi Fejr to steer for
Arfaja in Sirhan, a point rather east of north. Accordingly, we
inclined right, over flats of limestone and sand, and saw a distant
corner of the Great Nefudh, the famous belts of sand-dune which cut
off Jebel Shammar from the Syrian Desert. Palgrave, the Blunts, and
Gertrude Bell amongst the storied travellers had crossed it, and I
begged Auda to bear off a little and let us enter it, and their
company: but he growled that men went to the Nefudh only of
necessity, when raiding, and that the son of his father did not
raid on a tottering, mangy camel. Our business was to reach Arfaja
alive.</p>

<p>So we wisely marched on, over monotonous, glittering sand; and
over those worse stretches, 'Giaan', of polished mud, nearly as
white and smooth as laid paper, and often whole miles square. They
blazed back the sun into our faces with glassy vigour, so we rode
with its light raining direct arrows upon our heads, and its
reflection glancing up from the ground through our inadequate
eyelids. It was not a steady pressure, but a pain ebbing and
flowing; at one time piling itself up and up till we nearly
swooned; and then falling away coolly, in a moment of false shadow
like a black web crossing the retina: these gave us a moment's
breathing space to store new capacity for suffering, like the
struggles to the surface of a drowning man.</p>

<p>We grew short-answered to one another; but relief came toward
six o'clock, when we halted for supper, and baked ourselves fresh
bread. I gave my camel what was left over of my share, for the poor
animal went tired and hungry in these bad marches. She was the
pedigree camel given by Ibn Saud of Nejd to King Hussein and by him
to Feisal; a splendid beast; rough, but sure-footed on hills, and
great-hearted. Arabs of means rode none but she-camels, since they
went smoother under the saddle than males, and were better tempered
and less noisy: also, they were patient and would endure to march
long after they were worn out, indeed until they tottered with
exhaustion and fell in their tracks and died: whereas the coarser
males grew angry, flung themselves down when tired, and from sheer
rage would die there unnecessarily.</p>

<p>After dark we crawled for three hours, reaching the top of a
sand-ridge. There we slept thankfully, after a bad day of burning
wind, dust blizzards, and drifting sand which stung our inflamed
faces, and at times, in the greater gusts, wrapped the sight of our
road from us and drove our complaining camels up and down. But Auda
was anxious about the morrow, for another hot head-wind would delay
us a third day in the desert, and we had no water left: so he
called us early in the night, and we marched down into the plain of
the Bisaita (so called in derision, for its huge size and
flatness), before day broke. Its fine surface-litter of sun-browned
flints was restfully dark after sunrise for our streaming eyes, but
hot and hard going for our camels, some of which were already
limping with sore feet.</p>

<p>Camels brought up on the sandy plains of the Arabian coast had
delicate pads to their feet; and if such animals were taken
suddenly inland for long marches over flints or other
heat-retaining ground, their soles would burn, and at last crack in
a blister; leaving quick flesh, two inches or more across, in the
centre of the pad. In this state they could march as ever over
sand; but if, by chance, the foot came down on a pebble, they would
stumble, or flinch as though they had stepped on fire, and in a
long march might break down altogether unless they were very brave.
So we rode carefully, picking the softest way, Auda and myself in
front.</p>

<p>As we went, some little puffs of dust scurried into the eye of
the wind. Auda said they were ostriches. A man ran up to us with
two great ivory eggs. We settled to breakfast on this bounty of the
Bisaita, and looked for fuel; but in twenty minutes found only a
wisp of grass. The barren desert was defeating us. The baggage
train passed, and my eye fell on the loads of blasting gelatine. We
broached a packet, shredding it carefully into a fire beneath the
egg propped on stones, till the cookery was pronounced complete.
Nasir and Nesib, really interested, dismounted to scoff at us. Auda
drew his silver-hilted dagger and chipped the top of the first egg.
A stink like a pestilence went across our party. We fled to a clean
spot, rolling the second egg hot before us with gentle kicks. It
was fresh enough, and hard as a stone. We dug out its contents with
the dagger on to the flint flakes which were our platters, and ate
it piecemeal; persuading even Nasir, who in his life before had
never fallen so low as egg-meat, to take his share. The general
verdict was: tough and strong, but good in the Bisaita.</p>

<p>Zaal saw an oryx; stalked it on foot, and killed it. The better
joints were tied upon the baggage camels for the next halt, and our
march continued. Afterwards the greedy Howeitat saw more oryx in
the distance and went after the beasts, who foolishly ran a little;
then stood still and stared till the men were near, and, too late,
ran away again. Their white shining bellies betrayed them; for, by
the magnification of the mirage, they winked each move to us from
afar.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIV</h3>

<p>I was too weary, and too little sporting, to go out of the
straight way for all the rare beasts in the world; so I rode after
the caravan, which my camel overhauled quickly with her longer
stride. At the tail of it were my men, walking. They feared that
some of their animals would be dead before evening, if the wind
blew stronger, but were leading them by hand in hope of getting
them in. I admired the contrast between Mohammed the lusty,
heavy-footed peasant, and the lithe Ageyl, with Farraj and Daud
dancing along, barefooted, delicate as thoroughbreds. Only Gasim
was not there: they thought him among the Howeitat, for his
surliness offended the laughing soldiery and kept him commonly with
the Beduin, who were more of his kidney.</p>

<p>There was no one behind, so I rode forward wishing to see how
his camel was: and at last found it, riderless, being led by one of
the Howeitat. His saddle-bags were on it, and his rifle and his
food, but he himself nowhere; gradually it dawned on us that the
miserable man was lost. This was a dreadful business, for in the
haze and mirage the caravan could not be seen two miles, and on the
iron ground it made no tracks: afoot he would never overtake
us.</p>

<p>Everyone had marched on, thinking him elsewhere in our loose
line; but much time had passed and it was nearly midday, so he must
be miles back. His loaded camel was proof that he had not been
forgotten asleep at our night halt. The Ageyl ventured that perhaps
he had dozed in the saddle and fallen, stunning or killing himself:
or perhaps someone of the party had borne him a grudge. Anyway they
did not know. He was an ill-natured stranger, no charge on any of
them, and they did not greatly care.</p>

<p>True: but it was true also that Mohammed, his countryman and
fellow, who was technically his road-companion, knew nothing of the
desert, had a foundered camel, and could not turn back for him.</p>

<p>If I sent him, it would be murder. That shifted the difficulty
to my shoulders. The Howeitat, who would have helped, were away in
the mirage out of sight, hunting or scouting. Ibn Dgheithir's Ageyl
were so clannish that they would not put themselves about except
for one another. Besides Gasim was my man: and upon me lay the
responsibility of him.</p>

<p>I looked weakly at my trudging men, and wondered for a moment if
I could change with one, sending him back on my camel to the
rescue. My shirking the duty would be understood, because I was a
foreigner: but that was precisely the plea I did not dare set up,
while I yet presumed to help these Arabs in their own revolt. It
was hard, anyway, for a stranger to influence another people's
national movement, and doubly hard for a Christian and a sedentary
person to sway Moslem nomads. I should make it impossible for
myself if I claimed, simultaneously, the privileges of both
societies.</p>

<p>So, without saying anything, I turned my unwilling camel round,
and forced her, grunting and moaning for her camel friends, back
past the long line of men, and past the baggage into the emptiness
behind. My temper was very unheroic, for I was furious with my
other servants, with my own play-acting as a Beduin, and most of
all with Gasim, a gap-toothed, grumbling fellow, skrimshank in all
our marches, bad-tempered, suspicious, brutal, a man whose
engagement I regretted, and of whom I had promised to rid myself as
soon as we reached a discharging-place. It seemed absurd that I
should peril my weight in the Arab adventure for a single worthless
man.</p>

<p>My camel seemed to feel it also, by her deep grumbling; but that
was a constant recourse of ill-treated camels. From calfhood they
were accustomed to live in droves, and some grew too conventional
to march alone: while none would leave their habitual party without
loud grief and unwillingness, such as mine was showing. She turned
her head back on her long neck, lowing to the rest, and walked very
slowly, and bouncingly. It needed careful guidance to hold her on
the road, and a tap from my stick at every pace to keep her moving.
However, after a mile or two, she felt better, and began to go
forward less constrainedly, but still slowly. I had been noting our
direction all these days with my oil compass, and hoped, by its
aid, to return nearly to our starting place, seventeen miles
away.</p>

<p>Before twenty minutes, the caravan was out of sight, and it was
borne in on me how really barren the Bisaita was. Its only marks
were the old sanded samh pits, across all possible of which I rode,
because my camel tracks would show in them, and be so many blazes
of the way back. This samh was the wild flour of the Sherarat; who,
poor in all but camel-stocks, made it a boast to find the desert
sufficient for their every need. When mixed with dates and loosened
with butter, it was good food.</p>

<p>The pits, little threshing floors, were made by pushing aside
the flints over a circle of ten feet across. The flints, heaped up
round the rim of the pit, made it inches deep, and in this hollow
place the women collected and beat out the small red seed. The
constant winds, sweeping since over them, could not indeed put back
the flint surface (that would perhaps be done by the rain in
thousands of winters), but had levelled them up with pale blown
sand, so that the pits were grey eyes in the black stony
surface.</p>

<p>I had ridden about an hour and a half, easily, for the following
breeze had let me wipe the crust from my red eyes and look forward
almost without pain: when I saw a figure, or large bush, or at
least something black ahead of me. The shifting mirage disguised
height or distance; but this thing seemed moving, a little east of
our course. On chance I turned my camel's head that way, and in a
few minutes saw that it was Gasim. When I called he stood
confusedly; I rode up and saw that he was nearly blinded and silly,
standing there with his arms held out to me, and his black mouth
gaping open. The Ageyl had put our last water in my skin, and this
he spilled madly over his face and breast, in haste to drink. He
stopped babbling, and began to wail out his sorrows. I sat him,
pillion, on the camel's rump; then stirred her up and mounted.</p>

<p>At our turn the beast seemed relieved, and moved forward freely.
I set an exact compass course, so exact that often I found our old
tracks, as little spurts of paler sand scattered over the
brown-black flint. In spite of our double weight the camel began to
stride out, and at times she even put her head down and for a few
paces developed that fast and most comfortable shuffle to which the
best animals, while young, were broken by skilled riders. This
proof of reserve spirit in her rejoiced me, as did the little time
lost in search.</p>

<p>Gasim was moaning impressively about the pain and terror of his
thirst: I told him to stop; but he went on, and began to sit
loosely; until at each step of the camel he bumped down on her
hinder quarters with a crash, which, like his crying, spurred her
to greater pace. There was danger in this, for we might easily
founder her so. Again I told him to stop, and when he only screamed
louder, hit him and swore that for another sound I would throw him
off. The threat, to which my general rage gave colour, worked.
After it he clung on grimly without sound.</p>

<p>Not four miles had passed when again I saw a black bubble,
lunging and swaying in the mirage ahead. It split into three, and
swelled. I wondered if they were enemy. A minute later the haze
unrolled with the disconcerting suddenness of illusion; and it was
Auda with two of Nasir's men come back to look for me. I yelled
jests and scoffs at them for abandoning a friend in the desert.
Auda pulled his beard and grumbled that had he been present I would
never have gone back. Gasim was transferred with insults to a
better rider's saddle-pad, and we ambled forward together.</p>

<p>Auda pointed to the wretched hunched-up figure and denounced me,
'For that thing, not worth a camel's price...' I interrupted him
with 'Not worth a half-crown, Auda', and he, delighted in his
simple mind, rode near Gasim, and struck him sharply, trying to
make him repeat, like a parrot, his price. Gasim bared his broken
teeth in a grin of rage and afterwards sulked on. In another hour
we were on the heels of the baggage camels, and as we passed up the
inquisitive line of our caravan, Auda repeated my joke to each
pair, perhaps forty times in all, till I had seen to the full its
feebleness.</p>

<p>Gasim explained that he had dismounted to ease nature, and had
missed the party afterwards in the dark: but, obviously, he had
gone to sleep, where he dismounted, with the fatigue of our slow,
hot journeying. We rejoined Nasir and Nesib in the van. Nesib was
vexed with me, for perilling the lives of Auda and myself on a
whim. It was clear to him that I reckoned they would come back for
me. Nasir was shocked at his ungenerous outlook, and Auda was glad
to rub into a townsman the paradox of tribe and city; the
collective responsibility and group-brotherhood of the desert,
contrasted with the isolation and competitive living of the crowded
districts.</p>

<p>Over this little affair hours had passed, and the rest of the
day seemed not so long; though the heat became worse, and the
sandblast stiffened in our faces till the air could be seen and
heard, whistling past our camels like smoke. The ground was flat
and featureless till five o'clock, when we saw low mounds ahead,
and a little later found ourselves in comparative peace, amid
sand-hills coated slenderly with tamarisk. These were the Kaseim of
Sirhan. The bushes and the dunes broke the wind, it was sunset, and
the evening mellowed and reddened on us from the west. So I wrote
in my diary that Sirhan was beautiful.</p>

<p>Palestine became a land of milk and honey to those who had spent
forty years in Sinai: Damascus had the name of an earthly paradise
to the tribes which could enter it only after weeks and weeks of
painful marching across the flint-stones of this northern desert:
and likewise the Kaseim of Arfaja in which we spent that night,
after five days across the blazing Houl in the teeth of a
sand-storm, looked fresh and countryfied. They were raised only a
few feet above the Bisaita, and from them valleys seemed to run
down towards the east into a huge depression where lay the well we
wanted: but now that we had crossed the desert and reached the
Sirhan safely, the terror of thirst had passed and we knew fatigue
to be our chief ill. So we agreed to camp for the night where we
were, and to make beacon fires for the slave of Nuri Shaalan, who,
like Gasim, had disappeared from our caravan to-day.</p>

<p>We were not greatly perturbed about him. He knew the country and
his camel was under him. It might be that he had intentionally
taken the direct way to Jauf, Nuri's capital, to earn the reward of
first news that we came with gifts. However it was, he did not come
that night, nor next day; and when, months after, I asked Nuri of
him, he replied that his dried body had lately been found, lying
beside his unplundered camel far out in the wilderness. He must
have lost himself in the sand-haze and wandered till his camel
broke down; and there died of thirst and heat. Not a long
death&mdash;even for the very strongest a second day in summer was
all&mdash;but very painful; for thirst was an active malady; a fear
and panic which tore at the brain and reduced the bravest man to a
stumbling babbling maniac in an hour or two: and then the sun
killed him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLV</h3>

<p>Having not a mouthful of water we of course ate nothing: which
made it a continent night. Yet the certainty of drink on the morrow
let us sleep easily, lying on our bellies to prevent the inflation
of foodlessness. Arab habit was to fill themselves to vomiting
point at each well, and either to go dry to the next; or, if they
carried water, to use it lavishly at the first halt, drinking and
bread-making. As my ambition was to avoid comment upon my
difference, I copied them, trusting with reason that their physical
superiority was not great enough to trap me into serious harm.
Actually I only once went ill with thirst.</p>

<p>Next morning we rode down slopes, over a first ridge, and a
second, and a third; each three miles from the other; till at eight
o'clock we dismounted by the wells of Arfaja, the sweet-smelling
bush so called being fragrant all about us. We found the Sirhan not
a valley, but a long fault draining the country on each side of it
and collecting the waters into the successive depressions of its
bed. The ground surface was of flinty gravel, alternating with soft
sand; and the aimless valleys seemed hardly able to trace their
slow and involved levels between the loose sand-dunes, over which
blew the feathery tamarisk; its whipcord roots binding the slopes
together.</p>

<p>The unlined wells were dug about eighteen feet, to water creamy
to the touch with a powerful smell and brackish taste. We found it
delicious, and since there was greenstuff about, good for camel
food, decided to stay here the day while we searched for the
Howeitat by sending to Maigua, the southernmost well of Sirhan. So
we should establish whether they were behind us; and if they were
not, could march towards the north with confidence that we were on
their track.</p>

<p>Hardly, however, had our messenger ridden off when one of the
Howeitat saw riders hiding in the scrub to the northward of us.</p>

<p>Instantly they called to arms. Mohammed el Dheilan, first into
the saddle, with other Toweiha galloped out against the supposed
enemy; Nasir and I mustered the Ageyl (whose virtue lay not in
fighting Beduin-fashion with Beduins) and placed them in sets about
the dunes so as reasonably to defend the baggage. However, the
enemy got off. Mohammed returned after half an hour to say that he
had not made relentless pursuit for pity of the condition of his
camel. He had seen only three tracks and supposed that the men had
been scouts of a Shammar raiding party in the neighbourhood, Arfaja
being commonly infested by them.</p>

<p>Auda called up Zaal, his nephew, the keenest eye of all the
Howeitat, and told him to go out and discover the enemy's number
and intention. Zaal was a lithe metallic man, with a bold
appraising look, cruel lips, and a thin laugh, full of the
brutality which these nomad Howeitat had caught from the peasantry.
He went off and searched; but found the thicket of brushwood about
us full of tracks; while the tamarisk kept the wind off the sandy
floor, and made it impossible to distinguish particularly the
footprints of to-day.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed peacefully, and we lulled ourselves, though
we kept a sentry on the head of the great dune behind the
water-holes. At sunset I went down and washed myself in the
smarting brine; and on my way back halted at the Ageyl fire to take
coffee with them, while listening to their Nejdi Arabic. They began
to tell me long stories of Captain Shakespear, who had been
received by ibn Saud in Riyadh as a personal friend, and had
crossed Arabia from the Persian Gulf to Egypt; and been at last
killed in battle by the Shammar in a set-back which the champions
of Nejd had suffered during one of their periodic wars.</p>

<p>Many of the Ageyl of ibn Dgheithir had travelled with him, as
escort or followers, and had tales of his magnificence and of the
strange seclusion in which he kept himself day and night. The
Arabs, who usually lived in heaps, suspected some ulterior reason
for any too careful privacy. To remember this, and to foreswear all
selfish peace and quiet while wandering with them, was one of the
least pleasant lessons of the desert war: and humiliating, too, for
it was a part of pride with Englishmen to hug solitude; ourselves
finding ourselves to be remarkable, when there was no competition
present.</p>

<p>While we talked the roasted coffee was dropped with three grains
of cardamom into the mortar. Abdulla brayed it; with the
dring-drang, dring-drang pestle strokes of village Nejd, two equal
pairs of <i>legato</i> beats. Mohammed el Dheilan heard, came
silently across the sand and sank down, slowly, groaningly,
camel-like, on the ground by me. Mohammed was a companionable
fellow; a powerful, thinking man with much wry humour, and an
affection of sour craft, sometimes justified by his acts, but
generally disclosing a friendly cynical nature. In build he was
unusually strong and well-grown, not much under six feet in height;
a man of perhaps thirty-eight, determined and active, with a
high-coloured face ruggedly lined, and very baffling eyes.</p>

<p>He was second man of the Abu Tayi; richer and having more
followers than Auda, and with more taste for the luscious. He had a
little house in Maan, landed property (and it was whispered,
'cattle') near Tafileh. Under his influence the war parties of the
Abu Tayi rode out delicately, with sunshades to defend them from
the fierce rays of the sun and with bottles of mineral water in
their saddle-bags as refreshment upon the journey. He was the brain
of the tribal councils and directed their politics. His sore-headed
critical spirit pleased me; and often I used his intelligence and
greed to convert him to my party before broaching a new idea.</p>

<p>The long ride in company had made companions of our minds and
bodies. The hazardous goal was in our thoughts, day and night;
consciously and unconsciously we were training ourselves; reducing
our wills to the single purpose which oftenest engrossed these odd
moments of talk about an evening fire. And we were so musing while
the coffee-maker boiled up his coffee, tapped it down again, made a
palm-fibre mat to strain it before he poured (grounds in the cup
were evil manners), when there came a volley from the shadowy dunes
east of us and one of the Ageyl toppled forward into the centre of
the firelit circle with a screech.</p>

<p>Mohammed with his massive foot thrust a wave of sand over the
fire and in the quick blinding darkness we rolled behind banks of
tamarisk and scattered to get rifles, while our outlying pickets
began to return the fire, aiming hurriedly towards the flashes. We
had unlimited ammunition in our hand, and did not stint to show
it.</p>

<p>Gradually the enemy slackened, astonished perhaps at our
preparedness. Finally his fire stopped, and we held our own,
listening for a rush or for attack from a new quarter. For half an
hour we lay still; and silent, but for the groans, and at last the
death struggle of the man hit with the first volley. Then we were
impatient of waiting longer. Zaal went out to report what was
happening to the enemy. After another half-hour he called to us
that no one was left within reach. They had ridden away: about
twenty of them, in his trained opinion.</p>

<p>Despite Zaal's assurances, we passed a restless night, and in
the morning before dawn we buried Assaf, our first casualty, and
moved off northward, keeping the bottom of the hollow, with the
sand-hills mostly on our left. We rode for five hours and then
halted for breakfast on the south bank of a great spill of
torrent-beds running down into the Sirhan from the south-west. Auda
told me these were the mouths of Seil Fejr, the valley whose head
we had seen at Selhub and whose bed we had followed right across
the Houl.</p>

<p>The grazing was better than at Arfaja, and we allowed our camels
the four hours of noon to fill themselves&mdash;a poor proceeding,
for the midday grazing was not profitable to them, though we
enjoyed ourselves in the shadow of our blankets, sleeping out the
sleep we had missed the night before. Here in the open, away from
all possibility of hidden approach, was no fear of disturbance, and
our displayed strength and confidence might dissuade the invisible
enemy. Our desire was to fight Turks, and this inter-Arab business
was sheer waste. In the afternoon we rode on twelve miles to a
sharp group of firm sand-hills, enclosing an open space big enough
for us, and commanding the country round about. We halted there, in
anticipation of another night attack.</p>

<p>Next morning we did a fast march of five hours (our camels being
full of life after their ease of yesterday) to an oasis-hollow of
stunted palm-trees, with tamarisk clumps here and there, and
plentiful water, about seven feet underground, tasting sweeter than
the water of Arfaja. Yet this also upon experience proved 'Sirhan
water', the first drink of which was tolerable, but which refused a
lather to soap, and developed (after two days in closed vessels) a
foul smell and a taste destructive to the intended flavour of
coffee, tea, or bread.</p>

<p>Verily we were tiring of Wadi Sirhan, though Nesib and Zeki
still designed works of plantation and reclamation here for the
Arab Government when by them established. Such vaulting imagination
was typical of Syrians, who easily persuaded themselves of
possibilities, and as quickly reached forward to lay their present
responsibilities on others. 'Zeki,' said I one day, 'your camel is
full of mange.' 'Alas, and alack,' agreed he mournfully, 'in the
evening, very quickly, when the sun is low, we shall dress her skin
with ointment.'</p>

<p>During our next ride, I mentioned mange once more. 'Aha,' said
Zeki, 'it has given me a full idea. Conceive the establishment of a
Veterinary Department of State, for Syria, when Damascus is ours.
We shall have a staff of skilled surgeons, with a school of
probationers and students, in a central hospital, or rather central
hospitals, for camels and for horses, and for donkeys and cattle,
even (why not?) for sheep and goats. There must be scientific and
bacteriological branches to make researches into universal cures
for animal disease. And what about a library of foreign
books?...and district hospitals to feed the central, and travelling
inspectors...' With Nesib's eager collaboration he carved Syria
into four inspectorates general, and many sub-inspectorates.</p>

<p>Again on the morrow there was mention of mange. They had slept
on their labour, and the scheme was rounding out. 'Yet, my dear, it
is imperfect; and our nature stops not short of perfection. We
grieve to see you thus satisfied to snatch the merely opportune. It
is an English fault.' I dropped into their vein. 'O Nesib,' said I,
'and O Zeki, will not perfection, even in the least of things,
entail the ending of this world? Are we ripe for that? When I am
angry I pray God to swing our globe into the fiery sun, and prevent
the sorrows of the not-yet-born: but when I am content, I want to
lie for ever in the shade, till I become a shade myself.' Uneasily
they shifted the talk to stud farms, and on the sixth day the poor
camel died. Very truly, 'Because', as Zeki pointed out, 'you did
not dress her'. Auda, Nasir, and the rest of us kept our beasts
going by constant care. We could, perhaps, just stave the mange off
till we should reach the camp of some well-provided tribe, and be
able to procure medicines, with which to combat the disease
whole-heartedly.</p>

<p>A mounted man came bearing down upon us. Tension there was, for
a moment; but then the Howeitat hailed him. He was one of their
herdsmen, and greetings were exchanged in an unhurried voice, as
was proper in the desert, where noise was a low-bred business at
the best, and urban at its worst.</p>

<p>He told us the Howeitat were camped in front, from Isawiya to
Nebk, anxiously waiting our news. All was well with their tents.
Auda's anxiety passed and his eagerness kindled. We rode fast for
an hour to Isawiya and the tents of Ali abu Fitna, chief of one of
Auda's clans. Old Ali, rheumy-eyed, red and unkempt, into whose
jutting beard a long nose perpetually dripped, greeted us warmly
and urged us to the hospitality of his tent. We excused ourselves
as too many, and camped near by under some thorns, while he and the
other tent-holders made estimate of our numbers, and prepared
feasts for us in the evening, to each group of tents its little
batch of visitors. The meal took hours to produce, and it was long
after dark when they called us to it. I woke and stumbled across,
ate, made my way back to our couched camels and slept again.</p>

<p>Our march was prosperously over. We had found the Howeitat: our
men were in excellent fettle: we had our gold and our explosives
still intact. So we drew happily together in the morning to a
solemn council on action. There was agreement that first we should
present six thousand pounds to Nuri Shaalan, by whose sufferance we
were in Sirhan. We wanted from him liberty to stay while enrolling
and preparing our fighting men; and when we moved off we wanted him
to look after their families and tents and herds.</p>

<p>These were great matters. It was determined that Auda himself
should ride to Nuri on embassy, because they were friends. Nuri's
was too near and too big a tribe for Auda to fight, however lordly
his delight in war. Self-interest, accordingly, had prompted the
two great men to an alliance: and acquaintance had bred a whimsical
regard, by virtue of which each suffered the other's oddities with
patience. Auda would explain to Nuri what we hoped to do, and
Feisal's desire that he make a public demonstration of adherence to
Turkey. Only so could he cover us, while still pleasing the
Turks.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVI</h3>

<p>Meanwhile we would stay with Ali abu Fitna, moving gently
northward with him towards Nebk, where Auda would tell all the Abu
Tayi to collect. He would be back from Nuri before they were
united. This was the business, and we laded six bags of gold into
Auda's saddle-bags, and off he went. Afterwards the chiefs of the
Fitenna waited on us, and said that they were honoured to feast us
twice a day, forenoon and sunset, so long as we remained with them;
and they meant what they said. Howeitat hospitality was
unlimited&mdash;no three-day niggardliness for them of the nominal
desert law&mdash;and importunate, and left us no honourable escape
from the entirety of the nomad's dream of well-being.</p>

<p>Each morning, between eight and ten, a little group of blood
mares under an assortment of imperfect saddlery would come to our
camping place, and on them Nasir, Nesib, Zeki and I would mount,
and with perhaps a dozen of our men on foot would move solemnly
across the valley by the sandy paths between the bushes. Our horses
were led by our servants, since it would be immodest to ride free
or fast. So eventually we would reach the tent which was to be our
feast-hall for that time; each family claiming us in turn, and
bitterly offended if Zaal, the adjudicator, preferred one out of
just order.</p>

<p>As we arrived, the dogs would rush out at us, and be driven off
by onlookers&mdash;always a crowd had collected round the chosen
tent&mdash;and we stepped in under the ropes to its guest half,
made very large for the occasion and carefully dressed with its
wall-curtain on the sunny side to give us the shade. The bashful
host would murmur and vanish again out of sight. The tribal rugs,
lurid red things from Bey-rout, were ready for us, arranged down
the partition curtain, along the back wall and across the dropped
end, so that we sat down on three sides of an open dusty space. We
might be fifty men in all.</p>

<p>The host would reappear, standing by the pole; our local
fellow-guests, el Dheilan, Zaal and other sheikhs, reluctantly let
themselves be placed on the rugs between us, sharing our elbow-room
on the pack-saddles, padded with folded felt rugs, over which we
leaned. The front of the tent was cleared, and the dogs were
frequently chased away by excited children, who ran across the
empty space pulling yet smaller children after them. Their clothes
were less as their years were less, and their pot-bodies rounder.
The smallest infants of all, out of their fly-black eyes, would
stare at the company, gravely balanced on spread legs, stark-naked,
sucking their thumbs and pushing out expectant bellies towards
us.</p>

<p>Then would follow an awkward pause, which our friends would try
to cover, by showing us on its perch the household hawk (when
possible a sea-bird taken young on the Red Sea coast) or their
watch-cockerel, or their greyhound. Once a tame ibex was dragged in
for our admiration: another time an oryx. When these interests were
exhausted they would try and find a small talk to distract us from
the household noises, and from noticing the urgent whispered
cookery-directions wafted through the dividing curtain with a
powerful smell of boiled fat and drifts of tasty meat-smoke.</p>

<p>After a silence the host or a deputy would come forward and
whisper, 'Black or white?' an invitation for us to choose coffee or
tea. Nasir would always answer 'Black', and the slave would be
beckoned forward with the beaked coffee-pot in one hand, and three
or four clinking cups of white ware in the other. He would dash a
few drops of coffee into the uppermost cup, and proffer it to
Nasir; then pour the second for me, and the third for Nesib; and
pause while we turned the cups about in our hands, and sucked them
carefully, to get appreciatively from them the last richest
drop.</p>

<p>As soon as they were empty his hand was stretched to clap them
noisily one above the other, and toss them out with a lesser
flourish for the next guest in order, and so on round the assembly
till all had drunk. Then back to Nasir again. This second cup would
be tastier than the first, partly because the pot was yielding
deeper from the brew, partly because of the heel-taps of so many
previous drinkers present in the cups; whilst the third and fourth
rounds, if the serving of the meat delayed so long, would be of
surprising flavour.</p>

<p>However, at last, two men came staggering through the thrilled
crowd, carrying the rice and meat on a tinned copper tray or
shallow bath, five feet across, set like a great brazier on a foot.
In the tribe there was only this one food-bowl of the size, and an
incised inscription ran round it in florid Arabic characters: 'To
the glory of God, and in trust of mercy at the last, the property
of His poor suppliant, Auda abu Tayi.' It was borrowed by the host
who was to entertain us for the time; and, since my urgent brain
and body made me wakeful, from my blankets in the first light I
would see the dish going across country, and by marking down its
goal would know where we were to feed that day.</p>

<p>The bowl was now brim-full, ringed round its edge by white rice
in an embankment a foot wide and six inches deep, filled with legs
and ribs of mutton till they toppled over. It needed two or three
victims to make in the centre a dressed pyramid of meat such as
honour prescribed. The centre-pieces were the boiled, upturned
heads, propped on their severed stumps of neck, so that the ears,
brown like old leaves, flapped out on the rice surface. The jaws
gaped emptily upward, pulled open to show the hollow throat with
the tongue, still pink, clinging to the lower teeth; and the long
incisors whitely crowned the pile, very prominent above the
nostrils' pricking hair and the lips which sneered away blackly
from them.</p>

<p>This load was set down on the soil of the cleared space between
us, where it steamed hotly, while a procession of minor helpers
bore small cauldrons and copper vats in which the cooking had been
done. From them, with much-bruised bowls of enamelled iron, they
ladled out over the main dish all the inside and outside of the
sheep; little bits of yellow intestine, the white tail-cushion of
fat, brown muscles and meat and bristly skin, all swimming in the
liquid butter and grease of the seething. The bystanders watched
anxiously, muttering satisfactions when a very juicy scrap plopped
out.</p>

<p>The fat was scalding. Every now and then a man would drop his
baler with an exclamation, and plunge his burnt fingers, not
reluctantly, in his mouth to cool them: but they persevered till at
last their scooping rang loudly on the bottoms of the pots; and,
with a gesture of triumph, they fished out the intact livers from
their hiding place in the gravy and topped the yawning jaws with
them.</p>

<p>Two raised each smaller cauldron and tilted it, letting the
liquid splash down upon the meat till the rice-crater was full, and
the loose grains at the edge swam in the abundance: and yet they
poured, till, amid cries of astonishment from us, it was running
over, and a little pool congealing in the dust. That was the final
touch of splendour, and the host called us to come and eat.</p>

<p>We feigned a deafness, as manners demanded: at last we heard
him, and looked surprised at one another, each urging his fellow to
move first; till Nasir rose coyly, and after rum we all came
forward to sink on one knee round the tray, wedging in and cuddling
up till the twenty-two for whom there was barely space were grouped
around the food. We turned back our right sleeves to the elbow,
and, taking lead from Nasir with a low 'In the name of God the
merciful, the loving-kind', we dipped together.</p>

<p>The first dip, for me, at least, was always cautious, since the
liquid fat was so hot that my unaccustomed fingers could seldom
bear it: and so I would toy with an exposed and cooling lump of
meat till others' excavations had drained my rice-segment. We would
knead between the fingers (not soiling the palm), neat balls of
rice and fat and liver and meat cemented by gentle pressure, and
project them by leverage of the thumb from the crooked fore-finger
into the mouth. With the right trick and the right construction the
little lump held together and came clean off the hand; but when
surplus butter and odd fragments clung, cooling, to the fingers,
they had to be licked carefully to make the next effort slip easier
away.</p>

<p>As the meat pile wore down (nobody really cared about rice:
flesh was the luxury) one of the chief Howeitat eating with us
would draw his dagger, silver hilted, set with turquoise, a signed
masterpiece of Mohammed ibn Zari, of Jauf, and would cut
criss-cross from the larger bones long diamonds of meat easily torn
up between the fingers; for it was necessarily boiled very tender,
since all had to be disposed of with the right hand which alone was
honourable.</p>

<p>Our host stood by the circle, encouraging the appetite with
pious ejaculations. At top speed we twisted, tore, cut and stuffed:
never speaking, since conversation would insult a meal's quality;
though it was proper to smile thanks when an intimate guest passed
a select fragment, or when Mohammed el Dheilan gravely handed over
a huge barren bone with a blessing. On such occasions I would
return the compliment with some hideous impossible lump of guts, a
flippancy which rejoiced the Howeitat, but which the gracious,
aristocratic Nasir saw with disapproval.</p>

<p>At length some of us were nearly filled, and began to play and
pick; glancing sideways at the rest till they too grew slow, and at
last ceased eating, elbow on knee, the hand hanging down from the
wrist over the tray edge to drip, while the fat, butter and
scattered grains of rice cooled into a stiff white grease which
gummed the fingers together. When all had stopped, Nasir meaningly
cleared his throat, and we rose up together in haste with an
explosive 'God requite it you, O host', to group ourselves outside
among the tent-ropes while the next twenty guests inherited our
leaving.</p>

<p>Those of us who were nice would go to the end of the tent where
the flap of the roof-cloth, beyond the last poles, drooped down as
an end curtain; and on this clan handkerchief (whose coarse
goat-hair mesh was pliant and glossy with much use) would scrape
the thickest of the fat from the hands. Then we would make back to
our seats, and re-take them sighingly; while the slaves, leaving
aside their portion, the skulls of the sheep, would come round our
rank with a wooden bowl of water, and a coffee-cup as dipper, to
splash over our fingers, while we rubbed them with the tribal
soap-cake.</p>

<p>Meantime the second and third sittings by the dish were having
their turn, and then there would be one more cup of coffee, or a
glass of syrup-like tea; and at last the horses would be brought
and we would slip out to them, and mount, with a quiet blessing to
the hosts as we passed by. When our backs were turned the children
would run in disorder upon the ravaged dish, tear our gnawed bones
from one another, and escape into the open with valuable fragments
to be devoured in security behind some distant bush: while the
watchdogs of all the camp prowled round snapping, and the master of
the tent fed the choicest offal to his greyhound.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVII</h3>

<p>We feasted on the first day once, on the second twice, on the
third twice; at Isawiya: and then, on May the thirtieth, we saddled
and rode easily for three hours, past an old sanded lava-field to a
valley in which seven-foot wells of the usual brackish water lay
all about us. The Abu Tayi struck camp when we struck, and
journeyed at our side, and camped around us: so to-day for the
first time I was spectator from the midst of an Arab tribe, and
actor in the routine of its march.</p>

<p>It was strangely unlike the usual desert-constancy. All day the
grey-green expanse of stones and bushes quivered like a mirage with
the movement of men on foot; and horsemen; men on camels; camels
bearing the hunched black loads which were the goat-hair
tent-cloths; camels swaying curiously, like butterflies, under the
winged and fringed howdahs of the women; camels tusked like
mammoths or tailed like birds with the cocked or dragging
tent-poles of silvery poplar. There was no order nor control nor
routine of march, other than the wide front, the self-contained
parties, the simultaneous start, which the insecurity of countless
generations had made instinctive. The difference was that the
desert, whose daily sparseness gave value to every man, to-day
seemed with their numbers suddenly to come alive.</p>

<p>The pace was easy; and we, who had been guarding our own lives
for weeks, found it a relaxation beyond feeling to know ourselves
so escorted as to share the light liability of danger with a host.
Even our most solemn riders let themselves go a little, and the
wilder ones became licentious. First amongst these, of course, were
Farraj and Daud, my two imps, whose spirits not all the privations
of our road had quelled for a moment. About their riding places in
our line of march centred two constant swirls of activity or of
accident, according as their quenchless mischief found a further
expression.</p>

<p>On my dry patience they grated a little, because the plague of
snakes which had been with us since our first entry into Sirhan
today rose to memorable height, and became a terror. In ordinary
times, so the Arabs said, snakes were little worse here than
elsewhere by water in the desert: but this year the valley seemed
creeping with horned vipers and puff-adders, cobras and black
snakes. By night movement was dangerous: and at last we found it
necessary to walk with sticks, beating the bushes each side while
we stepped warily through on bare feet.</p>

<p>We could not lightly draw water after dark, for there were
snakes swimming in the pools or clustering in knots around their
brinks. Twice puff-adders came twisting into the alert ring of our
debating coffee-circle. Three of our men died of bites; four
recovered after great fear and pain, and a swelling of the poisoned
limb. Howeitat treatment was to bind up the part with snake-skin
plaster, and read chapters of the Koran to the sufferer until he
died. They also pulled thick Damascene ankle-boots, red, with blue
tassels and horse-shoe heels, over their horny feet when they went
late abroad.</p>

<p>A strange' thing was the snakes' habit, at night, of lying
beside us, probably for warmth, under or on the blanket. When we
learned this our rising was with infinite care, and the first up
would search round his fellows with a stick till he could pronounce
them unencumbered. Our party of fifty men killed perhaps twenty
snakes daily; at last they got so on our nerves that the boldest of
us feared to touch ground; while those who, like myself, had a
shuddering horror of all reptiles longed that our stay in Sirhan
might end.</p>

<p>Not so Farraj and Daud. To them, this was a new and splendid
game. They troubled us continually with alarms, and furious
beatings upon the head of every harmless twig or root which caught
their fancy. At last, in our noon-halt, I charged them strictly not
to let the cry of snake again pass their lips aloud; and then,
sitting by our traps upon the sand, we had peace. To live on the
floor, whence it was so far to arise and walk, disposed to
inaction, and there was much to think about so that it may have
been an hour afterwards before I noticed the offending pair smiling
and nudging one another. My eyes idly followed their eyes to the
neighbouring bush under which a brown snake lay coiled, glittering
at me.</p>

<p>Quickly I moved myself, and cried to Ali, who jumped in with his
riding-cane and settled it. I told him to give the two boys a
swinging half-dozen each, to teach them not again to be literal at
my expense. Nasir, slumbering behind me, heard and with joy shouted
to add six from himself. Nesib copied him, and then Zeki, and then
ibn Dgheithir, till half the men were clamouring for revenge. The
culprits were abashed when they saw that all the hides and all the
sticks in the party would hardly expiate their account: however, I
saved them the weight of it, and instead we proclaimed them moral
bankrupts, and set them under the women to gather wood and draw
water for the tents.</p>

<p>So they laboured shamefully for the two days we spent at Abu
Tarfeiyat; where on the first day we feasted twice and on the
second day twice. Then Nesib broke down, and on plea of illness
took refuge inside Nasir's tent, and ate dry bread thankfully. Zeki
had been ailing on the road, and his first effort at the Howeitat
sodden meat and greasy rice had prostrated him. He also lay within
the tent, breathing disgust and dysentery against us. Nasir's
stomach had had long experience of tribal ways and stood the test
grandly. It was incumbent on him, for the honour of our guesting,
to answer every call; and for greater honour, he constrained me
always to go with him. So we two leaders represented the camp each
day, with a decent proportion of the hungering Ageyl.</p>

<p>Of course it was monotonous; but the crystal happiness in our
hosts was a return satisfaction for our eyes, and to have shattered
it a crime. Oxford or Medina had tried to cure Nasir and me of
superstitious prejudice; and had complicated us to the point of
regaining simplicity. These people were achieving in our cause the
height of nomadic ambition, a continued orgy of seethed mutton. My
heaven might have been a lonely, soft arm-chair, a book-rest, and
the complete poets, set in Caslon, printed on tough paper: but I
had been for twenty-eight years well-fed, and if Arab imagination
ran on food-bowls, so much the more attainable their joy. They had
been provident expressly on our account. A few days before we came,
a drover had guested with them; and, by Auda's order, they had
bought his fifty sheep to entertain us worthily. In fifteen meals
(a week) we had consumed them all, and the hospitality guttered
out.</p>

<p>Digestion returned, and with it our power of movement. We were
very weary of Sirhan. The landscape was of a hopelessness and
sadness deeper than all the open deserts we had crossed. Sand, or
flint, or a desert of bare rocks was exciting sometimes, and in
certain lights had the monstrous beauty of sterile desolation: but
there was something sinister, something actively evil in this
snake-devoted Sirhan, proliferant of salt water, barren palms, and
bushes which served neither for grazing nor for firewood.</p>

<p>Accordingly we marched one day, and another, beyond Ghutti,
whose weak well was nearly sweet. When we got near Ageila, we saw
that it was held by many tents, and presently a troop came out to
meet us. They were Auda abu Tayi, safely back from Nuri Shaa-lan,
with the one-eyed Durzi ibn Dughmi, our old guest at Wejh. His
presence proved Nuri's favour, as did their strong escort of Rualla
horse; who, bareheaded and yelling, welcomed us to Nuri's empty
house with a great show of spears and wild firing of rifles and
revolvers at full gallop through the dust.</p>

<p>This modest manor had some fruitful palms, enclosed, and they
had pitched beside the garden a Mesopotamian tent of white canvas.
Here, also, stood Auda's tent, a huge hall seven poles long and
three wide; and Zaal's tent was near it, and many others; and
through the afternoon we received fusillades of honour,
deputations, and gifts of ostrich eggs, or Damascus dainties, or
camels, or scraggy horses, while the air was loud about us with the
cries of Auda's volunteers demanding service, immediate service,
against the Turks.</p>

<p>Affairs looked well, and we set three men to make coffee for the
visitors, who came in to Nasir one by one or group by group,
swearing allegiance to Feisal and to the Arab Movement, in the Wejh
formula; and promising to obey Nasir, and to follow after
<i>him</i> with their contingents. Besides their formal presents,
each new party deposited on our carpet their privy, accidental gift
of lice; and long before sunset Nasir and I were in a fever, with
relay after relay of irritation. Auda had a stiff arm, the effect
of an old wound in the elbow joint, and so could not scratch all of
himself; but experience had taught him a way of thrusting a
cross-headed camel-stick up his left sleeve and turning it round
and round inside against his ribs, which method seemed to relieve
his itch more than our claws did ours.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVIII</h3>

<p>Nebk, to be our next halt, had plentiful water, with some
grazing. Auda had appointed it our rallying place, because of the
convenient nearness of the Blaidat, or 'salt hamlets'. In it he and
Sherif Nasir sat down for days, to consider enrolling the men, and
to prepare the road along which we would march, by approaching the
tribes and the sheikhs who lived near. Leisure remained for Nasib,
Zeki and myself. As usual, the unstable Syrian judgement, not able
to consist in the narrow point of virtue, staggered to the
circumference. In the heady atmosphere of first enthusiasm they
ignored Akaba, and despised the plain purpose which had led us
here. Nesib knew the Shaalans and the Druses. His mind enrolled
them, not the Howeitat; struck at Deraa, not Maan: occupied
Damascus, not Akaba. He pointed out that the Turks were all
unready: that we were sure to gain our first objective, by sheer
surprise: that therefore our objective should be the highest.
Damascus was indicated by the finger of inevitable fate.</p>

<p>I pointed him in vain to Feisal yet in Wejh: to the British yet
the wrong side of Gaza: to the new Turkish army massing in Aleppo
to recover Mesopotamia. I showed how we in Damascus would be
unsupported: without resources or organization: without a base:
without even a line of communication with our friends. But Nesib
was towering above geography, and beyond tactics, and only sordid
means would bring him down. So I went to Auda, and said that with
the new objective cash and credit would go to Nuri Shaalan, and not
to him: I went to Nasir, and used influence and our liking for one
another to keep <i>him</i> on my plan; fanning high the too
easily-lit jealousy between a Sherif and a Damascene; between an
authentic Shia descendant of Ali and the martyred Hussein, and a
very doubtfully reputed descendant of the 'successor' Abu Bekr.</p>

<p>For our movement, the point was life and death. I was sure that
if we took Damascus we should not hold it six weeks, for Murray
could not instantly attack the Turks, nor would sea-transport be
available at the moment's notice to land a British army at Beyrout:
and in losing Damascus we should lose our supporters (only their
first flush was profitable: a rebellion which stood still or went
back was lost) without having gained Akaba, which was the last base
in safe water; and in my judgement the only door, except the Middle
Euphrates, which we could unlock for an assuredly successful entry
into Syria.</p>

<p>Akaba's special value to the Turks was that, when they pleased,
it might be constituted a threat to the right flank of the British
army. At the end of 1914 their higher command had thought to make
it their main route to the Canal: but they found the food and water
difficulties great, and adopted the Beersheba route. Now, however,
the British had left the Canal positions and had thrust forward to
Gaza and Beersheba. This made the feeding of the Turkish army
easier by shortening its line. Consequently, the Turks had surplus
transport. Akaba was also of greater geographical value than of
old, since it now lay behind the British right, and a small force
operating from it would threaten either El Arish or Suez
effectively.</p>

<p>The Arabs needed Akaba: firstly, to extend their front, which
was their tactical principle; and, secondly, to link up with the
British. If they took it the act gave them Sinai, and made positive
junction between them and Sir Archibald Murray. Thus having become
really useful, they would obtain material help. The human frailty
of Murray's Staff was such that nothing but physical contact with
our success could persuade them of our importance. Murray was
friendly: but if we became his right wing he would equip us
properly, almost without the asking. Accordingly, for the Arabs,
Akaba spelt plenty in food, money, guns, advisers. I wanted contact
with the British; to act as the right wing of the Allies in the
conquest of Palestine and Syria; and to assert the Arabic-speaking
peoples' desire or desert of freedom and self-government. In my
view, if the revolt did not reach the main battlefield against
Turkey it would have to confess failure, and remain a side-show of
a side-show. I had preached to Feisal, from our first meeting, that
freedom was taken, not given.</p>

<p>Both Nasir and Auda fortunately answered to my whispers; and,
after recriminations, Nesib left us, and rode with Zeki to the
Druse Mountain, there to do the preliminary work necessary to the
launching of his great Damascus scheme. I knew his incapacity to
create; but it was not in my mind to permit even a half-baked
rising there, to spoil our future material. So I was careful to
draw his teeth before he started, by taking from him most of the
money Feisal had shared out to him. The fool made this easy for me,
as he knew he had not enough for all he wanted; and, measuring the
morality of England by his own pettiness, came to me for the
promise of more if he raised a Syrian movement independent of
Feisal, under his own leadership. I had no fear of so untoward a
miracle; and, instead of calling him rat, gave my ready promise for
future help, if he would for the present give me his balance, to
get us to Akaba, where I would make funds available for the general
need. He yielded to my condition with a bad grace; and Nasir was
delighted to get two bags of money unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Yet the optimism of Nesib had its effect upon me; while I still
saw the liberation of Syria happening in steps, of which Akaba was
the indispensable first, I now saw these steps coming close
together; and as soon as Nesib was out of the way planned to go off
myself, rather in his fashion, on a long tour of the north country.
I felt that one more sight of Syria would put straight the
strategic ideas given me by the Crusaders and the first Arab
conquest, and adjust them to the two new factors&mdash;the
railways, and Murray in Sinai.</p>

<p>Also a rash adventure suited my abandoned mood. It should have
been happiness, this lying out free as air, with the visible life
striving its utmost along my own path; but the knowledge of the axe
I was secretly grinding destroyed all my assurance.</p>

<p>The Arab Revolt had begun on false pretences. To gain the
Sherif's help our Cabinet had offered, through Sir Henry McMahon,
to support the establishment of native governments in parts of
Syria and Mesopotamia, 'saving the interests of our ally, France'.
The last modest clause concealed a treaty (kept secret, till too
late, from McMahon, and therefore from the Sherif) by which France,
England and Russia agreed to annex some of these promised areas,
and to establish their respective spheres of influence over all the
rest.</p>

<p>Rumours of the fraud reached Arab ears, from Turkey. In the East
persons were more trusted than institutions. So the Arabs, having
tested my friendliness and sincerity under fire, asked me, as a
free agent, to endorse the promises of the British Government. I
had had no previous or inner knowledge of the McMahon pledges and
the Sykes-Picot treaty, which were both framed by war-time branches
of the Foreign Office. But, not being a perfect fool, I could see
that if we won the war the promises to the Arabs were dead paper.
Had I been an honourable adviser I would have sent my men home, and
not let them risk their lives for such stuff. Yet the Arab
inspiration was our main tool in winning the Eastern war. So I
assured them that England kept her word in letter and spirit. In
this comfort they performed their fine things: but, of course,
instead of being proud of what we did together, I was continually
and bitterly ashamed.</p>

<p>Clear sight of my position came to me one night, when old Nuri
Shaalan in his aisled tent brought out a file of documents and
asked which British pledge was to be believed. In his mood, upon my
answer, lay the success or failure of Feisal. My advice, uttered
with some agony of mind, was to trust the latest in date of the
contradictions. This disingenuous answer promoted me, in six
months, to be chief confidence-man. In Hejaz the Sherifs were
everything, and I had allayed my conscience by telling Feisal how
hollow his basis was. In Syria England was mighty and the Sherif
very low. So I became the principal.</p>

<p>In revenge I vowed to make the Arab Revolt the engine of its own
success, as well as handmaid to our Egyptian campaign: and vowed to
lead it so madly in the final victory that expediency should
counsel to the Powers a fair settlement of the Arabs' moral claims.
This presumed my surviving the war, to win the later battle of the
Council Chamber&mdash;immodest presumptions, which still balance in
fulfilment. Yet the issue of the fraud was beside the point.</p>

<p>Clearly I had no shadow of leave to engage the Arabs, unknowing,
in a gamble of life and death. Inevitably and justly we should reap
bitterness, a sorry fruit of heroic endeavour. So in resentment at
my false place (did ever second lieutenant so lie abroad for his
betters?) I undertook this long, dangerous ride, in which to see
the more important of Feisal's secret friends, and to study
key-positions of our future campaigns: but the results were
incommensurate with the risks, and the act artistically
unjustifiable, like the motive. I had whispered to myself 'Let me
chance it, now, before we begin', seeing truly that this was the
last chance, and that after a successful capture of Akaba I would
never again possess myself freely, without association, in the
security lurking for the obscure in their protective shadow.</p>

<p>Before me lay a vista of responsibility and command, which
disgusted my thought-riddled nature. I felt mean, to fill the place
of a man of action; for my standards of value were a wilful
reaction against theirs, and I despised their happiness. Always my
soul hungered for less than it had, since my senses, sluggish
beyond the senses of most men, needed the immediacy of contact to
achieve perception; they distinguished kinds only, not degrees.</p>

<p>When I returned it was June the sixteenth, and Nash was still
labouring in his tent. He and Auda had been seeing too much of one
another for their good, and lately there had been a breach; but
this was easily healed, and after a day the old chief was as much
with us as ever, and as kind and difficult. We stood up always when
he entered; not for his sheikhhood, for sitting we received sheikhs
of much older rank: but because he was Auda, and Auda was such a
splendid thing to be. The old man loved it, and however much we
might wrangle, everyone knew that really we were his friends.</p>

<p>We were now five weeks out from Wejh: we had spent nearly all
the money we had brought with us: we had eaten all the Howeitat
sheep: we had rested or replaced all our old camels: nothing
hindered the start. The freshness of the adventure in hand consoled
us for everything; and Auda, importing more mutton, gave a farewell
feast, the greatest of the whole series, in his huge tent the eve
before we started. Hundreds were present, and five fills of the
great tray were eaten up in relay as fast as they were cooked and
carried in.</p>

<p>Sunset came down, delightfully red, and after the feast the
whole party lay round the outside coffee-hearth lingering under the
stars, while Auda and others told us stories. In a pause I remarked
casually that I had looked for Mohammed el Dheilan in his tent that
afternoon, to thank him for the milch camel he had given me, but
had not found him. Auda shouted for joy, till everybody looked at
him; and then, in the silence which fell that they might learn the
joke, he pointed to Mohammed sitting dismally beside the coffee
mortar, and said in his huge voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Ho! Shall I tell why Mohammed for fifteen days has not slept in
his tent?' Everybody chuckled with delight, and conversation
stopped; all the crowd stretched out on the ground, chins in hands,
prepared to take the good points of the story which they had heard
perhaps twenty times. The women, Auda's three wives, Zaal's wife,
and some of Mohammed's, who had been cooking, came across,
straddling their bellies in the billowy walk which came of carrying
burdens on their heads, till they were near the partition-curtain;
and there they listened like the rest while Auda told at length how
Mohammed had bought publicly in the bazaar at Wejh a costly string
of pearls, and had not given it to any of his wives, and so they
were all at odds, except in their common rejection of him.</p>

<p>The story was, of course, a pure invention&mdash;Auda's elvish
humour heightened by the stimulus of Revolt&mdash;and the luckless
Mohammed, who had dragged through the fortnight guesting casually
with one or other of the tribesmen, called upon God for mercy, and
upon me for witness that Auda lied. I cleared my throat solemnly.
Auda asked for silence, and begged me to confirm his words.</p>

<p>I began with the introducing phrase of a formal tale: In the
name of God the merciful, the loving-kind. We were six in Wejh.
There were Auda, and Mohammed, and Zaal, Gasim el Shimt, Mufaddhi
and the poor man (myself); and one night just before dawn, Auda
said, 'Let us make a raid against the market'. And we said, 'in the
name of God'. And we went; Auda in a white robe and a red
head-cloth, and Kasim sandals of pieced leather; Mohammed in a
silken tunic of 'seven kings' and barefoot; Zaal...I forget Zaal.
Gasim wore cotton, and Mufaddhi was in silk of blue stripes with an
embroidered head-cloth. Your servant was as your servant.'</p>

<p>My pause was still with astonishment. This was a close parody of
Auda's epic style; and I mimicked also his wave of the hand, his
round voice, and the rising and dropping tone which emphasized the
points, or what he thought were points, of his pointless stories.
The Howeitat sat silent as death, twisting their full bodies inside
their sweat-stiffened shirts for joy, and staring hungrily at Auda;
for they all recognized the original, and parody was a new art to
them and to him. The coffee man, Mufaddhi, a Shammar refugee from
the guilt of blood, himself a character, forgot to pile fresh
thorns on his fire for fixity of listening to the tale.</p>

<p>I told how we left the tents, with a list of the tents, and how
we walked down towards the village, describing every camel and
horse we saw, and all the passers-by, and the ridges, 'all bare of
grazing, for by God that country was barren. And we marched: and
after we had marched the time of a smoked cigarette, we heard
something, and Auda stopped and said, 'Lads, I hear something'. And
Mohammed stopped and said, 'Lads, I hear something'. And Zaal, 'By
God, you are right'. And we stopped to listen, and there was
nothing, and the poor man said, 'By God, I hear nothing'. And Zaal
said, 'By God, I hear nothing'. And Mohammed said, 'By God, I hear
nothing'. And Auda said, 'By God, you are right'.</p>

<p>'And we marched and we marched, and the land was barren, and we
heard nothing. And on our right hand came a man, a negro, on a
donkey. The donkey was grey, with black ears, and one black foot,
and on its shoulder was a brand like this' (a scrabble in the air),
'and its tail moved and its legs: Auda saw it, and said, 'By God, a
donkey'. And Mohammed said, 'By the very God, a donkey and a
slave'. And we marched. And there was a ridge, not a great ridge,
but a ridge as great as from the here to the what-do-you-call-it
(<i>hi biliyeh el hok</i>) that is yonder: and we marched to the
ridge and it was barren. That land is barren: barren: barren.</p>

<p>'And we marched: and beyond the what-do-you-call-it there was a
what-there-is as far as hereby from thence, and thereafter a ridge:
and we came to that ridge, and went up that ridge: it was barren,
all that land was barren: and as we came up that ridge, and were by
the head of that ridge, and came to the end of the head of that
ridge, by God, by my God, by very God, the sun rose upon us.'</p>

<p>It ended the session. Everyone had heard that sunrise twenty
times, in its immense bathos; an agony piled up of linked phrases,
repeated and repeated with breathless excitement by Auda to carry
over for hours the thrill of a raiding story in which nothing
happened; and the trivial rest of it was exaggerated the degree
which made it like one of Auda's tales; and yet, also, the history
of the walk to market at Wejh which many of us had taken. The tribe
was in waves of laughter on the ground.</p>

<p>Auda laughed the loudest and longest, for he loved a jest upon
himself; and the fatuousness of my epic had shown him his own sure
mastery of descriptive action. He embraced Mohammed, and confessed
the invention of the necklace. In gratitude Mohammed invited the
camp to breakfast with him in his regained tent on the morrow, an
hour before we started for the swoop on Akaba. We should have a
sucking camel-calf boiled in sour milk by his wives: famous cooks,
and a legendary dish!</p>

<p>Afterwards we sat by the wall of Nuri's manor, and saw the women
take down the great tent, greater than Auda's, eight-bayed of
twenty-four poles in all, longer and broader and loftier than any
other in the tribe, and new, like the rest of Mohammed's goods. The
Abu Tayi were rearranging their camp, for security when their
fighting men marched away. Throughout the afternoon tents were
coming in and being pitched by us. The oblong cloth was stretched
flat upon the ground; the ropes at the end, in the sides, by the
pole-gussets, strained out and tied to pegs. Then the housewife
would insert the light poles one by one, under the cloth, and lever
it up by them, until the whole was in place, pitched single-handed
by the one weak woman, however rough the wind.</p>

<p>If it rained one row of poles was drawn in at the foot, so
slanting the roof-cloth obliquely to the shower, and making it
reasonably waterproof. In summer the Arab tent was less hot than
our canvas tents, for the sun-heat was not absorbed in this loose
woven fabric of hair and wool, with the air spaces and currents
between its threads.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIX</h3>

<p>We started an hour before noon. Nasir led us, riding his
Ghazala&mdash;a camel vaulted and huge-ribbed as an antique ship;
towering a good foot above the next of our animals, and yet
perfectly proportioned, with a stride like an ostrich's&mdash;a
lyrical beast, noblest and best bred of the Howeitat camels, a
female of nine remembered dams. Auda was beside him, and I
skirmished about their gravities on Naama, 'the hen-ostrich', a
racing camel and my last purchase. Behind me rode my Ageyl, with
Mohammed, the clumsy. Mohammed was now companioned by Ahmed,
another peasant, who had been for six years living among the
Howeitat by force of his thews and wits&mdash;a knowing eager
ruffian. Sixty feet of a rise took us out of Sirhan to the first
terrace of the Ard el Suwan&mdash;a country of black flints upon
marly limestone; not very solid, but hard enough in the tracks
which the feet of passing centuries of camels had worn an inch or
two into the surface. Our aim was Bair, a historic group of
Ghassanid wells and ruins in the desert thirty or forty miles east
of the Hejaz Railway. It lay some sixty miles ahead, and there we
would camp a few days, while our scouts brought us flour from the
hill villages above the Dead Sea. Our food from Wejh was nearly
finished (except that Nasir still had some of the precious rice for
great occasions), and we could not yet certainly forecast the date
of our arrival in Akaba.</p>

<p>Our present party totalled more than five hundred strong; and
the sight of this jolly mob of hardy, confident northerners chasing
gazelle wildly over the face of the desert, took from us
momentarily all sorry apprehension as to the issue of our
enterprise. We felt it was a rice-night, and the chiefs of the Abu
Tayi came to sup with us. Afterwards, with the embers of our
coffee-fire pleasantly red between us against the cool of this
upland north-country, we sat about on the carpets chatting
discursively of this remote thing and that.</p>

<p>Nasir rolled over on his back, with my glasses, and began to
study the stars, counting aloud first one group and then another;
crying out with surprise at discovering little lights not noticed
by his unaided eye. Auda set us on to talk of telescopes&mdash;of
the great ones&mdash;and of how man in three hundred years had so
far advanced from his first essay that now he built glasses as long
as a tent, through which he counted thousands of unknown stars.
'And the stars&mdash;what are they?' We slipped into talk of suns
beyond suns, sizes and distance beyond wit. 'What will now happen
with this knowledge?' asked Mohammed. 'We shall set to, and many
learned and some clever men together will make glasses as more
powerful than ours, as ours than Galileo's; and yet more hundreds
of astronomers will distinguish and reckon yet more thousands of
now unseen stars, mapping them, and giving each one its name. When
we see them all, there will be no night in heaven.'</p>

<p>Why are the Westerners always wanting all?' provokingly said
Auda. 'Behind our few stars we can see God, who is not behind your
millions.' We want the world's end, Auda.' 'But that is God's,'
complained Zaal, half angry. Mohammed would not have his subject
turned. 'Are there men on these greater worlds?' he asked. 'God
knows.' 'And has each the Prophet and heaven and hell?' Auda broke
in on him. 'Lads, we know our districts, our camels, our women. The
excess and the glory are to God. If the end of wisdom is to add
star to star our foolishness is pleasing.' And then he spoke of
money, and distracted their minds till they all buzzed at once.
Afterwards he whispered to me that I must get him a worthy gift
from Feisal when he won Akaba.</p>

<p>We marched at dawn, and in an hour topped the Wagf, the
water-shed, and rode down its far side. The ridge was only a bank
of chalk, flint-capped, a couple of hundred feet high. We were now
in the hollow between the Snainirat on the south and, on the north,
the three white heads of the Thlaithukhwat, a cluster of conical
hills which shone brilliant as snow in the sunshine. Soon we
entered Wadi Bair, and marched up and across it for hours. There
had been a flood there in the spring, producing a rich growth of
grasses between the scrubby bushes. It was green and pleasant to
the eye and to our camels' hungry palates, after the long hostility
of the Sirhan.</p>

<p>Presently Auda told me he was riding ahead to Bair, and would I
come? We went fast, and in two hours came upon the place suddenly,
under a knoll. Auda had hurried on to visit the tomb of his son
Annad, who had been waylaid by five of his Motalga cousins in
revenge for Abtan, their champion, slain by Annad in single combat.
Auda told me how Annad had ridden at them, one against five, and
had died as he should; but it left only little Mohammed between him
and childlessness. He had brought me along to hear him greatly
lament his dead.</p>

<p>However, as we rode down towards the graves, we were astonished
to see smoke wreathing from the ground about the wells. We changed
direction sharply, and warily approached the ruins. It seemed there
was no one there; but the thick dung-cake round the well-brink was
charred, and the well itself shattered at the top. The ground was
torn and blackened as if by an explosion; and when we looked down
the shaft we saw its steyning stripped and split, and many blocks
thrown down the bore half choking it and the water in the bottom. I
sniffed the air and thought the smell was dynamite.</p>

<p>Auda ran to the next well, in the bed of the valley below the
graves; and that, too, was ragged about the head and choked with
fallen stones. This,' said he, 'is Jazi work.' We walked across the
valley to the third&mdash;the Beni Sakhr&mdash;well. It was only a
crater of chalk. Zaal arrived, grave at sight of the disaster. We
explored the ruined khan, in which were night-old traces of perhaps
a hundred horse. There was a fourth well, north of the ruins in the
open flat, and to it we went hopelessly, wondering what would
become of us if Bair were all destroyed. To our joy it was
uninjured.</p>

<p>This was a Jazi well, and its immunity gave strong colour to
Auda's theory. We were disconcerted to find the Turks so ready, and
began to fear that perhaps they had also raided El Jefer, east of
Maan, the wells at which we planned to concentrate before we
attacked. Their blocking would be a real embarrassment. Meanwhile,
thanks to the fourth well, our situation, though uncomfortable, was
not dangerous. Yet its water facilities were altogether
insufficient for five hundred camels; so it became imperative to
open the least damaged of the other wells&mdash;that in the ruins,
about whose lip the turf smouldered. Auda and I went off with Nasir
to look again at it.</p>

<p>An Ageyli brought us an empty case of Nobel's gelignite,
evidently the explosive which the Turks had used. From scars in the
ground it was clear that several charges had been fired
simultaneously round the well-head, and in the shaft. Staring down
it till our eyes were adjusted to its dark, we suddenly saw many
niches cut in the shaft less than twenty feet below. Some were
still tamped, and had wires hanging down.</p>

<p>Evidently there was a second series of charges, either
inefficiently wired, or with a very long time-fuse. Hurriedly we
unrolled our bucket-ropes, twined them together, and hung them
freely down the middle of the well from a stout cross-pole, the
sides being so tottery that the scrape of a rope might have
dislodged their blocks. I then found that the charges were small,
not above three pounds each, and had been wired in series with
field telephone cable. But something had gone wrong. Either the
Turks had scamped their job or their scouts had seen us coming
before they had had time to re-connect.</p>

<p>So we soon had two fit wells, and a clear profit of thirty
pounds of enemy gelignite. We determined to stay a week in this
fortunate Bair. A third object&mdash;to discover the condition of
the Jefer wells&mdash;was now added to our needs for food, and for
news of the state of mind of the tribes between Maan and Akaba. We
sent a man to Jefer. We prepared a little caravan of pack-camels
with Howeitat brands and sent them across the line to Tafileh with
three or four obscure clansmen-people who would never be suspected
of association with us. They would buy all the flour they could and
bring it back to us in five or six days' time.</p>

<p>As for the tribes about the Akaba road, we wanted their active
help against the Turks to carry out the provisional plan we had
made at Wejh. Our idea was to advance suddenly from El Jefer, to
cross the railway-line and to crown the great pass&mdash;Nagb el
Shtar&mdash;down which the road dipped from the Maan plateau to the
red Guweira plain. To hold this pass we should have to capture Aba
el Lissan, the large spring at its head, about sixteen miles from
Maan; but the garrison was small, and we hoped to overrun it with a
rush. We would then be astride the road, whose posts at the end of
the week should fall from hunger; though probably before that the
hill tribes, hearing of our successful beginning, would join us to
wipe them out.</p>

<p>Crux of our plan was the attack on Aba el Lissan, lest the force
in Maan have time to sally out, relieve it, and drive us off the
head of Shtar. If, as at present, they were only a battalion, they
would hardly dare move; and should they let it fall while waiting
for reinforcements to arrive, Akaba would surrender to us, and we
should be based on the sea and have the advantageous gorge of Itm
between us and the enemy. So our insurance for success was to keep
Maan careless and weak, not suspecting our malevolent presence in
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>It was never easy for us to keep our movements secret, as we
lived by preaching to the local people, and the unconvinced would
tell the Turks. Our long march into Wadi Sirhan was known to the
enemy, and the most civilian owl could not fail to see that the
only fit objective was Akaba. The demolition of Bair (and Jefer,
too, for we had it confirmed that the seven wells of Jefer were
destroyed) showed that the Turks were to that extent on the
alert.</p>

<p>However, there was no measuring the stupidity of the Turkish
Army; a point which helped us now and again, and harmed us
constantly, for we could not avoid despising them for it (Arabs
being a race gifted with uncommon quickness of mind, and
over-valuing it) and an army suffered when unable to yield honour
to the enemy. For the moment the stupidity might be made use of;
and so we had undertaken a prolonged campaign of deception, to
convince them that our objective lay nearer to Damascus.</p>

<p>They were susceptible to pressure in that neighbourhood, for the
railway from Damascus, north to Deraa and south to Amman, was the
communication, not merely of Hejaz, but of Palestine; and if we
attacked it we should do double damage. So, in my long trip round
the north country, I had dropped hints of our near arrival in Jebel
Druse; and I had been glad to let the notorious Nesib go up there,
noisily, but with small resources. Nuri Shaalan had warned the
Turks for us in the same sense; and Newcombe, down near Wejh, had
contrived to lose official papers, including a plan (in which we
were advance guard) for marching from Wejh, by Jefer and the
Sirhan, to Tadmor, to attack Damascus and Aleppo. The Turks took
the documents very seriously, and chained up an unfortunate
garrison in Tadmor till the end of the war, much to our
advantage.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER L</h3>

<p>It seemed wise to make some concrete effort in the same
direction during the week that we must spend in Bair, and Auda
decided that Zaal should ride with me in command of a party to
attack the line near Deraa. Zaal chose one hundred and ten men,
individually, and we rode hard, in six-hour spells with
one&mdash;or two&mdash;hour intervals, day and night. For me it was
an eventful trip, for those reasons which made it dull to the
Arabs; namely, that we were an ordinary tribal raiding party,
riding on conventional lines, in the formation and after the
pattern which generations of practice had proved efficient.</p>

<p>In the second afternoon we reached the railway just above Zerga,
the Circassian village north of Amman. The hot sun and fast riding
had tried our camels, and Zaal decided to water them at a ruined
Roman village, the underground cisterns of which had been filled by
the late rains. It lay within a mile of the railway, and we had to
be circumspect, for the Circassians hated the Arabs, and would have
been hostile had they seen us. Also there was a military post of
two tents on a tall bridge just down the line. The Turks seemed
active. Later we heard that a general's inspection was pending.</p>

<p>After the watering we rode another six miles, and in the early
dark turned to Dhuleil bridge, which Zaal reported as a big one,
good to destroy. The men and camels stayed on the high ground east
of the railway to cover our retreat if anything untoward happened,
while Zaal and I went down to the bridge to look it over. There
were Turks two hundred yards beyond it, with many tents and cooking
fires. We were puzzled to explain their strength, until we reached
the bridge and found it being rebuilt; the spring flood had washed
away four of its arches, and the line was temporarily laid on a
deviation. One of the new arches was finished, another had the
vault just turned, and the timber centring was set ready for a
third.</p>

<p>Useless, of course, it was, bothering to destroy a bridge in
such a state; so we drew off quietly (not to alarm the workmen),
walking over loose stones which turned under our bare feet in a way
imposing care if we would avoid risk of sprain. Once I put my foot
on something moving, soft and cold; and stepped heavily, on chance
it was a snake; but no harm followed. The brilliant stars cast
about us a false light, not illumination, but rather a transparency
of air lengthening slightly the shadow below each stone, and making
a difficult greyness of the ground.</p>

<p>We decided to go further north, towards Minifir, where Zaal
thought the land propitious for mining a train. A train would be
better than a bridge, for our need was political, to make the Turks
think that our main body was at Azrak in Sirhan, fifty miles away
to the east. We came out on a flat plain, crossed by a very
occasional shallow bed of fine shingle. Over this we were going
easily when we heard a long rumble. We pricked ears, wondering: and
there came out of the north a dancing plume of flame bent low by
the wind of its speed. It seemed to light us, extending its
fire-tagged curtain of smoke over our heads, so near were we to the
railway; and we shrank back while the train rushed on. Two minutes'
warning and I would have blown its locomotive into scrap.</p>

<p>Afterwards our march was quiet till the dawn, when we found
ourselves riding up a narrow valley. At its head was a sharp turn
to the left, into an amphitheatre of rock where the hill went up by
step after step of broken cliff to a crest on which stood a massive
cairn. Zaal said the railway was visible thence, and if this were
true the place was an ideal ambush, for the camels could be herded
without any guardians into the pit of excellent pasture.</p>

<p>I climbed at once to the cairn, the ruin of an Arab watch-tower
of the Christian period, commanding a most gracious view of rich
pastoral uplands beyond the line, which ran round the foot of our
slope in a lazy curve, open to sight for perhaps five miles. Below
on our left was the square box of the 'coffee-house', a railway
halt, about which a few little soldiers were slouching peacefully.
We lay alternately watching and sleeping, for many hours, during
which a train ground slowly past up the stiff gradient. We made
plans to descend upon the line that night, wherever seemed best for
mining.</p>

<p>However, in mid-morning a dark mass approached from the
northward. Eventually we made it out to be a force of perhaps one
hundred and fifty mounted men, riding straight for our hill. It
looked as though we had been reported; A quite possible thing,
since all this area was grazed over by the sheep of the Belga
tribes, whose shepherds, when they saw our stealthiness, would have
taken us for robber-enemies and alarmed their tents.</p>

<p>Our position, admirable against the railway, was a death-trap in
which to be caught by superior mobile forces: so we sent down the
alarm, mounted and slipped across the valley of our entry, and over
its eastern ridge into a small plain, where we could canter our
animals. We made speed to low mounds on its further side, and got
behind them before the enemy were in a position to see us.</p>

<p>There the terrain better suited our tactics and we waited for
them; but they were at least imperfectly informed, for they rode
past our old hiding-place and quickly away towards the south,
leaving us puzzled. There were no Arabs among them&mdash;all were
regulars&mdash;so we had not to fear being tracked, but here again
it seemed as though the Turks were on the alert. This was according
to my wish, and I was glad, but Zaal, on whom fell the military
responsibility, was disquieted. He held a council with those others
who knew the country, and eventually we remounted, and jogged off
to another hill, rather north of our old one, but satisfactory
enough. Particularly it happened to be free of tribal
complications.</p>

<p>This was Minifir proper, a round-headed, grass-grown hill of two
shoulders. The high neck between provided us, on its eastern face,
a broad track perfectly covered from north and south and west,
which afforded a safe retreat into the desert. At the top the neck
was cupped, so that collected rain had made the soil rich, and the
grazing sumptuous; but loosed camels required constant care, for if
they wandered two hundred paces forward they became visible from
the railway, a further four hundred yards down the western face of
the hill. On each side the shoulders pushed forward in spurs which
the line passed in shallow cuttings. The excavated material had
been thrown across the hollow in an embankment; through the centre
of which a lofty culvert let the drainage of the little zigzag
gully from the neck run down into a larger transverse valley bed
beyond.</p>

<p>Northward the line curved away, hard uphill, to the wide level
of the southern Hauran, spread out like a grey sky, and flecked
with small dark clouds which were the dead basalt towns of
Byzantine Syria. Southward was a cairn from which we could look
down the railway for six miles or more.</p>

<p>The high land facing us to the west, the Belga, was spotted with
black tent-villages of peasants in summer quarters. They could see
us too, in our hill-cup, so we sent word who we were. Whereupon
they kept silent till we had gone, and then were fervid and
eloquent in proving that we fled eastward, to Azrak. When our
messengers came back we had bread to eat&mdash;a luxury; since the
dearth in Bair had reduced us to parched corn which, for lack of
cooking-opportunity the men had been chewing raw. The trial was too
steep for my teeth, so that I rode fasting.</p>

<p>Zaal and I buried that night on the culvert a great Garland
mine, automatic-compound, to explode three charges in parallel by
instantaneous fuse; and then lay down to sleep, sure that we would
hear noises if a train came along in the dark and fired it.
However, nothing happened, and at dawn I removed the detonators
which (additional to the trigger action) had been laid on the
metals. Afterwards we waited all day, fed and comfortable, cooled
by a high wind which hissed like surf as it ruffled up the
stiff-grassed hill.</p>

<p>For hours nothing came along: but at last there was a flutter
among the Arabs, and Zaal, with the Hubsi and some of the more
active men, dashed down towards the line. We heard two shots under
us in the dead ground, and after half an hour the party reappeared,
leading two ragged Turkish deserters from the mounted column of the
day before. One had been badly wounded, while attempting to escape
up the line; and in the afternoon he died, most miserable about
himself and his fate. Exceptionally: for when death became certain
most men felt the quietness of the grave waiting for them, and went
to it not unwillingly. The other man was hurt also, a clean gunshot
in the foot; but he was very feeble and collapsed when the wound
grew painful with the cold. His thin body was so covered with
bruises, tokens of army service and cause of his desertion, that he
dared lie only on his face. We offered him the last of our bread
and water and did what else we could for him: which was little.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon came a thrill when the mule-mounted
infantry reappeared, heading up-line towards us. They would pass
below our ambush, and Zaal and the men were urgent to attack them
on the sudden. We were one hundred, they little over two hundred.
We had the upper ground, could hope to empty some of their saddles
by our first volley, and then would camel-charge upon them. Camels,
especially down a gentle slope, would overtake mules in a few
strides, and their moving bulk would send spinning the lighter
animals and their riders. Zaal gave me his word that no regular
cavalry, let alone mere mounted infantry, could cope with tribal
camels in a running fight We should take not only the men, but
their precious animals.</p>

<p>I asked him how many casualties we might incur. He guessed five
or six, and then I decided to do nothing, to let them pass. We had
one objective only, the capture of Akaba, and had come up here
solely to make that easier by leading the Turks off on the false
scent of thinking that we were at Azrak. To lose five or six men in
such a demonstration, however profitable it proved financially,
would be fatuous, or worse, because we might want our last rifle to
take Akaba, the possession of which was vital to us. After Akaba
had fallen we might waste men, if we felt callous; but not
before.</p>

<p>I told Zaal, who was not content; while the furious Howeitat
threatened to run off downhill at the Turks, willy-nilly. They
wanted a booty of mules; and I, particularly, did not, for it would
have diverted us. Commonly, tribes went to war to gain honour and
wealth. The three noble spoils were arms, riding-animals, and
clothes. If we took these two hundred mules, the proud men would
throw up Akaba and drive them home by way of Azrak to their tents,
to triumph before the women. As for prisoners, Nasir would not be
grateful for two hundred useless mouths: so we should have to kill
them; or let them go, revealing our numbers to the enemy.</p>

<p>We sat and gnashed our teeth at them and let them pass: a severe
ordeal, from which we only just emerged with honour. Zaal did it.
He was on his best behaviour, expecting tangible gratitude from me
later; and glad, meanwhile, to show me his authority over the
Beduin. They respected him as Auda's deputy, and as a famous
fighter, and in one or two little mutinies he had shown a
self-conscious mastery.</p>

<p>Now he was tested to the utmost. The Hubsi, Auda's cousin, A.
spirited youth, while the Turks were defiling innocently not three
hundred yards from our itching rifle-muzzles, sprang to his feet
and ran forward shouting to attract them, and compel a battle; but
Zaal caught him in ten strides, threw him down and bludgeoned him
savagely time and again till we feared lest the lad's now very
different cries fulfil his former purpose.</p>

<p>It was sad to see a sound and pleasant little victory pass
voluntarily out of our hands, and we were gloomy till evening came
down and confirmed our sense that once more there would be no
train. This was the final occasion, for thirst was hanging over us,
and on the morrow the camels must be watered. So after nightfall we
returned to the line, laid thirty charges of gelignite against the
most-curved rails and fired them leisurely. The curved rails were
chosen since the Turks would have to bring down new ones from
Damascus. Actually, this took them three days; and then their
construction train stepped on our mine (which we had left as hook
behind the demolition's bait) and hurt its locomotive. Traffic
ceased for three other days while the line was picked over for
traps.</p>

<p>For the moment, of course, we could anticipate none of these
good things. We did the destruction, returned sorrowfully to our
camels, and were off soon after midnight. The prisoner was left
behind on his hill-top, for he could neither walk nor ride, and we
had no carriage for him. We feared he would starve to death where
he lay: and, indeed, already he was very ill: so on a telegraph
pole, felled across the rails by the damaged stretch, we put a
letter in French and German, to give news of where he was, and that
we had captured him wounded after a hard fight.</p>

<p>We hoped this might save him the penalties which the Turks
inflicted on red-handed deserters, or from being shot if they
thought he had been in collusion with us: but when we came back to
Minifir six months later the picked bones of the two bodies were
lying scattered on our old camping ground. We felt sorry always for
the men of the Turkish Army. The officers, volunteer and
professional, had caused the war by their ambition&mdash;almost by
their existence&mdash;and we wished they could receive not merely
their proportionate deserts, but all that the conscripts had to
suffer through their fault.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LI</h3>

<p>In the night we lost our way among the stony ridges and valleys
of Dhuleil, but kept moving until dawn, so that half an hour after
sunrise, while the shadows were yet long across the green hollows,
we had reached our former watering-place, Khau, whose ruins broke
from the hill-top against Zerga like a scab. We were working hard
at the two cisterns, watering our camels for the return march to
Bair, when a young Circassian came in sight, driving three cows
towards the rich green pasture of the ruins.</p>

<p>This would not do, so Zaal sent off his too-energetic offenders
of the day previous to show their proper mettle by stalking him:
and they brought him in, unharmed, but greatly frightened.
Circassians were swaggering fellows, inordinate bullies in a clear
road; but if firmly met they cracked; and so this lad was in a
head-and-tail flux of terror, offending our sense of respect. We
drenched him with water till he recovered, and then in disposal set
him to fight at daggers with a young Sherari, caught stealing on
the march; but after a scratch the prisoner threw himself down
weeping.</p>

<p>Now he was a nuisance, for if we left him he would give the
alarm, and send the horsemen of his village out against us. If we
tied him up in this remote place he would die of hunger or thirst;
and, besides, we had not rope to spare. To kill him seemed
unimaginative: not worthy of a hundred men. At last the Sherari boy
said if we gave him scope he would settle his account and leave him
living.</p>

<p>He looped his wrist to the saddle and trotted him off with us
for the first hour, till he was dragging breathlessly. We were
still near the railway, but four or five miles from Zerga. There he
was stripped of presentable clothes, which fell, by point of
honour, to his owner. The Sherari threw him on his face, picked up
his feet, drew a dagger, and chopped him with it deeply across the
soles. The Circassian howled with pain and terror, as if he thought
he was being killed.</p>

<p>Odd as was the performance, it seemed effective, and more
merciful than death. The cuts would make him travel to the railway
on hands and knees, a journey of an hour; and his nakedness would
keep him in the shadow of the rocks, till the sun was low. His
gratitude was not coherent; but we rode away, across undulations
very rich in grazing. The camels, with their heads down snatching
plants and grass, moved uncomfortably for us cocked over the chute
of their sloped necks; yet we must let them eat, since we were
marching eighty miles a day, with halts to breathe only in the
brief gloamings of dawn and sunset.</p>

<p>Soon after daylight we turned west, and dismounted, short of the
railway among broken reefs of limestone, to creep carefully forward
until Atwi station lay beneath us. Its two stone houses (the first
only one hundred yards away) were in line, one obscuring the other.
Men were singing in them without disquietude. Their day was
beginning, and from the guard-room thin blue smoke curled into the
air, while a soldier drove out a flock of young sheep to crop the
rich meadow between the station and the valley.</p>

<p>This flock sealed the business, for after our horse-diet of dry
corn we craved meat. The Arabs' teeth gritted as they counted ten,
fifteen, twenty-five, twenty-seven. Zaal dropped into the valley
bed where the line crossed a bridge, and, with a party in file
behind him, crept along till he faced the station across the
meadow.</p>

<p>From our ridge we covered the station yard. We saw Zaal lean his
rifle on the bank, shielding his head with infinite precaution
behind grasses on the brink. He took slow aim at the coffee-sipping
officers and officials in shaded chairs, outside the ticket office.
As he pressed the trigger, the report overtook the crash of the
bullet against the stone wall, while the fattest man bowed slowly
in his chair and sank to the ground under the frozen stare of his
fellows.</p>

<p>An instant later Zaal's men poured in their volleys, broke from
the valley, and rushed forward: but the door of the northern house
clanged to, and rifles began to speak from behind its steel window
shutters. We replied, but soon saw our impotence, and ceased fire,
as did the enemy. The Sherarat drove the guilty sheep eastward into
the hills, where were the camels; everyone else ran down to join
Zaal, who was busy about the nearer and undefended building.</p>

<p>Near the height of plundering came a pause and panic. The Arabs
were such accustomed scouts that almost they felt danger before it
came, sense taking precautions before mind was persuaded. Swinging
down the line from the south was a trolley with four men, to whose
ears the grinding wheels had deadened our shots. The Rualla section
crept under a culvert three hundred yards up, while the rest of us
crowded silently by the bridge.</p>

<p>The trolley rolled unsuspectingly over the ambush, who came out
to line the bank behind, while we filed solemnly across the green
in front. The Turks slowed in horror, jumped off, and ran into the
rough: but our rifles cracked once more and they were dead. The
trolley brought to our feet its load of copper wire and telegraph
tools, with which we put 'earths' in the long-distance wire. Zaal
fired our half of the station, whose petrol-splashed woodwork
caught freely. The planks and cloth hangings twisted and jerked
convulsively as the flames licked them up. Meanwhile the Ageyl were
measuring out gelatine, and soon we lit their charges and destroyed
a culvert, many rails, and furlongs of telegraph. With the roar of
the first explosion our hundred knee-haltered camels rose smartly
to their feet, and at each following burst hopped more madly on
three legs till they shook off the rope-hitch about the fourth, and
drove out every way like scattered starlings into the void. Chasing
them and chasing the sheep took us three hours, for which
graciously the Turks gave law, or some of us would have had to walk
home.</p>

<p>We put a few miles between us and the railway before we sat down
to our feast of mutton. We were short of knives, and, after killing
the sheep in relay, had recourse to stray flints to cut them up. As
men unaccustomed to such expedients, we used them in the eolithic
spirit; and it came to me that if iron had been constantly rare we
should have chipped our daily tools skilfully as palasoliths:
whilst had we had no metal whatever, our art would have been
lavished on perfect and polished stones. Our one hundred and ten
men ate the best parts of twenty-four sheep at the sitting, while
the camels browsed about, or ate what we left over; for the best
riding-camels were taught to like cooked meat. When it was finished
we mounted, and rode through the night towards Bair: which we
entered without casualty, successful, well-fed, and enriched, at
dawn.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LII</h3>

<p>Nasir had done great work. A week's flour for us had come from
Tafileh, to restore our freedom of movement. We might well take
Akaba before we starved again. He had good letters from the
Dhumaniyeh, the Darausha, and the Dhiabat, three Howeitat clans on
Nagb el Shtar, the first difficult pass of the Maan-Akaba road.
They were willing to help us, and if they struck soon and strongly
at Aba el Lissan the great factor of surprise would probably mean
success to their effort.</p>

<p>My hopefulness misled me into another mad ride, which
miscarried. Yet the Turks did not take alarm. As my party rode in
there came a messenger post-haste from Nuri Shaalan. He brought
greetings, and Nuri's news that the Turks had called upon his son
Nawaf, as guide hostage, to take four hundred cavalry from Deraa
down the Sirhan in search of us. Nuri had sent his better-spared
nephew Trad, who was conducting them by devious routes in which men
and horses were suffering terribly from thirst. They were near
Nebk, our old camping ground. The Turkish Government would believe
us still in the Wadi till their cavalry returned. For Maan
especially they had no anxiety since the engineers who had blown up
Bair reported every source of water utterly destroyed, while the
wells of Jefer had been dealt with a few days earlier.</p>

<p>It might be that Jefer really was denied to us; but we were not
without hope that there, too, we should find the technical work of
demolition ill-done by these pitiful Turks. Dhaif-Allah, a leading
man of the Jazi Howeitat, one who came down to Wejh and swore
allegiance, had been present in Jefer when the King's Well was
fired by dynamite placed about its lip; and sent us secret word
from Maan that he had heard the upper stones clap together and key
over the mouth of the well. His conviction was that the shaft was
intact, and the clearing of it a few hours' work. We hoped so; and
rode away from Bair all in order, on June the twenty-eighth, to
find out.</p>

<p>Quickly we crossed the weird plain of Jefer. Next day by noon we
were at the wells. They seemed most thoroughly destroyed; and the
fear grew that we might find in them the first check to our scheme
of operations, a scheme so much too elaborate that a check might be
far reaching.</p>

<p>However, we went to the well&mdash;Auda's family
property&mdash;of which Dhaif Allah had told us the tale, and began
to sound about it. The ground rang hollow under our mallet, and we
called for volunteers able to dig and build. Some of the Ageyl came
forward, led by the Mirzugi, a capable camel boy of Nasir's. They
started with the few tools we had. The rest of us formed a ring
round the well-depression and watched them work, singing to them
and promising rewards of gold when they had found the water.</p>

<p>It was a hot task in the full glare of the summer sun; for the
Jefer plain was of hard mud, flat as the hand, blinding white with
salt, and twenty miles across; but time pressed, because if we
failed we might have to ride fifty miles in the night to the next
well. So we pushed the work by relays at speed through the midday
heat, turning into labourers all our amenable fellows. It made easy
digging, for the explosion which shifted the stones had loosened
the soil.</p>

<p>As they dug and threw out the earth, the core of the well rose
up like a tower of rough stones in the centre of the pit. Very
carefully we began to take away the ruined head of the pile:
difficult work, for the stones had become interlocked in their
fall; but this was the better sign, and our spirits rose. Before
sunset the workers shouted that there was no more packing-soil,
that the interstices between the blocks were clear, and they heard
the mud fragments which slipped through splashing many feet
below.</p>

<p>Half an hour later came a rush and rumble of stones in the
mouth, followed by a heavy splash and yells. We hurried down, and
by the Mirzugi's torch saw the well yawning open, no longer a tube,
but a deep bottle-shouldered pit, twenty feet across at the bottom,
which was black with water and white in the middle with spray where
the Ageyli who had been clearing when the key slipped was striking
out lustily in the effort not to drown. Everybody laughed down the
well at him, till at last Abdulla lowered him a noose of rope, and
we drew him up, very wet and angry, but in no way damaged by his
fall.</p>

<p>We rewarded the diggers, and feasted them on a weak camel, which
had failed in the march to-day; and then all night we watered,
while a squad of Ageyl, with a long chorus, steyned up to ground
level an eight-foot throat of mud and stones. At dawn the earth was
stamped in round this, and the well stood complete, as fit in
appearance as ever. Only the water was not very much. We worked it
the twenty-four hours without rest, and ran it to a cream; and
still some of our camels were not satisfied.</p>

<p>From Jefer we took action. Riders went forward into the
Dhumaniyeh tents to lead their promised attack against Fuweilah,
the block-house which covered the head of the pass of Aba el
Lissan. Our attack was planned for two days before the weekly
caravan which, from Maan, replenished the client garrisons.
Starvation would make reduction of these distant places easier, by
impressing on them how hopelessly they were cut off from their
friends.</p>

<p>We sat in Jefer meanwhile, waiting to hear the fortune of the
attack. On its success or failure would depend the direction of our
next march. The halt was not unpleasant, for our position had its
comic side. We were within sight of Maan, during those minutes of
the day in which the mirage did not make eyes and glasses useless;
and yet we strolled about admiring our new well-lip in complete
security, because the Turkish garrison believed water impossible
here or at Bair, and were hugging the pleasant idea that we were
now desperately engaged with their cavalry in Sirhan.</p>

<p>I hid under some bushes near the well for hours, against the
heat, very lazy, pretending to be asleep, the wide silk sleeve of
my pillow-arm drawn over my face as veil against the flies. Auda
sat up and talked like a river, telling his best stories in great
form. At last I reproved him with a smile, for talking too much and
doing too little. He sucked his lips with pleasure of the work to
come.</p>

<p>In the following dawn a tired horseman rode into our camp with
news that the Dhumaniyeh had fired on the Fuweilah post the
afternoon before as soon as our men had reached them. The surprise
had not been quite complete; the Turks manned their dry stone
breastworks and drove them off. The crestfallen Arabs drew back
into cover, and the enemy believing it only an ordinary tribal
affray, had made a mounted sortie upon the nearest encampment.</p>

<p>One old man, six women and seven children were its only
occupants. In their anger at finding nothing actively hostile or
able-bodied, the troopers smashed up the camp and cut the throats
of its helpless ones. The Dhumaniyeh on the hill-tops heard and saw
nothing till it was too late; but then, in their fury, they dashed
down across the return road of the murderers and cut them off
almost to the last man. To complete their vengeance they assaulted
the now weakly-garrisoned fort, carried it in the first fierceness
of their rush, and took no prisoners.</p>

<p>We were ready saddled; and within ten minutes had loaded and
marched for Ghadir el Haj, the first railway station south of Maan,
on our direct road for Aba el Lissan. Simultaneously, we detached a
small party to cross the railway just above Maan and create a
diversion on that side. Especially they were to threaten the great
herds of sick camels, casualties of the Palestine front, which the
Turks pastured in the Shobek plains till once more fit for
service.</p>

<p>We calculated that the news of their Fuweilah disaster would not
have reached Maan till the morning, and that they could not drive
in these camels (supposing our northern party missed them) and fit
out a relief expedition, before nightfall; and if we were then
attacking the line at Ghadir el Haj, they would probably divert the
relief thither, and so let us move on Akaba unmolested.</p>

<p>With this hope we rode steadily through the flowing mirage till
afternoon, when we descended on the line; and, having delivered a
long stretch of it from guards and patrols, began on the many
bridges of the captured section. The little garrison of Ghadir el
Haj sallied out with the valour of ignorance against us, but the
heat-haze blinded them, and we drove them off with loss.</p>

<p>They were on the telegraph, and would notify Maan, which beside,
could not fail to hear the repeated thuds of our explosion. It was
our aim to bring the enemy down upon us in the night; or rather
down here, where they would find no people but many broken bridges,
for we worked fast and did great damage. The drainage holes in the
spandrils held from three to five pounds of gelatine each. We,
firing our mines by short fuses, brought down the arch, shattered
the pier, and stripped the side walls, in no more than six minutes'
work. So we ruined ten bridges and many rails, and finished our
explosive.</p>

<p>After dusk, when our departure could not be seen, we rode five
miles westward of the line, to cover. There we made fires and baked
bread. Our meal, however, was not cooked before three horsemen
cantered up to report that a long column of new
troops&mdash;infantry and guns&mdash;had just appeared at Alba el
Lissan from Maan. The Dhumaniyeh, disorganized with victory, had
had to abandon their ground without fighting. They were at Batra
waiting for us. We had lost Aba el Lissan, the blockhouse, the
pass, the command of the Akaba road: without a shot being
fired.</p>

<p>We learned afterwards that this unwelcome and unwonted vigour on
the part of the Turks was accident. A relief battalion had reached
Maan that very day. The news of an Arab demonstration against
Fuweilah arrived simultaneously; and the battalion, which happened
to be formed up ready with its transport in the station yard, to
march to barracks, was hurriedly strengthened by a section of pack
artillery and some mounted men, and moved straight out as a
punitive column to rescue the supposedly besieged post.</p>

<p>They had left Maan in mid-morning and marched gently along the
motor road, the men sweating in the heat of this south country
after their native Caucasian snows, and drinking thirstily of every
spring. From Aba el Lissan they climbed uphill towards the old
blockhouse, which was deserted except for the silent vultures
flying above its walls in slow uneasy rings. The battalion
commander feared lest the sight be too much for his young troops,
and led them back to the roadside spring of Aba el Lissan, in its
serpentine narrow valley, where they camped all night in peace
about the water.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LIII</h3>

<p>Such news shook us into quick life. We threw our baggage across
our camels on the instant and set out over the rolling downs of
this end of the tableland of Syria. Our hot bread was in our hands,
and, as we ate, there mingled with it the taste of the dust of our
large force crossing the valley bottoms, and some taint of the
strange keen smell of the wormwood which overgrew the slopes. In
the breathless air of these evenings in the hills, after the long
days of summer, everything struck very acutely on the senses: and
when marching in a great column, as we were, the front camels
kicked up the aromatic dust-laden branches of the shrubs, whose
scent-particles rose into the air and hung in a long mist, making
fragrant the road of those behind.</p>

<p>The slopes were clean with the sharpness of wormwood, and the
hollows oppressive with the richness of their stronger, more
luxuriant growths. Our night-passage might have been through a
planted garden, and these varieties part of the unseen beauty of
successive banks of flowers. The noises too were very clear. Auda
broke out singing, away in front, and the men joined in from time
to time, with the greatness, the catch at heart, of an army moving
into battle.</p>

<p>We rode all night, and when dawn came were dismounting on the
crest of the hills between Batra and Aba el Lissan, with a
wonderful view westwards over the green and gold Guweira plain, and
beyond it to the ruddy mountains hiding Akaba and the sea. Gasim
abu Dumeik, head of the Dhumaniyeh, was waiting anxiously for us,
surrounded by his hard-bitten tribesmen, their grey strained faces
flecked with the blood of the fighting yesterday. There was a deep
greeting for Auda and Nasir. We made hurried plans, and scattered
to the work, knowing we could not go forward to Akaba with this
battalion in possession of the pass. Unless we dislodged it, our
two months' hazard and effort would fail before yielding even
first-fruits.</p>

<p>Fortunately the poor handling of the enemy gave us an unearned
advantage. They slept on, in the valley, while we crowned the hills
in wide circle about them unobserved. We began to snipe them
steadily in their positions under the slopes and rock-faces by the
water, hoping to provoke them out and up the hill in a charge
against us. Meanwhile, Zaal rode away with our horsemen and cut the
Maan telegraph and telephone in the plain.</p>

<p>This went on all day. It was terribly hot&mdash;hotter than ever
before I had felt it in Arabia&mdash;and the anxiety and constant
moving made it hard for us. Some even of the tough tribesmen broke
down under the cruelty of the sun, and crawled or had to be thrown
under rocks to recover in their shade. We ran up and down to supply
our lack of numbers by mobility, ever looking over the long ranges
of hill for a new spot from which to counter this or that Turkish
effort. The hill-sides were steep, and exhausted our breath, and
the grasses twined like little hands about our ankles as we ran,
and plucked us back. The sharp reefs of limestone which cropped out
over the ridges tore our feet, and long before evening the more
energetic men were leaving a rusty print upon the ground with every
stride.</p>

<p>Our rifles grew so hot with sun and shooting that they seared
our hands; and we had to be grudging of our rounds, considering
every shot and spending great pains to make it sure. The rocks on
which we flung ourselves for aim were burning, so that they
scorched our breasts and arms, from which later the skin drew off
in ragged sheets. The present smart made us thirst. Yet even water
was rare with us; we could not afford men to fetch enough from
Batra, and if all could not drink, it was better that none
should.</p>

<p>We consoled ourselves with knowledge that the enemy's enclosed
valley would be hotter than our open hills: also that they were
Turks, men of white meat, little apt for warm weather. So we clung
to them, and did not let them move or mass or sortie out against us
cheaply. They could do nothing valid in return. We were no targets
for their rifles, since we moved with speed, eccentrically. Also we
were able to laugh at the little mountain guns which they fired up
at us. The shells passed over our heads, to burst behind us in the
air; and yet, of course, for all that they could see from their
hollow place, fairly amongst us above the hostile summits of the
hill.</p>

<p>Just after noon I had a heat-stroke, or so pretended, for I was
dead weary of it all, and cared no longer how it went. So I crept
into a hollow where there was a trickle of thick water in a muddy
cup of the hills, to suck some moisture off its dirt through the
filter of my sleeve. Nasir joined me, panting like a winded animal,
with his cracked and bleeding lips shrunk apart in his distress:
and old Auda appeared, striding powerfully, his eyes bloodshot and
staring, his knotty face working with excitement.</p>

<p>He grinned with malice when he saw us lying there, spread out to
find coolness under the bank, and croaked at me harshly, 'Well, how
is it with the Howeitat? All talk and no work?' 'By God, indeed,'
spat I back again, for I was angry with everyone and with myself,
'they shoot a lot and hit a little.' Auda almost pale with rage,
and trembling, tore his head-cloth off and threw it on the ground
beside me. Then he ran back up the hill like a madman, shouting to
the men in his dreadful strained and rustling voice.</p>

<p>They came together to him, and after a moment scattered away
downhill. I feared things were going wrong, and struggled to where
he stood alone on the hill-top, glaring at the enemy: but all he
would say to me was, 'Get your camel if you want to see the old
man's work'. Nasir called for his camel and we mounted.</p>

<p>The Arabs passed before us into a little sunken place, which
rose to a low crest; and we knew that the hill beyond went down in
a facile slope to the main valley of Aba el Lissan, somewhat below
the spring. All our four hundred camel men were here tightly
collected, just out of sight of the enemy. We rode to their head,
and asked the Shimt what it was and where the horsemen had
gone.</p>

<p>He pointed over the ridge to the next valley above us, and said,
'With Auda there': and as he spoke yells and shots poured up in a
sudden torrent from beyond the crest. We kicked our camels
furiously to the edge, to see our fifty horsemen coming down the
last slope into the main valley like a run-away, at full gallop,
shooting from the saddle. As we watched, two or three went down,
but the rest thundered forward at marvellous speed, and the Turkish
infantry, huddled together under the cliff ready to cut their
desperate way out towards Maan, in the first dusk began to sway in
and out, and finally broke before the rush, adding their flight to
Auda's charge.</p>

<p>Nasir screamed at me, 'Come on', with his bloody mouth; and we
plunged our camels madly over the hill, and down towards the head
of the fleeing enemy. The slope was not too steep for a
camel-gallop, but steep enough to make their pace terrific, and
their course uncontrollable: yet the Arabs were able to extend to
right and left and to shoot into the Turkish brown. The Turks had
been too bound up in the terror of Auda's furious charge against
their rear to notice us as we came over the eastward slope: so we
also took them by surprise and in the flank; and a charge of ridden
camels going nearly thirty miles an hour was irresistible.</p>

<p>My camel, the Sherari racer, Naama, stretched herself out, and
hurled downhill with such might that we soon out-distanced the
others. The Turks fired a few shots, but mostly only shrieked and
turned to run: the bullets they did send at us were not very
harmful, for it took much to bring a charging camel down in a dead
heap.</p>

<p>I had got among the first of them, and was shooting, with a
pistol of course, for only an expert could use a rifle from such
plunging beasts; when suddenly my camel tripped and went down
emptily upon her face, as though pole-axed. I was torn completely
from the saddle, sailed grandly through the air for a great
distance, and landed with a crash which seemed to drive all the
power and feeling out of me. I lay there, passively waiting for the
Turks to kill me, continuing to hum over the verses of a
half-forgotten poem, whose rhythm something, perhaps the prolonged
stride of the camel, had brought back to my memory as we leaped
down the hill-side:</p>

<p>For Lord I was free of all Thy flowers, but I chose the world's
sad roses, And that is why my feet are torn and mine eyes are blind
with sweat.</p>

<p>While another part of my mind thought what a squashed thing I
should look when all that cataract of men and camels had poured
over.</p>

<p>After a long time I finished my poem, and no Turks came, and no
camel trod on me: a curtain seemed taken from my ears: there was a
great noise in front. I sat up and saw the battle over, and our men
driving together and cutting down the last remnants of the enemy.
My camel's body had lain behind me like a rock and divided the
charge into two streams: and in the back of its skull was the heavy
bullet of the fifth shot I fired.</p>

<p>Mohammed brought Obeyd, my spare camel, and Nasir came back
leading the Turkish commander, whom he had rescued, wounded, from
Mohammed el Dheilan's wrath. The silly man had refused to
surrender, and was trying to restore the day for his side with a
pocket pistol. The Howeitat were very fierce, for the slaughter of
their women on the day before had been a new and horrible side of
warfare suddenly revealed to them. So there were only a hundred and
sixty prisoners, many of them wounded; and three hundred dead and
dying were scattered over the open valleys.</p>

<center><a name="landing" id="landing"></a>
<p><img alt="" src="0100111h-images/0100111h-14.jpg">

</p>
</center>

<p>A few of the enemy got away, the gunners on their teams, and
some mounted men and officers with their Jazi guides. Mohammed el
Dheilan chased them for three miles into Mreigha, hurling insults
as he rode, that they might know him and keep out of his way. The
feud of Auda and his cousins had never applied to Mohammed, the
political-minded, who showed friendship to all men of his tribe
when he was alone to do so. Among the fugitives was Dhaif-Allah,
who had done us the good turn about the King's Well at Jefer.</p>

<p>Auda came swinging up on foot, his eyes glazed over with the
rapture of battle, and the words bubbling with incoherent speed
from his mouth. 'Work, work, where are words, work, bullets, Abu
Tayi'...and he held up his shattered field-glasses, his pierced
pistol-holster, and his leather sword-scabbard cut to ribbons. He
had been the target of a volley which had killed his mare under
him, but the six bullets through his clothes had left him
scathless.</p>

<p>He told me later, in strict confidence, that thirteen years
before he had bought an amulet Koran for one hundred and twenty
pounds and had not since been wounded. Indeed, Death had avoided
his face, and gone scurvily about killing brothers, sons and
followers. The book was a Glasgow reproduction, costing eighteen
pence; but Auda's deadliness did not let people laugh at his
superstition.</p>

<p>He was wildly pleased with the fight, most of all because he had
confounded me and shown what his tribe could do. Mohammed was wroth
with us for a pair of fools, calling me worse than Auda, since I
had insulted him by words like flung stones to provoke the folly
which had nearly killed us all: though it had killed only two of
us, one Rueili and one Sherari.</p>

<p>It was, of course, a pity to lose any one of our men, but time
was of importance to us, and so imperative was the need of
dominating Maan, to shock the little Turkish garrisons between us
and the sea into surrender, that I would have willingly lost much
more than two. On occasions like this Death justified himself and
was cheap.</p>

<p>I questioned the prisoners about themselves, and the troops in
Maan; but the nerve crisis had been too severe for them. Some gaped
at me and some gabbled, while others, with helpless weepings,
embraced my knees, protesting at every word from us that they were
fellow Moslems and my brothers in the faith.</p>

<p>Finally I got angry and took one of them aside and was rough to
him, shocking him by new pain into a half-understanding, when he
answered well enough, and reassuringly, that their battalion was
the only reinforcement, and it merely a reserve battalion; the two
companies in Maan would not suffice to defend its perimeter.</p>

<p>This meant we could take it easily, and the Howeitat clamoured
to be led there, lured by the dream of unmeasured loot, though what
we had taken here was a rich prize. However, Nasir, and afterwards
Auda, helped me stay them. We had no supports, no regulars, no
guns, no base nearer than Wejh, no communications, no money even,
for our gold was exhausted, and we were issuing our own notes,
promises to pay 'when Akaba is taken', for daily expenses. Besides,
a strategic scheme was not changed to follow up a tactical success.
We must push to the coast, and re-open sea-contact with Suez.</p>

<p>Yet it would be good to alarm Maan further: so we sent mounted
men to Mriegha and took it; and to Waheida and took it. News of
this advance, of the loss of the camels on the Shobek road, of the
demolition of El Haj, and of the massacre of their relieving
battalion all came to Maan together, and caused a very proper
panic. The military headquarters wired for help, the civil
authorities loaded their official archive into trucks, and left,
hot-speed, for Damascus.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LIV</h3>

<p>Meanwhile our Arabs had plundered the Turks, their baggage
train, and their camp; and soon after moonrise, Auda came to us and
said that we must move. It angered Nasir and myself. To-night there
was a dewy west wind blowing, and at Aba el Lissan's four thousand
feet, after the heat and burning passion of the day, its damp chill
struck very sharply on our wounds and bruises. The spring itself
was a thread of silvery water in a runnel of pebbles across
delightful turf, green and soft, on which we lay, wrapped in our
cloaks, wondering if something to eat were worth preparing: for we
were subject at the moment to the physical shame of success, a
reaction of victory, when it became clear that nothing was worth
doing, and that nothing worthy had been done.</p>

<p>Auda insisted. Partly it was superstition&mdash;he feared the
newly-dead around us; partly lest the Turks return in force; partly
lest other clans of the Howeitat take us, lying there broken and
asleep. Some were his blood enemies; others might say they came to
help our battle, and in the darkness thought we were Turks and
fired blindly. So we roused ourselves, and jogged the sorry
prisoners into line.</p>

<p>Most had to walk. Some twenty camels were dead or dying from
wounds which they had got in the charge, and others were over weak
to take a double burden. The rest were loaded with an Arab and a
Turk; but some of the Turkish wounded were too hurt to hold
themselves on pillion. In the end we had to leave about twenty on
the thick grass beside the rivulet, where at least they would not
die of thirst, though there was little hope of life or rescue for
them.</p>

<p>Nasir set himself to beg blankets for these abandoned men, who
were half-naked; and while the Arabs packed, I went off down the
valley where the fight had been, to see if the dead had any
clothing they could spare. But the Beduin had been beforehand with
me, and had stripped them to the skin. Such was their point of
honour.</p>

<p>To an Arab an essential part of the triumph of victory was to
wear the clothes of an enemy: and next day we saw our force
transformed (as to the upper half) into a Turkish force, each man
in a soldier's tunic: for this was a battalion straight from home,
very well found and dressed in new uniforms.</p>

<p>The dead men looked wonderfully beautiful. The night was shining
gently down, softening them into new ivory. Turks were
white-skinned on their clothed parts, much whiter than the Arabs;
and these soldiers had been very young. Close round them lapped the
dark wormwood, now heavy with dew, in which the ends of the
moonbeams sparkled like sea-spray. The corpses seemed flung so
pitifully on the ground, huddled anyhow in low heaps. Surely if
straightened they would be comfortable at last. So I put them all
in order, one by one, very wearied myself, and longing to be of
these quiet ones, not of the restless, noisy, aching mob up the
valley, quarrelling over the plunder, boasting of their speed and
strength to endure God knew how many toils and pains of this sort;
with death, whether we won or lost, waiting to end the history.</p>

<p>In the end our little army was ready, and wound slowly up the
height and beyond into a hollow sheltered from the wind; and there,
while the tired men slept, we dictated letters to the Sheikhs of
the coastal Howeitat, telling them of the victory, that they might
invest their nearest Turks, and hold them till we came. We had been
kind to one of the captured officers, a policeman despised by his
regular colleagues, and him we persuaded to be our Turkish scribe
to the commandants of Guweira, Kethera, and Hadra, the three posts
between us and Akaba, telling them that if our blood was not hot we
took prisoners, and that prompt surrender would ensure their good
treatment and safe delivery to Egypt.</p>

<p>This lasted till dawn, and then Auda marshalled us for the road,
and led us up the last mile of soft heath-clad valley between the
rounded hills. It was intimate and homelike till the last green
bank; when suddenly we realized it was the last, and beyond lay
nothing but clear air. The lovely change this time checked me with
amazement; and afterwards, however often we came, there was always
a catch of eagerness in the mind, a pricking forward of the camel
and straightening up to see again over the crest into openness.</p>

<p>Shtar hill-side swooped away below us for hundreds and hundreds
of feet, in curves like bastions, against which summer-morning
clouds were breaking: and from its foot opened the new earth of the
Guweira plain. Aba el Lissan's rounded limestone breasts were
covered with soil and heath, green, well watered. Guweira was a map
of pink sand, brushed over with streaks of watercourses, in a
mantle of scrub: and, out of this, and bounding this, towered
islands and cliffs of glowing sandstone, wind-scarped and
rain-furrowed, tinted celestially by the early sun.</p>

<p>After days of travel on the plateau in prison valleys, to meet
this brink of freedom was a rewarding vision, like a window in the
wall of life. We walked down the whole zigzag pass of Shtar, to
feel its excellence, for on our camels we rocked too much with
sleep to dare see anything. At the bottom the animals found a
matted thorn which gave their jaws pleasure; we in front made a
halt, rolled on to sand soft as a couch, and incontinently
slept.</p>

<p>Auda came. We pleaded that it was for mercy upon our broken
prisoners. He replied that they alone would die of exhaustion if we
rode, but if we dallied, both parties might die: for truly there
was now little water and no food. However, we could not help it,
and stopped that night short of Guweira, after only fifteen miles.
At Guweira lay Sheikh ibn Jad, balancing his policy to come down
with the stronger: and to-day we were the stronger, and the old fox
was ours. He met us with honeyed speeches. The hundred and twenty
Turks of the garrison were his prisoners; we agreed with him to
carry them at his leisure and their ease to Akaba.</p>

<p>To-day was the fourth of July. Time pressed us, for we were
hungry, and Akaba was still far ahead behind two defences. The
nearer post, Kethira, stubbornly refused parley with our flags.
Their cliff commanded the valley&mdash;a strong place which it
might be costly to take. We assigned the honour, in irony, to ibn
Jad and his unwearied men, advising him to try it after dark. He
shrank, made difficulties, pleaded the full moon: but we cut hardly
into this excuse, promising that to-night for a while there should
be no moon. By my diary there was an eclipse. Duly it came, and the
Arabs forced the post without loss, while the superstitious
soldiers were firing rifles and clanging copper pots to rescue the
threatened satellite.</p>

<p>Reassured we set out across the strandlike plain. Niazi Bey, the
Turkish battalion commander, was Nasir's guest, to spare him the
humiliation of Beduin contempt. Now he sidled up by me, and, his
swollen eyelids and long nose betraying the moroseness of the man,
began to complain that an Arab had insulted him with a gross
Turkish word. I apologized, pointing out that it must have been
learnt from the mouth of one of his Turkish fellow-governors. The
Arab was repaying Caesar.</p>

<p>Caesar, not satisfied, pulled from his pocket a wizened hunch of
bread to ask if it was fit breakfast for a Turkish officer. My
heavenly twins, foraging in Guweira, had bought, found, or stolen a
Turkish soldier's ration loaf; and we had quartered it. I said it
was not breakfast, but lunch and dinner, and perhaps to-morrow's
meals as well. I, a staff officer of the British Army (not less
well fed than the Turkish), had eaten mine with the relish of
victory. It was defeat, not bread, which stuck in his gullet, and I
begged him not to blame me for the issue of a battle imposed on
both our honours.</p>

<p>The narrows of Wadi Itm increased in intricate ruggedness as we
penetrated deeper. Below Kethira we found Turkish post after
Turkish post, empty. Their men had been drawn in to Khadra, the
entrenched position (at the mouth of Itm), which covered Akaba so
well against a landing from the sea. Unfortunately for them the
enemy had never imagined attack from the interior, and of ahl their
great works not one trench or post faced inland. Our advance from
so new a direction threw them into panic.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we were in contact with this main position, and
heard from the local Arabs that the subsidiary posts about Akaba
had been called in or reduced, so that only a last three hundred
men barred us from the sea. We dismounted for a council, to hear
that the enemy were resisting firmly, in bomb-proof trenches with a
new artesian well. Only it was rumoured that they had little
food.</p>

<p>No more had we. It was a deadlock. Our council swayed this way
and that. Arguments bickered between the prudent and the bold.
Tempers were short and bodies restless in the incandescent gorge
whose granite peaks radiated the sun in a myriad shimmering points
of light, and into the depths of whose tortuous bed no wind could
come to relieve the slow saturation of the air with heat.</p>

<p>Our numbers had swollen double. So thickly did the men crowd in
the narrow space, and press about us, that we broke up our council
twice or thrice, partly because it was not good they should
overhear us wrangling, partly because in the sweltering confinement
our unwashed smells offended us. Through our heads the heavy pulses
throbbed like clocks.</p>

<p>We sent the Turks summonses, first by white flag, and then by
Turkish prisoners, but they shot at both. This inflamed our Beduin,
and while we were yet deliberating a sudden wave of them burst up
on to the rocks and sent a hail of bullets spattering against the
enemy. Nasir ran out barefoot, to stop them, but after ten steps on
the burning ground screeched for sandals; while I crouched in my
atom of shadow, too wearied of these men (whose minds all wore my
livery) to care who regulated their febrile impulses.</p>

<p>However, Nasir prevailed easily. Farraj and Daud had been
ringleaders. For correction they were set on scorching rocks till
they should beg pardon. Daud yielded immediately; but Farraj, who,
for all his soft form, was of whipcord and much the master-spirit
of the two, laughed from his first rock, sat out the second
sullenly, and gave way with a bad grace only when ordered to a
third.</p>

<p>His stubbornness should have been stringently visited: but the
only punishment possible to our hands in this vagrant life was
corporal, which had been tried upon the pair so often and so
uselessly that I was sick of it. If confined this side of cruelty
the surface pain seemed only to irritate their muscles into
activities wilder than those for which they had been condemned.
Their sins were elvish gaiety, the thoughtlessness of unbalanced
youth, the being happy when we were not; and for such follies to
hurt them mercilessly like criminals till their self-control melted
and their manhood was lost under the animal distress of their
bodies, seemed to me degrading, almost an impiety towards two
sunlit beings, on whom the shadow of the world had not yet
fallen&mdash;the most gallant, the most enviable, I knew.</p>

<p>We had a third try to communicate with the Turks, by means of a
little conscript, who said that he understood how to do it. He
undressed, and went down the valley in little more than boots. An
hour later he proudly brought us a reply, very polite, saying that
in two days, if help did not come from Maan, they would
surrender.</p>

<p>Such folly (for we could not hold our men indefinitely) might
mean the massacre of every Turk. I held no great brief for them,
but it was better they be not killed, if only to spare us the pain
of seeing it. Besides, we might have suffered loss. Night
operations in the staring moon would be nearly as exposed as day.
Nor was this, like Aba el Lissan, an imperative battle.</p>

<p>We gave our little man a sovereign as earnest of reward, walked
down close to the trenches with him, and sent in for an officer to
speak with us. After some hesitation this was achieved, and we
explained the situation on the road behind us; our growing forces;
and our short control over their tempers. The upshot was that they
promised to surrender at daylight. So we had another sleep (an
event rare enough to chronicle) in spite of our thirst.</p>

<p>Next day at dawn fighting broke out on all sides, for hundreds
more hill-men, again doubling our number, had come in the night;
and, not knowing the arrangement, began shooting at the Turks, who
defended themselves. Nasir went out, with ibn Dgheithir and his
Ageyl marching in fours, down the open bed of the valley. Our men
ceased fire. The Turks then stopped, for their rank and file had no
more fight in them and no more food, and thought we were well
supplied. So the surrender went off quietly after all.</p>

<p>As the Arabs rushed in to plunder I noticed an engineer in grey
uniform, with red beard and puzzled blue eyes; and spoke to him in
German. He was the well-borer, and knew no Turkish. Recent doings
had amazed him, and he begged me to explain what we meant. I said
that we were a rebellion of the Arabs against the Turks. This, it
took him time to appreciate. He wanted to know who was our leader.
I said the Sherif of Mecca. He supposed he would be sent to Mecca.
I said rather to Egypt. He inquired the price of sugar, and when I
replied, 'cheap and plentiful', he was glad.</p>

<p>The loss of his belongings he took philosophically, but was
sorry for the well, which a little work would have finished as his
monument. He showed me where it was, with the pump only half-built.
By pulling on the sludge bucket we drew enough delicious clear
water to quench our thirsts. Then we raced through a driving
sandstorm down to Akaba, four miles further, and splashed into the
sea on July the sixth, just two months after our setting out from
Wejh.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LV</h3>

<p>Through the whirling dust we perceived that Akaba was all a
ruin. Repeated bombardments by French and English warships had
degraded the place to its original rubbish. The poor houses stood
about in a litter, dirty and contemptible, lacking entirely that
dignity which the durability of their time-challenging bones
conferred on ancient remains.</p>

<p>We wandered into the shadowed grove of palms, at the very break
of the splashing waves, and there sat down to watch our men
streaming past as lines of flushed vacant faces without message for
us. For months Akaba had been the horizon of our minds, the goal:
we had had no thought, we had refused thought, of anything beside.
Now, in achievement, we were a little despising the entities which
had spent their extremest effort on an object whose attainment
changed nothing radical either in mind or body.</p>

<p>In the blank light of victory we could scarcely identify
ourselves. We spoke with surprise, sat emptily, fingered upon our
white skirts; doubtful if we could understand or learn whom we
were. Others' noise was a dreamlike unreality, a singing in ears
drowned deep in water. Against the astonishment of this unasked-for
continued life we did not know how to turn our gift to account.
Especially for me was it hard, because though my sight was sharp, I
never saw men's features: always I peered beyond, imagining for
myself a spirit-reality of this or that: and to-day each man owned
his desire so utterly that he was fulfilled in it, and became
meaningless.</p>

<p>Hunger called us out of our trance. We had now seven hundred
prisoners in addition to our own five hundred men and two thousand
expectant allies. We had not any money (or, indeed, a market); and
the last meal had been two days ago. In our riding-camels we
possessed meat enough for six weeks, but it was poor diet, and a
dear one, indulgence in which would bring future immobility upon
us.</p>

<p>Green dates loaded the palms overhead. Their taste, raw, was
nearly as nasty as the want they were to allay. Cooking left them
still deplorable; so we and our prisoners sadly faced a dilemma of
constant hunger, or of violent diurnal pains more proper to
gluttony than to our expedient eating. The assiduous food-habit of
a lifetime had trained the English body to the pitch of producing a
punctual nervous excitation in the upper belly at the fixed hour of
each meal: and we sometimes gave the honoured name of hunger to
this sign that our gut had cubic space for more stuff. Arab hunger
was the cry of a long-empty labouring body fainting with weakness.
They lived on a fraction of our bulk-food, and their systems made
exhaustive use of what they got A nomad army did not dung the earth
richly with by-products.</p>

<p>Our forty-two officer prisoners were an intolerable nuisance.
They were disgusted when they found how ill-provided we were:
indeed they refused to believe it was not a fraud to annoy them,
and plagued us for delicacies, as though Cairo lay hidden in our
saddlebags. To escape them Nasir and I slept. Always we tried to
signalize each accomplished stage by this little extra peace; for
in the desert we were only left alone by men and flies when lying
on our backs, with a cloak to shield our faces, asleep or feigning
sleep.</p>

<p>In the evening, our first reaction against success having passed
off, we began to think how we should keep Akaba, having gained it.
We settled that Auda should return to Guweira. He would there be
covered by the descent of Shtar, and the Guweira sands. In fact, as
safe as need be. But we would make him safer yet, in excess of
precaution. We would put an outpost twenty miles to his north, in
the impregnable rock-ruins of Nabathean Petra, and link them to him
by a post at Delagha. Auda should also send men to Batra so that
his Howeitat lie in a semicircle of four positions round the edge
of the Maan highlands, covering every way towards Akaba.</p>

<p>These four positions existed independently. The enemy had
swallowed Goltz' impertinent generalities about the interdependence
of strong-posts. We looked to their delivering a spirited drive
against one, and sitting afterwards in it dazed for an
uncomfortable month, unable to advance for the threat of the
remaining three, scratching their heads and wondering why the
others did not fall.</p>

<p>Supper taught us the urgent need to send news over the one
hundred and fifty miles to the British at Suez for a relief-ship. I
decided to go across myself with a party of eight, mostly Howeitat,
on the best camels in the force&mdash;one even was the famous
Jedhah, the seven-year-old for whom the Nowasera had fought the
beni Sakhr. As we rode round the bay we discussed the manner of our
journey. If we went gently, sparing the animals, they might fail
with hunger. If we rode hard they might break down with exhaustion
or sore feet in mid-desert.</p>

<p>Finally we agreed to keep at a walk, however tempting the
surface, for so many hours of the twenty-four as our endurance
would allow. On such time-tests the man, especially if he were a
foreigner, usually collapsed before the beast: in particular, I had
ridden fifty miles a day for the last month, and was near my limit
of strength. If I held out, we should reach Suez in fifty hours of
a march; and, to preclude cooking-halts upon the road, we carried
lumps of boiled camel and broiled dates in a rag behind our
saddles.</p>

<p>We rode up the Sinai scarp by the pilgrims' granite-hewn road
with its gradient of one in three and a half. The climb was severe,
because hasty, and when we reached the crest before sunset both men
and camels were trembling with fatigue. One camel we thence sent
back as unfit for the trip: with the others we pushed out across
the plain to some thorn-scrub, where they cropped for an hour.</p>

<p>Near midnight we reached Themed, the only wells on our route, in
a clean valley-sweep below the deserted guard-house of the Sinai
police. We let the camels breathe, gave them water and drank
ourselves. Then forward again, plodding through a silence of night
so intense that continually we turned round in the saddles at
fancied noises away there by the cloak of stars. But the activity
lay in ourselves, in the crackling of our passage through the
undergrowth perfumed like ghost-flowers about us.</p>

<p>We marched into the very slow dawn. At sun-up we were far out in
the plain through which sheaves of watercourses gathered towards
Arish: and we stopped to give our camels a few minutes' mockery of
pasture. Then again in the saddle till noon, and past noon, when
behind the mirage rose the lonely ruins of Nakhl. These we left on
our right. At sunset we halted for an hour.</p>

<p>Camels were sluggish, and ourselves utterly wearied; but Motlog,
the one-eyed owner of Jedhah, called us to action. We remounted,
and at a mechanical walk climbed the Mitla Hills. The moon came out
and their tops, contoured in form-lines of limestone strata, shone
as though crystalline with snow.</p>

<p>In the dawn we passed a melon field, sown by some adventurous
Arab in this no-man's-land between the armies. We halted another of
our precious hours, loosing the disgusted camels to search the
sand-valleys for food while we cracked the unripe melons and cooled
our chapped lips on their pithy flesh. Then again forward, in the
heat of the new day; though the canal valley, constantly refreshed
by breezes from the Gulf of Suez, was never too oppressive.</p>

<p>By midday we were through the dunes, after a happy switchback
ride up and down their waves, and out on the flatter plain.
<i>Suez</i> was to be guessed at, as the frise of indeterminate
points mowing and bobbing in the mirage of the canal-hollow far in
front.</p>

<p>We reached great trench-lines, with forts and barbed wire, roads
and railways, falling to decay. We passed them without challenge.
Our aim was the Shatt, a post opposite Suez on the Asiatic bank of
the Canal, and we gained it at last near three in the afternoon,
forty-nine hours out of Akaba. For a tribal raid this would have
been fair time, and we were tired men before ever we started.</p>

<p>Shatt was in unusual disorder, without even a sentry to stop us,
plague having appeared there two or three days before. So the old
camps had been hurriedly cleared, left standing, while the troops
bivouacked out in the clean desert. Of course we knew nothing of
this, but hunted in the empty offices till we found a telephone. I
rang up Suez headquarters and said I wanted to come across.</p>

<p>They regretted that it was not their business. The Inland Water
Transport managed transit across the Canal, after their own
methods. There was a sniff of implication that these methods were
not those of the General Staff. Undaunted, for I was never a
partisan of my nominal branch of the service, I rang up the office
of the Water Board, and explained that I had just arrived in Shatt
from the desert with urgent news for Headquarters. They were sorry,
but had no free boats just then. They would be sure to send first
thing in the morning, to carry me to the Quarantine Department: and
rang off.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LVI</h3>

<p>Now I had been four months in Arabia continually on the move. In
the last four weeks I had ridden fourteen hundred miles by camel,
not sparing myself anything to advance the war; but I refused to
spend a single superfluous night with my familiar vermin. I wanted
a bath, and something with ice in it to drink: to change these
clothes, all sticking to my saddle sores in filthiness: to eat
something more tractable than green date and camel sinew. I got
through again to the Inland Water Transport and talked like
Chrysostom. It had no effect, so I became vivid. Then, once more,
they cut me off. I was growing very vivid, when friendly northern
accents from the military exchange floated down the line: It's no
bluidy good, sir, talking to them fookin water boogers.'</p>

<p>This expressed the apparent truth; and the broad-spoken operator
worked me through to the Embarkation Office. Here, Lyttleton, a
major of the busiest, had added to his innumerable labours that of
catching Red Sea warships one by one as they entered Suez roads and
persuading them (how some loved it!) to pile high their decks with
stores for Wejh or Yenbo. In this way he ran our thousands of bales
and men, free, as a by-play in his routine; and found time as well
to smile at the curious games of us curious folk.</p>

<p>He never failed us. As soon as he heard who and where I was, and
what was not happening in the Inland Water Transport, the
difficulty was over. His launch was ready: would be at the Shatt in
half an hour. I was to come straight to his office: and not explain
(till perhaps now after the war) that a common harbour launch had
entered the sacred canal without permission of the Water
Directorate. All fell out as he said. I sent my men and camels
north to Kubri; where, by telephone from Suez, I would prepare them
rations and shelter in the animal camp on the Asiatic shore. Later,
of course, came their reward of hectic and astonishing days in
Cairo.</p>

<p>Lyttleton saw my weariness and let me go at once to the hotel.
Long ago it had seemed poor, but now was become splendid; and,
after conquering its first hostile impression of me and my dress,
it produced the hot baths and the cold drinks (six of them) and the
dinner and bed of my dreams. A most willing intelligence officer,
warned by spies of a disguised European in the Sinai Hotel, charged
himself with the care of my men at Kubri and provided tickets and
passes for me to Cairo next day.</p>

<p>The strenuous 'control' of civilian movement in the canal zone
entertained a dull journey. A mixed body of Egyptian and British
military police came round the train, interrogating us and
scrutinizing our passes. It was proper to make war on permit-men,
so I replied crisply in fluent English, 'Sherif of Mecca-Staff, to
their Arabic inquiries. They were astonished. The sergeant begged
my pardon: he had not expected to hear. I repeated that I was in
the Staff uniform of the Sherif of Mecca. They looked at my bare
feet, white silk robes and gold head-rope and dagger. Impossible!
'What army, sir?' 'Meccan.' 'Never heard of it: don't know the
uniform.' 'Would you recognize a Montenegrin dragoon?'</p>

<p>This was a home-thrust. Any Allied troops in uniform might
travel without pass. The police did not know all the Allies, much
less their uniforms. Mine might really be some rare army. They fell
back into the corridor and watched me while they wired up the line.
Just before Ismailia, a perspiring intelligence officer in wet
khaki boarded the train to check my statements. As we had almost
arrived I showed him the special pass with which the forethought of
Suez had twice-armed my innocence. He was not pleased.</p>

<p>At Ismailia passengers for Cairo changed, to wait until the
express from Port Said was due. In the other train shone an opulent
saloon, from which descended Admiral Wemyss and Burmester and
Neville, with a very large and superior general. A terrible tension
grew along the platform as the party marched up and down it in
weighty talk. Officers saluted once: twice: still they marched up
and down. Three times was too much. Some withdrew to the fence and
stood permanently to attention: these were the mean souls. Some
fled: these were the contemptibles. Some turned to the bookstall
and studied book-backs avidly: these were shy. Only one was
blatant.</p>

<p>Burmester's eye caught my staring. He wondered who it was, for I
was burned crimson and very haggard with travel. (Later I found my
weight to be less than seven stone.) However, he answered; and I
explained the history of our unannounced raid on Akaba. It excited
him. I asked that the admiral send a storeship there at once.
Burmester said the <i>Dufferin</i>, which came in that day, should
load all the food in Suez, go straight to Akaba, and bring back the
prisoners. (Splendid!) He would order it himself, not to interrupt
the Admiral and Allenby.</p>

<p>'Allenby! what's he doing here?' cried I. 'Oh, he's in command
now.' 'And Murray?' 'Gone home.' This was news of the biggest,
importantly concerning me: and I climbed back and fell to wondering
if this heavy, rubicund man was like ordinary generals, and if we
should have trouble for six months teaching him. Murray and Belinda
had begun so tiresomely that our thought those first days had been,
not to defeat the enemy, but to make our own chiefs let us live.
Only by time and performance had we converted Sir Archibald and his
Chief of Staff, who in their last months, wrote to the War Office
commending the Arab venture, and especially Feisal in it. This was
generous of them and our secret triumph, for they were an odd pair
in one chariot&mdash;Murray all brains and claws, nervous, elastic,
changeable; Lynden Bell so solidly built up of layers of
professional opinion, glued together after Government testing and
approval, and later trimmed and polished to standard pitch.</p>

<p>At Cairo my sandalled feet slip-slapped up the quiet Savoy
corridors to Clayton, who habitually cut the lunch hour to cope
with his thronging work. As I entered he glanced up from his desk
with a muttered 'Mush fadi' (Anglo-Egyptian for 'engaged') but I
spoke and got a surprised welcome. In Suez the night before I had
scribbled a short report; so we had to talk only of what needed
doing. Before the hour ended, the Admiral rang up to say that the
<i>Dufferin</i> was loading flour for her emergency trip.</p>

<center><a name="wind" id="wind"></a>
<p><img alt="" src="0100111h-images/0100111h-16.jpg">
</p>
</center>

<p>Clayton drew sixteen thousand pounds in gold and got an escort
to take it to Suez by the three o'clock train. This was urgent,
that Nasir might be able to meet his debts. The notes we had issued
at Bair, Jefer and Guweira were pencilled promises, on army
telegraph forms, to pay so much to bearer in Akaba. It was a great
system, but no one had dared issue notes before in Arabia, because
the Beduins had neither pockets in their shirts nor strong-rooms in
their tents, and notes could not be buried for safety. So there was
an unconquerable prejudice against them, and for our good name it
was essential that they be early redeemed.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in the hotel, I tried to find clothes less publicly
exciting than my Arab get-up; but the moths had corrupted all my
former store, and it was three days before I became normally
ill-dressed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I heard of Allenby's excellence, and of the last
tragedy of Murray, that second attack on Gaza, which London forced
on one too weak or too politic to resist; and how we went into it,
everybody, generals and staff-officers, even soldiers, convinced
that we should lose. Five thousand eight hundred was the casualty
bill. They said Allenby was getting armies of fresh men, and
hundreds of guns, and all would be different.</p>

<p>Before I was clothed the Commander-in-Chief sent for me,
curiously. In my report, thinking of Saladin and Abu Obeida, I had
stressed the strategic importance of the eastern tribes of Syria,
and their proper use as a threat to the communications of
Jerusalem. This jumped with his ambitions, and he wanted to weigh
me.</p>

<p>It was a comic interview, for Allenby was physically large and
confident, and morally so great that the comprehension of our
littleness came slow to him. He sat in his chair looking at
me&mdash;not straight, as his custom was, but sideways, puzzled. He
was newly from France, where for years he had been a tooth of the
great machine grinding the enemy. He was full of Western ideas of
gun power and weight&mdash;the worst training for our
war&mdash;but, as a cavalryman, was already half persuaded to throw
up the new school, in this different world of Asia, and accompany
Dawnay and Chetwode along the worn road of manoeuvre and movement;
yet he was hardly prepared for anything so odd as myself&mdash;a
little bare-footed silk-skirted man offering to hobble the enemy by
his preaching if given stores and arms and a fund of two hundred
thousand sovereigns to convince and control his converts.</p>

<p>Allenby could not make out how much was genuine performer and
how much charlatan. The problem was working behind his eyes, and I
left him unhelped to solve it. He did not ask many questions, nor
talk much, but studied the map and listened to my unfolding of
Eastern Syria and its inhabitants. At the end he put up his chin
and said quite directly, Well, I will do for you what I can', and
that ended it. I was not sure how far I had caught him; but we
learned gradually that he meant exactly what he said; and that what
General Allenby could do was enough for his very greediest
servant.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LVII</h3>

<p>Upon Clayton I opened myself completely. Akaba had been taken on
my plan by my effort. The cost of it had fallen on my brains and
nerves. There was much more I felt inclined to do, and capable of
doing:&mdash;if he thought I had earned the right to be my own
master. The Arabs said that each man believed his ticks to be
gazelles: I did, fervently.</p>

<p>Clayton agreed they were spirited and profitable ticks; but
objected that actual command could not be given to an officer
junior to the rest. He suggested Joyce as commanding officer at
Akaba: a notion which suited me perfectly. Joyce was a man in whom
one could rest against the world: a serene, unchanging, comfortable
spirit. His mind, like a pastoral landscape, had four corners to
its view: cared-for, friendly, limited, displayed.</p>

<p>He had won golden opinions at Rabegh and Wejh, practising that
very labour of building up an army and a base, which would be
necessary at Akaba. Clayton-like, he was a good cartilage to set
between opposing joints, but he had more laughter than Clayton,
being broad and Irish and much over six feet in height. His nature
was to be devoted to the nearest job without straining on his toes
after longer horizons. Also, he was more patient than any recorded
archangel, and only smiled that jolly smile of his whenever I came
in with revolutionary schemes, and threw new ribbons of fancy about
the neck of the wild thing he was slowly rearing.</p>

<p>The rest was easy. For supply officer we would have Goslett, the
London business man who had made chaotic Wejh so prim. The
aeroplanes could not yet be moved; but the armoured cars might come
straight away, and a guard-ship if the Admiral was generous. We
rang up Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, who was very generous: his flagship,
the <i>Euryalus</i>, should sit there for the first few weeks.</p>

<p>Genius, this was, for in Arabia ships were esteemed by number of
funnels, and the <i>Euryalus</i>, with four, was exceptional in
ships. Her great reputation assured the mountains that we were
indeed the winning side: and her huge crew, by the prompting of
Everard Feilding, for fun built us a good pier.</p>

<p>On the Arab side, I asked that the expensive and difficult Wejh
be closed down, and Feisal come to Akaba with his full army. A
sudden demand, it seemed to Cairo. So I went further, pointing out
that the Yenbo-Medina sector also became a back-number; and advised
the transfer to Akaba of the stores, money, and officers now
devoted to Ali and Abdulla. This was ruled to be impossible. But my
wish regarding Wejh was granted me in compromise.</p>

<p>Then I showed that Akaba was Allenby's right flank, only one
hundred miles from his centre, but eight hundred miles from Mecca.
As the Arabs prospered their work would be done more and more in
the Palestine sphere. So it was logical that Feisal be transferred
from the area of King Hussein to become an army commander of the
Allied expedition of Egypt under Allenby.</p>

<p>This idea held difficulties. Would Feisal accept?5 I had talked
it over with him in Wejh months ago. The High Commissioner?'
Feisal's army had been the largest and most distinguished of the
Hejaz units: its future would not be dull. General Wingate had
assumed full responsibility for the Arab Movement in its darkest
moment, at great risk in reputation: dare we ask him to relinquish
its advance-guard now on the very threshold of success?</p>

<p>Clayton, knowing Wingate very well, was not afraid to broach the
idea to him: and Wingate replied promptly that if Allenby could
make direct and large use of Feisal, it would be both his duty and
his pleasure to give him up for the good of the show.</p>

<p>A third difficulty of the transfer might be King Hussein: an
obstinate, narrow-minded, suspicious character, little likely to
sacrifice a pet vanity for unity of control. His opposition would
endanger the scheme: and I offered to go down to talk him over,
calling on the way to get from Feisal such recommendations of the
change as should fortify the powerful letters which Wingate was
writing to the King. This was accepted. The <i>Dufferin</i> on
returning from Akaba, was detailed to take me to Jidda for the new
mission.</p>

<p>She took two days to reach Wejh. Feisal, with Joyce, Newcombe,
and all the army, was at Jeida, one hundred miles inland. Stent,
who had succeeded Ross in command of the Arabian flight, sent me up
by air; so we crossed comfortably at sixty miles an hour the hills
learned toilsomely on camel-back.</p>

<p>Feisal was eager to hear the details of Akaba, and laughed at
our prentice wars. We sat and made plans the whole night. He wrote
to his father; ordered his camel corps to march upon Akaba
forthwith; and made first arrangements towards getting Jaafar Pasha
and his army ferried up in the long-suffering <i>Hardinge</i>.</p>

<p>At dawn they flew me back to Wejh, and, an hour after, the
<i>Dufferin</i> was making for Jidda, where things became easy for
me with Wilson's powerful help. To render Akaba, our most promising
sector, strong, he sent up a shipload of reserve stores and
ammunition, and offered us any of his officers. Wilson was of the
Wingate school.</p>

<p>The King came down from Mecca and talked discursively. Wilson
was the royal touchstone, by which to try doubtful courses. Thanks
to him, the proposed transfer of Feisal to Allenby was accepted at
once, King Hussein taking the opportunity to stress his complete
loyalty to our alliance. Then, changing his subject, as usual
without obvious coherence, he began to expose his religious
position, neither strong Shia nor strong Surini, aiming rather at a
simple pre-schism interpretation of the faith. In foreign politics
he betrayed a mind as narrow as it had been broad in unworldly
things; with much of that destructive tendency of little men to
deny the honesty of opponents. I grasped something of the fixed
jealousy which made the modern Feisal suspect in his father's
court; and realized how easily mischief-makers could corrode the
King.</p>

<p>While we played so interestingly at Jidda, two abrupt telegrams
from Egypt shattered our peace. The first reported that the
Howei-tat were in treasonable correspondence with Maan. The second
connected Auda with the plot. This dismayed us. Wilson had
travelled with Auda, and formed the inevitable judgement of his
perfect sincerity: yet Mohammed el Dheilan was capable of double
play, and ibn Jad and his friends were still uncertain. We prepared
to leave at once for Akaba. Treachery had not been taken into
account when Nasir and I had built our plan for the town's
defence.</p>

<p>Fortunately the <i>Hardinge</i> was in harbour for us. On the
third afternoon we were in Akaba, where Nasir had no notion that
anything was wrong. I told him only of my wish to greet Auda: he
lent me a swift camel and a guide; and at dawn we found Auda and
Mohammed and Zaal all in a tent at Guweira. They were confused when
I dropped in on them, unheralded; but protested that all was well.
We fed together as friends.</p>

<p>Others of the Howeitat came in, and there was gay talk about the
war. I distributed the King's presents; and told them, to their
laughter, that Nasir had got his month's leave to Mecca. The King,
an enthusiast for the revolt, believed that his servants should
work as manfully. So he would not allow visits to Mecca, and the
poor men found continual military service heavy banishment from
their wives. We had jested a hundred times that, if he took Akaba,
Nasir would deserve a holiday; but he had not really believed in
its coming until I gave him Hussein's letter the evening before. In
gratitude he sold me Ghazala, the regal camel he won from the
Howeitat As her owner I became of new interest to the Abu Tayi.</p>

<p>After lunch, by pretence of sleep, I got rid of the visitors;
and then abruptly asked Auda and Mohammed to walk with me to see
the ruined fort and reservoir. When we were alone I touched on
their present correspondence with the Turks. Auda began to laugh;
Mohammed to look disgusted. At last they explained elaborately that
Mohammed had taken Auda's seal and written to the Governor of Maan,
offering to desert the Sherif s cause. The Turk had replied gladly,
promising great rewards. Mohammed asked for something on account.
Auda then heard of it, waited till the messenger with presents was
on his way, caught him, robbed him to the skin: and was denying
Mohammed a share of the spoils. A farcical story, and we laughed
richly over it: but there was more behind.</p>

<p>They were angry that no guns or troops had yet come to their
support; and that no rewards had been given them for taking Akaba.
They were anxious to know how I had learnt of their secret
dealings, and how much more I knew. We were on a slippery ledge. I
played on their fear by my unnecessary amusement, quoting in
careless laughter, as if they were my own words, actual phrases of
the letters they had exchanged. This created the impression
desired.</p>

<p>Parenthetically I told them Feisal's entire army was coming up;
and how Allenby was sending rifles, guns, high explosive, food and
money to Akaba. Finally I suggested that Auda's present expenses in
hospitality must be great; would it help if I advanced something of
the great gift Feisal would make him, personally, when he arrived?
Auda saw that the immediate moment would not be unprofitable: that
Feisal would be highly profitable: and that the Turks would be
always with him if other resources failed. So he agreed, in a very
good temper, to accept my advance: and with it to keep the Howeitat
well-fed and cheerful.</p>

<p>It was near sunset. Zaal had killed a sheep and we ate again in
real amity. Afterwards I remounted, with Mufaddih (to draw Auda's
allowance), and Abd el Rahman, a servant of Mohammed's who, so he
whispered me, would receive any little thing I wished to send him
separately. We rode all night towards Akaba, where I roused Nasir
from sleep, to run over our last business. Then I paddled out in a
derelict canoe from 'Euryalus jetty' to the <i>Hardinge</i> just as
the first dawn crept down the western peaks.</p>

<p>I went below, bathed, and slept till mid-morning. When I came on
deck the ship was rushing grandly down the narrow gulf under full
steam for Egypt. My appearance caused a sensation, for they had not
dreamed I could reach Guweira, assure myself, and get back in less
than six or seven days, to catch a later steamer.</p>

<p>We rang up Cairo and announced that the situation at Guweira was
thoroughly good, and no treachery abroad. This may have been hardly
true; but since Egypt kept us alive by stinting herself, we must
reduce impolitic truth to keep her confident and ourselves a
legend. The crowd wanted book-heroes, and would not understand how
more human old Auda was because, after battle and murder, his heart
yearned towards the defeated enemy now subject, at his free choice,
to be spared or killed: and therefore never so lovely.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LVIII</h3>

<p>Again there fell a pause in my work and again my thoughts built
themselves up. Till Feisal and Jaafar and Joyce and the army came
we could do little but think: yet that, for our own credit, was the
essential process. So far our war had had but the one studied
operation&mdash;the march on Akaba. Such haphazard playing with the
men and movements of which we had assumed the leadership disgraced
our minds. I vowed to know henceforward, before I moved, where I
was going and by what roads.</p>

<p>At Wejh the Hejaz war was won: after Akaba it was ended.
Feisal's army had cleared off its Arabian liabilities and now,
under General Allenby the joint Commander-in-Chief, its role was to
take part in the military deliverance of Syria.</p>

<p>The difference between Hejaz and Syria was the difference
between the desert and the sown. The problem which faced us was one
of character&mdash;the learning to become civil. Wadi Musa village
was our first peasant recruit. Unless we became peasants too, the
independence movement would get no further.</p>

<p>It was good for the Arab Revolt that so early in its growth this
change imposed itself. We had been hopelessly labouring to plough
waste lands; to make nationality grow in a place full of the
certainty of God, that upas certainty which forbade all hope. Among
the tribes our creed could be only like the desert grass&mdash;a
beautiful swift seeming of spring; which, after a day's heat, fell
dusty. Aims and ideas must be translated into tangibility by
material expression. The desert men were too detached to express
the one; too poor in goods, too remote from complexity, to carry
the other. If we would prolong our life, we must win into the
ornamented lands; to the villages where roofs or fields held men's
eyes downward and near; and begin our campaign as we had begun that
in Wadi Ais, by a study of the map, and a recollection of the
nature of this our battleground of Syria.</p>

<p>Our feet were upon its southern boundary. To the east stretched
the nomadic desert. To the west Syria was limited by the
Mediterranean, from Gaza to Alexandretta. On the north the Turkish
populations of Anatolia gave it an end. Within these limits the
land was much parcelled up by natural divisions. Of them the first
and greatest was longitudinal; the rugged spine of mountains which,
from north to south, divided a coast strip from a wide inland
plain. These areas had climatic differences so marked that they
made two countries, two races almost, with their respective
populations. The shore Syrians lived in different houses, fed and
worked differently, used an Arabic differing by inflection and in
tone from that of the inlanders. They spoke of the interior
unwillingly, as of a wild land of blood and terror.</p>

<p>The inland plain was sub-divided geographically into strips by
rivers. These valleys were the most stable and prosperous tillages
of the country. Their inhabitants reflected them: contrasting, on
the desert side, with the strange, shifting populations of the
borderland, wavering eastward or westward with the season, living
by their wits, wasted by drought and locusts, by Beduin raids; or,
if these failed them, by their own incurable blood feuds.</p>

<p>Nature had so divided the country into zones. Man, elaborating
nature, had given to her compartments an additional complexity.
Each of these main north-and-south strip divisions was crossed and
walled off artificially into communities at odds. We had to gather
them into our hands for offensive action against the Turks.
Feisal's opportunities and difficulties lay in these political
complications of Syria which we mentally arranged in order, like a
social map.</p>

<p>In the very north, furthest from us, the language-boundary
followed, not inaptly, the coach road from Alexandretta to Aleppo,
until it met the Baghdad Railway, up which it went to the Euphrates
valley; but enclaves of Turkish speech lay to the south of this
general line in the Turkoman villages north and south of Antioch,
and in the Armenians who were sifted in among them.</p>

<p>Otherwise, a main component of the coast population was the
community of Ansariya, those disciples of a cult of fertility,
sheer pagan, anti-foreign, distrustful of Islam, drawn at moments
towards Christians by common persecution. The sect, vital in
itself, was clannish in feeling and politics. One Nosairi would not
betray another, and would hardly not betray an unbeliever. Their
villages lay in patches down the main hills to the Tripoli gap.
They spoke Arabic, but had lived there since the beginning of Greek
letters in Syria. Usually they stood aside from affairs, and left
the Turkish Government alone in hope of reciprocity.</p>

<p>Mixed among the Ansariyeh were colonies of Syrian Christians;
and in the bend of the Orontes had been some firm blocks of
Armenians, inimical to Turkey. Inland, near Harim were Druses,
Arabic in origin; and some Circassians from the Caucasus. These had
their hand against all. North-east of them were Kurds, settlers of
some generations back, who were marrying Arabs and adopting their
politics. They hated native Christians most; and, after them, they
hated Turks and Europeans.</p>

<p>Just beyond the Kurds existed a few Yezidis, Arabic-speaking,
but in thought affected by the dualism of Iran, and prone to
placate the spirit of evil. Christians, Mohammedans, and Jews,
peoples who placed revelation before reason, united to spit upon
Yezid. Inland of them stood Aleppo, a town of two hundred thousand
people, an epitome of all Turkey's races and religions. Eastward of
Aleppo, for sixty miles, were settled Arabs whose colour and manner
became more and more tribal as they neared the fringe of
cultivation where the semi-nomad ended and the Bedawi began.</p>

<p>A section across Syria from sea to desert, a degree further
south, began in colonies of Moslem Circassians near the coast. In
the new generation they spoke Arabic and were an ingenious race,
but quarrelsome, much opposed by their Arab neighbours. Inland of
them were Ismailiya. These Persian immigrants had turned Arab in
the course of centuries, but revered among themselves one Mohammed,
who in the flesh, was the Agha Khan. They believed him to be a
great and wonderful sovereign, honouring the English with his
friendship. They shunned Moslems, but feebly hid their beastly
opinions under a veneer of orthodoxy.</p>

<p>Beyond them were the strange sights of villages of Christian
tribal Arabs, under sheikhs. They seemed very sturdy Christians,
quite unlike their snivelling brethren in the hills. They lived as
the Sunni about them, dressed like them, and were on the best terms
with them. East of the Christians lay semi-pastoral Moslem
communities; and on the last edge of cultivation, some villages of
Ismailia outcasts, in search of the peace men would not grant.
Beyond were Beduin.</p>

<p>A third section through Syria, another degree lower, fell
between Tripoli and Beyrout. First, near the coast, were Lebanon
Christians; for the most part Maronites or Greeks. It was hard to
disentangle the politics of the two Churches. Superficially, one
should have been French and one Russian; but a part of the
population, to earn a living, had been in the United States, and
there developed an Anglo-Saxon vein, not the less vigorous for
being spurious. The Greek Church prided itself on being Old Syrian,
autochthonous, of an intense localism which might ally it with
Turkey rather than endure irretrievable domination by a Roman
Power.</p>

<p>The adherents of the two sects were at one in unmeasured
slander, when they dared, of Mohammedans. Such verbal scorn seemed
to salve their consciousness of inbred inferiority. Families of
Moslems lived among them, identical in race and habit, except for a
less mincing dialect, and less parade of emigration and its
results.</p>

<p>On the higher slopes of the hills clustered settlements of
Metawala, Shia Mohammedans from Persia generations ago. They were
dirty, ignorant, surly and fanatical, refusing to eat or drink with
infidels; holding the Sunni as bad as Christians; following only
their own priests and notables. Strength of character was their
virtue: a rare one in garrulous Syria. Over the hill-crest lay
villages of Christian yeomen living in free peace with their Moslem
neighbours as though they had never heard the grumbles of Lebanon.
East of them were semi-nomad Arab peasantry; and then the open
desert.</p>

<p>A fourth section, a degree southward, would have fallen near
Acre, where the inhabitants, from the seashore, were first Sunni
Arabs, then Druses, then Metawala. On the banks of the Jordan
valley lived bitterly-suspicious colonies of Algerian refugees,
facing villages of Jews. The Jews were of varied sorts. Some,
Hebrew scholars of the traditionalist pattern, had developed a
standard and style of living befitting the country: while the later
comers, many of whom were German-inspired, had introduced strange
manners, and strange crops, and European houses (erected out of
charitable funds) into this land of Palestine, which seemed too
small and too poor to repay in kind their efforts: but the land
tolerated them. Galilee did not show the deep-seated antipathy to
its Jewish colonists which was an unlovely feature of the
neighbouring Judea.</p>

<p>Across the eastern plains (thick with Arabs) lay a labyrinth of
crackled lava, the Leja, where the loose and broken men of Syria
had foregathered for unnumbered generations. Their descendants
lived there in lawless villages, secure from Turk and Beduin, and
worked out their internecine feuds at leisure. South and south-west
of them opened the Hauran, a huge fertile land; populous with
warlike, self-reliant' and prosperous Arab peasantry.</p>

<p>East of them were the Druses, heterodox Moslem followers of a
mad and dead Sultan of Egypt. They hated Maronites with a bitter
hatred; which, when encouraged by the Government and the fanatics
of Damascus, found expression in great periodic killings. None the
less the Druses were disliked by the Moslem Arabs and despised them
in return. They were at feud with the Beduins, and preserved in
their mountain a show of the chivalrous semi-feudalism of Lebanon
in the days of their autonomous Emirs.</p>

<p>A fifth section in the latitude of Jerusalem would have begun
with Germans and with German Jews, speaking German or
German-Yiddish, more intractable even than the Jews of the Roman
era, unable to endure contact with others not of their race, some
of them farmers, most of them shopkeepers, the most foreign,
uncharitable part of the whole population of Syria. Around them
glowered their enemies, the sullen Palestine peasants, more stupid
than the yeomen of North Syria, material as the Egyptians, and
bankrupt.</p>

<p>East of them lay the Jordan depth, inhabited by charred serfs;
and across it group upon group of self-respecting village
Christians who were, after their agricultural co-religionists of
the Orontes valley, the least timid examples of our original faith
in the country. Among them and east of them were tens of thousands
of semi-nomad Arabs, holding the creed of the desert, living on the
fear and bounty of their Christian neighbours. Down this debatable
land the Ottoman Government had planted a line of Circassian
immigrants from the Russian Caucasus. These held their ground only
by the sword and the favour of the Turks, to whom they were, of
necessity, devoted.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LIX</h3>

<p>The tale of Syria was not ended in this count of odd races and
religions. Apart from the country-folk, the six great
towns&mdash;Jerusalem, Beyrout, Damascus, Horns, Hama, and
Aleppo&mdash;were entities, each with its character, direction, and
opinion. The southernmost, Jerusalem, was a squalid town, which
every Semitic religion had made holy. Christians and Mohammedans
came there on pilgrimage to the shrines of its past, and some Jews
looked to it for the political future of their race. These united
forces of the past and the future were so strong that the city
almost failed to have a present. Its people, with rare exceptions,
were characterless as hotel servants, living on the crowd of
visitors passing through. Ideals of Arab nationality were far from
them, though familiarity with the differences of Christians at
their moment of most poignant sentience had led the classes of
Jerusalem to despise us all.</p>

<p>Beyrout was altogether new. It would have been bastard French in
feeling as in language but for its Greek harbour and American
college. Public opinion in it was that of the Christian merchants,
fat men living by exchange; for Beyrout itself produced nothing.
The next strongest component was the class of returned emigrants,
happy on invested savings in the town of Syria which most resembled
that Washington Street where they had made good. Beyrout was the
door of Syria, a chromatic Levantine screen through which cheap or
shop-soiled foreign influences entered: it represented Syria as
much as Soho the Home Counties.</p>

<p>Yet Beyrout, because of its geographical position, because of
its schools, and the freedom engendered by intercourse with
foreigners, had contained before the war a nucleus of people,
talking, writing, thinking like the doctrinaire Cyclopasdists who
paved the way for revolution in France. For their sake, and for its
wealth, and its exceeding loud and ready voice, Beyrout was to be
reckoned with.</p>

<p>Damascus, Horns, Hama and Aleppo were the four ancient cities in
which native Syria took pride. They stretched like a chain along
the fertile valleys between the desert and the hills. Because of
their setting they turned their backs upon the sea and looked
eastward. They were Arab, and knew themselves such. Of them, and of
Syria, Damascus was the inevitable head; the seat of lay
government; and the religious centre. Its sheikhs were leaders of
opinion, more 'Meccan' than others elsewhere. Its fresh and
turbulent citizens, always willing to strike, were as extreme in
thought and word as in pleasure. The city boasted to move before
any part of Syria. The Turks made it military headquarters, just as
certainly as the Arab Opposition, and Oppenheim, and Sheikh Shawish
there established themselves. Damascus was a lode-star to which
Arabs were naturally drawn: a capital which would not smoothly be
subservient to any alien race.</p>

<p>Horns and Hama were twins disliking one another. All in them
manufactured things: in Horns often cotton and wool, in Hama
brocaded silks. Their industries were prosperous and increasing,
their merchants quick to find new outlets, or to meet new tastes,
in North Africa, the Balkans, Asia Minor, Arabia, Mesopotamia. They
demonstrated the productive ability of Syria, unguided by
foreigners, as Beyrout proved its skill in distribution. Yet while
the prosperity of Beyrout made it Levantine, the prosperity of
Horns and Kama reinforced their localism; made them more firmly
native, more jealously native. Almost it seemed as though
familiarity with plant and power taught people that their fathers'
manners were best.</p>

<p>Aleppo was a great city in Syria, but not of it, nor of
Anatolia, nor of Mesopotamia. There the races, creeds, and tongues
of the Ottoman Empire met and knew one another in a spirit of
compromise. The clash of characteristics, which made its streets a
kaleidoscope, imbued the Aleppine with a lewd thoughtfulness which
corrected in him what was blatant in the Damascene. Aleppo had
shared in all the civilizations which turned about it: the result
seemed to be a lack of zest in its people's belief. Even so, they
surpassed the rest of Syria. They fought and traded more; were more
fanatical and vicious; and made most beautiful things: but all with
a dearth of conviction which rendered barren their multitudinous
strength.</p>

<p>It was typical of Aleppo that in it, while yet Mohammedan
feeling ran high, more fellowship should rule between Christian and
Mohammedan, Armenian, Arab, Turk, Kurd and Jew, than in perhaps any
other great city of the Ottoman Empire, and that more friendliness,
though little licence, should have been accorded to Europeans.
Politically, the town stood aside altogether, save in Arab quarters
which, like overgrown half-nomad villages scattered over with
priceless mediaeval mosques, extended east and south of the mural
crown of its great citadel. The intensity of their self-sown
patriotism tinged the bulk of the citizens outside them with a
colour of local consciousness which was by so much less vivid than
the Beyrout-acquired unanimity of Damascus.</p>

<p>All these peoples of Syria were open to us by the master-key of
their common Arabic language. Their distinctions were political and
religious: morally they differed only in the steady gradation from
neurotic sensibility on the sea coast to reserve inland. They were
quick-minded; admirers, but not seekers of truth; self-satisfied;
not (like the Egyptians) helpless before abstract ideas, but
unpractical; and so lazy in mind as to be habitually superficial.
Their ideal was ease in which to busy themselves with others'
affairs.</p>

<p>From childhood they were lawless, obeying their fathers only
from physical fear; and their government later for much the same
reason: yet few races had the respect of the upland Syrian for
customary law. All of them wanted something new, for with their
superficiality and lawlessness went a passion for politics, a
science fatally easy for the Syrian to smarter, but too difficult
for him to master. They were discontented always with what
government they had; such being their intellectual pride; but few
of them honestly thought out a working alternative, and fewer still
agreed upon one.</p>

<p>In settled Syria there was no indigenous political entity larger
than the village, in patriarchal Syria nothing more complex than
the clan; and these units were informal and voluntary, devoid of
sanction, with heads indicated from the entitled families only by
the slow cementing of public opinion. All higher constitution was
the imported bureau-system of the Turk, in practice either fairly
good or very bad according to the frailty of the human instruments
(generally gendarmes) through which, in the last resort, it
worked.</p>

<p>The people, even the best-taught, showed a curious blindness to
the unimportance of their country, and a misconception of the
selfishness of great powers whose normal course was to consider
their own interests before those of unarmed races. Some cried aloud
for an Arab kingdom. These were usually Moslems; and the Catholic
Christians would counter them by demanding European protection of a
thelemic order, conferring privileges without obligation. Both
proposals were, of course, far from the hearts of the national
groups, who cried for autonomy for Syria, having a knowledge of
what autonomy was, but not knowing Syria; for in Arabic there was
no such name, nor any name for all the country any of them meant.
The verbal poverty of their Rome-borrowed name indicated a
political disintegration. Between town and town, village and
village, family and family, creed and creed, existed intimate
jealousies sedulously fostered by the Turks.</p>

<p>Time seemed to have proclaimed the impossibility of autonomous
union for such a land. In history, Syria had been a corridor
between sea and desert, joining Africa to Asia, Arabia to Europe.
It had been a prize-ring, a vassal, of Anatolia, of Greece, of
Rome, of Egypt, of Arabia, of Persia, of Mesopotamia. When given a
momentary independence by the weakness of neighbours it had
fiercely resolved into discordant northern, southern, eastern and
western 'kingdoms' with the area at best of Yorkshire, at worst of
Rutland; for if Syria was by nature a vassal country it was also by
habit a country of tireless agitation and incessant revolt.</p>

<p>The master-key of opinion lay in the common language: where
also, lay the key of imagination. Moslems whose mother tongue was
Arabic looked upon themselves for that reason as a chosen people.
Their heritage of the Koran and classical literature held the
Arabic-speaking peoples together. Patriotism, ordinarily of soil or
race, was warped to a language.</p>

<p>A second buttress of a polity of Arab motive was the dim glory
of the early Khalifate, whose memory endured among the people
through centuries of Turkish misgovernment. The accident that these
traditions savoured rather of the Arabian Nights than of sheer
history maintained the Arab rank and file in their conviction that
their past was more splendid than the present of the Ottoman
Turk.</p>

<p>Yet we knew that these were dreams. Arab Government in Syria,
though buttressed on Arabic prejudices, would be as much 'imposed'
as the Turkish Government, or a foreign protectorate, or the
historic Caliphate. Syria remained a vividly coloured racial and
religious mosaic. Any wide attempt after unity would make a patched
and parcelled thing, ungrateful to a people whose instincts ever
returned towards parochial home rule.</p>

<p>Our excuse for over-running expediency was War. Syria, ripe for
spasmodic local revolt, might be seethed up into insurrection, if a
new factor, offering to realize that centripetal nationalism of the
Beyrout Cyclopaedists, arose to restrain the jarring sects and
classes. Novel the factor must be, to avoid raising a jealousy of
itself: not foreign, since the conceit of Syria forbade.</p>

<p>Within our sight the only independent factor with acceptable
groundwork and fighting adherents was a Sunni prince, like Feisal,
pretending to revive the glories of Ommayad or Ayubid. He might
momentarily combine the inland men until success came with its need
to transfer their debauched enthusiasm to the service of ordered
government. Then would come reaction; but only after victory; and
for victory everything material and moral might be pawned.</p>

<p>There remained the technique and direction of the new revolts:
but the direction a blind man could see. The critical centre of
Syria in all ages had been the Yarmuk Valley, Hauran, and Deraa.
When Hauran joined us our campaign would be well ended. The process
should be to set up another ladder of tribes, comparable to that
from Wejh to Akaba: only this time our ladder would be made of
steps of Howeitat, Beni Sakhr, Sherarat, Rualla, and Serahin, to
raise us three hundred miles to Azrak, the oasis nearest Hauran and
Jebel Druse.</p>

<p>In character our operations of development for the final stroke
should be like naval war, in mobility, ubiquity, independence of
bases and communications, ignoring of ground features, of strategic
areas, of fixed directions, of fixed points. 'He who commands the
sea is at great liberty, and may take as much or as little of the
war as he will.' And we commanded the desert. Camel raiding
parties, self-contained like ships, might cruise confidently along
the enemy's cultivation-frontier, sure of an unhindered retreat
into their desert-element which the Turks could not explore.</p>

<p>Discrimination of what point of the enemy organism to disarrange
would come to us with war practice. Our tactics should be tip and
run: not pushes, but strokes. We should never try to improve an
advantage. We should use the smallest force in the quickest time at
the farthest place.</p>

<p>The necessary speed and range for distant war we would attain
through the frugality of the desert men, and their efficiency on
camels. The camel, that intricate, prodigious piece of nature, in
expert hands yielded a remarkable return. On them we were
independent of supply for six weeks, if each man had a half-bag of
flour, forty-five pounds in weight, slung on his riding-saddle.</p>

<p>Of water we would not want to carry more than a pint each. The
camels must drink, and there was no gain in making ourselves richer
than our mounts. Some of us never drank between wells, but those
were hardy men: most drank fully at each well, and carried a drink
for an intermediate dry day. In summer the camels would do about
two hundred and fifty miles after a watering; a three days'
vigorous march. An easy stage was fifty miles: eighty was good: in
an emergency we might do one hundred and ten miles in the
twenty-four hours: twice the Ghazala, our greatest camel, did one
hundred and forty-three alone with me. Wells were seldom a hundred
miles apart, so the pint reserve was latitude enough.</p>

<p>Our six weeks' food gave us capacity for a thousand miles out
and home. The endurance of our camels made it possible for us (for
me, the camel-novice in the army, 'painful' would be the fitter
word) to ride fifteen hundred miles in thirty days, without fear of
starvation; because, even if we exceeded in time, each of us sat on
two hundred pounds of potential meat, and the man made camel-less
could double-bank another, riding two-up, in emergency.</p>

<p>The equipment of the raiding parties should aim at simplicity;
with, nevertheless, a technical superiority over the Turks in the
critical department. I sent to Egypt demands for great quantities
of light automatic guns, Hotchkiss or Lewis, to be used as snipers'
tools. The men we trained to them were kept deliberately ignorant
of the mechanism, not to waste speed in action upon efforts at
repair. Ours were battles of minutes, fought at eighteen miles an
hour. If a gun jammed, the gunner must throw it aside and go in
with his rifle.</p>

<p>Another distinguishing feature might be high explosives. We
evolved special dynamite methods, and by the end of the war could
demolish any quantity of track and bridges with economy and safety.
Allenby was generous with explosive. It was only guns we never got
until the last month&mdash;and the pity of it! In manoeuvre war one
long-range gun outweighed ninety-nine short.</p>

<p>The distribution of the raiding parties was unorthodox. We could
not mix or combine tribes, because of their distrusts: nor could we
use one in the territory of another. In compensation we aimed at
the widest dissipation of force; and we added fluidity to speed by
using one district on Monday, another on Tuesday, a third on
Wednesday. Thus natural mobility was reinforced. In pursuit, our
ranks refilled with fresh men at each new tribe, and maintained the
pristine energy. In a real sense maximum disorder was our
equilibrium.</p>

<p>The internal economy of our raiding parties achieved
irregularity and extreme articulation. Our circumstances were not
twice similar, so no system could fit them twice: and our diversity
threw the enemy intelligence off the track. By identical battalions
and divisions information built itself up, until a corps could be
inferred on corpses from three companies. Our strengths depended
upon whim.</p>

<p>We were serving a common ideal, without tribal emulation, and so
could not hope for <i>esprit de corps</i>. Ordinary soldiers were
made a caste either by great rewards in pay, dress and privilege:
or by being cut off from life by contempt. We could not so knit man
to man, for our tribesmen were in arms willingly. Many armies had
been voluntarily enlisted: few served voluntarily. Any of our Arabs
could go home without penalty whenever the conviction failed him:
the only contract was honour.</p>

<p>Consequently we had no discipline in the sense in which it was
restrictive, submergent of individuality, the Lowest Common
Denominator of men. In peace-armies discipline meant the hunt, not
of an average but of an absolute; the hundred per cent standard in
which the ninety-nine were played down to the level of the weakest
man on parade. The aim was to render the unit a unit, the man a
type; in order that their effort might be calculable, and the
collective output even in grain and bulk. The deeper the
discipline, the lower was the individual excellence; also the more
sure the performance.</p>

<p>By this substitution of a sure job for a possible masterpiece,
military science made a deliberate sacrifice of capacity in order
to reduce the uncertain element, the bionomic factor, in enlisted
humanity. Discipline's necessary accompaniment was compound or
social war&mdash;that form in which the fighting man was the
product of the multiplied exertions of a long hierarchy, from
workshop to supply unit, which kept him active in the field.</p>

<p>The Arab war should react against this, and be simple and
individual. Every enrolled man should serve in the line of battle
and be self-contained there. The efficiency of our forces was the
personal efficiency of the single man. It seemed to me that, in our
articulated war, the sum yielded by single men would at least equal
the product of a compound system of the same strength.</p>

<p>In practice we should not employ in the firing line the great
numbers which a simple system put theoretically at our disposal,
lest our attack (as contrasted with our threat) become too
extended. The moral strain of isolated fighting made 'simple' war
very hard upon the soldier, exacting from him special initiative,
endurance, enthusiasm. Irregular war was far more intellectual than
a bayonet charge, far more exhausting than service in the
comfortable imitative obedience of an ordered army. Guerillas must
be allowed liberal work room: in irregular war, of two men
together, one was being wasted. Our ideal should be to make our
battle a series of single combats, our ranks a happy alliance of
agile commanders-in-chief.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LX</h3>

<p>Vessels steamed up the Gulf of Akaba. Feisal landed, and with
him Jaafar, his staff, and Joyce, the fairy godmother. There came
the armoured cars, Goslett, Egyptian labourers and thousands of
troops. To repair the six weeks' peace, Falkenhayn had been down to
advise the Turks, and his fine intelligence made them worthier our
opposition. Maan was a special command, under Behjet, the old
G.O.C. Sinai. He had six thousand infantry, a regiment of cavalry
and mounted infantry, and had entrenched Maan till it was
impregnable according to the standard of manoeuvre war. A flight of
aeroplanes operated daily thence. Great supply dumps had been
collected.</p>

<p>By now the Turkish preparations were complete; they began to
move, disclosing that their objective was Guweira, the best road
for Akaba. Two thousand infantry pushed out to Aba el Lissan, and
fortified it. Cavalry kept the outskirts, to contain a possible
Arab counter-stroke from the Wadi Musa side.</p>

<p>This nervousness was our cue. We would play with them and
provoke them to go for us in Wadi Musa, where the natural obstacles
were so tremendous that the human defending factor might behave as
badly as it liked, and yet hold the place against attack.</p>

<p>To bait the hook, the men of neighbouring Delagha were set busy.
The Turks, full of spirit, put in a counter-stroke, and suffered
sharply. We rubbed into the peasantry of Wadi Musa the rich booty
now enjoyed by their rivals of Delagha. Maulud, the old war-horse,
went up with his mule-mounted regiment, and quartered himself among
the famous ruins of Petra. The encouraged Liathena, under their
one-eyed sheikh, Khalil, began to foray out across the plateau, and
to snap up by twos and threes Turkish riding or transport animals,
together with the rifles of their occasional guards. This went on
for weeks, while the irritated Turks grew hotter and hotter.</p>

<p>We could also prick the Turks into discomfort by asking General
Salmond for his promised long-distance air raid on Maan. As it was
difficult, Salmond had chosen Stent, with other tried pilots of
Rabegh or Wejh, and told them to do their best. They had experience
of forced landing on desert surfaces and could pick out an unknown
destination across unmapped hills: Stent spoke Arabic perfectly.
The flight had to be air-contained, but its commander was full of
resource and display, like other bundles of nerves, who, to punish
themselves, did outrageous things. On this occasion he ordered low
flying, to make sure the aim; and profited by reaching Maan, and
dropping thirty-two bombs in and about the unprepared station. Two
bombs into the barracks killed thirty-five men and wounded fifty.
Eight struck the engine-shed, heavily damaging the plant and stock.
A bomb in the General's kitchen finished his cook and his
breakfast. Four fell on the aerodrome. Despite the shrapnel our
pilots and engines returned safely to their temporary landing
ground at Kuntilla above Akaba.</p>

<p>That afternoon they patched the machines, and after dark slept
under their wings. In the following dawn they were off once more,
three of them this time, to Aba el Lissan, where the sight of the
great camp had made Stent's mouth water. They bombed the horse
lines and stampeded the animals, visited the tents and scattered
the Turks. As on the day before, they flew low and were much hit,
but not fatally. Long before noon they were back in Kuntilla.</p>

<p>Stent looked over the remaining petrol and bombs, and decided
they were enough for one more effort. So he gave directions to
everyone to look for the battery which had troubled them in the
morning. They started in the midday heat. Their loads were so heavy
they could get no height, and therefore came blundering over the
crest behind Aba el Lissan, and down the valley at about three
hundred feet. The Turks, always somnolent at noon, were taken
completely by surprise. Thirty bombs were dropped: one silenced the
battery, the others killed dozens of men and animals. Then the
lightened machines soared up and home to El Arish. The Arabs
rejoiced: the Turks were seriously alarmed. Behjet Pasha set his
men to digging shelters, and when his aeroplanes had been repaired,
he disposed them innocuously about the plateau for camp
defence.</p>

<p>By air we had perturbed the Turks: by irritative raids we were
luring them towards a wrong objective. Our third resource to ruin
their offensive was to hinder the railway, whose need would make
them split up the striking force on defensive duties. Accordingly
we arranged many demolitions for mid-September.</p>

<p>I decided also to revive the old idea of mining a train.
Something more vigorous and certain than automatic mines was
indicated, and I had imagined a direct firing, by electricity, of a
charge under the locomotive. The British sappers encouraged me to
try, especially General Wright, the chief engineer in Egypt, whose
experience took a sporting interest in my irregularities. He sent
me the recommended tools: an exploder and some insulated cable.
With them I went on board H.M.S. <i>Number</i>, our new guard-ship,
and introduced myself to Captain Snagge, in command.</p>

<p>Snagge was fortunate in his ship, which had been built for
Brazil, and was much more comfortably furnished than British
monitors; and we were doubly fortunate in him and in this, for he
was the spirit of hospitality. His inquiring nature took interest
in the shore, and saw the comic side even of our petty disasters.
To tell him the story of a failure was to laugh at it, and always
for a good story he gave me a hot bath, and tea with civilized
trappings, free from every suspicion of blown sand. His kindness
and help served us in lieu of visits to Egypt for repairs, and
enabled us to hammer on against the Turks through month after month
of feckless disappointment.</p>

<p>The exploder was in a formidable locked white box, very heavy.
We split it open, found a ratchet handle, and pushed it down
without harming the ship. The wire was heavy rubber-insulated
cable. We cut it in half, fastened the ends to screw terminals on
the box, and transmitted shocks to one another convincingly. It
worked.</p>

<p>I fetched detonators. We stuffed the free ends of the cable into
one and pumped the handle: nothing followed. We tried again and
again ineffectually, grieving over it. At last Snagge rang his bell
for the gunner warrant officer who knew all about circuits. He
suggested special electric detonators. The ship carried six, and
gave me three of them. We joined one up with our box, and when the
handle was crashed down it popped off beautifully. So I felt that I
knew all about it and turned to arrange the details of the
raid.</p>

<p>Of targets, the most promising and easiest-reached seemed
Mudowwara, a water station eighty miles south of Maan. A smashed
train there would embarrass the enemy. For men, I would have the
tried Howeitat; and, at the same time, the expedition would test
the three Haurani peasants whom I had added to my personal
followers. In view of the new importance of the Hauran, there was
need for us to learn its dialect, the construction and jealousies
of its clan-framework, and its names and roads. These three
fellows, Rahail, Assaf and Hemeid would teach me their home-affairs
imperceptibly, as we rode on business, chatting.</p>

<p>To make sure of the arrested train required guns and
machine-guns. For the first, why not trench-mortars? For the
second, Lewis guns? Accordingly, Egypt chose two forceful
sergeant-instructors from the Army School at Zeitun, to teach
squads of Arabs in Akaba how to use such things. Snagge gave them
quarters in his ship, since we had, as yet, no convenient English
camp ashore.</p>

<p>Their names may have been Yells and Brooke, but became Lewis and
Stokes after their jealously-loved tools. Lewis was an Australian,
long, thin and sinuous, his supple body lounging in unmilitary
curves. His hard face, arched eyebrows, and predatory nose set off
the peculiarly Australian air of reckless willingness and capacity
to do something very soon. Stokes was a stocky English yeoman,
workmanlike and silent; always watching for an order to obey.</p>

<p>Lewis, full of suggestion, emerged bursting with delight at what
had been well done whenever a thing happened. Stokes never offered
opinion until after action, when he would stir his cap
reflectively, and painstakingly recount the mistakes he must next
time avoid. Both were admirable men. In a month, without common
language or interpreter, they got on terms with their classes and
taught them their weapons with reasonable precision. More was not
required: for an empirical habit appeared to agree with the spirit
of our haphazard raids better than complete scientific
knowledge.</p>

<p>As we worked at the organization of the raid, our appetites
rose. Mudowwara station sounded vulnerable. Three hundred men might
rush it suddenly. That would be an achievement, for its deep well
was the only one in the dry sector below Maan. Without its water,
the train service across the gap would become uneconomic in
load.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXI</h3>

<p>Lewis, the Australian, at such an ambitious moment, said that he
and Stokes would like to be of my party. A new, attractive idea.
With them we should feel sure of our technical detachments, whilst
attacking a garrisoned place. Also, the sergeants wanted to go very
much, and their good work deserved reward. They were warned that
their experiences might not at the moment seem altogether joyful.
There were no rules; and there could be no mitigation of the
marching, feeding, and fighting, inland. If they went they would
lose their British Army comfort and privilege, to share and share
with the Arabs (except in booty!) and suffer exactly their hap in
food and discipline. If anything went wrong with me, they, not
speaking Arabic, would be in a tender position.</p>

<p>Lewis replied that he was looking for just this strangeness of
life. Stokes supposed that if we did it, he could. So they were
lent two of my best camels (their saddle-bags tight with bully-beef
and biscuits) and on September the seventh we went together up Wadi
Itm, to collect our Howeitat from Auda in Guweira.</p>

<p>For the sergeants' sake, to harden them gently, things were made
better than my word. We marched very easily for to-day, while we
were our own masters. Neither had been on a camel before, and there
was risk that the fearful heat of the naked granite walls of Itm
might knock them out before the trip had properly begun. September
was a bad month. A few days before, in the shade of the
palm-gardens of Akaba beach, the thermometer had shown a hundred
and twenty degrees. So we halted for midday under a cliff, and in
the evening rode only ten miles to camp for the night.</p>

<p>We were comfortable with cans of hot tea, and rice and meat; and
it was covertly enjoyable to watch the percussion of their
surroundings on the two men. Each reacted to the type expected.</p>

<p>The Australian from the first seemed at home, and behaved freely
towards the Arabs. When they fell into his spirit, and returned the
fellowship, he was astonished: almost resentful: having never
imagined that they would be misled by his kindness to forget the
difference between a white man and a brown.</p>

<p>It added humour to the situation that he was browner by far than
my new followers, of whom the youngest interested me most. He,
Rahail, was quite a lad: a free-built, sturdy fellow, too fleshy
for the life we were to lead, but for that the more tolerant of
pains. His face was high-coloured; his cheeks a little full and
low-pouched, almost pendent. The mouth was budded and small, the
chin very pointed. This, added to the high, strong brows and
antimony-enlarged eyes, gave him a mixed air of artifice and
petulance, with weary patience self-imposed upon a base of pride.
He was blowsy-spoken (mouthing his Arabic); vulgar in dialect;
forward and impudent in speech; always thrusting, flaunting,
restless and nervous. His spirit was not as strong as his body, but
mercurial. When exhausted or cross he broke into miserable tears
easily chased away by any interference; and after, was fit for more
endurance. My followers, Mohammed and Ahmed, with Rashid and Assaf,
the probationers, gave Rahail much licence of behaviour; partly
because of his animal attractiveness, and of his tendency to
advertise his person. He had to be checked once or twice for taking
liberties with the sergeants.</p>

<p>Stokes, the Englishman, was driven by the Arab strangeness to
become more himself; more insular. His shy correctness reminded my
men in every movement that he was unlike them, and English. Such
consideration elicited a return of respect. To them he was 'the
sergeant', while Lewis was 'the long one'.</p>

<p>These were points of character, which all showed in their
degree. It was humiliating to find that our book-experience of all
countries and ages still left us prejudiced like washerwomen, but
without their verbal ability to get on terms with strangers. The
Englishmen in the Middle East divided into two classes. Class one,
subtle and insinuating, caught the characteristics of the people
about him, their speech, their conventions of thought, almost their
manner. He directed men secretly, guiding them as he would. In such
frictionless habit of influence his own nature lay hid,
unnoticed.</p>

<p>Class two, the John Bull of the books, became the more rampantly
English the longer he was away from England. He invented an Old
Country for himself, a home of all remembered virtues, so splendid
in the distance that, on return, he often found reality a sad
falling off and withdrew his muddle-headed self into fractious
advocacy of the good old times. Abroad, through his armoured
certainty, he was a rounded sample of our traits. He showed the
complete Englishman. There was friction in his track, and his
direction was less smooth than that of the intellectual type: yet
his stout example cut wider swathe.</p>

<p>Both sorts took the same direction in example, one vociferously,
the other by implication. Each assumed the Englishman a chosen
being, inimitable, and the copying him blasphemous or impertinent.
In this conceit they urged on people the next best thing. God had
not given it them to be English; a duty remained to be good of
their type. Consequently we admired native custom; studied the
language; wrote books about its architecture, folklore, and dying
industries. Then one day, we woke up to find this chthonic spirit
turned political, and shook our heads with sorrow over its
ungrateful nationalism&mdash;truly the fine flower of our innocent
efforts.</p>

<p>The French, though they started with a similar doctrine of the
Frenchman as the perfection of mankind (dogma amongst them, not
secret instinct), went on, contrarily, to encourage their subjects
to imitate them; since, even if they could never attain the true
level, yet their virtue would be greater as they approached it. We
looked upon imitation as a parody; they as a compliment.</p>

<p>Next day, in the early heat, we were near Guweira, comfortably
crossing the sanded plain of restful pink with its grey-green
undergrowth, when there came a droning through the air. Quickly we
drove the camels off the open road into the bush-speckled ground,
where their irregular colouring would not be marked by the enemy
airmen; for the loads of blasting gelatine, my favourite and most
powerful explosive, and the many ammonal-filled shells of the
Stokes' gun would be ill neighbours in a bombing raid. We waited
there, soberly, in the saddle while our camels grazed the little
which was worth eating in the scrub, until the aeroplane had
circled twice about the rock of Guweira in front of us, and planted
three loud bombs.</p>

<p>We collected our caravan again on the path and paced gently into
camp. Guweira was thronged with life, and a mart for the Howeitat
of both hills and highlands. As far as the eye reached the plain
was softly moving with herded camels, whose multitude drained the
near water-holes each morning before dawn, so that late risers must
travel many miles to drink.</p>

<p>This was little matter, for the Arabs had nothing to do but wait
for the morning aeroplane; and after its passing, nothing but talk
to kill time till night was full enough for sleep. The talk and
leisure were too plentiful and had revived old jealousies. Auda was
ambitious to take advantage of our dependence on his help to assort
the tribes. He drew the bulk-wages for the Howeitat; and, by the
money, sought to compel the smaller free-sections to his
leadership.</p>

<p>They resented it, and were threatening either to retire into
their hills or to re-open touch with the Turks. Feisal sent up
Sherif Mastur as mediator. The thousands of Howeitat, in hundreds
of sections, were uncompromising, hard-headed, greedy land-lawyers.
To hold them content without angering Auda was task delicate enough
for the most fastidious mind. Also, it was one hundred and ten
degrees in the shade, and the shade was a surge of flies.</p>

<p>The three southern clans on whom we had been counting for our
raid were among the dissidents. Mastur spoke to them, the chiefs of
the Abu Tayi spoke, we all spoke, without effect. It seemed as
though our plans were to break down at the start.</p>

<p>One day, going along before noon under the rock, Mastur met me
with news that the southerners were mounting to desert our camp and
movement. Full of vexation, I swung round into Auda's tent. He sat
on its sand-floor, feeding on boiled bread with his latest wife, a
jolly girl, whose brown skin was blue with the indigo dye from her
new smock. When I suddenly burst in, the little woman whisked away
through the back-flap like a rabbit. To gain ground with him, I
began to jeer at the old man for being so old and yet so foolish
like the rest of his race, who regarded our comic reproductive
processes not as an unhygienic pleasure, but as a main business of
life.</p>

<p>Auda retorted with his desire for heirs. I asked if he had found
life good enough to thank his haphazard parents for bringing him
into it? or selfishly to confer the doubtful gift upon an unborn
spirit?</p>

<p>He maintained himself. 'Indeed, I am Auda,' said he, firmly,
'and you know Auda. My father (to whom God be merciful) was master,
greater than Auda; and he would praise my grandfather. The world is
greater as we go back.' 'But, Auda, we say honour our sons and
daughters, the heirs of our accumulated worth, fulfillers of our
broken wisdom. With each generation the earth is older, mankind
more removed from its childhood...'</p>

<p>The old thing, not to-day to be teased, looked at me through his
narrowed eyes with a benign humour, and pointed to Abu Tayi, his
son, out on the plain before us trying a new camel, banging it on
the neck with his stick in vain effort to make it pace like a
thoroughbred. 'O world's imp,' said he, 'if God please he has
inherited my worth, but thank God not yet my strength; and if I
find fault with him I will redden his tail. No doubt you are very
wise.' The upshot of our talk was that I should go off to a clean
spot, to wait events. We hired twenty camels to carry the
explosives; and the morrow, two hours after the aeroplane, was
fixed for our start.</p>

<p>The aeroplane was the quaint regulator of public business in the
Guweira camp. The Arabs, up as ever before dawn, waited for it:
Mastur set a slave on the crag's peak to sound the first warning.
When its constant hour drew near the Arabs would saunter, chatting
in parade of carelessness, towards the rock. Arrived beneath it,
each man climbed to the ledge he favoured. After Mastur would climb
the bevy of his slaves, with his coffee on the brazier, and his
carpet. In a shaded nook he and Auda would sit and talk till the
little shiver of excitement tightened up and down the crowded
ledges when first was heard the song of the engine over the pass of
Shtar.</p>

<p>Everyone pressed back against the wall and waited stilly while
the enemy circled vainly above the strange spectacle of this
crimson rock banded with thousands of gaily-dressed Arabs, nesting
like ibises in every cranny of its face. The aeroplane dropped
three bombs, or four bombs, or five bombs, according to the day of
the week. Their bursts of dense smoke sat on the sage-green plain
compactly like cream-puffs; writhing for minutes in the windless
air before they slowly spread and faded. Though we knew there was
no menace in it, yet we could not but catch our breath when the
sharp-growing cry of the falling bombs came through the loud engine
overhead.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXII</h3>

<p>Gladly we left the noise and heart-burning of Guweira. So soon
as we had lost our escort of flies we halted: indeed there was no
need of haste, and the two unfortunate fellows with me were tasting
of such heat as they had never known: for the stifling air was like
a metal mask over our faces. It was admirable to see them struggle
not to speak of it, that they might keep the spirit of the Akaba
undertaking to endure as firmly as the Arabs; but by this silence
the sergeants went far past their bond. It was ignorance of Arabic
which made them so superfluously brave, for the Arabs themselves
were loud against the tyrannous sun and the breathlessness; but the
test-effect was wholesome; and, for effect, I played about, seeming
to enjoy myself.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon we marched further and stopped for the
night under a thick screen of tamarisk-trees. The camp was very
beautiful, for behind us rose a cliff, perhaps four hundred feet in
height, a deep red in the level sunset. Under our feet was spread a
floor of buff-coloured mud, as hard and muffled as wood-paving,
flat like a lake for half a mile each way: and on a low ridge to
one side of it stood the grove of tamarisk-stems of brown wood,
edged with a sparse and dusty fringe of green, which had been faded
by drought and sunshine till it was nearly of the silvered grey
below the olive-leaves about Les Baux, when a wind from the
river-mouth rustled up the valley-grass and made the trees turn
pale.</p>

<p>We were riding for Rumm, the northern water of the Beni Atiyeh:
A place which stirred my thought, as even the unsentimental
Howei-tat had told me it was lovely. The morrow would be new with
our entry to it: but very early, while the stars were yet shining,
I was roused by Aid, the humble Harithi Sherif accompanying us. He
crept to me, and said in a chilled voice, 'Lord, I am gone blind'.
I made him lie down, and felt that he shivered as if cold; but all
he could tell me was that in the night, waking up, there had been
no sight, only pain in his eyes. The sun-blink had burned them
out.</p>

<p><b>Allenby</b>
</p>
</center>

<p>Day was still young as we rode between two great pikes of
sandstone to the foot of a long, soft slope poured down from the
domed hills in front of us. It was tamarisk-covered: the beginning
of the Valley of Rumm, they said. We looked up on the left to a
long wall of rock, sheering in like a thousand-foot wave towards
the middle of the valley; whose other arc, to the right, was an
opposing line of steep, red broken hills. We rode up the slope,
crashing our way through the brittle undergrowth.</p>

<p>As we went, the brushwood grouped itself into thickets whose
massed leaves took on a stronger tint of green the purer for their
contrasted setting in plots of open sand of a cheerful delicate
pink. The ascent became gentle, till <i>the</i> valley was a
confined tilted plain. The hills on the right grew taller and
sharper, a fair counterpart of the other side which straightened
itself to one massive rampart of redness. They drew together until
only two miles divided them: and then, towering gradually till
their parallel parapets must have been a thousand feet above us,
ran forward in an avenue for miles.</p>

<p>They were not unbroken walls of rock, but were built
sectionally, in crags like gigantic buildings, along the two sides
of their street. Deep alleys, fifty feet across, divided the crags,
whose plans were smoothed by the weather into huge apses and bays,
and enriched with surface fretting and fracture, like design.
Caverns high up on the precipice were round like windows: others
near the foot gaped like doors. Dark stains ran down the shadowed
front for hundreds of feet, like accidents of use. The cliffs were
striated vertically, in their granular rock; whose main order stood
on two hundred feet of broken stone deeper in colour and harder in
texture. This plinth did not, like the sandstone, hang in folds
like cloth; but chipped itself into loose courses of scree,
horizontal as the footings of a wall.</p>

<p>The crags were capped in nests of domes, less hotly red than the
body of the hill; rather grey and shallow. They gave the finishing
semblance of Byzantine architecture to this irresistible place:
this processional way greater than imagination. The Arab armies
would have been lost in the length and breadth of it, and within
the walls a squadron of aeroplanes could have wheeled in formation.
Our little caravan grew self-conscious, and fell dead quiet, afraid
and ashamed to flaunt its smallness in the presence of the
stupendous hills.</p>

<p>Landscapes, in childhood's dream, were so vast and silent. We
looked backward through our memory for the prototype up which all
men had walked between such walls toward such an open square as
that in front where this road seemed to end. Later, when we were
often riding inland, my mind used to turn me from the direct road,
to clear my senses by a night in Rumm and by the ride down its
dawn-lit valley towards the shining plains, or up its valley in the
sunset towards that glowing square which my timid anticipation
never let me reach. I would say, 'Shall I ride on this time, beyond
the Khazail, and know it all?' But in truth I liked Rumm too
much.</p>

<p>To-day we rode for hours while the perspectives grew greater and
more magnificent in ordered design, till a gap in the cliff-face
opened on our right to a new wonder. The gap, perhaps three hundred
yards across, was a crevice in such a wall; and led to an
amphitheatre, oval in shape, shallow in front, and long-lobed right
and left. The walls were precipices, like all the walls of Rumm;
but appeared greater, for the pit lay in the very heart of a ruling
hill, and its smallness made the besetting heights seem
overpowering.</p>

<p>The sun had sunk behind the western wall, leaving the pit in
shadow; but its dying glare flooded with startling red the wings
each side of the entry, and the fiery bulk of the further wall
across the great valley. The pit-floor was of damp sand, darkly
wooded with shrubs; while about the feet of all the cliffs lay
boulders greater than houses, sometimes, indeed, like fortresses
which had crashed down from the heights above. In front of us a
path, pale with use, zigzagged up the cliff-plinth to the point
from which the main face rose, and there it turned precariously
southward along a shallow ledge outlined by occasional leafy trees.
From between these trees, in hidden crannies of the rock, issued
strange cries; the echoes, turned into music, of the voices of the
Arabs watering camels at the springs which there flowed out three
hundred feet above ground.</p>

<p>The rains, falling on the grey domes of the hill-top, seemed to
have soaked slowly into the porous rock; and my mind followed them,
filtering inch by inch downward through those mountains of
sandstone till they came against the impervious horizontal layer of
the plinth, and ran along its top under pressure, in jets which
burst out on the cliff-face at the junction of the two rocky
layers.</p>

<p>Mohammed turned into the amphitheatre's left hand lobe. At its
far end Arab ingenuity had cleared a space under an overhanging
rock: there we unloaded and settled down. The dark came upon us
quickly in this high prisoned place; and we felt the water-laden
air cold against our sunburnt skin. The Howeitat who had looked
after the loads of explosive collected their camel drove, and led
them with echo-testing shouts up the hill-path to water against
their early return to Guweira. We lit fires and cooked rice to add
to the sergeants' bully-beef, while my coffee men prepared for the
visitors who would come to us.</p>

<p>The Arabs in the tents outside the hollow of the springs had
seen us enter, and were not slow to learn our news. In an hour we
had the head men of the Darausha, Zelebani, Zuweida and Togatga
clans about us; and there mounted great talk, none too happy. Aid,
the Sherif, was too cast down in heart by his blindness to lift the
burden of entertainment from my shoulders; and a work of such
special requirements was not to be well done by me. These smaller
clans, angry with the Abu Tayi, suspected us of abetting Auda in
his ambition to win a predominance over them. They were unwilling
to serve the Sherif till assured of his support of their extremest
claims.</p>

<p>Gasim abu Dumeik, the fine horseman who had led the highland men
on the day of Aba el Lissan, seemed particularly vicious. He was a
dark man with an arrogant face and thin-lipped smile: good enough
at heart, but crusted. To-day, he flamed with jealousy of the
Toweiha. Alone, I could never win him, so to make patent his
hostility I took him as adversary and fought him fiercely with my
tongue till he was silenced. In shame his audience deserted him and
rallied ever so little to my side. Their flickering judgements
began to murmur at the chiefs, and to advocate marching off with
me. I took the chance to say that Zaal would be here in the
morning, and that he and I would accept the help of all except the
Dhumaniyeh; who, made impossible by Gasim's words, would be erased
from Feisal's book and forfeit their earned goodwill and rewards.
Gasim, swearing he would join the Turks at once, withdrew from the
fireside in great anger, while cautious friends tried vainly to
stop his mouth.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXIII</h3>

<p>Next morning there he was, with his men, ready to join or oppose
us, as the whim went. While he hesitated Zaal arrived. Gasim's
dourness soon clashed upon Zaal's metallic cruelty, and the pair
had high words. We got between them before a fight could start, but
enough passed to overthrow the weak arrangement of the night. The
other clans, disgusted at Gasim's fierceness, came to us quietly in
twos and threes, as volunteers; but begged me to make their loyalty
known to Feisal before we started.</p>

<p>Their doubts determined me to communicate at once with him,
partly that this trouble might be composed, and partly to raise
camels for carrying the explosives. To hire Dhumaniyeh camels would
not be fitting; and there were no others here. The best way was to
go myself; because while Gasim might stop a messenger, he would not
dare hinder me. The two sergeants were commended to Zaal, who swore
to answer for their lives; and off went Ahmed and myself on
stripped camels, meaning to hurry to Akaba and back.</p>

<p>We knew only the very long way by Wadi Itm. A short cut existed,
but we could find no guide to it. Vainly we searched up and down
the valley; and were in despair when a boy blurted out that we
should go along the next valley to our right. By it, after an hour,
we were on a watershed from which valleys trended away westward.
They could lead only into Wadi Itm, for there was no other drainage
hereabouts through the hills to the sea; and we raced down them,
ever and again cutting at a venture across ridges on our right into
parallel tributaries, to shorten the assumed line.</p>

<p>In the beginning it was clean sandstone country, of pleasant
rock-shapes: but as we went spines of granite, the material of the
shore, rose up in front of us, and after thirty miles of good
trotting gradient we passed, by the southern Itm, into the main
valley, just above the well of the surrender of Akaba. The journey
took us only six hours.</p>

<p>In Akaba we rode straight to Feisal's house. My sudden return
scared him, but a word explained the little drama which was being
played at Rumm. After we had fed we took the necessary steps. The
twenty baggage camels should start up in two days with enough of
Feisal's camel-men to transport the explosives, and a few of his
personal slaves to guard them. He would lend me Sherif Abdulla el
Feir, the best of his henchmen now in camp, as mediator. The
families of the men who rode with me to the railway should draw
provisions from his stores on my certificate.</p>

<p>Abdulla and I went off before dawn, and in the afternoon, after
a friendly ride, reached Rumm to find all safe: so anxiety was
lifted. Sherif Abdulla at once got to work. Having collected the
Arabs, including the recalcitrant Gasim, he began to smooth over
their griefs with that ready persuasiveness which was the birthmark
of an Arab leader, and which all his experience served to whet.</p>

<p>In the idleness forced on him by our absence, Lewis had explored
the cliff, and reported the springs very good for washing in; so,
to get rid of the dust and strain after my long rides, I went
straight up the gully into the face of the hill, along the ruined
wall of the conduit by which a spout of water had once run down the
ledges to a Nabatasan well-house on the valley floor. It was a
climb of fifteen minutes to a tired person, and not difficult. At
the top, the waterfall, el Shellala as the Arabs named it, was only
a few yards away.</p>

<p>Its rushing noise came from my left, by a jutting bastion of
cliff over whose crimson face trailed long falling runners of green
leaves. The path skirted it in an undercut ledge. On the rock-bulge
above were clear-cut Nabathaean inscriptions, and a sunk panel
incised with a monogram or symbol. Around and about were Arab
scratches, including tribe-marks, some of which were witnesses of
forgotten migrations: but my attention was only for the splashing
of water in a crevice under the shadow of the overhanging rock.</p>

<p>From this rock a silver runlet issued into the sunlight. I
looked in to see the spout, a little thinner than my wrist, jetting
out firmly from a fissure in the roof, and falling with that clean
sound into a shallow, frothing pool, behind the step which served
as entrance. The walls and roof of the crevice dripped with
moisture. Thick ferns and grasses of the finest green made it a
paradise just five feet square.</p>

<p>Upon the water-cleansed and fragrant ledge I undressed my soiled
body, and stepped into the little basin, to taste at last a
freshness of moving air and water against my tired skin. It was
deliciously cool. I lay there quietly, letting the clear, dark red
water run over me in a ribbly stream, and rub the travel-dirt away.
While I was so happy, a grey-bearded, ragged man, with a hewn face
of great power and weariness, came slowly along the path till
opposite the spring; and there he let himself down with a sigh upon
my clothes spread out over a rock beside the path, for the sun-heat
to chase out their thronging vermin.</p>

<p>He heard me and leaned forward, peering with rheumy eyes at this
white thing splashing in the hollow beyond the veil of sun-mist.
After a long stare he seemed content, and closed his eyes,
groaning, 'The love is from God; and of God; and towards God'.</p>

<p>His low-spoken words were caught by some trick distinctly in my
water pool. They stopped me suddenly. I had believed Semites unable
to use love as a link between themselves and God, indeed, unable to
conceive such a relation except with the intellectuality of
Spinoza, who loved so rationally and sexlessly, and transcendently
that he did not seek, or rather had not permitted, a return.
Christianity had seemed to me the first creed to proclaim love in
this upper world, from which the desert and the Semite (from Moses
to Zeno) had shut it out: and Christianity was a hybrid, except in
its first root not essentially Semitic.</p>

<p>Its birth in Galilee had saved it from being just one more of
the innumerable revelations of the Semite. Galilee was Syria's
non-Semitic province, contact with which was almost uncleanness for
the perfect Jew. Like Whitechapel to London, it lay alien to
Jerusalem. Christ by choice passed his ministry in its intellectual
freedom; not among the mud-huts of a Syrian village, but in
polished streets among fora and pillared houses and rococo baths,
products of an intense if very exotic provincial and corrupt Greek
civilization.</p>

<p>The people of this stranger-colony were not Greek&mdash;at least
not in the majority&mdash;but Levantines of sorts, aping a Greek
culture; and in revenge producing, not the correct banal Hellenism
of the exhausted homeland, but a tropical rankness of idea, in
which the rhythmical balance of Greek art and Greek ideality
blossomed into novel shapes tawdry with the larded passionate
colours of the East.</p>

<p>Gadarene poets, stuttering their verses in the prevailing
excitement, held a mirror to the sensuality and disillusioned
fatalism, passing into disordered lust, of their age and place;
from whose earthiness the ascetic Semite religiosity perhaps caught
the tang of humanity and real love that made the distinction of
Christ's music, and fitted it to sweep across the hearts of Europe
in a fashion which Judaism and Islam could not achieve.</p>

<p>And then Christianity had had the fortune of later architects of
genius; and in its passage through time and clime had suffered
sea-changes incomparably greater than the unchanging Jewry, from
the abstraction of Alexandrian bookishness into Latin prose, for
the mainland of Europe: and last and most terrible passing of all,
when it became Teuton, with a formal synthesis to suit our chilly
disputatious north. So remote was the Presbyterian creed from the
Orthodox faith of its first or second embodiment that, before the
war, we were able to send missionaries to persuade these softer
Oriental Christians to our presentation of a logical God.</p>

<p>Islam, too, had inevitably changed from continent to continent.
It had avoided metaphysics, except in the introspective mysticism
of Iranian devotees: but in Africa it had taken on colours of
fetishism (to express in a loose word the varied animalities of the
dark continent), and in India, it had to stoop to the legality and
literalism of its converts' minds. In Arabia, however, it had kept
a Semitic character, or rather the Semitic character had endured
through the phase of Islam (as through all the phases of the creeds
with which the town-dwellers continually vested the simplicity of
faith), expressing the monotheism of open spaces, the
pass-through-infinity of pantheism and its everyday usefulness of
an all-pervading, household God.</p>

<p>By contrast with this fixity, or with my reading of it, the old
man of Rumm loomed portentous in his brief, single sentence, and
seemed to overturn my theories of the Arab nature. In fear of a
revelation, I put an end to my bath, and advanced to recover my
clothes. He shut his eyes with his hands and groaned heavily.
Tenderly I persuaded him to rise up and let me dress, and then to
come with me along the crazy path which the camels had made in
their climbing to and from the other water-springs. He sat down by
our coffee-place, where Mohammed blew up the fire while I sought to
make him utter doctrine.</p>

<p>When the evening meal was ready we fed him, so checking for some
minutes his undercurrent of groans and broken words. Late at night,
he rose painfully to his feet and tottered deafly into the night,
taking his beliefs, if any, with him. The Howeitat told me that
lifelong he had wandered among them moaning strange things, not
knowing day or night, not troubling himself for food or work or
shelter. He was given bounty of them all, as an afflicted man: but
never replied a word, or talked aloud, except when abroad by
himself or alone among the sheep and goats.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXIV</h3>

<p>Abdulla made progress with his settlement. Gasim, no longer
defiant, but sulky, would not give public counsel: so about a
hundred men of the smaller clans dared defy him by promising to
ride with us. We talked it over with Zaal, and decided to try our
fortune to the utmost of this power. By longer delay we risked
adherents whom we now had, with little hope of getting others in
the present temper of the tribes.</p>

<p>It was a tiny party, only a third of what had been hoped. Our
weakness would modify our plans regrettably: also we lacked an
assured leader. Zaal, as ever, showed himself capable of being
chief, prescient and active in all concrete preparations. He was a
man of great mettle, but too close to Auda to suit the others; and
his sharp tongue and the sneer hovering on his blue, wet lips
fanned distrust and made men reluctant to obey even his good
advice.</p>

<p>Next day the baggage camels came from Feisal, twenty of them in
charge of ten freedmen, and guarded by four of his body-slaves.
These were the trustiest attendants in the army, with a quite
particular reading of the duties of personal service. They would
have died to save their master hurt, or have died with him if he
were hurt. We attached two to each sergeant, so that whatever
happened to me their safe return would be assured. The loads needed
for the reduced raid were sorted out and all made ready for an
early start.</p>

<p>Accordingly at dawn on September the sixteenth we rode out from
Rumm. Aid, the blind Sherif, insisted on coming, despite his lost
sight; saying he could ride, if he could not shoot, and that if God
prospered us he would take leave from Feisal in the flush of the
success, and go home, not too sorry, to the blank life which would
be left. Zaal led his twenty-five Nowasera, a clan of Auda's Arabs
who called themselves my men, and were famous the desert over for
their saddle-camels. My hard riding tempted them to my company.</p>

<p>Old Motlog el Awar, owner of el Jedha, the finest she-camel in
North Arabia, rode her in our van. We looked at her with proud or
greedy eyes, according to our relationship with him. My Ghazala was
taller and more grand, with a faster trot, but too old to be
galloped. However she was the only other animal in the party, or,
indeed, in this desert, to be matched with the Jedha, and my honour
was increased by her dignity.</p>

<p>The rest of our party strayed like a broken necklace. There were
groups of Zuweida, Darausha, Togatga, and Zelebani; and it was on
this ride that the virtue of Hammad el Tugtagi was first brought to
my mind. Half an hour after we started there rode out from a
side-valley some shame-faced men of the Dhumaniyeh, unable to
endure others raiding while they idled with the women.</p>

<p>No one group would ride or speak with another, and I passed back
and forth all day like a shuttle, talking first to one lowering
sheikh, and then to another, striving to draw them together, so
that before a cry to action came there might be solidarity. As yet
they agreed only in not hearing any word from Zaal as to the order
of our march; though he was admitted the most intelligent warrior,
and the most experienced. For my private part he was the only one
to be trusted further than eyesight. Of the others, it seemed to me
that neither their words nor their counsels, perhaps not their
rifles, were sure.</p>

<p>Poor Sherif Aid's uselessness, even as nominal leader, forced me
to assume the direction myself, against both principle and
judgement; since the special arts of tribal raiding and the details
of food-halts and pasturage, road-direction, pay, disputes,
division of spoils, feuds and march order were much outside the
syllabus of the Oxford School of Modern History. The need to vamp
these matters kept me too busied to see the country, and prevented
my worrying out how we must assault Mudowwara, and the best
surprise uses of explosive.</p>

<p>We put our midday halt in a fertile place, where the late spring
rain, falling on a sandy talus, had brought up a thick tufting of
silvery grass which our camels loved. The weather was mild, perfect
as an August in England, and we lingered in great content,
recovered at last from the bickering appetites of the days before
the start, and from that slight rending of nerve inevitable when
leaving even a temporary settlement. Man, in our circumstances,
took root so soon.</p>

<p>Late in the day we rode again, winding downhill in a narrow
valley between moderate sandstone walls: till before sunset we were
out on another flat of laid yellow mud, like that which had been so
wonderful a prelude to Rumm's glory. By its edge we camped. My care
had borne fruit, for we settled in only three parties, by bright
fires of crackling, flaring tamarisk. At one supped my men; at the
second Zaal; at the third the other Howeitat; and late at night,
when all the chiefs had been well adjusted with gazelle meat and
hot bread, it became possible to bring them to my neutral fire, and
discuss sensibly our course for the morrow.</p>

<p>It seemed that about sunset we should water at Mudowwara well,
two or three miles this side of the station, in a covered valley.
Then, in the early night, we might go forward to examine the
station and see if, in our weakness, we might yet attempt some
stroke against it. I held strongly to this (against the common
taste) for it was by so much the most critical point of the line.
The Arabs could not see it, since their minds did not hold a
picture of the long, linked Turkish front with its necessitous
demands. However, we had reached internal harmony, and scattered
confidently to sleep.</p>

<p>In the morning we delayed to eat again, having only six hours of
march before us; and then pushed across the mud-flat to a plain of
firm limestone rag, carpeted with brown, weather-blunted flint.
This was succeeded by low hills, with occasional soft beds of sand,
under the steeper slopes where eddying winds had dropped their
dust. Through these we rode up shallow valleys to a crest; and then
by like valleys down the far side, whence we issued abruptly, from
dark, tossed stone-heaps into the sun-steeped wideness of a plain.
Across it an occasional low dune stretched a drifting line.</p>

<p>We had made our noon halt at the first entering of the broken
country; and, rightly, in the late afternoon came to the well. It
was an open pool, a few yards square, in a hollow valley of large
stone-slabs and flint and sand. The stagnant water looked
uninviting. Over its face lay a thick mantle of green slime, from
which swelled curious bladder-islands of floating fatty pink. The
Arabs explained that the Turks had thrown dead camels into the pool
to make the water foul; but that time had passed and the effect was
grown faint. It would have been fainter had the criterion of their
effort been my taste.</p>

<p>Yet it was all the drink we should get up here unless we took
Mudowwara, so we set to and filled our water-skins. One of the
Howeitat, while helping in this, slipped off the wet edge into the
water. Its green carpet closed oilily over his head and hid him for
an instant: then he came up, gasping vigorously, and scrambled out
amid our laughter; leaving behind him a black hole in the scum from
which a stench of old meat rose like a visible pillar, and hung
about us and him and the valley, disconcertingly.</p>

<p>At dusk, Zaal and I, with the sergeants and others, crept
forward quietly. In half an hour we were at the last crest, in a
place where the Turks had dug trenches and stoned up an elaborate
outpost of engrailed sangars which on this black new-moon night of
our raid were empty. In front and below lay the station, its doors
and windows sharply marked by the yellow cooking fires and lights
of the garrison. It seemed close under our observation; but the
Stokes gun would carry only three hundred yards. Accordingly we
went nearer, hearing the enemy noises, and attentively afraid lest
their barking dogs uncover us. Sergeant Stokes made casts out to
left and right, in search of gun-positions, but found nothing that
was satisfactory.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Zaal and I crawled across the last flat, till we
could count the unlighted tents and hear the men talking. One came
out a few steps in our direction, then hesitated. He struck a match
to light a cigarette, and the bold light flooded his face, so that
we saw him plainly, a young, hollow-faced sickly officer. He
squatted, busy for a moment, and returned to his men, who hushed as
he passed.</p>

<p>We moved back to our hill and consulted in whispers. The station
was very long, of stone buildings, so solid that they might be
proof against our time-fused shell. The garrison seemed about two
hundred. We were one hundred and sixteen rifles and not a happy
family. Surprise was the only benefit we could be sure of.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I voted that we leave it, unalarmed, for a
future occasion, which might be soon. But, actually, one accident
after another saved Mudowwara; and it was not until August, 1918,
that Buxton's Camel Corps at last measured to it the fate so long
overdue.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXV</h3>

<p>Quietly we regained our camels and slept. Next morning we
returned on our tracks to let a fold of the plain hide us from the
railway, and then marched south across the sandy flat; seeing
tracks of gazelle, oryx and ostrich; with, in one spot, stale
padmarks of leopard. We were making for the low hills bounding the
far side, intending to blow up a train; for Zaal said that where
these touched the railway was such a curve as we needed for
mine-laying, and that the spurs commanding it would give us ambush
and a field of fire for our machine-guns.</p>

<p>So we turned east in the southern ridges till within half a mile
of the line. There the party halted in a thirty-foot valley, while
a few of us walked down to the line, which bent a little eastward
to avoid the point of higher ground under our feet. The point ended
in a flat table fifty feet above the track, facing north across the
valley.</p>

<p>The metals crossed the hollow on a high bank, pierced by a
two-arched bridge for the passage of rain-water. This seemed an
ideal spot to lay the charge. It was our first try at electric
mining and we had no idea what would happen; but it stood to our
reason that the job would be more sure with an arch under the
explosive because, whatever the effect on the locomotive, the
bridge would go, and the succeeding coaches be inevitably
derailed.</p>

<p>The ledge would make an admirable position for Stokes. For the
automatics, it was rather high; but the enfilade would be masterful
whether the train was going up or down the line. So we determined
to put up with the disadvantages of plunging fire. It was good to
have my two British responsibilities in one place, safe from
surprise and with an independent retreat into the rough: for to-day
Stokes was in pain with dysentery. Probably the Mudowwara water had
upset his stomach. So few Englishmen seemed to have been endowed by
their upbringing with any organic resistance to disease.</p>

<p>Back with our camels, we dumped the loads, and sent the animals
to safe pasture near some undercut rocks from which the Arabs
scraped salt. The freedmen carried down the Stokes gun with its
shells; the Lewis guns; and the gelatine with its insulated wire,
magneto and tools to the chosen place. The sergeants set up their
toys on a terrace, while we went down to the bridge to dig a bed
between the ends of two steel sleepers, wherein to hide my fifty
pounds of gelatine. We had stripped off the paper wrapping of the
individual explosive plugs and kneaded them together by help of the
sun-heat into a shaking jelly in a sand-bag.</p>

<p>The burying of it was not easy. The embankment was steep, and in
the sheltered pocket between it and the hill-side was a wind-laid
bank of sand. No one crossed this but myself, stepping carefully;
yet I left unavoidable great prints over its smoothness. The
ballast dug out from the track I had to gather in my cloak for
carriage in repeated journeys to the culvert, whence it could be
tipped naturally over the shingle bed of the watercourse.</p>

<p>It took me nearly two hours to dig in and cover the charge: then
came the difficult job of unrolling the heavy wires from the
detonator to the hills whence we would fire the mine. The top sand
was crusted and had to be broken through in burying the wires. They
were stiff wires, which scarred the wind-rippled surface with long
lines like the belly marks of preposterously narrow and heavy
snakes. When pressed down in one place they rose into the air in
another. At last they had to be weighted down with rocks which, in
turn, had to be buried at the cost of great disturbance of the
ground.</p>

<p>Afterwards it was necessary, with a sand-bag, to stipple the
marks into a wavy surface; and, finally, with a bellows and long
fanning sweeps of my cloak, to simulate the smooth laying of the
wind. The whole job took five hours to finish; but then it was well
finished: neither myself nor any of us could see where the charge
lay, or that double wires led out underground from it to the firing
point two hundred yards off, behind the ridge marked for our
riflemen.</p>

<p>The wires were just long enough to cross from this ridge into a
depression. There we brought up the two ends and connected them
with the electric exploder. It was an ideal place both for it and
for the man who fired it, except that the bridge was not visible
thence.</p>

<p>However, this only meant that someone would have to press the
handle at a signal from a point fifty yards ahead, commanding the
bridge and the ends of the wires alike. Salem, Feisal's best slave,
asked for this task of honour, and was yielded it by acclamation.
The end of the afternoon was spent in showing him (on the
disconnected exploder) what to do, till he was act-perfect and
banged down the ratchet precisely as I raised my hand with an
imaginary engine on the bridge.</p>

<p>We walked back to camp, leaving one man on watch by the line.
Our baggage was deserted, and we stared about in a puzzle for the
rest, till we saw them suddenly sitting against the golden light of
sunset along a high ridge. We yelled to them to lie down or come
down, but they persisted up there on their perch like a school of
hooded crows, in full view of north and south.</p>

<p>At last we ran up and threw them off the skyline, too late. The
Turks in a little hill-post by Hallat Ammar, four miles south of
us, had seen them, and opened fire in their alarm upon the long
shadows which the declining sun was pushing gradually up the slopes
towards the post. Beduin were past masters in the art of using
country, but in their abiding contempt for the stupidity of the
Turks they would take no care to fight them. This ridge was visible
at once from Mudowwara and Hallat Ammar, and they had frightened
both places by their sudden ominous expectant watch.</p>

<p>However, the dark closed on us, and we knew we must sleep away
the night patiently in hope of the morrow. Perhaps the Turks would
reckon us gone if our place looked deserted in the morning. So we
lit fires in a deep hollow, baked bread and were comfortable. The
common tasks had made us one party, and the hill-top folly shamed
everyone into agreement that Zaal should be our leader.</p>

<p>Day broke quietly, and for hours we watched the empty railway
with its peaceful camps. The constant care of Zaal and of his lame
cousin Howeimil, kept us hidden, though with difficulty, because of
the insatiate restlessness of the Beduin, who would never sit down
for ten minutes, but must fidget and do or say something. This
defect made them very inferior to the stolid English for the long,
tedious strain of a waiting war. Also it partly accounted for their
uncertain stomachs in defence. To-day they made us very angry.</p>

<p>Perhaps, after all, the Turks saw us, for at nine o'clock some
forty men came out of the tents on the hill-top by Hallat Ammar to
the south and advanced in open order. If we left them alone, they
would turn us off our mine in an hour; if we opposed them with our
superior strength and drove them back, the railway would take
notice, and traffic be held up. It was a quandary, which eventually
we tried to solve by sending thirty men to check the enemy patrol
gradually; and, if possible, to draw them lightly aside into the
broken hills. This might hide our main position and reassure them
as to our insignificant strength and purpose.</p>

<p>For some hours it worked as we had hoped; the firing grew
desultory and distant. A permanent patrol came confidently up from
the south and walked past our hill, over our mine and on towards
Mudowwara without noticing us. There were eight soldiers and a
stout corporal, who mopped his brow against the heat, for it was
now after eleven o'clock and really warm. When he had passed us by
a mile or two the fatigue of the tramp became too much for him. He
marched his party into the shade of a long culvert, under whose
arches a cool draught from the east was gently flowing, and there
in comfort they lay on the soft sand, drank water from their
bottles, smoked, and at last slept. We presumed that this was the
noon-day rest which every solid Turk in the hot summer of Arabia
took as a matter of principle, and that their allowing themselves
the pause showed that we were disproved or ignored. However, we
were in error.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXVI</h3>

<p>Noon brought a fresh care. Through my powerful glasses we saw a
hundred Turkish soldiers issue from Mudowwara Station and make
straight across the sandy plain towards our place. They were coming
very slowly, and no doubt unwillingly, for sorrow at losing their
beloved midday sleep: but at their very worst marching and temper
they could hardly take more than two hours before they reached
us.</p>

<p>We began to pack up, preparatory to moving off, having decided
to leave the mine and its leads in place on chance that the Turks
might not find them, and we be able to return and take advantage of
all the careful work. We sent a messenger to our covering party on
the south, that they should meet us farther up, near those scarred
rocks which served as screen for our pasturing camels.</p>

<p>Just as he had gone, the watchman cried out that smoke in clouds
was rising from Hallat Ammar. Zaal and I rushed uphill and saw by
its shape and volume that indeed there must be a train waiting in
that station. As we were trying to see it over the hill, suddenly
it moved out in our direction. We yelled to the Arabs to get into
position as quick as possible, and there came a wild scramble over
sand and rock. Stokes and Lewis, being booted, could not win the
race; but they came well up, their pains and dysentery
forgotten.</p>

<p>The men with rifles posted themselves in a long line behind the
spur running from the guns past the exploder to the mouth of the
valley. From it they would fire directly into the derailed
carriages at less than one hundred and fifty yards, whereas the
ranges for the Stokes and Lewis guns were about three hundred
yards. An Arab stood up on high behind the guns and shouted to us
what the train was doing&mdash;a necessary precaution, for if it
carried troops and detrained them behind our ridge we should have
to face about like a flash and retire fighting up the valley for
our lives. Fortunately it held on at all the speed the two
locomotives could make on wood fuel.</p>

<p>It drew near where we had been reported, and opened random fire
into the desert. I could hear the racket coming, as I sat on my
hillock by the bridge to give the signal to Salem, who danced round
the exploder on his knees, crying with excitement, and calling
urgently on God to make him fruitful. The Turkish fire sounded
heavy, and I wondered with how many men we were going to have
affair, and if the mine would be advantage enough for our eighty
fellows to equal them. It would have been better if the first
electrical experiment had been simpler.</p>

<p>However, at that moment the engines, looking very big, rocked
with screaming whistles into view around the bend. Behind them
followed ten box-waggons, crowded with rifle-muzzles at the windows
and doors; and in little sand-bag nests on the roofs Turks
precariously held on, to shoot at us. I had not thought of two
engines, and on the moment decided to fire the charge under the
second, so that however little the mine's effect, the uninjured
engine should not be able to uncouple and drag the carriages
away.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the front 'driver' of the second engine was on
the bridge, I raised my hand to Salem. There followed a terrific
roar, and the line vanished from sight behind a spouting column of
black dust and smoke a hundred feet high and wide. Out of the
darkness came shattering crashes and long, loud metallic clangings
of ripped steel, with many lumps of iron and plate; while one
entire wheel of a locomotive whirled up suddenly black out of the
cloud against the sky, and sailed musically over our heads to fall
slowly and heavily into the desert behind. Except for the flight of
these, there succeeded a deathly silence, with no cry of men or
rifle-shot, as the now grey mist of the explosion drifted from the
line towards us, and over our ridge until it was lost in the
hills.</p>

<p>In the lull, I ran southward to join the sergeants. Salem picked
up his rifle and charged out into the murk. Before I had climbed to
the guns the hollow was alive with shots, and with the brown
figures of the Beduin leaping forward to grips with the enemy. I
looked round to see what was happening so quickly, and saw the
train stationary and dismembered along the track, with its waggon
sides jumping under the bullets which riddled them, while Turks
were falling out from the far doors to gain the shelter of the
railway embankment.</p>

<p>As I watched, our machine-guns chattered out over my head, and
the long rows of Turks on the carriage roofs rolled over, and were
swept off the top like bales of cotton before the furious shower of
bullets which stormed along the roofs and splashed clouds of yellow
chips from the planking. The dominant position of the guns had been
an advantage to us so far.</p>

<p>When I reached Stokes and Lewis the engagement had taken another
turn. The remaining Turks had got behind the bank, here about
eleven feet high, and from cover of the wheels were firing
point-blank at the Beduin twenty yards away across the sand-filled
dip. The enemy in the crescent of the curving line were secure from
the machine-guns; but Stokes slipped in his first shell, and after
a few seconds there came a crash as it burst beyond the train in
the desert.</p>

<p>He touched the elevating screw, and his second shot fell just by
the trucks in the deep hollow below the bridge where the Turks were
taking refuge. It made a shambles of the place. The survivors of
the group broke out in a panic across the desert, throwing away
their rifles and equipment as they ran. This was the opportunity of
the Lewis gunners. The sergeant grimly traversed with drum after
drum, till the open sand was littered with bodies. Mushagraf, the
Sherari boy behind the second gun, saw the battle over, threw aside
his weapon with a yell, and dashed down at speed with his rifle to
join the others who were beginning, like wild beasts, to tear open
the carriages and fall to plunder. It had taken nearly ten
minutes.</p>

<p>I looked up-line through my glasses and saw the Mudowwara patrol
breaking back uncertainly towards the railway to meet the
train-fugitives running their fastest northward. I looked south, to
see our thirty men cantering their camels neck and neck in our
direction to share the spoils. The Turks there, seeing them go,
began to move after them with infinite precaution, firing volleys.
Evidently we had a half-hour respite, and then a double threat
against us.</p>

<p>I ran down to the ruins to see what the mine had done. The
bridge was gone; and into its gap was fallen the front waggon,
which had been filled with sick. The smash had killed all but three
or four and had rolled dead and dying into a bleeding heap against
the splintered end. One of those yet alive deliriously cried out
the word typhus. So I wedged shut the door, and left them there,
alone.</p>

<p>Succeeding waggons were derailed and smashed: some had frames
irreparably buckled. The second engine was a blanched pile of
smoking iron. Its driving wheels had been blown upward, taking away
the side of the fire-box. Cab and tender were twisted into strips,
among the piled stones of the bridge abutment. It would never run
again. The front engine had got off better: though heavily derailed
and lying half-over, with the cab burst, yet its steam was at
pressure, and driving-gear intact.</p>

<p>Our greatest object was to destroy locomotives, and I had kept
in my arms a box of gun-cotton with fuse and detonator ready fixed,
to make sure such a case. I now put them in position on the outside
cylinder. On the boiler would have been better, but the sizzling
steam made me fear a general explosion which would sweep across my
men (swarming like ants over the booty) with a blast of jagged
fragments. Yet they would not finish their looting before the Turks
came. So I lit the fuse, and in the half-minute of its burning
drove the plunderers a little back, with difficulty. Then the
charge burst, blowing the cylinder to smithers, and the axle too.
At the moment I was distressed with uncertainty whether the damage
were enough; but the Turks, later, found the engine beyond use and
broke it up.</p>

<p>The valley was a weird sight. The Arabs, gone raving mad, were
rushing about at top speed bareheaded and half-naked, screaming,
shooting into the air, clawing one another nail and fist, while
they burst open trucks and staggered back and forward with immense
bales, which they ripped by the rail-side, and tossed through,
smashing what they did not want. The train had been packed with
refugees and sick men, volunteers for boat-service on the
Euphrates, and families of Turkish officers returning to
Damascus.</p>

<p>There were scores of carpets spread about; dozens of mattresses
and flowered quilts; blankets in heaps, clothes for men and women
in full variety; clocks, cooking-pots, food, ornaments and weapons.
To one side stood thirty or forty hysterical women, unveiled,
tearing their clothes and hair; shrieking themselves distracted.
The Arabs without regard to them went on wrecking the household
goods; looting their absolute fill. Camels had become common
property. Each man frantically loaded the nearest with what it
could carry and shooed it westward into the void, while he turned
to his next fancy.</p>

<p>Seeing me tolerably unemployed, the women rushed, and caught at
me with howls for mercy. I assured them that all was going well:
but they would not get away till some husbands delivered me. These
knocked their wives off and seized my feet in a very agony of
terror of instant death. A Turk so broken down was a nasty
spectacle: I kicked them off as well as I could with bare feet, and
finally broke free.</p>

<p>Next a group of Austrians, officers and non-commissioned
officers, appealed to me quietly in Turkish for quarter. I replied
with my halting German; whereupon one, in English, begged a doctor
for his wounds. We had none: not that it mattered, for he was
mortally hurt and dying. I told them the Turks would return in an
hour and care for them. But he was dead before that, as were most
of the others (instructors in the new Skoda mountain howitzers
supplied to Turkey for the Hejaz war), because some dispute broke
out between them and my own bodyguard, and one of them fired a
pistol shot at young Rahail. My infuriated men cut them down, all
but two or three, before I could return to interfere.</p>

<p>So far as could be seen in the excitement, our side had suffered
no loss. Among the ninety military prisoners were five Egyptian
soldiers, in their underclothes. They knew me, and explained that
in a night raid of Davenport's, near Wadi Ais, they had been cut
off by the Turks and captured. They told me something of
Davenport's work: of his continual pegging away in Abdulla's
sector, which was kept alive by him for month after month, without
any of the encouragement lent to us by success and local
enthusiasm. His best helpers were such stolid infantrymen as these,
whom I made lead the prisoners away to our appointed rallying place
at the salt rocks.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXVII</h3>

<p>Lewis and Stokes had come down to help me. I was a little
anxious about them; for the Arabs, having lost their wits, were as
ready to assault friend as foe. Three times I had had to defend
myself when they pretended not to know me and snatched at my
things. However, the sergeants' war-stained khaki presented few
attractions. Lewis went out east of the railway to count the thirty
men he had slain; and, incidentally, to find Turkish gold and
trophies in their haversacks. Stokes strolled through the wrecked
bridge, saw there the bodies of twenty Turks torn to pieces by his
second shell, and retired hurriedly.</p>

<p>Ahmed came up to me with his arms full of booty and shouted (no
Arab could speak normally in the thrill of victory) that an old
woman in the last waggon but one wished to see me. I sent him at
once, empty-handed, for my camel and some baggage camels to remove
the guns; for the enemy's fire was now plainly audible, and the
Arabs, sated with spoils were escaping one by one towards the
hills, driving tottering camels before them into safety. It was bad
tactics to leave the guns until the end: but the confusion of a
first, overwhelmingly successful, experiment had dulled our
judgement.</p>

<p>In the end of the waggon sat an ancient and very tremulous Arab
dame, who asked me what it was all about. I explained. She said
that though an old friend and hostess of Feisal, she was too infirm
to travel and must wait her death there. I replied that she would
not be harmed. The Turks were almost arrived and would recover what
remained of the train. She accepted this, and begged me to find her
old negress, to bring her water. The slave woman filled a cup from
the spouting tender of the first engine (delicious water, from
which Lewis was slaking his thirst), and then I led her to her
grateful mistress. Months after there came to me secretly from
Damascus a letter and a pleasant little Baluchi carpet from the
lady Ayesha, daughter of Jellal el Lei, of Medina, in memory of an
odd meeting.</p>

<p>Ahmed never brought the camels. My men, possessed by greed, had
dispersed over the land with the Beduins. The sergeants and I were
alone by the wreck, which had a strange silence now. We began to
fear that we must abandon the guns and run for it, but just then
saw two camels dashing back. Zaal and Howeimil had missed me and
had returned in search.</p>

<p>We were rolling up the insulated cable, our only piece. Zaal
dropped from his camel and would have me mount and ride; but,
instead, we loaded it with the wire and the exploder. Zaal found
time to laugh at our quaint booty, after all the gold and silver in
the train. Howeimil was dead lame from an old wound in the knee and
could not walk, but we made him couch his camel, and hoisted the
Lewis guns, tied butt to butt like scissors, behind his saddle.
There remained the trench mortars; but Stokes reappeared,
unskilfully leading by the nose a baggage camel he had found
straying. We packed the mortars in haste; put Stokes (who was still
weak with his dysentery) on Zaal's saddle, with the Lewis guns, and
sent off the three camels in charge of Howeimil, at their best
pace.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lewis and Zaal, in a sheltered and invisible hollow
behind the old gun-position, made a fire of cartridge boxes, petrol
and waste, banked round it the Lewis drums and the spare small-arms
ammunition; and, gingerly, on the top, laid some loose Stokes'
shells. Then we ran. As the flames reached the cordite and ammonal
there was a colossal and continuing noise. The thousands of
cartridges exploded in series like massed machine-guns, and the
shells roared off in thick columns of dust and smoke. The
outflanking Turks, impressed by the tremendous defence, felt that
we were in strength and strongly posted. They halted their rush,
took cover, and began carefully to surround our position and
reconnoitre it according to rule, while we sped panting into
concealment among the ridges.</p>

<p>It seemed a happy ending to the affair, and we were glad to get
off with no more loss than my camels and baggage; though this
included the sergeants' cherished kits. However, there was food at
Rumm, and Zaal thought perhaps we should find our property with the
others, who were waiting ahead. We did. My men were loaded with
booty, and had with them all our camels whose saddles were being
suddenly delivered of spoils to look ready for our mounting.</p>

<p>Softly I explained what I thought of the two men who had been
ordered to bring up the camels when the firing ceased. They pleaded
that the explosion had scattered everyone in fright, and afterwards
the Arabs had appropriated each man any animal he saw. This was
probably true; but my men also were able-bodied and might have
helped themselves. We asked if anyone were hurt, and a voice said
that the Shunt's boy&mdash;a very dashing fellow&mdash;had been
killed in the first rush forward at the train. This rush was a
mistake, made without instructions, as the Lewis and Stokes guns
were sure to end the business if the mine worked properly. So I
felt that his loss was not directly my reproach.</p>

<p>Three men had been slightly wounded. Then one of Feisal's slaves
vouchsafed that Salem was missing. We called everyone together and
questioned them. At last an Arab said that he had seen him lying
hit, just beyond the engine. This reminded Lewis, who, ignorant
that he was one of us, had seen a negro on the ground there, badly
hurt. I had not been told and was angry, for half the Howeitat must
have known of it, and that Salem was in my charge. By their default
now, for the second time, I had left a friend behind.</p>

<p>I asked for volunteers to come back and find him. After a little
Zaal agreed, and then twelve of the Nowasera. We trotted fast
across the plain towards the line. As we topped the last ridge but
one we saw the train-wreck with Turks swarming over it. There must
have been one hundred and fifty of them, and our attempt was
hopeless. Salem would have been dead, for the Turks did not take
Arab prisoners. Indeed, they used to kill them horribly; so, in
mercy, we were finishing those of our badly wounded who would have
to be left helpless on abandoned ground.</p>

<p>We must give up Salem; but, to make some profit out of our
return, I suggested to Zaal that we slip up-valley and recover the
sergeants' kits. He was willing, and we rode till the Turks'
shooting drove us to cover behind a bank. Our camp had been in the
next hollow, across a hundred yards of flat. So, watching the time,
one or two of the quicker youths nipped across to drag back the
saddlebags. The Turks were distant, and Turkish long-range fire was
always bad; but for our third trip they got up a machine-gun, and
the dusty splashes of the bullets on the dark flints let them group
well about us.</p>

<p>I sent the running boys away, picked out what was light and best
of the remaining baggage, and rejoined the party. We pounded down
the slope and across. In the open the Turks could clearly count our
fewness. They grew bold and ran forward on both flanks to cut us
off. Zaal threw himself from his camel, climbed with five men to
the peak of the ridge we had just crossed, and fired back at them.
He was a marvellous shot, whom I had seen to bring down a running
gazelle from the saddle with his second bullet at three hundred
yards, and his fire checked them.</p>

<p>He called to us laden men to hurry across the next hollow and
hold it while he fell back on us, and in this fashion we retired
from ridge to ridge, putting up a good delay action and hitting
thirteen or fourteen Turks at a cost of four camels wounded. At
last, when we were only two ridges from our supports, and were
feeling sure that we should do it easily, a solitary rider
appeared, coming up. It was Lewis, with a Lewis gun held
efficiently across his thighs. He had heard the rapid fire, and
thought to see if we needed help.</p>

<p>He changed our strength very much, and my mind, for I was angry
with the Turks, who had got Salem and had chased us breathless so
far in dust and heat and streaming sweat. Therefore we took place
to give our pursuers a knock; but either they suspected our
silence, or they feared the distance they had come; anyway, we saw
no more of them. After a few minutes we became cool, and
wise-headed enough to ride off after the others.</p>

<p>They had marched very heavy-laden. Of our ninety prisoners, ten
were friendly Medina women electing to go to Mecca by way of
Feisal. There had been twenty-two riderless camels. The women had
climbed on to five pack-saddles, and the wounded were in pairs on
the residue. It was late in the afternoon. We were exhausted, the
prisoners had drunk all our water. We must re-fill from the old
well at Mudowwara that night to sustain ourselves so far as
Rumm.</p>

<p>As the well was close to the station, it was highly desirable
that we get to it and away, lest the Turks divine our course and
find us there defenceless. We broke up into little parties and
struggled north. Victory always undid an Arab force, so we were no
longer a raiding party, but a stumbling baggage caravan, loaded to
breaking point with enough household goods to make rich an Arab
tribe for years.</p>

<p>My sergeants asked me for a sword each, as souvenir of their
first private battle. As I went down the column to look out
something, suddenly I met Feisal's freedmen; and to my astonishment
on the crupper behind one of them, strapped to him, soaked with
blood, unconscious, was the missing Salem.</p>

<p>I trotted up to Ferhan and asked wherever he had found him. He
told me that when the Stokes gun fired its first shell, Salem
rushed past the locomotive, and one of the Turks shot him in the
back. The bullet had come out near his spine, without, in their
judgement, hurting him mortally. After the train was taken, the
Howeitat had stripped him of cloak, dagger, rifle and head-gear.
Mijbil, one of the freedmen, had found him, lifted <i>him</i>
straight to his camel, and trekked off homeward without telling us.
Ferhan, overtaking him on the road, had relieved him of Salem; who,
when he recovered, as later he did, perfectly, bore me always a
little grudge for having left him behind, when he was of my company
and wounded. I had failed in staunchness. My habit of hiding behind
a Sherif was to avoid measuring myself against the pitiless Arab
standard, with its no-mercy for foreigners who wore its clothes,
and aped its manners. Not often was I caught with so poor a shield
as blind Sherif Aid.</p>

<p>We reached the well in three hours and watered without mishap.
Afterwards we moved off another ten miles or so, beyond fear of
pursuit. There we lay down and slept, and in the morning found
ourselves happily tired. Stokes had had his dysentery heavy upon
him the night before, but sleep and the ending of anxiety made him
well. He and I and Lewis, the only unburdened ones, went on in
front across one huge mud-flat after another till just before
sunset we were at the bottom of Wadi Rumm.</p>

<p>This new route was important for our armoured cars, because its
twenty miles of hard mud might enable them to reach Mudowwara
easily. If so, we should be able to hold up the circulation of
trains when we pleased. Thinking of this, we wheeled into the
avenue of Rumm, still gorgeous in sunset colour; the cliffs as red
as the clouds in the west, like them in scale and in the level bar
they raised against the sky. Again we felt how Rumm inhibited
excitement by its serene beauty. Such whelming greatness dwarfed
us, stripped off the cloak of laughter in which we had ridden over
the jocund flats.</p>

<p>Night came down, and the valley became a mind-landscape. The
invisible cliffs boded as presences; imagination tried to piece out
the plan of their battlements by tracing the dark pattern they cut
in the canopy of stars. The blackness in the depth was very
real&mdash;it was a night to despair of movement. We felt only our
camels' labour, as hour after hour monotonously and smoothly they
shouldered their puny way along the unfenced level, with the wall
in front no nearer and the wall behind no further than at
first.</p>

<p>About nine at night we were before the pit in which lay the
water and our old camp. We knew its place because the deep darkness
there grew humidly darker. We turned our camels to the right and
advanced towards the rock, which reared its crested domes so high
over us that the ropes of our head-cloths slipped back round our
necks as we stared up. Surely if we stretched out even our
camel-sticks in front of us we should touch the facing walls: yet
for many paces more we crept in under their horns.</p>

<p>At last we were in the tall bushes: then we shouted. An Arab
shouted back. The echoes of my voice rolling down from the cliff
met his rising cry, and the sounds wrapped themselves together and
wrestled among the crags. A flame flickered palely on the left, and
we found Musa our watchman there. He lit a fire of powerfully
scented wood, and by its light we broke open bully-beef and fed
ravenously; gulping down, through our food, bowl after bowl of the
delicious water, ice-cold, and heady after the foul drink of
Mudowwara; which, for days, had seared our throats.</p>

<p>We slept through the coming of the rest. Two days later we were
at Akaba; entering in glory, laden with precious things, and
boasting that the trains were at our mercy. From Akaba the two
sergeants took hurried ship to Egypt. Cairo had remembered them and
gone peevish because of their non-return. However, they could pay
the penalty of this cheerfully. They had won a battle
single-handed; had had dysentery; lived on camel-milk; and learned
to ride a camel fifty miles a day without pain. Also Allenby gave
them a medal each.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXVIII</h3>

<p>Days passed, talking politics, organization and strategy with
Feisal, while preparations for a new operation went forward. Our
luck had quickened the camp; and the mining of trains promised to
become popular, if we were able to train in the technique of the
work enough men for several parties. Captain Pisani was first
volunteer. He was the experienced commander of the French at Akaba,
an active soldier who burned for distinction&mdash;and
distinctions. Feisal found me three young Damascenes of family, who
were ambitious to lead tribal raids. We went to Rumm and announced
that this raid was specially for Gasim's clan. Such coals of fire
scorched them; but greed would not let them refuse. Everyone for
days around flocked to join. Most were denied: nevertheless, we
started out with one hundred and fifty men and a huge train of
empty pack-camels for the spoils.</p>

<p>For variety we determined to work by Maan. So we rode up to
Batra, climbing out of heat into cold, out of Arabia into Syria,
from tamarisk to wormwood. As we topped the pass and saw the
blood-red stain on the hills above the leech-infested wells, there
met us A first breath of the northern desert; that air too fine to
describe, which told of perfect loneliness, dried grass, and the
sun on burning flints.</p>

<p>The guides said that Kilometre 475 would be good for mining: but
we found it beset by blockhouses, and had to creep shyly away. We
marched down the line till it crossed a valley on a high bank,
pierced by bridges on each side and in the middle. There, after
midnight, we laid an automatic mine of a new and very powerful
luddite type. The burying took hours, and dawn caught us as we
worked. There was no perceptible lightening, and when we stared
round to know where the dark was yielding, we could see no special
onset of the day. Long minutes afterwards the sun disclosed itself,
high above the earth's rim, over a vignetted bank of edgeless
mist.</p>

<p>We retired a thousand yards up the valley's scrubby bed to
ambush for the intolerable day. As the hours passed the sun
increased, and shone so closely upon our radiant trench that we
felt crowded by its rays. The men were a mad lot, sharpened to
distraction by hope of success. They would listen to no word but
mine, and brought me their troubles for judgement. In the six days'
raid there came to a head, and were settled, twelve cases of
assault with weapons, four camel-liftings, one marriage, two
thefts, a divorce, fourteen feuds, two evil eyes, and a
bewitchment.</p>

<p>These decisions were arrived at despite my imperfect knowledge
of Arabic. The fraudulence of my business stung me. Here were more
fruits, bitter fruits, of my decision, in front of Akaba, to become
a principal of the Revolt. I was raising the Arabs on false
pretences, and exercising a false authority over my dupes, on
little more evidence than their faces, as visible to my eyes weakly
watering and stinging after a year's exposure to the throb, throb
of sunlight.</p>

<p>We waited that day, and night. At sunset a scorpion scuttled out
of the bush by which I had lain down to make note of the day's
weariness, and fastening on my left hand struck me, it seemed
repeatedly. The pain of my swollen arm kept me awake until the
second dawn: to the relief of my overburdened mind, for its body
became clamant enough to interrupt my self-questioning when the
fire of some such surface injury swept the sluggish nerves.</p>

<p>Yet pain of this quality never endured long enough really to
cure mind-sickness. After a night it would give way to that
unattractive, and not honourable, internal ache which in itself
provoked thought and left its victim yet weaker to endure. In such
conditions the war seemed as great a folly as my sham leadership a
crime; and, sending for our sheikhs, I was about to resign myself
and my pretensions into their puzzled hands, when the fugleman
announced a train.</p>

<p>It came down from Maan, a water-train, and passed over the mine
without accident. The Arabs thanked me, for a booty of water was
not their dream. The mine-action had failed; so at noon, with my
pupils, I went down to lay an electric mine over the lyddite, that
the detonation of one might fire the other. For concealment we
trusted to the mirage and midday drowsiness of the Turks;
justifiably, for there was no alarm in the hour we spent burying
the charge.</p>

<p>From the southern bridge we brought the electric leads to the
middle bridge, whose arch would conceal the exploder from a train
overhead. The Lewis guns we put under the northern bridge, to rake
the far side of the train when the mine went off. The Arabs would
line the bushes of a cross-channel of the valley three hundred
yards our side of the railway. We waited afterwards throughout a
day of sunlight and flies. Enemy patrols marched actively along the
line morning, afternoon and evening.</p>

<p>On the second day, about eight in the morning, a pillar of smoke
left Maan. At the same time the first patrol approached. They were
only half a dozen men, but their warning would deter the train; and
we watched strainingly, in wonder which would win the race. The
train was very slow, and sometimes the patrol halted.</p>

<p>We calculated they might be two or three hundred yards short of
us when the train came. So we ordered everybody to stations. With
twelve loaded waggons the engine panted on the up grade. However,
it held on steadily. I sat by a bush in the stream-bed, a hundred
yards from the mine; in view of it and of the exploder-party and of
the machine-guns. When Faiz and Bedri heard the engine over their
arch, they danced a war-dance round their little electric box. The
Arabs in the ditch were hissing softly to me that it was time to
fire: but not until the engine was exactly over the arch did I jump
up and wave my cloak. Faiz instantly pressed his handle, and the
great noise and dust and blackness burst up, as at Mudow-wara a
week before, and enveloped me where I sat, while the green-yellow
sickly smoke of lyddite hung sluggishly about the wreck. The Lewis
guns rattled out suddenly, three or four short bursts: there was a
yell from the Arabs, and, headed by Pisani sounding the women's
vibrant battle-cry, they rushed in a wild torrent for the
train.</p>

<p>A Turk appeared upon the buffers of the fourth truck from the
end, loosed the couplings, and let the tail of the train slip back
down the gradient. I made a languid effort to get behind the wheel
with a stone, but scarcely cared enough to do it well. It seemed
fair and witty that this much of the booty should escape. A Turkish
colonel from the window fired at me with a Mauser pistol, cutting
the flesh of my hip. I laughed at his too-great energy, which
thought, like a regular officer, to promote the war by the killing
of an individual.</p>

<p>Our mine had taken out the near arch of the bridge. Of the
locomotive, the fire-box was torn open, and many tubes burst. The
cab was cleared out, a cylinder gone, the frame buckled, two
driving wheels and their journals shattered. The tender and first
waggon had telescoped. About twenty Turks were dead, and others
prisoners, including four officers, who stood by the line weeping
for the life which the Arabs had no mind to take.</p>

<p>The contents of the trucks were food-stuffs, some seventy tons
of them; 'urgently needed', according to the way-bill, in Medain
Salih. We sent one way-bill to Feisal, as detailed report of our
success, and left the other receipted in the van. We also kicked
northward some dozen civilians, who had thought they were going to
Medina.</p>

<p>Pisani superintended the carrying off or destruction of the
booty. As before, the Arabs were now merely camel-drivers, walking
behind laden pack-animals. Farraj held my camel, while Salem and
Dheilan helped with the exploder and the too-heavy wire. Rescue
parties of Turks were four hundred yards away when we had finished,
but we rode off without a man killed or wounded.</p>

<p>My pupils practised the art of mining afterwards by themselves,
and taught others. Rumour of their fortune rolled about the tribes
in a growing wave: not always intelligently. 'Send us a lurens and
we will blow up trains with it', wrote the Beni Atiyeh to Feisal.
He lent them Saad, a cut-and-thrust Ageyli, by whose help they got
an important train carrying Suleiman Rifada, our old nuisance of
Wejh, with twenty thousand pounds in gold, and precious trophies.
Saad repeated history by saving only the wire for his share.</p>

<p>In the next four months our experts from Akaba destroyed
seventeen locomotives. Travelling became an uncertain terror for
the enemy. At Damascus people scrambled for the back seats in
trains, even paid extra for them. The engine-drivers struck.
Civilian traffic nearly ceased; and we extended our threat to
Aleppo by the mere posting a notice one night on Damascus Town
Hall, that good Arabs would henceforward travel by the Syrian
railway at their own risk. The loss of the engines was sore upon
the Turks. Since the rolling stock was pooled for Palestine and
Hejaz, our destructions not merely made the mass evacuation of
Medina impossible, but began to pinch the army about Jerusalem,
just as the British threat grew formidable.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Egypt had wired for me. An aeroplane carried me to
G.H.Q., where Allenby by splendour of will was re-creating the
broken British Army. He asked what our railway efforts meant; or
rather if they meant anything beyond the melodramatic advertisement
they gave Feisal's cause.</p>

<p>I explained my hope to leave the line just working, but only
just, to Medina; where Fakhri's corps fed itself at less cost than
if in prison at Cairo. The surest way to limit the line without
killing it was by attacking trains. The Arabs put into mining a
zest absent from their pure demolitions. We could not yet break the
line, since railhead was the strongest point of a railway, and we
preferred weakness in the nearest enemy neighbour till our regular
army was trained and equipped and numerous enough to invest
Maan.</p>

<p>He asked about Wadi Musa, because Turkish messages showed their
intention to assault it at once. I explained that we had tried to
provoke the Turks to attack Wadi Musa, and were about to be
rewarded by their falling, foxed and fogged, into our trap. We went
about in parties, not in stiff formation, and their aeroplanes
failed to estimate us. No spies could count us, either, since even
ourselves had not the smallest idea of our strength at any given
moment.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we knew them exactly; each single unit, and
every man they moved. They treated us as regulars, and before
venturing a move against us calculated the total force we could
meet them with. We, less orthodox, knew exactly what they would
meet us with. This was our balance. For these years the Arab
Movement lived on the exhilarating but slippery tableland between
'could' and 'would'. We allowed no margin for accident: indeed 'no
margins' was the Akaba motto, continuously in the mouths of
all.</p>

<p>When at last it came, Jemal's great attack on Wadi Musa made no
noise. Maulud presided beautifully. He opened his centre, and with
the greatest of humour let in the Turks until they broke their
faces against the vertical cliffs of the Arab refuge. Then, while
they were still puzzled and hurt, he came down simultaneously on
both flanks. They never again attacked a prepared Arab position.
Their losses had been heavy, but the loss of nerve at finding us
invisible and yet full of backlash cost them more than the
casualties. Thanks to Maulud, Akaba became quit of all concern for
its own present safety.</p>

<blockquote><i>By November, 1917, Allenby was ready to open a

should have done the same in their sector: but I was afraid to put

<h3>CHAPTER LXIX</h3>

<p>October, accordingly, was a month of anticipation for us, in the
knowledge that Allenby, with Bols and Dawnay, was planning to
attack the Gaza-Beersheba line; while the Turks, a quite small army
strongly entrenched, with excellent lateral communications, had
been puffed up by successive victories to imagine that all British
generals were incompetent to keep what their troops had won for
them by dint of sheer hard fighting.</p>

<p>They deceived themselves. Allenby's coming had re-made the
English. His breadth of personality swept away the mist of private
or departmental jealousies behind which Murray and his men had
worked. General Lynden Bell made way for General Bols, Allenby's
chief of staff in France, a little, quick, brave, pleasant man; a
tactical soldier perhaps, but principally an admirable and effaced
foil to Allenby, who used to relax himself on Bols. Unfortunately,
neither of them had the power of choosing men; but Chetwode's
judgement completed them with Guy Dawnay as third member of the
staff.</p>

<p>Bols had never an opinion, nor any knowledge. Dawnay was mainly
intellect. He lacked the eagerness of Bols, and the calm drive and
human understanding of Allenby, who was the man the men worked for,
the image we worshipped. Dawnay's cold, shy mind gazed upon our
efforts with bleak eye, always thinking, thinking. Beneath this
mathematical surface he hid passionate many-sided convictions, a
reasoned scholarship in higher warfare, and the brilliant
bitterness of a judgement disappointed with us, and with life.</p>

<p>He was the least professional of soldiers, a banker who read
Greek history, a strategist unashamed, and a burning poet with
strength over daily things. During the war he had had the grief of
planning the attack at Suvla (spoiled by incompetent tacticians)
and the battle for Gaza. As each work of his was ruined he withdrew
further into the hardnesses of frosted pride, for he was of the
stuff of fanatics.</p>

<p>Allenby, by not seeing his dissatisfaction, broke into him; and
Dawnay replied by giving for the Jerusalem advance all the talent
which he abundantly possessed. A cordial union of two such men made
the Turks' position hopeless from the outset.</p>

<p>Their divergent characters were mirrored in the intricate plan.
Gaza had been entrenched on a European scale with line after line
of defences in reserve. It was so obviously the enemy's strongest
point, that the British higher command had twice chosen it for
frontal attack. Allenby, fresh from France, insisted that any
further assault must be delivered by overwhelming numbers of men
and guns, and their thrust maintained by enormous quantities of all
kinds of transport. Bols nodded his assent.</p>

<p>Dawnay was not the man to fight a straight battle. He sought to
destroy the enemy's strength with the least fuss. Like a master
politician, he used the bluff Chief as a cloak for the last depth
of justifiable slimness. He advised a drive at the far end of the
Turkish line, near Beersheba. To make his victory cheap he wanted
the enemy main force behind Gaza, which would be best secured if
the British concentration was hidden so that the Turks would
believe the flank attack to be a shallow feint. Bols nodded his
assent.</p>

<p>Consequently the movements were made in great secrecy; but
Dawnay found an ally in his intelligence staff who advised him to
go beyond negative precautions, and to give the enemy specific (and
speciously wrong) information of the plans he matured.</p>

<p>This ally was Meinertzhagen, a student of migrating birds
drifted into soldiering, whose hot immoral hatred of the enemy
expressed itself as readily in trickery as in violence. He
persuaded Dawnay: Allenby reluctantly agreed: Bols assented, and
the work began.</p>

<p>Meinertzhagen knew no half measures. He was logical, an idealist
of the deepest, and so possessed by his convictions that he was
willing to harness evil to the chariot of good. He was a
strategist, a geographer, and a silent laughing masterful man; who
took as blithe a pleasure in deceiving his enemy (or his friend) by
some unscrupulous jest, as in spattering the brains of a cornered
mob of Germans one by one with his African knob-kerri. His
instincts were abetted by an immensely powerful body and a savage
brain, which chose the best way to its purpose, unhampered by doubt
or habit Meiner thought out false Army papers, elaborate and
confidential, which to a trained staff officer would indicate wrong
positions for Allenby's main formation, a wrong direction of the
coming attack, and a date some days too late. This information was
led up to by careful hints given in code wireless messages. When he
knew the enemy had picked these up, Meinertzhagen rode out with his
note books, on reconnaissance. He pushed forward until the enemy
saw him. In the ensuing gallop he lost all his loose equipment and
very nearly himself, but was rewarded by seeing the enemy reserves
held behind Gaza and their whole preparations swung towards the
coast and made less urgent. Simultaneously, an Army order by Ali
Fuad Pasha cautioned his staff against carrying documents into the
line.</p>

<p>We on the Arab front were very intimate with the enemy. Our Arab
officers had been Turkish Officers, and knew every leader on the
other side personally. They had suffered the same training, thought
the same, took the same point of view. By practising modes of
approach upon the Arabs we could explore the Turks: understand,
almost get inside, their minds. Relation between us and them was
universal, for the civil population of the enemy area was wholly
ours without pay or persuasion. In consequence our intelligence
service was the widest, fullest and most certain imaginable.</p>

<p>We knew, better than Allenby, the enemy hollowness, and the
magnitude of the British resources. We under-estimated the
crippling effect of Allenby's too plentiful artillery, and the
cumbrous intricacy of his infantry and cavalry, which moved only
with rheumatic slowness. We hoped Allenby would be given a month's
fine weather; and, in that case, expected to see him take, not
merely Jerusalem, but Haifa too, sweeping the Turks in ruin through
the hills.</p>

<p>Such would be our moment, and we needed to be ready for it in
the spot where our weight and tactics would be least expected and
most damaging. For my eyes, the centre of attraction was Deraa, the
junction of the Jerusalem-Haifa-Damascus-Medina railways, the navel
of the Turkish Armies in Syria, the common point of all their
fronts; and, by chance, an area in which lay great untouched
reserves of Arab fighting men, educated and armed by Feisal from
Akaba. We could there use Rualla, Serahin, Serdiyeh, Khoreisha;
and, far stronger than tribes, the settled peoples of Hauran and
Jebel Druse.</p>

<p>I pondered for a while whether we should not call up all these
adherents and tackle the Turkish communications in force. We were
certain, with any management, of twelve thousand men: enough to
rush Deraa, to smash all the railway lines, even to take Damascus
by surprise. Any one of these things would make the position of the
Beersheba army critical: and my temptation to stake our capital
instantly upon the issue was very sore.</p>

<p>Not for the first or last time service to two masters irked me.
I was one of Allenby's officers, and in his confidence: in return,
he expected me to do the best I could for him. I was Feisal's
adviser, and Feisal relied upon the honesty and competence of my
advice so far as often to take it without argument. Yet I could not
explain to Allenby the whole Arab situation, nor disclose the full
British plan to Feisal.</p>

<p>The local people were imploring us to come. Sheikh Talal el
Hareidhin, leader of the hollow country about Deraa, sent in
repeated messages that, with a few of our riders as proof of Arab
support, he would give us Deraa. Such an exploit would have done
the Allenby business, but was not one which Feisal could
scrupulously afford unless he had a fair hope of then establishing
himself there. Deraa's sudden capture, followed by a retreat, would
have involved the massacre, or the ruin of all the splendid
peasantry of the district.</p>

<p>They could only rise once, and their effort on that occasion
must be decisive. To call them out now was to risk the best asset
Feisal held for eventual success, on the speculation that Allenby's
first attack would sweep the enemy before it, and that the month of
November would be rainless, favourable to a rapid advance.</p>

<p>I weighed the English army in my mind, and could not honestly
assure myself of them. The men were often gallant fighters, but
their generals as often gave away in stupidity what they had gained
in ignorance. Allenby was quite untried, sent to us with a
not-blameless record from France, and his troops had broken down in
and been broken by the Murray period. Of course, we were fighting
for an Allied victory, and since the English were the leading
partners, the Arabs would have, in the last resort, to be
sacrificed for them. But was it the last resort? The war generally
was going neither well nor very ill, and it seemed as though there
might be time for another try next year. So I decided to postpone
the hazard for the Arabs' sake.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXX</h3>

<p>However, the Arab Movement lived on Allenby's good pleasure, so
it was needful to undertake some operation, less than a general
revolt, in the enemy rear: an operation which could be achieved by
a raiding party without involving the settled peoples; and yet one
which would please him by being of material help to the British
pursuit of the enemy. These conditions and qualifications pointed,
upon consideration, to an attempted cutting of one of the great
bridges in the Yarmuk Valley.</p>

<p>It was by the narrow and precipitous gorge of the Biver Yarmuk
that the railway from Palestine climbed to Hauran, on its way to
Damascus. The depth of the Jordan depression, and the abruptness of
the eastern plateau-face made this section of the line most
difficult to build. The engineers had to lay it in the very course
of the winding river-valley: and to gain its development the line
had to cross and recross the stream continually by a series of
bridges, the farthest west and the farthest east of which were
hardest to replace.</p>

<p>To cut either of these bridges would isolate the Turkish army in
Palestine, for one fortnight, from its base in Damascus, and
destroy its power of escaping from Allenby's advance. To reach the
Yarmuk we should need to ride from Akaba, by way of Azrak, some
four hundred and twenty miles. The Turks thought the danger from us
so remote that they guarded the bridges insufficiently.</p>

<p>Accordingly we suggested the scheme to Allenby, who asked that
it be done on November the fifth, or one of the three following
days. If it succeeded, and the weather held up afterwards for a
fortnight, the odds were that no coherent unit of von Rress's army
would survive its retreat to Damascus. The Arabs would then have
their opportunity to carry their wave forward into the great
capital, taking up at the half-way point from the British, whose
original impulse would then be nearly exhausted, with the
exhaustion of their transport.</p>

<p>For such an eventuality we needed at Azrak an authority to lead
the potential local adherents. Nasir, our usual pioneer, was
absent: but out with the Beni Sakhr was Ali ibn el Hussein, the
youthful and attractive Harith Sherif, who had distinguished
himself in Feisal's early desperate days about Medina, and later
had out-newcombed Newcombe about el Ula.</p>

<p>Ali, having been Jemal's guest in Damascus, had learned
something of Syria: so I begged a loan of him from Feisal. His
courage, his resource, and his energy were proven. There had never
been any adventure, since our beginning, too dangerous for Ali to
attempt, nor a disaster too deep for him to face with his high yell
of a laugh.</p>

<p>He was physically splendid: not tall nor heavy, but so strong
that he would kneel down, resting his forearms palm-up on the
ground, and rise to his feet with a man on each hand. In addition,
Ali could outstrip a trotting camel on his bare feet, keep his
speed over half a mile and then leap into the saddle. He was
impertinent, headstrong, conceited; as reckless in word as in deed;
impressive (if he pleased) on public occasions, and fairly educated
for a person whose native ambition was to excel the nomads of the
desert in war and sport.</p>

<p>Ali would bring us the Beni Sakhr. We had good hopes of the
Serahin, the tribe at Azrak. I was in touch with the Beni Hassan.
The Rualla, of course, at this season were away at their winter
quarters, so that our greatest card in the Hauran could not be
played. Faiz el Ghusein had gone into the Lejah to prepare for
action against the Hauran Railway if the signal came. Explosives
were stored in desirable places. Our friends in Damascus were
warned; and Ali Riza Pasha Rikabi, the city's military governor for
the innocent Turks, and at the same time chief agent and
conspirator for the Sherif, took quiet steps to retain control if
the emergency arose.</p>

<p>My detailed plan was to rush from Azrak, under guidance of Rafa
(that most gallant sheikh who had convoyed me in June), to Um Keis,
in one or two huge marches with a handful of, perhaps, fifty men.
Um Keis was Gadara, very precious with its memories of Menippus and
of Meleager, the immoral Greek-Syrian whose self-expression marked
the highest point of Syrian letters. It stood just over the
westernmost of the Yarmuk bridges, a steel masterpiece whose
destruction would fairly enrol me in the Gadarene school. Only half
a dozen sentries were stationed actually on the girders and
abutments. Reliefs for them were supplied from a garrison of sixty,
in the station buildings of Hemme, where the hot springs of Gadara
yet gushed out to the advantage of local sick. My hope was to
persuade some of the Abu Tayi under Zaal to come with me. These
men-wolves would make certain the actual storming of the bridge. To
prevent enemy reinforcements coming up we would sweep the
approaches with machine-guns, handled by Captain Bray's Indian
volunteers from the cavalry division in France, under Jemadar
Hassan Shah, a firm and experienced man. They had been months up
country, rail-cutting, from Wejh, and might fairly be assumed to
have become experts on camel-back, fit for the forced marches in
prospect.</p>

<p>The demolition of great underslung girders with limited weights
of explosive was a precise operation, and demanded a necklace of
blasting gelatine, fired electrically. The <i>humber</i> made us
canvas straps and buckles, to simplify the fixing. None the less,
the job remained a difficult one to do under fire. For fear of a
casualty, Wood, the base engineer at Akaba, the only sapper
available, was invited to come along and double me. He immediately
agreed, though knowing he had been condemned medically for active
service as the result of a bullet through the head in France.
George Lloyd, who was spending a last few days in Akaba before
going to Versailles on a regretted inter-allied Commission, said
that he would ride up with us to Jefer: as he was one of the best
fellows and least obtrusive travellers alive, his coming added
greatly to our forlorn anticipation.</p>

<p><b>Turk Troops Bombed in Wadi Fara</b>
</p>
</center>

<p>We were making our last preparations when an unexpected ally
arrived in Emir Abd el Kader el Jezairi, grandson of the chivalrous
defender of Algiers against the French. The exiled family had lived
in Damascus for a generation. One of them, Omar, had been hanged by
Jemal for treason disclosed in the Picot papers. The others had
been deported, and Abd el Kader told us a long story of his escape
from Brusa, and his journey, with a thousand adventures, across
Anatolia to Damascus. In reality, he had been enlarged by the Turks
upon request of the Khedive Abbas Hilmi, and sent down by him on
private business to Mecca. He went there, saw King Hussein, and
came back with a crimson banner, and noble gifts, his crazy mind
half-persuaded of our right, and glowing jerkily with
excitement.</p>

<p>To Feisal he offered the bodies and souls of his villagers,
sturdy, hard-smiting Algerian exiles living compactly along the
north bank of the Yarmuk. We seized at the chance this would give
us to control for a little time the middle section of the Valley
railway, including two or three main bridges, without the
disability of raising the country-side; since the Algerians were
hated strangers and the Arab peasantry would not join them.
Accordingly, we put off calling Rafa to meet us at Azrak, and said
not a word to Zaal, concentrating our thoughts instead on Wadi
Khalid and its bridges.</p>

<p>While we were in this train of mind arrived a telegram from
Colonel Bremond, warning us that Abd el Kader was a spy in pay of
the Turks. It was disconcerting. We watched him narrowly, but found
no proof of the charge, which was not to be accepted blindly, as
from Bremond, who was more a liability than our colleague; his
military temper might have carried away his judgement when he heard
Abd el Kader's outspoken public and private denunciations of
France. The French conception of their country as a fair woman lent
to them a national spitefulness against those who scorned her
charms.</p>

<p>Feisal told Abd el Kader to ride with Ali and myself, and said
to me, 'I know he is mad. I think he is honest. Guard your heads
and use him'. We carried on, showing him our complete confidence,
on the principle that a crook would not credit our honesty, and
that an honest man was made a crook soonest by suspicion. As a
matter of fact, he was an Islamic fanatic, half-insane with
religious enthusiasm and a most violent belief in himself. His
Moslem susceptibilities were outraged by my undisguised
Christianity. His pride was hurt by our companionship; for the
tribes greeted Ali as greater, and treated me as better, than
himself. His bullet-headed stupidity broke down Ali's self-control
twice or thrice into painful scenes: while his final effort was to
leave us in the lurch at a desperate moment, after hindering our
march and upsetting ourselves and our plans as far as he could.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXI</h3>

<p>Starting was as difficult as ever. For my bodyguard I took six
recruits. Of these Mahmud was a native of the Yarmuk. He was an
alert and hot-tempered lad of nineteen, with the petulance often
accompanying curly hair. Another, Aziz, of Tafas, an older fellow,
had spent three years with the Beduin in avoidance of military
service. Though capable with camels, he was a shallow spirit,
almost rabbit-mouthed, but proud. A third was Mustafa, a gentle boy
from Deraa, very honest, who went about sadly by himself because he
was deaf, and ashamed of his infirmity. One day on the beach, in a
short word he had begged admittance to my bodyguard. So evidently
did he expect to be refused that I took him; and it was a good
choice for the others, since he was a mild peasant, whom they could
bully into all the menial tasks. Yet he, too, was happy, for he was
among desperate fellows, and the world would think him desperate.
To balance his inefficiency on the march I enrolled Showak and
Salem, two Sherari camel-herds, and Abd el Rahman, a runaway slave
from Riyadth.</p>

<p>Of the old bodyguard I gave Mohammed and Ali a rest. They were
tired after train-wrecking adventures; and, like their camels,
needed to pasture quietly awhile. This left Ahmed the inevitable
head man. His ruthless energy deserved promotion, but the obvious
choice as ever failed. He misused his power and became oppressive;
so it was his last march with me. I took Kreim for the camels; and
Rahail, the lusty, conceited Haurani lad, for whom overwork was the
grace which kept him continent. Matar, a parasite fellow of the
Beni Hassan, attached himself to us. His fat peasant's buttocks
filled his camel-saddle, and took nearly as large a share in the
lewd or lurid jokes which, on march, helped pass my guards'
leisure. We might enter Beni Hassan territory, where he had some
influence. His unblushing greed made us sure of him, till his
expectations failed.</p>

<p>My service was now profitable, for I knew my worth to the
movement, and spent freely to keep myself safe. Rumour, for once in
a helpful mood, gilded my open hand. Farraj and Daud, with Khidr
and Mijbil, two Biasha, completed the party.</p>

<p>Farraj and Daud were capable and merry on the road, which they
loved as all the lithe Ageyl loved it; but in camp their excess of
spirit led them continually into dear affairs. This time they
surpassed themselves by disappearing on the morning of our
departure. At noon came a message from Sheikh Yusuf that they were
in his prison, and would I talk to him about it? I went up to the
house and found his bulk shaking between laughter and rage. He had
just bought a cream-coloured riding-camel of purest blood. The
beast had strayed in the evening into the palm-garden where my
Ageyl were camped. They never suspected she belonged to the
Governor, but laboured till dawn dyeing her head bright red with
henna, and her legs blue with indigo, before turning her loose.</p>

<p>Akaba bubbled immediately in an uproar about this circus beast.
Yusuf recognized her with difficulty and hurled all his police
abroad to find the criminals. The two friends were dragged before
the judgement seat, stained to the elbows with dye, and loudly
protesting their entire innocence. Circumstances, however, were too
strong; and Yusuf after doing his best with a palm-rib to hurt
their feelings, put them in irons for a slow week's meditation. My
concern made good his damage by the loan of a camel till his own
should be respectable. Then I explained our instant need of the
sinners, and promised another dose of his treatment for them when
their skins were fit: so he ordered their release. They were
delighted to escape the verminous prison on any terms, and rejoined
us singing.</p>

<p>This business had delayed us. So we had an immense final meal in
the luxury of camp, and started in the evening. For four hours we
marched slowly: a first march was always slow, and both camels and
men hated the setting out on a new hazard. Loads slipped, saddles
had to be re-girthed, and riders changed. In addition to my own
camels (Ghazala, the old grandmother, now far gone in foal, and
Rima, a full-pointed Sherari camel which the Sukhur had stolen from
the Rualla) and those of the bodyguard, I had mounted the Indians,
and lent one to Wood (who was delicate in the saddle and rode a
fresh animal nearly every day), and one to Thorne, Lloyd's yeomanry
trooper, who sat his saddle like an Arab and looked workmanlike in
a head-cloth, with a striped cloak over his khaki. Lloyd himself
was on a thoroughbred Dheraiyeh which Feisul had lent him: a fine,
fast-looking animal, but clipped after mange and thin.</p>

<p>Our party straggled. Wood fell behind, and my men, being fresh,
and having much work to keep the Indians together, lost touch with
him. So he found himself alone with Thorne, and missed our turn to
the east, in the blackness which always filled the depths of the
Itm gorge by night, except when the moon was directly overhead.
They went on up the main track towards Guweira, riding for hours;
but at last decided to wait for day in a side valley. Both were new
to the country, and not sure of the Arabs, so they took turns to
keep watch. We guessed what had happened when they failed to appear
at our midnight halt, and before dawn Ahmed, Aziz and Abd el Rahman
went back, with orders to scatter up the three or four practicable
roads and bring the missing pair to Rumm.</p>

<p>I stayed with Lloyd and the main body as their guide across the
curved slopes of pink sandstone and tamarisk-green valleys to Rumm.
Air and light were so wonderful that we wandered without thinking
in the least of to-morrow. Indeed, had I not Lloyd to talk to? The
world became very good. A faint shower last evening had brought
earth and sky together in the mellow day. The colours in cliffs and
trees and soil were so pure, so vivid, that we ached for real
contact with them, and at our tethered inability to carry anything
of them away. We were full of leisure. The Indians proved bad
camel-masters, while Farraj and Daud pleaded a new form of
saddle-soreness, called Tusufiyeh', which made them walk mile after
mile.</p>

<p>We entered Ruinm at last, while the crimson sunset burned on its
stupendous cliffs and slanted ladders of hazy fire down the walled
avenue. Wood and Thorne were there already, in the sandstone
amphitheatre of the springs. Wood was ill, and lying on the
platform of my old camp. Abd el Rahman had caught them before noon,
and persuaded them to follow him after a good deal of
misunderstanding, for their few words of Egyptian did not help much
with his clipped Aridh dialect or the Howeiti slang with which he
eked it out. He had cut across the hills by a difficult path to
their great discomfort.</p>

<p>Wood had been hungry and hot and worried, angry to the point of
refusing the native mess which Abd el Rahman contrived them in a
wayside tent. He had begun to believe that he would never see us
again, and was ungrateful when we proved too overcome with the awe
that Rumm compelled on her visitors to sympathize deeply with his
sufferings. In fact, we stared and said 'Yes', and left him lying
there while we wandered whispering about the wonder of the place.
Fortunately Ahmed and Thorne thought more of food: and with supper
friendly relations were restored.</p>

<p>Next day, while we were saddling, Ali and Abd el Kader appeared.
Lloyd and I had a second lunch with them, for they were
quarrelling, and to have guests held them in check. Lloyd was the
rare sort of traveller who could eat anything with anybody, anyhow
and at any time. Then, making pace, we pushed after our party down
the giant valley, whose hills <i>tell</i> short of architecture
only in design.</p>

<p>At the bottom we crossed the flat Gaa, matching our camels in a
burst over its velvet surface, until we overtook the main body, and
scattered them with the excitement of our gallop. The Indians'
soberly laden camels danced like ironmongery till they had shed
their burdens. Then we calmed ourselves, and plodded together
gently up Wadi Hafira, a gash like a sword-cut into the plateau. At
its head lay a stiff pass to the height of Batra; but to-day we
fell short of this, and out of laziness and craving for comfort
stopped in the sheltered bottom of the valley. We lit great fires,
which were cheerful in the cool evening. Farraj prepared rice in
his manner for me as usual. Lloyd and Wood and Thorne had brought
with them bully beef in tins and British army biscuits. So we
joined ranks and feasted.</p>

<p>Next day we climbed the zigzag broken pass, the grassy street of
Hafira below us framing a cone-hill in its centre, with, as
background, the fantastic grey domes and glowing pyramids of the
mountains of Rumm, prolonged to-day into wider fantasies by the
cloud-masses brooding over them. We watched our long train wind
upwards, till before noon the camels, Arabs, Indians and baggage
had reached the top without accident. Contentedly we plumped
ourselves down in the first green valley over the crest, sheltered
from the wind, and warmed by the faint sunshine which tempered the
autumn chill of this high tableland. Someone began to talk again
about food.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXII</h3>

<p>I went away north, scouting with Awad, a Sherari camel boy,
engaged in Rumm without investigation. There were so many baggage
camels in our party, and the Indians proved such novices at loading
and leading them, that my bodyguard were being diverted from their
proper duty of riding with me. So when Showakh introduced his
cousin, a Khayal Sherari who would serve with me on any conditions,
I accepted him at the glance: and now set out to measure his worth
in a predicament.</p>

<p>We circled round Aba el Lissan to make sure that the Turks were
in seemly idleness, for they had a habit of rushing a mounted
patrol over the Batra sites at sudden notice, and I had no mind to
put our party into unnecessary action yet. Awad was a ragged,
brown-skinned lad of perhaps eighteen, splendidly built, with the
muscles and sinews of an athlete, active as a cat, alive in the
saddle (he rode magnificently) and not ill-looking, though with
something of the base appearance of the Sherarat, and in his savage
eye an air of constant and rather suspicious expectancy, as though
he looked any moment for something new from life, and that
something not of his seeking or ordering, nor wholly grateful.</p>

<p>These Sherarat helots were an enigma of the desert. Other men
might have hopes or illusions. Sherarat knew that nothing better
than physical existence was willingly permitted them by mankind in
this world or another. Such extreme degradation was a positive base
on which to build a trust. I treated them exactly like the others
in my bodyguard. This they found astonishing; and yet pleasant,
when they had learned that my protection was active and sufficient.
While they served me they became wholly my property, and good
slaves they were, for nothing practicable in the desert was beneath
their dignity, or beyond their tempered strength and
experience.</p>

<p>Awad before me showed himself confused and self-conscious,
though with his fellows he could be merry and full of japes. His
engagement was a sudden fortune beyond dreams, and he was pitifully
determined to suit my mind. For the moment this was to wander
across the Maan high road in order to draw the Turks' notice. When
we had succeeded, and they trotted out in chase, we returned back,
doubled again, and so tricked their mule-riders away northward out
of the direction of danger. Awad took gleeful concern in the game
and handled his new rifle well.</p>

<p>Afterwards I climbed with him to the top of a hill overlooking
Batra, and the valleys which sloped to Aba el Lissan, and we lay
there lazily till afternoon, watching the Turks riding in a vain
direction, and our fellows asleep, and their pasturing camels, and
the shadows of the low clouds seeming like gentle hollows as they
chased over the grass in the pale sunlight. It was peaceful,
chilly, and very far from the fretting world. The austerity of
height shamed back the vulgar baggage of our cares. In the place of
consequence it set freedom, power to be alone, to slip the escort
of our manufactured selves; a rest and forgetfulness of the chains
of being.</p>

<p>But Awad could not forget his appetite and the new sensation of
power in my caravan to satisfy it regularly each day: so he
fidgeted about the ground on his belly chewing innumerable stalks
of grass, and talking to me of his animal joys in jerky phrases
with averted face, till we saw Ali's cavalcade beginning to lip
over the head of the pass. Then we ran down the slopes to meet
them, and heard how he had lost four camels on the pass, two broken
by falls, two failing through weakness as they mounted the rocky
ledges. Also, he had fallen out again with Abd el Kader, from whose
deafness and conceit and boorish manners he prayed God to deliver
him. The Emir moved so cumbrously, having no sense of the road: and
flatly refused to join with Lloyd and myself into one caravan, for
safety.</p>

<p>We left them to follow us after dark, and as they had no guide,
I loaned them Awad. We would meet again in Auda's tents. Then we
moved forward over shallow valleys and cross-ridges till the sun
set behind the last high bank, from whose top we saw the square box
of the station at Ghadir el Haj breaking artificially out of the
level, miles and miles away. Behind us in the valley were broom
bushes, so we called a halt, and made our supper-fires. This
evening Hassan Shah devised a pleasant notion (later to become a
habit) of winding up our meal by an offering of his Indian tea. We
were too greedy and grateful to refuse, and shamelessly exhausted
his tea and sugar before fresh rations could be sent him from the
base.</p>

<p>Lloyd and I marked the bearing of the railway where we purposed
to cross just below Shedia. As the stars rose we agreed that we
must march upon Orion. So we started and marched on Orion for hour
after hour, with effect that Orion seemed no nearer, and there were
no signs of anything between us and him. We had debouched from the
ridges upon the plain, and the plain was never-ending, and
monotonously striped by shallow wadi-beds, with low, flat, straight
banks, which in the milky star-light looked always like the
earthwork of the expected railway. The going underfoot was firm,
and the cool air of the desert in our faces made the camels swing
out freely.</p>

<p>Lloyd and I went in front to spy out the line, that the main
body might not be involved if chance put us against a Turkish
blockhouse or night-patrol. Our fine camels, lightly ridden, set
too long a stride; so that, without knowing, we drew more and more
ahead of the laden Indians. Hassan Shah the Jemadar threw out a man
to keep us in sight, and then another, and after that a third, till
his party was a hurrying string of connecting files. Then he sent
up an urgent whisper to go slowly, but the message which reached us
after its passage through three languages was unintelligible.</p>

<p>We halted and so knew that the quiet night was full of sounds,
while the scents of withering grass ebbed and flowed about us with
the dying wind. Afterwards we marched again more slowly, as it
seemed for hours, and the plain was still barred with deceitful
dykes, which kept our attention at unprofitable stretch. We felt
the stars were shifting and that we were steering wrong. Lloyd had
a compass somewhere. We halted and groped in his deep saddle-bags.
Thorne rode up and found it. We stood around calculating on its
luminous arrow-head, and deserted Orion for a more auspicious
northern star. Then again interminably forward till as we climbed a
larger bank Lloyd reined up with a gasp and pointed. Fair in our
track on the horizon were two cubes blacker than the sky, and by
them a pointed roof. We were bearing straight for Shedia station,
nearly into it.</p>

<p>We swung to the right, and jogged hastily across an open space,
a little nervous lest some of the caravan strung out behind us
should miss the abrupt change of course: but all was well, and a
few minutes later in the next hollow we exchanged our thrill in
English and Turkish, Arabic and Urdu. Behind us broke out a faint
pulse-quickening clamour of dogs in the Turkish camp.</p>

<p>We now knew our place, and took a fresh bearing to avoid the
first blockhouse below Shedia. We led off confidently, expecting in
a little to cross the line. Yet again time dragged and nothing
showed itself. It was midnight, we had marched for six hours, and
Lloyd began to speak bitterly of reaching Bagdad in the morning.
There could be no railway here. Thorne saw a row of trees, and saw
them move; the bolts of our rifles clicked, but they were only
trees.</p>

<p>We gave up hope, and rode carelessly, nodding in our saddles,
letting our tired eyes lid themselves. My Rima lost her temper
suddenly. With a squeal she plunged sideways, nearly unseating me,
pranced wildly over two banks and a ditch and flung herself flat in
a dusty place. I hit her over the head, and she rose and paced
forward nervously. Again the Indians lagged far behind our hasty
selves; but after an hour the last bank of to-night loomed
differently in front of us. It took straight shape, and over its
length grew darker patches which might be the shadowed mouths of
culverts. We spurred our minds to a fresh interest, and drove our
animals swiftly and silently forward. When we were nearer it, the
bank put up a fencing of sharp spikes along its edge. These were
the telegraph poles. A white-headed figure checked us for a moment,
but he never stirred, and so we judged him a kilometre post.</p>

<p>Quickly we halted our party and rode to one side and then
straight in, to challenge what lay behind the quiet of the place,
expecting the darkness to spout fire at us suddenly, and the
silence to volley out in rifle shots. But there was no alarm. We
reached the bank and found it deserted. We dismounted and ran up
and down each way two hundred yards: nobody. There was room for our
passage.</p>

<p>We ordered the others immediately over into the empty, friendly
desert on the east, and sat ourselves on the metals under the
singing wires, while the long line of shadowy bulks wavered up out
of the dark, shuffled a little on the bank and its ballast, and
passed down behind us into the dark in that strained noiselessness
which was a night march of camels. The last one crossed. Our little
group collected about a telegraph post. Out of a short scuffle
Thorne rose slowly up the pole to catch the lowest wire and swing
himself to its insulator-bracket. He reached for the top, and a
moment later there was a loud metallic twang and shaking of the
post as the cut wire leaped back each way into the air, and slapped
itself free from six or more poles on either side. The second and
third wires followed it, twisting noisily along the stony ground,
and yet no answering sound came out of the night, showing that we
had passed lightly in the empty distance of two blockhouses.
Thorne, with splintery hands, slid down the tottering pole. We
walked to our kneeling camels, and trotted after the company.
Another hour, and we ordered a rest till dawn; but before then were
roused by a brief flurry of rifle fire and the tapping of a
machine-gun far away to the north. Little Ali and Abd el Kadir were
not making so clean a crossing of the line.</p>

<p>Next morning, in a cheerful sunshine, we marched up parallel
with the line to salute the first train from Maan, and then struck
inland over the strange Jefer plain. The day was close, and the
sun's power increased, making mirages on all the heated flats.
Riding apart from our straggling party, we saw some of them drowned
in the silver flood, others swimming high over its changing
surface, which stretched and shrank with each swaying of the camel,
or inequality of ground.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon we found Auda camped unobtrusively in the
broken, bushy expanse south-west of the wells. He received us with
constraint. His large tents, with the women, had been sent away
beyond reach of the Turkish aeroplanes. There were few Toweiha
present: and those in violent dispute over the distribution of
tribal wages. The old man was sad we should find him in such
weakness.</p>

<p>I did my best tactfully to smooth the troubles by giving their
minds a new direction and countervailing interests. Successfully
too, for they smiled, which with Arabs was often half the battle.
Enough advantage for the time; we adjourned to eat with Mohammed el
Dheilan. He was a better diplomat, because less open than Auda; and
would have looked cheerful if he thought proper, whatever the
truth. So we were made very welcome to his platter of rice and meat
and dried tomatoes. Mohammed, a villager at heart, fed too
well.</p>

<p>After the meal, as we were wandering back over the grey dry
ditches, like mammoth-wallows, which floods had hacked deeply into
the fibrous mud, I broached to Zaal my plans for an expedition to
the Yarmuk bridges. He disliked the idea very much. Zaal in October
was not the Zaal of August. Success was changing the hard-riding
gallant of spring into a prudent man, whose new wealth made life
precious to him. In the spring he would have led me anywhere; but
the last raid had tried his nerve, and now he said he would mount
only if I made a personal point of it.</p>

<p>I asked what party we could make up; and he named three of the
men in the camp as good fellows for so desperate a hope. The rest
of the tribe were away, dissatisfied. To take three Toweiha would
be worse than useless, for their just conceit would inflame the
other men, while they themselves were too few to suffice alone: so
I said I would try elsewhere. Zaal showed his relief.</p>

<p>While we were still discussing what we ought to do (for I needed
the advice of Zaal, one of the finest raiders alive, and most
competent to judge my half-formed scheme), a scared lad rushed to
our coffee-hearth and blurted that riders in a dust-cloud were
coming up fast from the side of Maan. The Turks there had a
mule-regiment and a cavalry regiment, and were always boasting that
they would some day visit the Abu Tayi. So we jumped up to receive
them.</p>

<p>Auda had fifteen men, of whom five were able-bodied, and the
rest greybeards or boys, but we were thirty strong, and I pondered
the hard luck of the Turkish commander who had chosen for his
surprise the day on which there happened to be guesting with the
Howeitat a section of Indian machine-gunners who knew their
business. We couched and knee-haltered the camels in the deeper
water-cuts, and placed the Vickers and Lewis in others of these
natural trenches, admirably screened with alkali bushes, and
commanding a flat field eight hundred yards each way. Auda dropped
his tents, and threw out his riflemen to supplement our fire; and
then we waited easily till the first horseman rode up the bank on
to our level, and we saw they were Ali ibn el Hussein and Abd el
Kadir, coming to Jefer from the enemy direction. We foregathered
merrily, while Mohammed produced a second edition of tomato-rice
for Ali's comfort. They had lost two men and a mare in the shooting
on the railway in the night.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXIII</h3>

<p>Lloyd was to go back from here to Versailles, and we asked Auda
for a guide to take him across the line. About the man there was no
difficulty, but great difficulty in mounting him; for the Howeitat
camels were at pasture: and the nearest pasture lay a full day's
journey south-east of these barren wells. I cut this difficulty by
providing a mount for the new guide from my own beasts. Choice fell
on my ancient Ghazala, whose pregnancy had proved more heavy than
we thought. Before our long expedition ended she would be unfit for
fast work. So, in honour of his good seat and cheerful spirit,
Thorne was transferred to her, while the Howeitat stared
open-mouthed. They esteemed Ghazala above all the camels of their
desert and would have paid much for the honour of riding her, and
here she was given to a soldier, whose pink face and eyes swollen
with ophthalmia made him look feminine and tearful; a little, said
Lloyd, like an abducted nun. It was a sorry thing to see Lloyd go.
He was understanding, helped wisely, and wished our cause well.
Also he was the one fully-taught man with us in Arabia, and in
these few days together our minds had ranged abroad, discussing any
book or thing in heaven or earth which crossed our fancy. When he
left we were given over again to war and tribes and camels without
end.</p>

<p>The night began with a surfeit of such work. The matter of the
Howeitat must be put right. After dark we gathered round Auda's
hearth, and for hours I was reaching out to this circle of fire-lit
faces, playing on them with all the tortuous arts I knew, now
catching one, now another (it was easy to see the flash in their
eyes when a word got home); or again, taking a false line, and
wasting minutes of precious time without response. The Abu Tayi
were as hard-minded as they were hard-bodied, and the heat of
conviction had burned out of their long since in stress of
work.</p>

<p>Gradually I won my points, but the argument was yet marching
near midnight when Auda held up his stick and called silence. We
listened, wondering what the danger was, and after a while we felt
a creeping reverberation, a cadence of blows too dull, too wide,
too slow easily to find response in our ears. It was like the
mutter of a distant, very lowly thunderstorm. Auda raised his
haggard eyes towards the west, and said, The English guns'. Allenby
was leading off in preparation, and his helpful sounds closed my
case for me beyond dispute.</p>

<p>Next morning the atmosphere of the camp was serene and cordial.
Old Auda, his difficulties over for this time, embraced me warmly,
invoking peace upon us. At the last, whilst I was standing with my
hand on my couched camel, he ran out, took me in his arms again,
and strained me to him. I felt his harsh beard brush my ear as he
whispered to me windily, 'Beware of Abd el Kader'. There were too
many about us to say more.</p>

<p>We pushed on over the unending but weirdly beautiful Jefer
flats, till night fell on us at the foot of a flint scarp, like a
cliff above the plain. We camped there, in a snake-infested pocket
of underwood. Our marches were short and very leisurely. The
Indians had proved novices on the road. They had been for weeks
inland from Wejh, and I had rashly understood that they were
riders; but now, on good animals, and trying their best, they could
average only thirty-five miles a day, a holiday for the rest of the
party.</p>

<p>So for us each day was an easy movement, without effort, quite
free from bodily strain. A golden weather of misty dawns, mild
sunlight, and an evening chill added a strange peacefulness of
nature to the peacefulness of our march. This week was a St.
Martin's summer, which passed like a remembered dream. I felt only
that it was very gentle, very comfortable, that the air was happy,
and my friends content. Conditions so perfect must needs presage
the ending of our time; but this certainty, because of its being
unchallenged by any rebellious hope, served only to deepen the
quiet of the autumnal present. There was no thought or care at all.
My mind was as near stilled those days as ever in my life.</p>

<p>We camped for lunch and for a midday rest&mdash;the soldiers had
to have three meals a day. Suddenly there was an alarm. Men on
horses and camels appeared from the west and north and closed
quickly on us. We snatched our rifles. The Indians, getting used to
short notices, now carried their Vickers and Lewis mounted for
action. After thirty seconds we were in complete posture of
defence, though in this shallow country our position held little of
advantage. To the front on each flank were my bodyguards in their
brilliant clothes, lying spread out between the grey tufts of weed,
with their rifles lovingly against their cheeks. By them the four
neat groups of khaki Indians crouched about their guns. Behind them
lay Sherif Ali's men, himself in their midst, bareheaded and keen,
leaning easily upon his rifle. In the background the camel men were
driving in our grazing animals to be under cover of our fire.</p>

<p>It was a picture that the party made. I was admiring ourselves
and Sherif Ali was exhorting us to hold our fire till the attack
became real, when Awad, with a merry laugh sprang up and ran out
towards the enemy, waving his full sleeve over his head in sign of
friendliness. They fired at, or over him, ineffectually. He lay
down and shot back, one shot, aimed just above the head of the
foremost rider. That, and our ready silence perplexed them. They
pulled off in a hesitant group, and after a minute's discussion,
flagged back their cloaks in half-hearted reply to our signal.</p>

<p>One of them rode towards us at a foot's pace. Awad, protected by
our rifles, went two hundred yards to meet him, and saw that he was
a Sukhurri, who, when he heard our names, feigned shock. We walked
together to Sherif Ali, followed at A distance by the rest of the
newcomers, after they had seen our peaceful greeting. They were a
raiding party from the Zebn Sukhur, who were camped, as we had
expected, in front at Bair.</p>

<p>Ali, furious with them, for their treacherous attack on us,
threatened all sorts of pains. They accepted his tirade sullenly,
saying that it was a Beni Sakhr manner to shoot over strangers. Ali
accepted this as their habit, and a good habit in the desert, but
protested that their unheralded appearance against us from three
sides showed a premeditated ambush. The Beni Sakhr were a dangerous
gang, not pure enough nomads to hold the nomadic code of honour or
to obey the desert law in spirit, and not villagers enough to have
abjured the business of rapine and raid.</p>

<p>Our late assailants went into Bair to report our coming. Mifleh,
chief of their clan, thought it best to efface the ill-reception by
a public show in which all men and horses in the place turned out
to welcome us with wild cheers and gallopings and curvettings, and
much firing of shots and shouting. They whirled round and round us
in desperate chase, clattering over rocks with reckless
horsemanship and small regard for our staidness, as they broke in
and out of the ranks and let off their rifles under our camels'
necks continually.</p>

<p>Clouds of parching chalk dust arose, so that men's voices
croaked.</p>

<p>Eventually the parade eased off, but then Abd el Kader, thinking
the opinion even of fools desirable, felt it upon him to assert his
virtue. They were shouting to Ali ibn el Hussein 'God give victory
to our Sherif' and were reining back on their haunches beside me
with Welcome, Aurans, harbinger of action'. So he climbed up his
mare, into her high Moorish saddle, and with his seven Algerian
servants behind <i>him</i> in stiff file, began to prance
delicately in slow curves, crying out 'Houp, Houp', in his throaty
voice, and firing a pistol unsteadily in the air.</p>

<p>The Bedu, astonished at this performance, gaped silently; till
Mifleh came to us, and said, in his wheedling way, 'Lords, pray
call off your servant, for he can neither shoot nor ride, and if he
hits someone he will destroy our good fortune of today.' Mifleh did
not know the family precedent for his nervousness. Abd el Kader's
brother held what might well be a world's record for three
successive fatal accidents with automatic pistols in the circle of
his Damascus friends. Ali Riza Pasha, chief local gladiator, had
said Three things are notably impossible: One, that Turkey win this
war; one, that the Mediterranean become champagne; one, that I be
found in the same place with Mohammed Said, and he armed'.</p>

<p>We off-loaded by the ruins. Beyond us the black tents of the
Beni Sakhr were like a herd of goats spotting the valley. A
messenger bade us to Mifleh's tent. First, however, Ali had an
inquiry to make. At the request of the Beni Sakhr, Feisal had sent
a party of Bisha masons and well-sinkers to reline the blasted well
from which Nasir and I had picked the gelignite on our way to
Akaba. They had been for months in Bair and yet reported that the
work was not nearly finished. Feisal had deputed us to inquire into
the reasons for the costly delay. Ali found that the Bisha men had
been living at ease and forcing the Arabs to provide them with meat
and flour. He charged them with it. They prevaricated, vainly, for
Sherifs had a trained judicial instinct, and Mifleh was preparing a
great supper for us. My men whispered excitedly that sheep had been
seen to die behind his tent high on the knoll above the graves. So
Ali's justice moved on wings before the food-bowls could be carried
up. He heard and condemned the blacks all in a moment, and had
judgement inflicted on them by his slaves inside the ruins. They
returned, a little self-conscious, kissed hands in sign of amenity
and forgiveness, and a reconciled party knelt together to meat.</p>

<p>Howeitat feasts had been wet with butter; the Beni Sakhr were
overflowing. Our clothes were splashed, our mouths running over,
the tips of our fingers scalded with its heat. As the sharpness of
hunger was appeased the hands dipped more slowly; but the meal was
still far from its just end when Abd el Kader grunted, rose
suddenly to his feet, wiped his hands on a handkerchief, and sat
back on the carpets by the tent wall. We hesitated, but Ali
muttered the fellahs and the work continued until all the men of
our sitting were full, and the more frugal of us had begun to lick
the stiff fat from our smarting fingers.</p>

<p>Ali cleared his throat, and we returned to our carpets while the
second and third relays round the pans were satisfied. One little
thing, of five or six, in a filthy smock, sat there stuffing
solemnly with both hands from first to last, and, at the end, with
swollen belly and face glistening with grease, staggered off
speechlessly hugging a huge unpicked rib in triumph to its
breast.</p>

<p>In front of the tent the dogs cracked the dry bones loudly, and
Mifleh's slave in the corner split the sheep's skull and sucked out
the brains. Meanwhile, Abd el Kader sat spitting and belching and
picking his teeth. Finally, he sent one of his servants for his
medicine chest, and poured himself out a draught, grumbling that
tough meat was bad for his digestion. He had meant by such
unmannerliness to make himself a reputation for grandeur. His own
villagers could no doubt be browbeaten so, but the Zebn were too
near the desert to be measured by a purely peasant-measure. Also
to-day they had before their eyes the contrary example of Sherif
Ali ibn el Hussein, a born desert-lord.</p>

<p>His fashion of rising all at once from the food was of the
central deserts. On fringes of cultivation, among the semi-nomadic,
each guest slipped aside as he was full. The Anazeh of the extreme
north set the stranger by himself, and in the dark, that he be not
ashamed of his appetite. All these were modes; but among the
considerable clans the manner of the Sherifs was generally praised.
So poor Abd el Kader was not understood.</p>

<p>He took himself off, and we sat in the tent-mouth, above the
dark hollow, now set out in little constellations of tent-fires,
seeming to mimic or reflect the sky above. It was a calm night,
except when the dogs provoked one another to choral bowlings, and
as these grew rarer we heard again the quiet, steady thudding of
the heavy guns preparing assault in Palestine.</p>

<p>To this artillery accompaniment we told Mifleh that we were
about to raid the Deraa district, and would be glad to have him and
some fifteen of his tribesmen with us, all on camels. After our
failure with the Howeitat, we had decided not to announce our plain
object, lest its forlorn character dissuade our partisans. However,
Mifleh agreed at once, apparently with haste and pleasure,
promising to bring with him the fifteen best men in the tribe and
his own son. This lad, Turki by name, was an old love of Ali ibn el
Hussein; the animal in each called to the other, and they wandered
about inseparably, taking pleasure in a touch and silence. He was a
fair, open-faced boy of perhaps seventeen; not tall, but broad and
powerful, with a round freckled face, upturned nose, and very short
upper lip, showing his strong teeth, but giving his full mouth
rather a sulky look, belied by the happy eyes.</p>

<p>We found him plucky and faithful on two critical occasions. His
good temper atoned for his having caught a little of the begging
habit of his father, whose face was eaten up with greed. Turki's
great anxiety was to be sure that he was reckoned a man among the
men, and he was always looking to do something bold and wonderful
which would let him flaunt his courage before the girls of his
tribe. He rejoiced exceedingly in a new silk robe which I gave him
at dinner, and walked, to display it, twice through the
tent-village without his cloak, railing at those who seemed laggard
from our meet.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXIV</h3>

<p>Dark had fallen long before our caravan left Bair, after
watering. We chiefs waited longer still while the Zebn got ready.
Mifleh's preparations included a visit to Essad, the supposed
ancestor of the clan, in his bedecked tomb near Annad's grave. The
Beni Sakhr were already settled enough to have dressed themselves
in the Semitic village-superstitions of sacred places, holy trees,
and funerary shrines. Sheikh Mifleh thought the occasion warranted
his adding another head-cord to the ragged collection looped round
Essad's headstone, and characteristically asked us to provide the
offering. I handed over one of my rich red-and-silk-silver Mecca
ornaments, remarking that the virtue lay with the donor. The
thrifty Mifleh pressed upon me one halfpenny in exchange, that he
might plead purchase; and when I came past a few weeks later and
saw that the gaud was gone, he cursed loudly in my hearing the
sacrilege of some godless Sherari, who had robbed his ancestor.
Turki would have told me more.</p>

<p>A steep old pathway took us out of Wadi Bair. Near the crest of
a ridge we found the others camped for the night round a fire, but
there passed no talk or coffee-making for this time. We lay close
together, hushed and straining the ears to catch the throbbing of
Allenby's guns. They spoke eloquently: and sheet lightning in the
west made gun-flashes for them.</p>

<p>Next day we passed to the left of the Thlaithukhwat, the Three
Sisters' whose clean white peaks were landmarks on their lofty
watershed for a day's journey all about; and went down the soft
rolling slopes beyond them. The exquisite November morning had a
softness in it like an English summer; but its beauty had to be
fought off. I was spending the halts, and riding the stages, in the
ranks of the Beni Sakhr teaching my ear their dialect, and storing
in my memory the tribal, family or personal notes they let
drop.</p>

<p>In the little-peopled desert every worshipful man knew every
other; and instead of books they studied their generation. To have
fallen short in such knowledge would have meant being branded
either as ill-bred, or as a stranger; and strangers were not
admitted to familiar intercourse or councils, or confidences. There
was nothing so wearing, yet nothing so important for the success of
my purpose, as this constant mental gymnastic of apparent
omniscience at each time of meeting a new tribe.</p>

<p>At nightfall we camped in an affluent of Wadi Jesha, by some
bushes of faint grey-green foliage, which pleased our camels and
gave us firewood. That night the guns were very clear and loud,
perhaps because the intervening hollow of the Dead Sea drummed the
echoes up and over our high plateau. The Arabs whispered 'They are
nearer; the English are advancing; God deliver the men under that
rain'. They were thinking compassionately of the passing Turks, so
long their weak oppressors; whom, for their weakness, though
oppressors, they loved more than the strong foreigner with his
blind indiscriminate justice.</p>

<p>The Arab respected force a little: he respected craft more, and
often had it in enviable degree: but most of all he respected blunt
sincerity of utterance, nearly the sole weapon God had excluded
from his armament. The Turk was all things by turn, and so
commended himself to the Arabs for such while as he was not
corporately feared. Much lay in this distinction of the corporate
and the personal. There were Englishmen whom, individually, the
Arabs preferred to any Turk, or foreigner; but, on the strength of
this, to have generalized and called tie Arabs pro-English, would
have been a folly. Each stranger made his own poor bed among
them.</p>

<p>We were up early, meaning to push the long way to Ammari by
sunset. We crossed ridge after carpeted ridge of sun-burned flints,
grown over with a tiny saffron plant so bright and close that all
the view was gold. Safra el Jesha, the Sukhur called it. The
valleys were only inches deep, their beds grained like morocco
leather, in an intricate curving mesh, by innumerable rills of
water after the last rain. The swell of every curve was a grey
breast of sand set hard with mud, sometimes glistening with
salt-crystals, and sometimes rough with the projecting brush of
half-buried twigs which had caused it. These tailings of valleys
running into Sirhan were always rich in grazing. When there was
water in their hollows the tribes collected, and peopled them with
tent-villages. The Beni Sakhr with us had so camped; and, as we
crossed the monotonous downs they pointed first to one
indistinctive hollow with hearth and straight gutter-trenches and
then to another saying, There was my tent and there lay Hamdan el
Saih. Look at the dry stones for my bed-place, and for Tarfa's next
it. God have mercy upon her, she died the year of samh, in the
Snainirat, of a puff-adder.'</p>

<p>About noon a party of trotting camels appeared over the ridge,
moving fast, and openly towards us. Little Turki cantered out on
his old she-camel, with cocked carbine across his thighs, to find
what they meant. 'Ha,' cried Mifleh to me while they were still a
mile off, 'that is Fahad, on his Shaara, in the front. These are
our kinsmen,' and sure enough they were. Fahad and Adhub, chief
war-leaders of the Zebn, had been camped west of the railway by
Ziza, when a Gomani came in with news of our march. They had
saddled at once, and by hard riding caught us only half-way on the
road. Fahad, in courteous fashion, chided me gently for presuming
to ride their district on an adventure while his father's sons lay
in their tent.</p>

<p>Fahad was a melancholy, soft-voiced, little-spoken man of
perhaps thirty, with a white face, trim beard and tragic eyes. His
young brother Adhub was taller and stronger, yet not above middle
height. Unlike Fahad, he was active, noisy, uncouth-looking; with a
snub nose, hairless boy's face and gleaming green eyes flickering
hungrily from object to object. His commonness was pointed by his
dishevelled hair and dirty clothes. Fahad was neater, but still
very plainly dressed, and the pair, on their shaggy home-bred
camels, looked as little like sheikhs of their reputation as can be
conceived. However, they were famous fighters.</p>

<p>At Ammari a high cold night wind was stirring the ashen dust of
the salt-ground about the wells into a haze, which gritted in our
teeth like the stale breath of an eruption; and we were ungrateful
for the water. It was on the surface, like so much of Sirhan, but
most of the pools were too bitter to drink. One notable one,
however, called Bir el Emir was thought very good by contrast. It
lay in a little floor of bare limestone among sand-hummocks.</p>

<p>The water (opaque and tasting of mixed brine and ammonia) was
just below the level of the rock-slab, in a stone bath with ragged
undercut lips. Its depth Daud proved, by hurling Farraj
fully-dressed into it. He sank out of view in its yellowness, and
afterwards rose quietly to the surface under the rock-edge where he
could not be seen in the dusk. Daud waited a strained minute; but
when his victim did not appear tore off his cloak and plunged
after&mdash;to find him smiling under the overhanging ledge.
Pearl-diving in the gulf had made them like fishes in the
water.</p>

<p>They were dragged out, and then had a wild struggle in the sand
beside the water-hole. Each sustained hurt, and they returned to my
fire dripping wet, in rags, bleeding, with their hair and faces,
legs, arms and bodies covered with mud and thorns, more like the
devils of a whirlwind than their usual suave delicate presences.
They said they had been dancing, and had tripped over a bush; it
would be like my generosity to make them a gift of new clothes. I
blasted their hopes, and sent them off to repair damages.</p>

<p>My bodyguard, more especially the Ageyl in it, were by nature
foppish, and spent their wages on dress or ornaments, and much time
in braiding their plaits of shining hair. Butter gave it the
polish; and to keep down the vermin they frequently dragged the
scalp with a fine-toothed comb, and sprinkled it with
camel-staling. A German doctor at Beersheba, in their Turkish days
(these were the men who one misty dawn rushed our Yeomanry in Sinai
and wiped out a post) had taught them to be clean by prisoning the
lousy ones in army latrines until they had swallowed their
lice.</p>

<p>The wind became faint at dawn, and we moved forward for Azrak,
half a march ahead. Hardly, however, were we dear of the drifts
beside the wells when there was an alarm. Mounted men had been seen
in the brushwood. This country was a torn-tiddler's ground of
raiding parties. We drew together in the best place and halted. The
Indian section chose a tiny ridge hacked about with narrow ruts of
water-channels. They couched camels in the hollow behind, and had
their guns mounted in due order in a moment. Ali and Abd el Kader
threw out their great crimson banners in the intermittent breeze.
Our skirmishers headed by Ahmed and Awad, ran out to right and
left, and long shots were exchanged. All of it ended suddenly. The
enemy broke cover and marched in line towards us, waving their
cloaks and sleeves in the air and chanting their war-march of
welcome. They were the fighting men of the Serhan tribe on their
way to swear allegiance to Feisal. When they heard our news they
turned back with us, rejoicing to be spared the road, for this
tribe was not ordinarily warlike or nomadic. They made some little
pomp over our joint entry to their tents at Ain el Beidha, a few
miles east of Azrak, where the whole tribe was gathered; and our
reception was loud, because there had been fear and lamentation
among the women that morning when they saw their men march away on
the hazard of rebellion.</p>

<p>However, here they were returning the same day, with a Sherif of
their own, and Arab banners, and machine-guns, marching a ragged
hundred men abreast, and singing as merrily as when they started
out. My eyes were upon a notable red camel, perhaps a
seven-year-old, under a Sirhani in the second line. The tall beast
would not be put upon, but with a long, swinging pace, of which
there was no equal in the crowd of us, forged to the front, and
kept there. Ahmed slipped off to get acquainted with her owner.</p>

<p>In camp the chief men distributed our party among their tents
for the privilege of entertainment. Ali, Abd el Kader, Wood and
myself were taken in by Mteir, the paramount sheikh of the tribe,
an old, toothless, friendly thing, whose loose jaw sagged in his
supporting hand all the while he talked. He gave us a fussy
greeting and abundant hospitality of seethed sheep and bread. Wood
and Abd el Kader were, perhaps, a little squeamish, for the Serahin
seemed primitive in food-discipline, and at the common bowl there
was more splashing and spluttering than was proper in the best
tents. Afterwards, by constraint of Mteir's urgency, we lay on his
rugs for the one night. Round our fresh bodies, for the change of
food, collected all such local ticks, fleas and lice as were sick
of a diet of unmitigated Serhan. Their delight made them so
ravenous that with the best will in the world I could not go on
feasting them. Nor apparently could Ali; for he, too, sat up and
said that he felt wakeful. So we roused Sheikh Mteir, and sent for
Mifleh ibn Bani, a young, active man, accustomed to command their
battles. To them we explained Feisal's needs, and our plan to
relieve him.</p>

<p>Gravely they heard us. The western bridge, they said, was quite
impossible. The Turks had just filled its country with hundreds of
military wood-cutters. No hostile party could slip through
undetected. They professed great suspicion of the Moorish villages,
and of Abd el Kader. Nothing would persuade them to visit the one
under the guidance of the other. For Tell el Shehab, the nearest
bridge, they feared lest the villagers, their inveterate enemies,
attack them in the rear. Also if it rained the camels would be
unable to trot back across the muddy plains by Remthe, and the
whole party would be cut off and killed.</p>

<p>We were now in deep trouble. The Serahin were our last resource,
and if they refused to come with us we should be unable to carry
out Allenby's project by the appointed time. Accordingly Ali
collected about our little fire more of the better men of the
tribe, and fortified the part of courage by bringing in Fahad, and
Mifleh, and Adhub. Before them we began to combat in words this
crude prudence of the Serahin, which seemed all the more shameful
to us after our long sojourn in the clarifying wilderness.</p>

<p>We put it to them, not abstractedly, but concretely, for their
case, how life in mass was sensual only, to be lived and loved in
its extremity. There could be no rest-houses for revolt, no
dividend of joy paid out. Its spirit was accretive, to endure as
far as the senses would endure, and to use each such advance as
base for further adventure, deeper privation, sharper pain. Sense
could not reach back or forward. A felt emotion was a conquered
emotion, an experience gone dead, which we buried by expressing
it.</p>

<p>To be of the desert was, as they knew, a doom to wage unending
battle with an enemy who was not of the world, nor life, nor
anything, but hope itself; and failure seemed God's freedom to
mankind. We might only exercise this our freedom by not doing what
it lay within our power to do, for then life would belong to us,
and we should have mastered it by holding it cheap. Death would
seem best of all our works, the last free loyalty within our grasp,
our final leisure: and of these two poles, death and life, or, less
finally, leisure and subsistence, we should shun subsistence (which
was the stuff of life) in all save its faintest degree, and cling
close to leisure. Thereby we would serve to promote the not-doing
rather than the doing. Some men, there might be, uncreative; whose
leisure was barren; but the activity of these would have been
material only. To bring forth immaterial things, things creative,
partaking of spirit, not of flesh, we must be jealous of spending
time or trouble upon physical demands, since in most men the soul
grew aged long before the body. Mankind had been no gainer by its
drudges.</p>

<p>There could be no honour in a sure success, but much might be
wrested from a sure defeat. Omnipotence and the Infinite were our
two worthiest foemen, indeed the only ones for a full man to meet,
they being monsters of his own spirit's making; and the stoutest
enemies were always of the household. In fighting Omnipotence,
honour was proudly to throw away the poor resources that we had,
and dare Him empty-handed; to be beaten, not merely by more mind,
but by its advantage of better tools. To the clear-sighted, failure
was the only goal. We must believe, through and through, that there
was no victory, except to go down into death fighting and crying
for failure itself, calling in excess of despair to Omnipotence to
strike harder, that by His very striking He might temper our
tortured selves into the weapon of His own ruin.</p>

<p>This was a halting, half-coherent speech, struck out
desperately, moment by moment, in our extreme need, upon the anvil
of those white minds round the dying fire; and hardly its sense
remained with me afterwards; for once my picture-making memory
forgot its trade and only felt the slow humbling of the Serahin,
the night-quiet in which their worldliness faded, and at last their
flashing eagerness to ride with us whatever the bourne. Before
daylight we called old Abd el Kader, and, taking him aside among
the sandy thickets, screamed into his dense ear that the Serahin
would start with us, under his auspices, for Wadi Khalid, after
sunrise. He grunted that it was well: and we said to one another
that never, if life and opportunity were prolonged for us, would we
take a deaf man for a conspirator again.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXV</h3>

<p>Exhausted, we lay down a moment, but were astir again very early
to review the camel-men of the Sirhan. They made a wild and ragged
show, dashing past, but we thought them loose riders, and they
blustered too much to be quite convincing. It was a pity they had
no real leader. Mteir was too old for service, and ibn Bani was an
indistinct man, ambitious rather as a politician than as a fighter.
However, they were the force we had, so there was an end to it, and
at three in the afternoon we mounted for Azrak, since another night
in the tent would have left us picked to dry bones. Abd el Kader
and his servants mounted their mares, as sign that the fighting
line was near. They rode just behind us.</p>

<p>It was to be Ali's first view of Azrak, and we hurried up the
stony ridge in high excitement, talking of the wars and songs and
passions of the early shepherd kings, with names like music, who
had loved this place; and of the Roman legionaries who languished
here as garrison in yet earlier times. Then the blue fort on its
rock above the rustling palms, with the fresh meadows and shining
springs of water, broke on our sight. Of Azrak, as of Rumm, one
said '<i>numen inest</i>'. Both were magically haunted: but whereas
Rumm was vast and echoing and God-like, Azrak's unfathomable
silence was steeped in knowledge of wandering poets, champions,
lost kingdoms, all the crime and chivalry and dead magnificence of
Hira and Ghassan. Each stone or blade of it was radiant with
half-memory of the luminous, silky Eden, which had passed so long
ago.</p>

<p>At last Ali shook his rein, and his camel picked her careful way
down the lava flow to the rich turf behind the springs. Our
puckered eyes opened wide with relief that the bitterness of many
weeks was gone out of the reflected sunlight. Ali screamed 'Grass',
and flung himself off the saddle to the ground on hands and feet,
his face bowed down among the harsh stems which seemed so kindly in
the desert. He leaped up, flushed, with his Harith war-cry, tore
his head-cloth off, and raced along the marsh, bounding over the
red channels where water clotted among the reeds. His white feet
flashed beneath the tossed folds of his cashmere robes. We in the
West seldom experienced that added beauty when the body was seen
lightly poised on bare feet; when the rhythm and grace of movement
became visible, with the play of muscle and sinew pointing the
mechanism of each stride and the balance of repose.</p>

<p>When we turned again to business, there was no Abd el Kader. We
looked for him in the castle, in the palm-garden, over by the
spring. Eventually we sent our men away to search, and they came
back with Arabs, who told us that from just after the start he had
ridden off northward through the flaky hillocks, towards Jebel
Druse. The rank and file did not know our plans, hated him, and had
been glad to see him go: but it was bad news for us.</p>

<p>Of our three alternatives, Um Keis had been abandoned: without
Abd el Kader, Wadi Khalid was impossible: this meant that we must
necessarily attempt the bridge at Tell el Shehab. To reach it we
had to cross the open land between Remthe and Deraa. Abd el Kader
was gone up to the enemy, with information of our plans and
strength. The Turks, if they took the most reasonable precautions,
would trap us at the bridge. We took council with Fahad and decided
to push on none the less, trusting to the usual incompetence of our
enemy. It was not a confident decision. While we took it the
sunshine seemed less lambent, and Azrak not so aloof from fear.</p>

<p>Next morning we wound pensively along a flinty valley and over a
ridge into Wadi el Harith, whose green course had a sickening
likeness to some lands at home. Ali rejoiced to see a rich
pasture-valley bearing his family name, and was as glad as our
camels when we found limpid pools of last week's rain-water in
hollows among the bushes. We stopped and used the discovery for
lunch, making a long halt. Adhub went off with Ahmed and Awad to
look for gazelle. He came back with three. So we stopped yet longer
and made a second lunch, like a feast, of meat gobbets roasted on
ramrods till the outside was black as coal, while the heart
remained juicily sweet. So-journers in the desert loved its
accidental bounty; also on this trip a reluctance weighed down our
daily marching, to make us glad of each delay.</p>

<p>Unhappily my rest time was spoiled by a bed of justice. The feud
between Ahmed and Awad broke out during this gazelle chase into a
duel. Awad shot off Ahmed's head-rope; Ahmed holed Awad's cloak. I
disarmed them and gave loud order that the right thumb and
forefinger of each be cut off. The terror of this drove them into
an instant, violent and public kissing of peace. A little later all
my men went capital bail that the trouble had ended. I referred the
case to Ali ibn el Hussein, who set them at liberty on probation,
after sealing their promise with the ancient and curious nomad
penance of striking the head sharply with the edge of a weighty
dagger again and again till the issuing blood had run down to the
waist belt. It caused painful but not dangerous scalp wounds, whose
ache at first and whose scars later were supposed to remind the
would-be defaulter of the bond he had given.</p>

<p>We pushed on again for miles over perfect going, through rich
country for the camels, till at Abu Sawana we found a flinty
hollow, brim-full of deliciously clear rain-water in a narrow
channel two feet deep, and perhaps ten feet wide, but half a mile
long. This would serve as starting point for our bridge-raid. To be
sure of its safety, we rode a few yards further, to the top of a
stony knoll; and there found ourselves looking down upon a
retreating party of Circassian horsemen, sent out by the Turks to
report if the waters were occupied. They had missed us, to our
mutual benefit, by five minutes.</p>

<p>Next morning we filled our water-skins, since we should find
nothing to drink between here and the bridge; and then marched
leisurely until the desert ended in a three-foot depression at the
edge of a clean plain, which extended flatly to the metals of the
railway some miles off. We halted for dusk to make its crossing
possible. Our plan was to slip over secretly, and hide in the
further foothills, below Deraa. In the spring these hills were full
of grazing sheep, for the rain cloaked their low sides in new grass
and flowers. With the coming of summer they dried, and became
deserted save for chance travellers on obscure errands. We might
fairly calculate on lying in their folds for a day undisturbed.</p>

<p>We made our halt another opportunity of food, for we were
recklessly eating all we could as often as we had the chance. It
lightened our stores, and kept us from thinking: but even with this
help the day was very long. At last sunset came. The plain shivered
once, as the darkness, which for an hour had been gathering among
the facing hills, flowed slowly out and drowned it. We mounted. Two
hours later after a quick march over gravel, Fahad and myself, out
scouting ahead, came to the railway; and without difficulty found a
stony place where our caravan would make no signs of passage. The
Turkish rail-guards were clearly at their ease, which meant that
Abd el Kader had not yet caused a panic by what news he
brought.</p>

<p>We rode the other side of the line for half an hour, and then
dipped into a very slight rocky depression full of succulent
plants. This was Ghadir el Abyadh, recommended by Mifleh as our
ambush. We took his surprising word that we were in cover, and lay
down among or alongside our loaded beasts for a short sleep. Dawn
would show us how far we were safe and hidden.</p>

<p>As day was breaking, Fahad led me to the edge of our pit, some
fifteen feet above, and from it we looked straight across a
slowly-dropping meadow to the railway, which seemed nearly within
shot. It was most inconveniently close, but the Sukhur knew no
better place. We had to stand-to all the day. Each time something
was reported, our men ran to look at it, and the low bank would
grow a serried frieze of human heads. Also, the grazing camels
required many guards to keep them from straying into view. Whenever
a patrol passed we had to be very gentle in controlling the beasts,
since if one of them had roared or ruckled it would have drawn the
enemy. Yesterday had been long: to-day was longer: we could not
feed, as our water had to be husbanded with jealous care against
the scarcity of to-morrow. The very knowledge made us thirsty.</p>

<p>Ali and I worked at the last arrangements for our ride. We were
penned here until sunset; and must reach Tell el Shehab, blow up
the bridge, and get back east of the railway by dawn. This meant a
ride of at least eighty miles in the thirteen hours of darkness,
with an elaborate demolition thrown in. Such a performance was
beyond the capacity of most of the Indians. They were not good
riders, and had broken up their camels in the march from Akaba. An
Arab by saving his beast, could bring it home in fair condition
after hard work. The Indians had done their best; but the
discipline of their cavalry training had tired out them and the
animals in our easy stages.</p>

<p>So we picked out the six best riders and put them on the six
best camels, with Hassan Shah, their officer and greatest-hearted
man, to lead them. He decided that this little party would be
fittest armed with just one Vickers gun. It was a very serious
reduction of our offensive power. The more I looked at it, the less
fortunate seemed the development of this Yarmuk plan of ours.</p>

<p>The Beni Sakhr were fighting men; but we distrusted the Serahin.
So Ali and I decided to make the Beni Sakhr, under Fahad, our
storming party. We would leave some Serahin to guard the camels
while the others carried the blasting gelatine in our dismounted
charge upon the bridge. To suit the hurried carriage down steep
hill-sides in the dark we changed the explosive loads into
thirty-pound lumps, which were put, for visibility, each lump into
its own white bag. Wood undertook to repack the gelatine, and
shared the rare headache all got from handling it. This helped pass
the time.</p>

<p>My bodyguard had to be carefully distributed. One good rider was
told off to each of the less expert local men, whose virtue was
that they knew the country: the pairs so made were attached to one
or other of my foreign liabilities, with instructions to keep close
to him all night. Ali ibn el Hussein took six of his servants, and
the party was completed by twenty Beni Sakhr and forty Serahin. We
left the lame and weak camels behind at Abyadh in charge of the
balance of our men, with instructions to get back to Abu Sawana
before dawn to-morrow and wait there for our news. Two of my men
developed sudden illnesses, which made them feel unable to ride
with us. I excused them for the night, and afterward from all
duties whatsoever.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXVI</h3>

<p>Just at sunset we said good-bye to them, and went off up our
valley, feeling miserably disinclined to go on at all. Darkness
gathered as we rode over the first ridge and turned west, for the
abandoned pilgrim road, whose ruts would be our best guide. We were
stumbling down the irregular hill-side, when the men in front
suddenly dashed forward. We followed and found them surrounding a
terrified pedlar, with two wives and two donkeys laden with
raisins, flour and cloaks. They had been going to Mafrak, the
station just behind us. This was awkward; and in the end we told
them to camp, and left a Sirhani to see they did not stir: he was
to release them at dawn, and escape over the line to Abu
Sawana.</p>

<p>We went plodding across country in the now absolute dark till we
saw the gleam of the white furrows of the pilgrim road. It was the
same road along which the Arabs had ridden with me on my first
night in Arabia out by Rabegh. Since then in twelve months we had
fought up it for some twelve hundred kilometres, past Medina and
Hedia, Dizad, Mudowwara and Maan. There remained little to its head
in Damascus where our armed pilgrimage should end.</p>

<p>But we were apprehensive of to-night: our nerves had been shaken
by the flight of Abd el Kader, the solitary traitor of our
experience. Had we calculated fairly we should have known that we
had a chance in spite of him: yet a dispassionate judgement lay not
in our mood, and we thought half-despairingly how the Arab Revolt
would never perform its last stage, but would remain one more
example of the caravans which started out ardently for a
cloud-goal, and died man by man in the wilderness without the
tarnish of achievement.</p>

<p>Some shepherd or other scattered these thoughts by firing his
rifle at our caravan, seen by him approaching silently and
indistinctly in the dark. He missed widely, but began to cry out in
extremity of terror and, as he fled, to pour shot after shot into
the brown of us.</p>

<p>Mifleh el Gomaan, who was guiding, swerved violently, and in a
blind trot carried our plunging line down a slope, over a breakneck
bottom, and round the shoulder of a hill. There we had peaceful
unbroken night once more, and swung forward in fair order under the
stars. The next alarm was A. barking dog on the left, and then a
camel unexpectedly loomed up in our track. It was, however, a
stray, and riderless. We moved on again.</p>

<p>Mifleh made me ride with him, calling me 'Arab' that my known
name might not betray me to strangers in the blackness. We were
coming down into a very thick hollow when we smelt ashes, and the
dusky figure of a woman leaped from a bush beside the track and
rushed shrieking out of sight. She may have been a gipsy, for
nothing followed. We came to a hill. At the top was a village which
blazed at us while we were yet distant. Mifleh bore off to the
right over a broad stretch of plough; we climbed it slowly, with
creaking saddles. At the edge of the crest we halted.</p>

<p>Away to the north below our level were some brilliant clusters
of lights. These were the flares of Deraa station, lit for army
traffic: and we felt something reassuring perhaps, but also a
little blatant in this Turkish disregard for us. [It was our
revenge to make it then-last illumination: Deraa was obscured from
the morrow for a whole year until it fell.] In a close group we
rode to the left along the summit and down a long valley into the
plain of Remthe, from which village an occasional red spark glowed
out, in the darkness to the north-west. The going became flat; but
it was land half-ploughed, and very soft with a labyrinth of
cony-burrows, so that our plunging camels sank fetlock-in and
laboured. None the less, we had to put on speed, for the incidents
and roughness of the way had made us late. Mifleh urged his
reluctant camel into a trot.</p>

<p>I was better mounted than most, on the red camel which had led
our procession into Beidha. She was a long, raking beast, with a
huge piston-stride very hard to suffer: pounding, yet not fully
mechanical, because there was courage in the persistent effort
which carried her sailing to the head of the line. There, all
competitors outstripped, her ambition died into a solid step,
longer than normal by some inches, but like any other animal's,
except that it gave a confident feeling of immense reserves in
strength and endurance. I rode back down the ranks and told them to
press forward faster. The Indians, riding wooden, like horsemen,
did their best, as did most of our number; but the ground was so
bad that the greatest efforts were not very fruitful, and as hours
went on first one and then another rider dropped behind. Thereupon
I chose the rear position, with Ali ibn el Hussein who was riding a
rare old racing camel. She may have been fourteen years old, but
never flagged nor jogged the whole night. With her head low she
shuffled along in the quick, hang-kneed Nejd pace which was so easy
for the rider. Our speed and camel-sticks made life miserable for
the last men and camels.</p>

<p>Soon after nine o'clock we left the plough. The going should
have improved: but it began to drizzle, and the rich surface of the
land grew slippery. A Sirhani camel fell. Its rider had it up in a
moment and trotted forward. One of the Beni Sakhr came down. He
also was unhurt, and remounted hastily. Then we found one of Ali's
servants standing by his halted camel. Ali hissed him on, and when
the fellow mumbled an excuse cut him savagely across the head with
his cane. The terrified camel plunged forward, and the slave,
snatching at the hinder girth, was able to swing himself into the
saddle. Ali pursued him with a rain of blows. Mustafa, my man, an
inexperienced rider, fell off twice. Awad, his rank-man, each time
caught his halter, and had helped him up before we overtook
them.</p>

<p>The rain stopped, and we went faster. Downhill, now. Suddenly
Mifleh, rising in his saddle, slashed at the air overhead. A sharp
metallic contact from the night showed we were under the telegraph
line to Mezerib. Then the grey horizon before us went more distant.
We seemed to be riding on the camber of an arc of land, with a
growing darkness at each side and in front. There came to our ears
a faint sighing, like wind among trees very far away, but
continuous and slowly increasing. This must be from the great
waterfall below Tell el Shehab, and we pressed forward
confidently.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mifleh pulled up his camel and beat her neck
very gently till she sank silently on her knees. He threw himself
off, while we reined up beside him on this grassy platform by a
tumbled cairn. Before us from a lip of blackness rose very loudly
the rushing of the river which had been long dinning our ears. It
was the edge of the Yarmuk gorge, and the bridge lay just under us
to the right.</p>

<p>We helped down the Indians from their burdened camels, that no
sound betray us to listening ears; then mustered, whispering, on
the clammy grass. The moon was not yet over Hermon, but the night
was only half-dark in the promise of its dawn, with wild rags of
tattered clouds driving across a livid sky. I served out the
explosives to the fifteen porters, and we started. The Beni Sakhr
under Adhub sank into the dark slopes before us to scout the way.
The rainstorm had made the steep hill treacherous, and only by
driving our bare toes sharply into the soil could we keep a sure
foothold. Two or three men fell heavily.</p>

<p>When we were in the stiffest part, where rocks cropped out
brokenly from the face, a new noise was added to the roaring water
as a train clanked slowly up from Galilee, the flanges of its
wheels screaming on the curves and the steam of its engine panting
out of the hidden depths of the ravine in white ghostly breaths.
The Serahin hung back. Wood drove them after us. Fahad and I leaped
to the right, and in the light of the furnace-flame saw open trucks
in which were men in khaki, perhaps prisoners going up to Asia
Minor.</p>

<p>A little farther; and at last, below our feet, we saw a
something blacker in the precipitous blackness of the valley, and
at its other end a speck of flickering light. We halted to examine
it with glasses. It was the bridge, seen from this height in plan,
with a guard-tent pitched under the shadowy village-crested wall of
the opposite bank. Everything was quiet, except the river;
everything was motionless, except the dancing flame outside the
tent.</p>

<p>Wood, who was only to come down if I were hit, got the Indians
ready to spray the guard-tent if affairs became general; while Ali,
Fahad, Mifleh and the rest of us, with Beni Sakhr and explosive
porters, crept on till we found the old construction path to the
near abutment. We stole along this in single file, our brown cloaks
and soiled clothes blending perfectly with the limestone above us,
and the depths below, until we reached the metals just before they
curved to the bridge. There the crowd halted, and I crawled on with
Fahad.</p>

<p>We reached the naked abutment, and drew ourselves forward on our
faces in the shadow of its rails till we could nearly touch the
grey skeleton of underhung girders, and see the single sentry
leaning against the other abutment, sixty yards across the gulf.
Whilst we watched, he began to move slowly up and down, up and
down, before his fire, without ever setting foot on the dizzy
bridge. I lay staring at him fascinated, as if planless and
helpless, while Fahad shuffled back by the abutment wall where it
sprang clear of the hillside.</p>

<p>This was no good, for I wanted to attack the girders themselves;
so I crept away to bring the gelatine bearers. Before I reached
them there was the loud clatter of a dropped rifle and a scrambling
fall from up the bank. The sentry started and stared up at the
noise. He saw, high up, in the zone of light with which the rising
moon slowly made beautiful the gorge, the machine-gunners climbing
down to a new position in the receding shadow. He challenged
loudly, then lifted his rifle and fired, while yelling the guard
out.</p>

<p>Instantly all was complete confusion. The invisible Beni Sakhr,
crouched along the narrow path above our heads, blazed back at
random. The guard rushed into trenches, and opened rapid fire at
our flashes. The Indians, caught moving, could not get their
Vickers in action to riddle the tent before it was empty. Firing
became general. The volleys of the Turkish rifles, echoing in the
narrow place, were doubled by the impact of their bullets against
the rocks behind our party. The Serahin porters had learned from my
bodyguard that gelatine would go off if hit. So when shots
spattered about them they dumped the sacks over the edge and fled.
Ali leaped down to Fahad and me, where we stood on the obscure
abutment unperceived, but with empty hands, and told us that the
explosives were now somewhere in the deep bed of the ravine.</p>

<p>It was hopeless to think of recovering them, with such hell let
loose, so we scampered, without accident, up the hill-path through
the Turkish fire, breathlessly to the top. There we met the
disgusted Wood and the Indians, and told them it was all over. We
hastened back to the cairn where the Serahin were scrambling on
their camels. We copied them as soon as might be, and trotted off
at speed, while the Turks were yet rattling away in the bottom of
the valley. Turra, the nearest village, heard the clamour and
joined in. Other villages awoke, and lights began to sparkle
everywhere across the plain.</p>

<p>Our rush over-ran a party of peasants returning from Deraa. The
Serahin, sore at the part they had played (or at what I said in the
heat of running away) were looking for trouble, and robbed them
bare.</p>

<p>The victims dashed off through the moonlight with their women,
raising the ear-piercing Arab call for help. Remthe heard them. Its
massed shrieks alarmed every sleeper in the neighbourhood. Their
mounted men turned out to charge our flank, while settlements for
miles about manned their roofs and fired volleys.</p>

<p>We left the Serahin offenders with their encumbering loot, and
drove on in grim silence, keeping together in what order we could,
while my trained men did marvellous service helping those who fell,
or mounting behind them those whose camels got up too hurt to
canter on. The ground was still muddy, and the ploughed strips more
laborious than ever; but behind us was the riot, spurring us and
our camels to exertion, like a pack hunting us into the refuge of
the hills. At length we entered these, and cut through by a better
road towards peace, yet riding our jaded animals as hard as we
could, for dawn was near. Gradually the noise behind us died away,
and the last stragglers fell into place, driven together, as on the
advance, by the flail of Ali ibn el Hussein and myself in the
rear.</p>

<p>The day broke just as we rode down to the railway, and Wood, Ali
and the chiefs, now in front to test the passage, were amused by
cutting the telegraph in many places while the procession marched
over. We had crossed the line the night before to blow up the
bridge at Tell el Shehab, and so cut Palestine off from Damascus,
and we were actually cutting the telegraph to Medina after all our
pains and risks! Allenby's guns, still shaking the air away there
on our right, were bitter recorders of the failure we had been.</p>

<p>The grey dawn drew on with gentleness in it, foreboding the grey
drizzle of rain which followed, a drizzle so soft and hopeless that
it seemed to mock our broken-footed plodding towards Abu Sawana. At
sunset we reached the long water-pool; and there the rejects of our
party were curious after the detail of our mistakes. We were fools,
all of us equal fools, and so our rage was aimless. Ahmed and Awad
had another fight; young Mustafa refused to cook rice; Farraj and
Daud knocked him about until he cried; Ali had two of his servants
beaten: and none of us or of them cared a little bit. Our minds
were sick with failure, and our bodies tired after nearly a hundred
strained miles over bad country in bad conditions, between sunset
and sunset, without halt or food.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXVII</h3>

<p>Food was going to be our next preoccupation, and we held a
council in the cold driving rain to consider what we might do. For
lightness' sake we had carried from Azrak three days' rations,
which made us complete until to-night; but we could not go back
empty-handed. The Beni Sakhr wanted honour, and the Serahin were
too lately disgraced not to clamour for more adventure. We had
still a reserve bag of thirty pounds of gelatine, and Ali ibn el
Hussein who had heard of the performances below Maan, and was as
Arab as any Arab, said, 'Let's blow up a train'. The word was
hailed with universal joy, and they looked at me: but I was not
able to share their hopes, all at once.</p>

<p>Blowing up trains was an exact science when done deliberately,
by a sufficient party, with machine-guns in position. If scrambled
at it might become dangerous. The difficulty this time was that the
available gunners were Indians; who, though good men fed, were only
half-men in cold and hunger. I did not propose to drag them off
without rations on an adventure which might take a week. There was
no cruelty in starving Arabs; they would not die of a few days'
fasting, and would fight as well as ever on empty stomachs; while,
if things got too difficult, there were the riding-camels to kill
and eat: but the Indians, though Moslems, refused camel-flesh on
principle.</p>

<p>I explained these delicacies of diet. Ali at once said that it
would be enough for me to blow up the train, leaving him and the
Arabs with him to do their best to carry its wreck without
machine-gun support. As, in this unsuspecting district, we might
well happen on a supply train, with civilians or only a small guard
of reservists aboard, I agreed to risk it. The decision having been
applauded, we sat down in a cloaked circle, to finish our remaining
food in a very late and cold supper (the rain had sodden the fuel
and made fire not possible) our hearts somewhat comforted by chance
of another effort.</p>

<p>At dawn, with the unfit of the Arabs, the Indians moved away for
Azrak, miserably. They had started up country with me in hope of a
really military enterprise, and first had seen the muddled bridge,
and now were losing this prospective train. It was hard on them;
and to soften the blow with honour I asked Wood to accompany them.
He agreed, after argument, for their sakes; but it proved a wise
move for himself, as a sickness which had been troubling him began
to show the early signs of pneumonia.</p>

<p>The balance of us, some sixty men, turned back towards the
railway. None of them knew the country, so I led them to Minifir,
where, with Zaal, we had made havoc in the spring. The re-curved
hill-top was an excellent observation post, camp, grazing ground
and way of retreat, and we sat there in our old place till sunset,
shivering and staring out over the immense plain which stretched
map-like to the clouded peaks of Jebel Druse, with Um el Jemal and
her sister-villages like ink-smudges on it through the rain.</p>

<p>In the first dusk we walked down to lay the mine. The rebuilt
culvert of kilometre 172 seemed still the fittest place. While we
stood by it there came a rumbling, and through the gathering
darkness and mist a train suddenly appeared round the northern
curve, only two hundred yards away. We scurried under the long arch
and heard it roll overhead. This was annoying; but when the course
was clear again, we fell to burying the charge. The evening was
bitterly cold, with drifts of rain blowing down the valley.</p>

<p>The arch was solid masonry, of four metres span, and stood over
a shingle water-bed which took its rise on our hill-top. The winter
rains had cut this into a channel four feet deep, narrow and
winding, which served us as an admirable approach till within three
hundred yards of the line. There the gully widened out and ran
straight towards the culvert, open to the sight of anyone upon the
rails.</p>

<p>We hid the explosive carefully on the crown of the arch, deeper
than usual, beneath a tie, so that the patrols would not feel its
jelly softness under their feet. The wires were taken down the bank
into the shingle bed of the watercourse, where concealment was
quick; and up it as far as they would reach. Unfortunately, this
was only sixty yards, for there had been difficulty in Egypt over
insulated cable and no more had been available when our expedition
started.</p>

<p>Sixty yards was plenty for the bridge, but little for a train:
however, the ends happened to coincide with a little bush about ten
inches high, on the edge of the watercourse, and we buried them
beside this very convenient mark. It was impossible to leave them
joined up to the exploder in the proper way, since the spot was
evident to the permanent-way patrols as they made their rounds.</p>

<p>Owing to the mud the job took longer than usual, and it was very
nearly dawn before we finished. I waited under the draughty arch
till day broke, wet and dismal, and then I went over the whole area
of disturbance, spending another half-hour in effacing its every
mark, scattering leaves and dead grass over it, and watering down
the broken mud from a shallow rain-pool near. Then they waved to me
that the first patrol was coming, and I went up to join the
others.</p>

<p>Before I had reached them they came tearing down into their
prearranged places, lining the watercourse and spurs each side. A
train was coming from the north. Hamud, Feisal's long slave, had
the exploder; but before he reached me a short train of closed
box-waggons rushed by at speed. The rainstorms on the plain and the
thick morning had hidden it from the eyes of our watchman until too
late. This second failure saddened us further and Ali began to say
that nothing would come right this trip. Such a statement held risk
as prelude of the discovery of an evil eye present; so, to divert
attention, I suggested new watching posts be sent far out, one to
the ruins on the north, one to the great cairn of the southern
crest.</p>

<p>The rest, having no breakfast, were to pretend not to be hungry.
They all enjoyed doing this, and for a while we sat cheerfully in
the rain, huddling against one another for warmth behind a
breastwork of our streaming camels. The moisture made the animals'
hair curl up like a fleece, so that they looked queerly
dishevelled. When the rain paused, which it did frequently, a cold
moaning wind searched out the unprotected parts of us very
thoroughly. After a time we found our wetted shirts clammy and
comfortless things. We had nothing to eat, nothing to do and
nowhere to sit except on wet rock, wet grass or mud. However, this
persistent weather kept reminding me that it would delay Allenby's
advance on Jerusalem, and rob him of his great possibility. So
large a misfortune to our lion was a half-encouragement for the
mice. We would be partners into next year.</p>

<p>In the best circumstances, waiting for action was hard. To-day
it was beastly. Even enemy patrols stumbled along without care,
perfunctorily, against the rain. At last, near noon, in a snatch of
fine weather, the watchmen on the south peak flagged their cloaks
wildly in signal of a train. We reached our positions in an
instant, for we had squatted the late hours on our heels in a
streaming ditch near the line, so as not to miss another chance.
The Arabs took cover properly. I looked back at their ambush from
my firing point, and saw nothing but the grey hillsides.</p>

<p>I could not hear the train coming, but trusted, and knelt ready
for perhaps half an hour, when the suspense became intolerable, and
I signalled to know what was up. They sent down to say it was
coming very slowly, and was an enormously long train. Our appetites
stiffened. The longer it was the more would be the loot. Then came
word that it had stopped. It moved again.</p>

<p>Finally, near one o'clock, I heard it panting. The locomotive
was evidently defective (all these wood-fired trains were bad), and
the heavy load on the up-gradient was proving too much for its
capacity. I crouched behind my bush, while it crawled slowly into
view past the south cutting, and along the bank above my head
towards the culvert. The first ten trucks were open trucks, crowded
with troops. However, once again it was too late to choose, so when
the engine was squarely over the mine I pushed down the handle of
the exploder. Nothing happened. I sawed it up and down four
times.</p>

<p>Still nothing happened; and I realized that it had gone out of
order, and that I was kneeling on a naked bank, with a Turkish
troop train crawling past fifty yards away. The bush, which had
seemed a foot high, shrank smaller than a fig-leaf; and I felt
myself the most distinct object in the country-side. Behind me was
an open valley for two hundred yards to the cover where my Arabs
were waiting and wondering what I was at. It was impossible to make
a bolt for it, or the Turks would step off the train and finish us.
If I sat still, there might be just a hope of my being ignored as a
casual Bedouin.</p>

<p>So there I sat, counting for sheer life, while eighteen open
trucks, three box-waggons, and three officers' coaches dragged by.
The engine panted slower and slower, and I thought every moment
that it would break down. The troops took no great notice of me,
but the officers were interested, and came out to the little
platforms at the ends of their carriages, pointing and staring. I
waved back at them, grinning nervously, and feeling an improbable
shepherd in my Meccan dress, with its twisted golden circlet about
my head. Perhaps the mud-stains, the wet and their ignorance made
me accepted. The end of the brake van slowly disappeared into the
cutting on the north.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="0100111h-images/0100111h-19.jpg">
</p>
</center>

<p>As it went, I jumped up, buried my wires, snatched hold of the
wretched exploder, and went like a rabbit uphill into safety. There
I took breath and looked back to see that the train had finally
stuck. It waited, about five hundred yards beyond the mine, for
nearly an hour to get up a head of steam, while an officers' patrol
came back and searched, very carefully, the ground where I had been
seen sitting. However the wires were properly bidden: they found
nothing: the engine plucked up heart again, and away they went.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXVIII</h3>

<p>Mifleh was past tears, thinking I had intentionally let the
train through; and when the Serahin had been told the real cause
they said 'Bad luck is with us'. Historically they were right; but
they meant it for a prophecy, so I made sarcastic reference to
their courage at the bridge the week before, hinting that it might
be a tribal preference to sit on camel-guard. At once there was
uproar, the Serahin attacking me furiously, the Beni Sakhr
defending. Ali heard the trouble, and came running.</p>

<p>When we had made it up the original despondency was half
forgotten. Ali backed me nobly, though the wretched boy was blue
with cold and shivering in an attack of fever. He gasped that their
ancestor the Prophet had given to Sherifs the faculty of 'sight',
and by it he knew that our luck was turning. This was comfort for
them: my first instalment of good fortune came when in the wet,
without other tool than my dagger, I got the box of the exploder
open and persuaded its electrical gear to work properly once
more.</p>

<p>We returned to our vigil by the wires, but nothing happened, and
evening drew down with more squalls and beastliness, everybody full
of grumbles. There was no train; it was too wet to light a cooking
fire; our only potential food was camel. Raw meat did not tempt
anyone that night; and so our beasts survived to the morrow.</p>

<p>Ali lay down on his belly, which position lessened the
hunger-ache, trying to sleep off his fever. Khazen, Ali's servant,
lent him his cloak for extra covering. For a spell I took Khazen
under mine, but soon found it becoming crowded. So I left it to him
and went downhill to connect up the exploder. Afterwards I spent
the night there alone by the singing telegraph wires, hardly
wishing to sleep, so painful was the cold. Nothing came all the
long hours, and dawn, which broke wet, looked even uglier than
usual. We were sick to death of Minifir, of railways, of train
watching and wrecking, by now. I climbed up to the main body while
the early patrol searched the railway. Then the day cleared a
little. Ali awoke, much refreshed, and his new spirit cheered us.
Hamud, the slave, produced some sticks which he had kept under his
clothes by his skin all night. They were nearly dry. We shaved down
some blasting gelatine, and with its hot flame got a fire going,
while the Sukhur hurriedly killed a mangy camel, the best spared of
our riding-beasts, and began with entrenching tools to hack it into
handy joints.</p>

<p>Just at that moment the watchman on the north cried a train. We
left the fire and made a breathless race of the six hundred yards
downhill to our old position. Bound the bend, whistling its
loudest, came the train, a splendid two-engined thing of twelve
passenger coaches, travelling at top speed on the favouring grade.
I touched off under the first driving wheel of the first
locomotive, and the explosion was terrific. The ground spouted
blackly into my face, and I was sent spinning, to sit up with the
shirt torn to my shoulder and the blood dripping from long, ragged
scratches on my left arm. Between my knees lay the exploder,
crushed under a twisted sheet of sooty iron. In front of me was the
scalded and smoking upper half of a man. When I peered through the
dust and steam of the explosion the whole boiler of the first
engine seemed to be missing.</p>

<p>I dully felt that it was time to get away to support; but when I
moved, learnt that there was a great pain in my right foot, because
of which I could only limp along, with my head swinging from the
shock. Movement began to clear away this confusion, as I hobbled
towards the upper valley, whence the Arabs were now shooting fast
into the crowded coaches. Dizzily I cheered myself by repeating
aloud in English 'Oh, I wish this hadn't happened'.</p>

<p>When the enemy began to return our fire, I found myself much
between the two. Ali saw me fall, and thinking that I was hard hit,
ran out, with Turki and about twenty men of his servants and the
Beni Sakhr, to help me. The Turks found their range and got seven
of them in a few seconds. The others, in a rush, were about
me&mdash;fit models, after their activity, for a sculptor. Their
full white cotton drawers drawn in, bell-like, round their slender
waists and ankles; their hairless brown bodies; and the love-locks
plaited tightly over each temple in long horns, made them look like
Russian dancers.</p>

<p>We scrambled back into cover together, and there, secretly, I
felt myself over, to find I had not once been really hurt; though
besides the bruises and cuts of the boiler-plate and a broken toe,
I had five different bullet-grazes on me (some of them
uncomfortably deep) and my clothes ripped to pieces.</p>

<p>From the watercourse we could look about. The explosion had
destroyed the arched head of the culvert, and the frame of the
first engine was lying beyond it, at the near foot of the
embankment, down which it had rolled. The second locomotive had
toppled into the gap, and was lying across the ruined tender of the
first. Its bed was twisted. I judged them both beyond repair. The
second tender had disappeared over the further side; and the first
three waggons had telescoped and were smashed in pieces.</p>

<p>The rest of the train was badly derailed, with the listing
coaches butted end to end at all angles, zigzagged along the track.
One of them was a saloon, decorated with flags. In it had been
Mehmed Jemal Pasha, commanding the Eighth Army Corps, hurrying down
to defend Jerusalem against Allenby. His chargers had been in the
first waggon; his motor-car was on the end of the train, and we
shot it up. Of his staff we noticed a fat ecclesiastic, whom we
thought to be Assad Shukair, Imam to Ahmed Jemal Pasha, and a
notorious pro-Turk pimp. So we blazed at him till he dropped.</p>

<p>It was all long bowls. We could see that our chances of carrying
the wreck were slight. There had been some four hundred men on
board, and the survivors, now recovered from the shock, were under
shelter and shooting hard at us. At the first moment our party on
the north spur had closed, and nearly won the game. Mifleh on his
mare chased the officers from the saloon into the lower ditch. He
was too excited to stop and shoot, and so they got away scathless.
The Arabs following him had turned to pick up some of the rifles
and medals littering the ground, and then to drag bags and boxes
from the train. If we had had a machine-gun posted to cover the far
side, according to my mining practice, not a Turk would have
escaped.</p>

<p>Mifleh and Adhub rejoined us on the hill, and asked after Fahad.
One of the Serahin told how he had led the first rush, while I lay
knocked out beside the exploder, and had been killed near it. They
showed his belt and rifle as proof that he was dead and that they
had tried to save him. Adhub said not a word, but leaped out of the
gully, and raced downhill. We caught our breaths till our lungs
hurt us, watching him; but the Turks seemed not to see. A minute
later he was dragging a body behind the left-hand bank.</p>

<p>Mifleh went back to his mare, mounted, and took her down behind
a spur. Together they lifted the inert figure on to the pommel, and
returned. A bullet had passed through Fahad's face, knocking out
four teeth, and gashing the tongue. He had fallen unconscious, but
had revived just before Adhub reached him, and was trying on hands
and knees, blinded with blood, to crawl away. He now recovered
poise enough to cling to a saddle. So they changed him to the first
camel they found, and led him off at once.</p>

<p>The Turks, seeing us so quiet, began to advance up the slope. We
let them come half-way, and then poured in volleys which killed
some twenty and drove the others back. The ground about the train
was strewn with dead, and the broken coaches had been crowded: but
they were fighting under eye of their Corps Commander, and
undaunted began to work round the spurs to outflank us.</p>

<p>We were now only about forty left, and obviously could do no
good against them. So we ran in batches up the little stream-bed,
turning at each sheltered angle to delay them by pot-shots. Little
Turki much distinguished himself by quick coolness, though his
straight-stocked Turkish cavalry carbine made him so expose his
head that he got four bullets through his head-cloth. Ali was angry
with me for retiring slowly. In reality my raw hurts crippled me,
but to hide from him this real reason I pretended to be easy,
interested in and studying the Turks. Such successive rests while I
gained courage for a new run kept him and Turki far behind the
rest.</p>

<p>At last we reached the hill-top. Each man there jumped on the
nearest camel, and made away at full speed eastward into the
desert, for an hour. Then in safety we sorted our animals. The
excellent Rahail, despite the ruling excitement, had brought off
with him, tied to his saddle-girth, a huge haunch of the camel
slaughtered just as the train arrived. He gave us the motive for a
proper halt, five miles farther on, as a little party of four
camels appeared marching in the same direction. It was our
companion, Matar, coming back from his home village to Azrak with
loads of raisins and peasant delicacies.</p>

<p>So we stopped at once, under a large rock in Wadi Dhuleil, where
was a barren fig-tree, and cooked our first meal for three days.
There, also, we bandaged up Fahad, who was sleepy with the
lassitude of his severe hurt. Adhub, seeing this, took one of
Matar's new carpets, and, doubling it across the camel-saddle,
stitched the ends into great pockets. In one they laid Fahad, while
Adhub crawled into the other as make-weight: and the camel was led
off southward towards their tribal tents.</p>

<p>The other wounded men were seen to at the same time. Mifleh
brought up the youngest lads of the party, and had them spray the
wounds with their piss, as a rude antiseptic. Meanwhile we whole
ones refreshed ourselves. I bought another mangy camel for extra
meat, paid rewards, compensated the relatives of the killed, and
gave prize-money, for the sixty or seventy rifles we had taken. It
was small booty, but not to be despised. Some Serahin, who had gone
into the action without rifles, able only to throw unavailing
stones, had now two guns apiece. Next day we moved into Azrak,
having a great welcome, and boasting&mdash;God forgive
us&mdash;that we were victors.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXIX</h3>

<p>Rain had set in steadily, and the country was sodden wet.
Allenby had failed in his weather, and there could be no great
advance this year. Nevertheless, for progress' sake we determined
to hold to Azrak. Partly it would be a preaching base, from which
to spread our movement in the North: partly it would be a centre of
intelligence: partly it would cut off Nuri Shaalan from the Turks.
He hesitated to declare himself only because of his wealth in
Syria, and the possible hurt to his tribesmen if they were deprived
of their natural market. We, by living in one of his main manors,
would keep him ashamed to go in to the enemy. Azrak lay favourably
for us, and the old fort would be convenient headquarters if we
made it habitable, no matter how severe the winter.</p>

<p>So I established myself in its southern gate-tower, and set my
six Haurani boys (for whom manual labour was not disgraceful) to
cover with brushwood, palm-branches, and clay the ancient split
stone rafters, which stood open to the sky. Ali took up his
quarters in the south-east corner tower, and made that roof tight.
The Indians weather-proofed their own north-west rooms. We arranged
the stores on the ground floor of the western tower, by the little
gate, for it was the soundest, driest place. The Biasha chose to
live under me in the south gate. So we blocked that entry and made
a hall of it. Then we opened a great arch from the court to the
palm-garden, and made a ramp, that our camels might come inside
each evening.</p>

<p>Hassan Shah we appointed Seneschal. As a good Moslem his first
care was for the little mosque in the square. It had been half
unroofed and the Arabs had penned sheep within the walls. He set
his twenty men to dig out the filth, and wash the pavement clean.
The mosque then became a most attractive house of prayer. What had
been a place shut off, dedicated to God alone, Time had broken open
to the Evanescent with its ministering winds and rain and sunlight;
these entering into the worship taught worshippers how the two were
one.</p>

<p>Our prudent Jemadar's next labour was to make positions for
machine-guns in the upper towers, from whose tops the approaches
lay at mercy. Then he placed a formal sentry (a portent and cause
of wonder in Arabia) whose main duty was the shutting of the
postern gate at sundown. The door was a poised slab of dressed
basalt, a foot thick, turning on pivots of itself, socketed into
threshold and lintel. It took a great effort to start swinging, and
at the end went shut with a clang and crash which made tremble the
west wall of the old castle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we were studying to provision ourselves. Akaba was
far off, and in winter the roads thither would be rigorous: so we
prepared a caravan to go up to Jebel Druse, the neutral land, only
a day off. Matar went in charge of this for us, with a long train
of camels to carry back varieties of food for our motley party.
Besides my bodyguard, who were taught to live on what they got, we
had the Indians, for whom pepperless food was no food at all. Ali
ibn el Hussein wanted sheep and butter and parched wheat for his
men and the Biasha. Then there were the guests and refugees whom we
might expect so soon as the news of our establishment was rumoured
in Damascus. Till they came we should have a few days' repose, and
we sat down to enjoy these dregs of autumn&mdash;the alternate days
of rain and shine. We had sheep and flour, milk and fuel. Life in
the fort, but for the ill-omened mud, went well enough.</p>

<p>Yet the peacefulness ended sooner than we thought. Wood, who had
been ailing for some time, went down with a sharp attack of
dysentery. This was nothing by itself, but the consequent weakness
might have endangered him when winter set in earnestly. Besides, he
was their base engineer at Akaba; and, except for the comfort of
his companionship, I had no justification in keeping him longer. So
we made up a party to go down with him to the coast, choosing as
the escort, Ahmed, Abd el Rahman, Mahmoud, and Aziz. These were to
return to Azrak forthwith from Akaba with a new caravan of stores,
particularly comprising Indian rations. The rest of my men would
stay in chilly idleness watching the situation develop.</p>

<p>Then began our flood of visitors. All day and every day they
came, now in the running column of shots, raucous shouting and rush
of camel-feet which meant a Bedouin parade, it might be of Rualla,
or Sherarat, or Serahin, Serdiyeh, or Beni Sakhr, chiefs of great
name like ibn Zuhair, ibn Kaebir, Rafa el Khoreisha, or some little
father of a family demonstrating his greedy goodwill before the
fair eyes of Ali ibn el Hussein. Then it would be a wild gallop of
horse: Druses, or the ruffling warlike peasants of the Arab plain.
Sometimes it was a cautious, slow-led caravan of ridden camels,
from which stiffly dismounted Syrian politicians or traders not
accustomed to the road. One day arrived a hundred miserable
Armenians, fleeing starvation and the suspended terror of the
Turks. Again would come a spick and span group of mounted officers,
Arab deserters from the Turkish armies, followed, often as not, by
a compact company of Arab rank and file. Always they came, day
after day, till the desert, which had been trackless when we came,
was starred out with grey roads.</p>

<p>Ali appointed first one, then two, and at last three,
guest-masters, who received the rising tide of these newcomers,
sorted worshipful from curious, and marshalled them in due time
before him or me. All wanted to know about the Sherif, the Arab
army and the English. Merchants from Damascus brought presents:
sweet-meats, sesame, caramel, apricot paste, nuts, silk clothes for
ourselves, brocade cloaks, head-cloths, sheepskins, felt rugs with
coloured strands beaten into them in arabesques, Persian carpets.
We returned them coffee and sugar, rice, and rolls of white cotton
sheeting; necessities of which they had been deprived by war.
Everybody learned that in Akaba there was plenty, coming across the
open sea from all the markets of the world; and so the Arab cause
which was theirs by sentiment, and instinct and inclination, became
theirs by interest also. Slowly our example and teaching converted
them: very slowly, by our own choice, that they might be ours more
surely.</p>

<p>The greatest asset of Feisal's cause in this work up North was
Sherif Ali ibn el Hussein. The lunatic competitor of the wilder
tribesmen in their wildest feats was now turning all his force to
greater ends. The mixed natures in him made of his face and body
powerful pleadings, carnal, perhaps, except in so far as they were
transfused by character. No one could see him without the desire to
see him again; especially when he smiled, as he did rarely, with
both mouth and eyes at once. His beauty was a conscious weapon. He
dressed spotlessly, all in black or all in white; and he studied
gesture.</p>

<p>Fortune had added physical perfection and unusual grace, but
these qualities were only the just expression of his powers. They
made obvious the pluck which never yielded, which would have let
him be cut to pieces, holding on. His pride broke out in his
war-cry, I am of the Harith', the two-thousand-year-old clan of
freebooters; while the huge eyes, white with large black pupils
slowly turning in them, emphasized the frozen dignity which was his
ideal carriage, and to which he was always striving to still
himself. But as ever the bubbling laugh would shriek out of him
unawares; and the youth, boyish or girlish, of him, the fire and
deviltry would break through his night like a sunrise.</p>

<p>Yet, despite this richness, there was a constant depression with
him, the unknown longing of simple, restless people for abstract
thought beyond their minds' supply. His bodily strength grew day by
day, and hatefully fleshed over this humble something which he
wanted more. His wild mirth was only one sign of the vain
wearing-out of his desire. These besetting strangers underlined his
detachment, his unwilling detachment, from his fellows. Despite his
great instinct for confession and company, he could find no
intimates. Yet he could not be alone. If he had no guests, Khazen,
the servant, must serve his meals, while Ali and his slaves ate
together.</p>

<p>In these slow nights we were secure against the world. For one
thing, it was winter, and in the rain and the dark few men would
venture either over the labyrinth of lava or through the
marsh&mdash;the two approaches to our fortress; and, further, we
had ghostly guardians. The first evening we were sitting with the
Serahin, Hassan Shah had made the rounds, and the coffee was being
pounded by the hearth, when there rose a strange, long wailing
round the towers outside. Ibn Bani seized me by the arm and held to
me, shuddering. I whispered to him, 'What is IT?' and he gasped
that the dogs of the Beni Hillal, the mythical builders of the
fort, quested the six towers each night for their dead masters.</p>

<p>We strained to listen. Through Ali's black basalt window-frame
crept a rustling, which was the stirring of the night-wind in the
withered palms, an intermittent rustling, like English rain on
yet-crisp fallen leaves. Then the cries came again and again and
again, rising slowly in power, till they sobbed round the walls in
deep waves to die away choked and miserable. At such times our men
pounded the coffee harder while the Arabs broke into sudden song to
occupy their ears against the misfortune. No Bedouin would lie
outside in wait for the mystery, and from our windows we saw
nothing but the motes of water in the dank air which drove through
the radiance of our firelight. So it remained a legend: but wolves
or jackals, hyasnas, or hunting dogs, their ghost-watch kept our
ward more closely than arms could have done.</p>

<p>In the evening, when we had shut-to the gate, all guests would
assemble, either in my room or in Ali's, and coffee and stories
would go round until the last meal, and after it, till sleep came.
On stormy nights we brought in brushwood and dung and lit a great
fire in the middle of the floor. About it would be drawn the
carpets and the saddle-sheepskins, and in its light we would tell
over our own battles, or hear the visitors' traditions. The leaping
flames chased our smoke-muffled shadows strangely about the rough
stone wall behind us, distorting them over the hollows and
projections of its broken face. When these stories came to a
period, our tight circle would shift over, uneasily, to the other
knee or elbow; while coffee-cups went clinking round, and a servant
fanned the blue reek of the fire towards the loophole with his
cloak, making the glowing ash swirl and sparkle with his draught.
Till the voice of the story-teller took up again, we would hear the
rain-spots hissing briefly as they dripped from the stone-beamed
roof into the fire's heart.</p>

<p>At last the sky turned solidly to rain, and no man could
approach us. In loneliness we learned the full disadvantage of
imprisonment within such gloomy ancient unmortared palaces. The
rains guttered down within the walls' thickness and spouted into
the rooms from their chinks. We set rafts of palm-branches to bear
us clear of the streaming floor, covered them with felt mats, and
huddled down on them under sheepskins, with another mat over us
like a shield to throw off the water. It was icy cold, as we hid
there, motionless, from murky daylight until dark, our minds
seeming suspended within these massive walls, through whose every
shot-window the piercing mist streamed like a white pennant. Past
and future flowed over us like an uneddying river. We dreamed
ourselves into the spirit of the place; sieges and feasting, raids,
murders, love-singing in the night.</p>

<p>This escape of our wits from the fettered body was an indulgence
against whose enervation only change of scene could avail. Very
painfully I drew myself again into the present, and forced my mind
to say that it must use this wintry weather to explore the country
lying round about Deraa.</p>

<p>As I was thinking how I would ride, there came to us,
unheralded, one morning in the rain, Talal el Hareidhin, sheikh of
Tafas. He was a famous outlaw with a price upon his head; but so
great that he rode about as he pleased. In two wild years he had
killed, according to report, some twenty-three of the Turks. His
six followers were splendidly mounted, and himself the most dashing
figure of a man in the height of Hauran fashion. His sheepskin coat
was finest Angora, covered in green broadcloth, with silk patches
and designs in braid. His other clothes were silk; and his high
boots, his silver saddle, his sword, dagger, and rifle matched his
reputation.</p>

<p>He swaggered to our coffee-hearth, as a man sure of his welcome,
greeting Ali boisterously (after our long sojourn with the tribes
all peasants sounded boisterous), laughing broad-mouthed at the
weather and our old fort and the enemy. He looked about
thirty-five, was short and strong, with a full face, trimmed beard
and long, pointed moustaches. His round eyes were made rounder,
larger and darker by the antimony loaded on in villager style. He
was ardently ours, and we rejoiced, since his name was one to
conjure with in Hauran. When a day had made me sure of him, I took
him secretly to the palm-garden, and told him my ambition to see
his neighbourhood. The idea delighted him, and he companioned me
for the march as thoroughly and cheerfully as only a Syrian on a
good horse could. Halim and Faris, men specially engaged, rode with
me as guards.</p>

<p>We went past Umtaiye, looking at tracks, wells and lava-fields,
crossed the line to Sheikh Saad, and turned south to Tafas, where
Talal was at home. Next day we went on to Tell Arar, a splendid
position closing the Damascus railway and commanding Deraa.
Afterwards we rode through tricky rolling country to Mezerib on the
Palestine railway; planning, here also, for the next time; when
with men, money and guns we should start the general rising to win
inevitable victory. Perhaps the coming spring inight see Allenby
leap forward.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXX</h3>

<p>Properly to round off this spying of the hollow land of Hauran,
it was necessary to visit Deraa, its chief town. We could cut it
off on north and west and south, by destroying the three railways;
but it would be more tidy to rush the junction first and work
outwards. Talal, however, could not venture in with me since he was
too well known in the place. So we parted from him with many thanks
on both sides, and rode southward along the line until near Deraa.
There we dismounted. The boy, Halim, took the ponies, and set off
for Nisib, south of Deraa. My plan was to walk round the railway
station and town with Faris, and reach Nisib after sunset. Paris
was my best companion for the trip, because he was an insignificant
peasant, old enough to be my father, and respectable.</p>

<p>The respectability seemed comparative as we tramped off in the
watery sunlight, which was taking the place of the rain last night.
The ground was muddy, we were barefoot, and our draggled clothes
showed the stains of the foul weather to which we had been exposed.
I was in Halim's wet things, with a torn Hurani jacket, and was yet
limping from the broken foot acquired when we blew up Jemal's
train. The slippery track made walking difficult, unless we spread
out our toes widely and took hold of the ground with them: and
doing this for mile after mile was exquisitely painful to me.
Because pain hurt me so, I would not lay weight always on my pains
in our revolt: yet hardly one day in Arabia passed without a
physical ache to increase the corroding sense of my accessory
deceitfulness towards the Arabs, and the legitimate fatigue of
responsible command.</p>

<p>We mounted the curving bank of the Palestine Railway, and from
its vantage surveyed Deraa Station: but the ground was too open to
admit of surprise attack. We decided to walk down the east front of
the defences: so we plodded on, noting German stores, barbed wire
here and there, rudiments of trenches. Turkish troops were passing
incuriously between the tents and their latrines dug out on our
side.</p>

<p>At the corner of the aerodrome by the south end of the station
we struck over towards the town. There were old Albatros machines
in the sheds, and men lounging about. One of these, a Syrian
soldier, began to question us about our villages, and if there was
much 'government' where we lived. He was probably an intending
deserter, fishing for a refuge. We shook him off at last and turned
away. Someone called out in Turkish. We walked on deafly; but a
sergeant came after, and took me roughly by the arm, saying 'The
Bey wants you'. There were too many witnesses for fight or flight,
so I went readily. He took no notice of Paris.</p>

<p>I was marched through the tall fence into a compound set about
with many huts and a few buildings. We passed to a mud room,
outside which was an earth platform, whereon sat a fleshy Turkish
officer, one leg tucked under him. He hardly glanced at me when the
sergeant brought me up and made a long report in Turkish. He asked
my name: I told him Ahmed ibn Bagr, a Circassian from Kuneitra. 'A
deserter?' 'But we Circassians have no military service'. He
turned, stared at me, and said very slowly 'You are a liar. Enrol
him in your section, Hassan Chowish, and do what is necessary till
the Bey sends for him'.</p>

<p>They led me into a guard-room, mostly taken up by large wooden
cribs, on which lay or sat a dozen men in untidy uniforms. They
took away my belt, and my knife, made me wash myself carefully, and
fed me. I passed the long day there. They would not let me go on
any terms, but tried to reassure me. A soldier's life was not all
bad. To-morrow, perhaps, leave would be permitted, if I fulfilled
the Bey's pleasure this evening. The Bey seemed to be Nahi, the
Governor. If he was angry, they said, I would be drafted for
infantry training to the depot in Baalbek. I tried to look as
though, to my mind, there was nothing worse in the world than
that.</p>

<p>Soon after dark three men came for me. It had seemed a chance to
get away, but one held me all the time. I cursed my littleness. Our
march crossed the railway, where were six tracks, besides the
sidings of the engine-shop. We went through a side gate, down a
street, past a square, to a detached, two-storied house. There was
a sentry outside, and a glimpse of others lolling in the dark
entry. They took me upstairs to the Bey's room; or to his bedroom,
rather. He was another bulky man, a Circassian himself, perhaps,
and sat on the bed in a night-gown, trembling and sweating as
though with fever. When I was pushed in he kept his head down, and
waved the guard out. In a breathless voice he told me to sit on the
floor in front of him, and after that was dumb; while I gazed at
the top of his great head, on which the bristling hair stood up, no
longer than the dark stubble on his cheeks and chin. At last he
looked me over, and told me to stand up: then to turn round. I
obeyed; he flung himself back on the bed, and dragged me down with
<i>him</i> in his arms. When I saw what he wanted I twisted round
and up again, glad to find myself equal to him, at any rate in
wrestling.</p>

<p>He began to fawn on me, saying how white and fresh I was, how
fine my hands and feet, and how he would let me off drills and
duties, make me his orderly, even pay me wages, if I would love
him.</p>

<p>I was obdurate, so he changed his tone, and sharply ordered me
to take off my drawers. When I hesitated, he snatched at me; and I
pushed him back. He clapped his hands for the sentry, who hurried
in and pinioned me. The Bey cursed me with horrible threats: and
made the man holding me tear my clothes away, bit by bit. His eyes
rounded at the half-healed places where the bullets had flicked
through my skin a little while ago. Finally he lumbered to his
feet, with a glitter in his look, and began to paw me over. I bore
it for a little, till he got too beastly; and then jerked my knee
into him.</p>

<p>He staggered to his bed, squeezing himself together and groaning
with pain, while the soldier shouted for the corporal and the other
three men to grip me hand and foot. As soon as I was helpless the
Governor regained courage, and spat at me, swearing he would make
me ask pardon. He took off his slipper, and hit me repeatedly with
it in the face, while the corporal braced my head back by the hair
to receive the blows. He leaned forward, fixed his teeth in my neck
and bit till the blood came. Then he kissed me. Afterwards he drew
one of the men's bayonets. I thought he was going to kill me, and
was sorry: but he only pulled up a fold of the flesh over my ribs,
worked the point through, after considerable trouble, and gave the
blade a half-turn. This hurt, and I winced, while the blood wavered
down my side, and dripped to the front of my thigh. He looked
pleased and dabbled it over my stomach with his finger-tips.</p>

<p>In my despair I spoke. His face changed and he stood still, then
controlled his voice with an effort, to say significantly, 'You
must understand that I know: and it will be easier if you do as I
wish'. I was dumbfounded, and we stared silently at one another,
while the men who felt an inner meaning beyond their experience,
shifted uncomfortably. But it was evidently a chance shot, by which
he himself did not, or would not, mean what I feared. I could not
again trust my twitching mouth, which faltered always in
emergencies, so at last threw up my chin, which was the sign for
'No' in the East; then he sat down, and half-whispered to the
corporal to take me out and teach me everything.</p>

<p>They kicked me to the head of the stairs, and stretched me over
a guard-bench, pommelling me. Two knelt on my ankles, bearing down
on the back of my knees, while two more twisted my wrists till they
cracked, and then crushed them and my neck against the wood. The
corporal had run downstairs; and now came back with a whip of the
Circassian sort, a thong of supple black hide, rounded, and
tapering from the thickness of a thumb at the grip (which was
wrapped in silver) down to a hard point finer than a pencil.</p>

<p>He saw me shivering, partly I think, with cold, and made it
whistle over my ear, taunting me that before his tenth cut I would
howl for mercy, and at the twentieth beg for the caresses of the
Bey; and then he began to lash me madly across and across with all
his might, while I locked my teeth to endure this thing which
lapped itself like flaming wire about my body.</p>

<p>To keep my mind in control I numbered the blows, but after
twenty lost count, and could feel only the shapeless weight of
pain, not tearing claws, for which I had prepared, but a gradual
cracking apart of my whole being by some too-great force whose
waves rolled up my spine till they were pent within my brain, to
clash terribly together. Somewhere in the place a cheap clock
ticked loudly, and it distressed me that their beating was not in
its time. I writhed and twisted, but was held so tightly that my
struggles were useless. After the corporal ceased, the men took up,
very deliberately, giving me so many, and then an interval, during
which they would squabble for the next turn, ease themselves, and
play unspeakably with me. This was repeated often, for what may
have been no more than ten minutes. Always for the first of every
new series, my head would be pulled round, to see how a hard white
ridge, like a railway, darkening slowly into crimson, leaped over
my skin at the instant of each stroke, with a bead of blood where
two ridges crossed. As the punishment proceeded the whip fell more
and more upon existing weals, biting blacker or more wet, till my
flesh quivered with accumulated pain, and with terror of the next
blow coming. They soon conquered my determination not to cry, but
while my will ruled my lips I used only Arabic, and before the end
a merciful sickness choked my utterance.</p>

<p>At last when I was completely broken they seemed satisfied.
Somehow I found myself off the bench, lying on my back on the dirty
floor, where I snuggled down, dazed, panting for breath, but
vaguely comfortable. I had strung myself to learn all pain until I
died, and no longer actor, but spectator, thought not to care how
my body jerked and squealed. Yet I knew or imagined what passed
about me.</p>

<p>I remembered the corporal kicking with his nailed boot to get me
up; and this was true, for next day my right side was dark and
lacerated, and a damaged rib made each breath stab me sharply. I
remembered smiling idly at him, for a delicious warmth, probably
sexual, was swelling through me: and then that he flung up his arm
and hacked with the full length of his whip into my groin. This
doubled me half-over, screaming, or, rather, trying impotently to
scream, only shuddering through my open mouth. One giggled with
amusement. A voice cried, 'Shame, you've killed him'. Another slash
followed. A roaring, and my eyes went black: while within me the
core of life seemed to heave slowly up through the rending nerves,
expelled from its body by this last indescribable pang.</p>

<p>By the bruises perhaps they beat me further: but I next knew
that I was being dragged about by two men, each disputing over a
leg as though to split me apart: while a third man rode me astride.
It was momently better than more flogging. Then Nahi called. They
splashed water in my face, wiped off some of the filth, and lifted
me between them, retching and sobbing for mercy, to where he lay:
but he now rejected me in haste, as a thing too torn and bloody for
his bed, blaming their excess of zeal which had spoilt me: whereas
no doubt they had laid into me much as usual, and the fault rested
mainly upon my indoor skin, which gave way more than an Arab's.</p>

<p>So the crestfallen corporal, as the youngest and best-looking of
the guard, had to stay behind, while the others carried me down the
narrow stair into the street. The coolness of the night on my
burning flesh, and the unmoved shining of the stars after the
horror of the past hour, made me cry again. The soldiers, now free
to speak, warned me that men must suffer their officers' wishes or
pay for it, as I had just done, with greater suffering.</p>

<p>They took me over an open space, deserted and dark, and behind
the Government house to a lean-to wooden room, in which were many
dusty quilts. An Armenian dresser appeared, to wash and bandage me
in sleepy haste. Then all went away, the last soldier delaying by
my side a moment to whisper in his Druse accent that the door into
the next room was not locked.</p>

<p>I lay there in a sick stupor, with my head aching very much, and
growing slowly numb with cold, till the dawn light came shining
through the cracks of the shed, and a locomotive whistled in the
station. These and a draining thirst brought me to life, and I
found I was in no pain. Pain of the slightest had been my obsession
and secret terror, from a boy. Had I now been drugged with it, to
bewilderment? Yet the first movement was anguish: in which I
struggled nakedly to my feet, and rocked moaning in wonder that it
was not a dream, and myself back five years ago, a timid recruit at
Khalfati, where something, less staining, of the sort had
happened.</p>

<p>The next room was a dispensary. On its door hung a suit of
shoddy clothes. I put them on slowly and unhandily, because of my
swollen wrists: and from the drugs chose corrosive sublimate, as
safeguard against recapture. The window looked on a long blank
wall. Stiffly I climbed out, and went shaking down the road towards
the village, past the few people already astir. They took no
notice; indeed there was nothing peculiar in my dark broadcloth,
red fez and slippers: but it was only by the full urge of my tongue
silently to myself that I refrained from being foolish out of sheer
fright. Deraa felt inhuman with vice and cruelty, and it shocked me
like cold water when a soldier laughed behind me in the street.</p>

<p>By the bridge were the wells, with men and women about them. A
side trough was free. From its end I scooped up a little water in
my hands, and rubbed it over my face; then drank, which was
precious to me; and afterwards wandered along the bottom of the
valley, towards the south, unobtrusively retreating out of sight.
This valley provided the hidden road by which our projected raid
could attain Deraa town secretly, and surprise the Turks. So, in
escaping I solved, too late, the problem which had brought me to
Deraa.</p>

<p>Further on, a Serdi, on his camel, overtook me hobbling up the
road towards Nisib. I explained that I had business there, and was
already footsore. He had pity and mounted me behind him on his bony
animal, to which I clung the rest of the way, learning the feelings
of my adopted name-saint on his gridiron. The tribe's tents were
just in front of the village, where I found Fans and Halim anxious
about me, and curious to learn how I had fared. Halim had been up
to Deraa in the night, and knew by the lack of rumour that the
truth had not been discovered. I told them a merry tale of bribery
and trickery, which they promised to keep to themselves, laughing
aloud at the simplicity of the Turks.</p>

<p>During the night I managed to see the great stone bridge by
Nisib. Not that my maimed will now cared a hoot about the Arab
Revolt (or about anything but mending itself): yet, since the war
had been a hobby of mine, for custom's sake I would force myself to
push it through. Afterwards we took horse, and rode gently and
carefully towards Azrak, without incident, except that a raiding
party of Wuld Ali let us and our horses go unplundered when they
heard who we were. This was an unexpected generosity, the Wuld Ali
being not yet of our fellowship. Their consideration (rendered at
once, as if we had deserved men's homage) momently stayed me to
carry the burden, whose certainty the passing days confirmed: how
in Deraa that night the citadel of my integrity had been
irrevocably lost.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXXI</h3>

<p>Xury, the Druse Emir of Salkhad, reached our old castle just
before me on his first visit to Sherif Ali. He told us the rest of
the history of the Emir Abd el Kader, the Algerian. After stealing
away from us he had ridden straight to their village, and entered
in triumph, the Arab flag displayed, and his seven horsemen
cantering about him, firing joy-shots. The people were astonished,
and the Turkish Governor protested that such doings were an insult
to him. He was introduced to Abd el Kader, who, sitting in pomp on
the divan, made a bombastic speech, stating that the Sherif now
took over Jebel Druse through his agency, and all existing
officials were confirmed in their appointments. Next morning he
made a second progress through the district. The suffering Governor
complained again. Emir Abd el Kader drew his gold-mounted Meccan
sword, and swore that with it he would cut off Jemal Pasha's head.
The Druses reproved him, vowing that such things should not be said
in their house before his Excellency the Governor. Abd el Kader
called them whoresons, ingle's accidents, sons of a bitch,
profiteering cuckolds and pimps, jetting his insults broadcast to
the room-full. The Druses got angry. Abd el Kader flung raging out
of the house and mounted, shouting that when he stamped his foot
all Jebel Druse would rise on his side.</p>

<p>With his seven servants, he spurred down the road to Deraa
Station, which he entered as he had entered Salkhad. The Turks, who
knew his madness of old, left him to play. They disbelieved even
his yarn that Ali and I would try the Yarmuk bridge that night.
When, however, we did, they took a graver view, and sent him under
custody to Damascus. Jemal's brutal humour was amused, and he
enlarged him as a butt. Abd el Kader gradually became amenable. The
Turks began to use him once more as <i>agent provocateur</i> and
dissipator of the energy generated by their local Syrian
nationalists.</p>

<p>The weather was now dreadful, with sleet and snow and storms
continually; it was obvious that at Azrak there would be nothing
but teaching and preaching in the next months. For this I was not
eager. When necessary, I had done my share of proselytizing
fatigues, converting as best I could; conscious all the time of my
strangeness, and of the incongruity of an alien's advocating
national liberty. The war for me held a struggle to side-track
thought, to get into the people's attitude of accepting the revolt
naturally and trustingly. I had to persuade myself that the British
Government could really keep the spirit of its promises. Especially
was this difficult when I was tired and ill, when the delirious
activity of my brain tore to shreds my patience. And then, after
the blunt Beduin, who would thrust in, hailing me '<i>ya
auruns</i>', and put their need without compliments, these smooth
townspeople were maddening as they crawled for the favour of an
audience with their Prince and Bey and Lord and Deliverer. Such
imputed dignities, like body armour in a duel, were no doubt
useful; but uncomfortable, and mean, too.</p>

<p>I had never been a lofty person; on the contrary I had tried to
be accessible to everyone, even if it continually felt as though
most of them came and saw me every day. I had striven as eloquently
as I could by my own example to keep plain the standard of
existence. I had had no tents, no cooks, no body-servants: just my
guards, who were fighting men, not servile: and behold these
Byzantine shopkeepers endeavouring to corrupt our simplicity! So I
flung away from them in a rage, determined to go south and see if
anything active could be done, in the cold weather, about the Dead
Sea, which the enemy held as a trench dividing us from
Palestine.</p>

<p>My remaining money was handed over to Sherif Ali, for his
maintenance till the spring; and the Indians were commended to his
care. Particularly we bought them fresh riding-camels, in case the
need to move came suddenly upon them in the winter; though the
daily news of a threat by the Turks against Azrak was scornfully
discounted by young Ali. He and I took affectionate leave of one
another. Ali gave me half his wardrobe: shirts, head-cloths, belts,
tunics. I gave him an equivalent half of mine, and we kissed like
David and Jonathan, each wearing the other's clothes. Afterwards,
with Rahail only, on my two best camels, I struck away
southward.</p>

<p>We left Azrak one evening, riding into a glowing west, while
over our heads schools of cranes flew into the sunset like
<i>the</i> out-drawn barbs of arrows. It was toilsome from the
start. Night was deep by Wadi Butum, where the conditions became
even worse. All the plain was wet, and our poor camels slithered
and fell time and again. We fell as often as they did, but at least
our part of sitting still, between falls, was easier than their
part of movement. By midnight we had crossed the Ghadaf and the
quag felt too awful for further progress. Also the mishandling at
Deraa had left me curiously faint; my muscles seemed at once pappy
and inflamed, and all effort frightened me in anticipation. So we
halted.</p>

<p>We slept where we were, in the mud; rose up plated with it at
dawn, and smiled crackily at one another. The wind blew, and the
ground began to dry. It was important, for I wanted to reach Akaba
before Wood's men had left it with the return caravan, and their
eight days' start called for speed. My body's reluctance to ride
hard was another (and perverse) reason for forcing the march. Until
noon we made poor travelling, for the camels still broke through
the loose crust of flints, and foundered in the red under-clay.
After noon, on the higher ground, we did better, and began rapidly
to close the white sky-tents which were the Thlaithakhwat
peaks.</p>

<p>Suddenly shots rang out at close range, and four mouthing men
dashed down the slope towards us. I stopped my camel peaceably.
Seeing this they jumped off, and ran to us brandishing their arms.
They asked who I was: volunteering that they were Jazi
Howietat.</p>

<p>This was an open lie, because their camel-brands were Faiz. They
covered us with rifles at four yards, and told us to dismount. I
laughed at them, which was good tactics with Beduin at a crisis.
They were puzzled. I asked the loudest if he knew his name. He
stared at me, thinking I was mad. He came nearer, with his finger
on the trigger, and I bent down to him and whispered that it must
be '<i>Teras</i>' since no other tradesman could be so rude. As I
spoke, I covered him with a pistol hidden under my cloak.</p>

<p>It was a shooting insult, but he was so astonished that anyone
should provoke an armed man, as to give up for the moment his
thought of murdering us. He took a step back, and looked around,
fearful that there was a reserve somewhere, to give us confidence.
At once I rode off slowly, with a creepy feeling in my back,
calling Rahail to follow. They let him go too, unhurt. When we were
a hundred yards away, they repented themselves, and began to shoot,
but we dashed over the watershed into the next depression, and
across it cantered more confidently into safe ground.</p>

<p>From the ridge at sunset we looked back for an instant upon the
northern plain, as it sank away from us greyly, save that here and
there glowed specks or great splashes of crimson fire, the
reflection of the dying sun in shallow pools of rain-water on the
flats. These eyes of a dripping bloody redness were so much more
visible than the plain that they carried our sight miles into the
haze, and seemed to hang detached in the distant sky, tilted up,
like mirage.</p>

<p>We passed Bair long after dark, when only its latest tent-fires
still shone. As we went we saw the stars mirrored in a valley
bottom, and were able to water our breathless camels in a pool of
yesterday's rain. After their drink we eased them for half an hour.
This night-journeying was hard on both men and animals. By day the
camels saw the irregularities of their path, and undulated over
them; and the rider could swing his body to miss the jerk of a long
or short stride: but by night everything was blinded, and the march
racked with shocks. I had a heavy bout of fever on me, which made
me angry, so that I paid no attention to Rahail's appeals for rest.
That young man had maddened all of us for months by his abundant
vigour, and by laughing at our weaknesses; so this time I was
determined to ride him out, showing no mercy. Before dawn he was
blubbering with self-pity; but softly, lest I hear him.</p>

<p>Dawn in Jefer came imperceptibly through the mist like a ghost
of sunlight, which left the earth untouched, and demonstrated
itself as a glittering blink against the eyes alone. Things at
their heads stood matt against the pearl-grey horizon, and at their
feet melted softly into the ground. Our shadows had no edge: we
doubted if that faint stain upon the soil below was cast by us or
not. In the forenoon we reached Auda's camp; and stopped for a
greeting, and a few Jauf dates. Auda could not provide us a relay
of camels. We mounted again to get over the railway in the early
night. Rahail was past protest now. He rode beside me white-faced,
bleak and silent, wrought up only to outstay me, beginning to take
a half pride in his pains.</p>

<p>Even had we started fair, he had the advantage anyhow over me in
strength, and now I was nearly finished. Step by step I was
yielding myself to a slow ache which conspired with my abating
fever and the numb monotony of riding to close up the gate of my
senses. I seemed at last approaching the insensibility which had
always been beyond my reach: but a delectable land: for one born so
slug-tissued that nothing this side fainting would let his spirit
free. Now I found myself dividing into parts. There was one which
went on riding wisely, sparing or helping every pace of the wearied
camel. Another hovering above and to the right bent down curiously,
and asked what the flesh was doing. The flesh gave no answer, for,
indeed, it was conscious only of a ruling impulse to keep on and
on; but a third garrulous one talked and wondered, critical of the
body's self-inflicted labour, and contemptuous of the reason for
effort.</p>

<p>The night passed in these mutual conversations. My unseeing eyes
saw the dawn-goal in front; the head of the pass, below which that
other world of Rumm lay out like a sunlit map; and my parts debated
that the struggle might be worthy, but the end foolishness and a
re-birth of trouble. The spent body toiled on doggedly and took no
heed, quite rightly, for the divided selves said nothing which I
was not capable of thinking in cold blood; they were all my
natives. Telesius, taught by some such experience, split up the
soul. Had he gone on, to the furthest limit of exhaustion, he would
have seen his conceived regiment of thoughts and acts and feelings
ranked around him as separate creatures; eyeing, like vultures, the
passing in their midst of the common thing which gave them
life.</p>

<p>Rahail collected me out of my death-sleep by jerking my
headstall and striking me, while he shouted that we had lost our
direction, and were wandering toward the Turkish lines at Aba el
Lissan. He was right, and we had to make a long cut back to reach
Batra safely. We walked down the steeper portions of the pass, and
then stumbled along Wadi Hafira. In its midst a gallant little
Howeiti, aged perhaps fourteen, darted out against us, finger on
trigger, and told us to stand and explain; which we did, laughing.
The lad blushed, and pleaded that his father's camels kept him
always in the field so that he had not known us either by sight or
by description. He begged that we would not do him shame by
betraying his error. The incident broke the tension between Rahail
and myself; and, chatting, we rode out upon the Gaa. There under
the tamarisk we passed the middle hour of the day in sleep, since
by our slowness in the march over Batra we had lost the possibility
of reaching Akaba within the three days from Azrak. The breaking of
our intention we took quietly. Rumm's glory would not let a man
waste himself in feverish regrets.</p>

<p>We rode up its valley in the early afternoon; easier now and
exchanging jests with one another, as the long winter evening crept
down. When we got past the Khazail in the ascent we found the sun
veiled behind level banks of low clouds in the west, and enjoyed a
rich twilight of the English sort. In Itm the mist steamed up
gently from the soil, and collected into wool-white masses in each
hollow. We reached Akaba at midnight, and slept outside the camp
till breakfast, when I called on Joyce, and found the caravan not
yet ready to start: indeed Wood was only a few days returned.</p>

<p>Later came urgent orders for me to go up at once to Palestine by
air. Croil flew me to Suez. Thence I went up to Allenby's
headquarters beyond Gaza. He was so full of victories that my short
statement that we had failed to carry a Yarmuk bridge was
sufficient, and the miserable details of failure could remain
concealed.</p>

<p>While I was still with him, word came from Chetwode that
Jerusalem had fallen; and Allenby made ready to enter in the
official manner which the catholic imagination of Mark Sykes had
devised. He was good enough, although I had done nothing for the
success, to let Clayton take me along as his staff officer for the
day. The personal Staff tricked me out in their spare clothes till
I looked like a major in the British Army. Dalmeny lent me red
tabs, Evans his brass hat; so that I had the gauds of my
appointment in the ceremony of the Jaffa gate, which for me was the
supreme moment of the war.</p>

Campaign</h2>

<h3>CHAPTERS LXXXII TO XCI</h3>

<blockquote><i>After the capture of Jerusalem, Allenby, to relieve
his right, assigned us a limited objective. We began well; but when
we reached the Dead Sea, bad weather, bad temper and division of
purpose blunted our offensive spirit and broke up our
force.</i><br>
<br>
<i>I had a misunderstanding with Zeid, threw in my hand, and
returned to Palestine reporting that we had failed, and asking the
favour of other employment. Allenby was in the hopeful midst of a
great scheme for the coming spring. He sent me back at once to
Feisal with new powers and duties.</i>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXXII</h3>

<p>Shamefaced with triumph&mdash;which was not so much a triumph as
homage by Allenby to the mastering spirit of the place&mdash;we
drove back to Shea's headquarters. The aides pushed about, and from
great baskets drew a lunch, varied, elaborate and succulent. On us
fell a short space of quiet, to be shattered by Monsieur Picot, the
French political representative permitted by Allenby to march
beside Clayton in the entry, who said in his fluting voice: 'And
to-morrow, my dear general, I will take the necessary steps to set
up civil government in this town.'</p>

<p>It was the bravest word on record; a silence followed, as when
they opened the seventh seal in heaven. Salad, chicken mayonnaise
and foie gras sandwiches hung in our wet mouths unmunched, while we
turned to Allenby and gaped. Even he seemed for the moment at a
loss. We began to fear that the idol might betray a frailty. But
his face grew red: he swallowed, his chin coming forward (in the
way we loved), whilst he said, grimly, 'In the military zone the
only authority is that of the Commander-in-Chief&mdash;myself.'
'But Sir Grey, Sir Edward Grey'...stammered M. Picot. He was cut
short. 'Sir Edward Grey referred to the civil government which will
be established when I judge that the military situation permits.'
And by car again, through the sunshine of a great thankfulness, we
sped down the saluting mountain-side into our camp.</p>

<p>There Allenby and Dawnay told me the British were marched and
fought nearly to a standstill, in the ledged and precipitous hills,
shell-torn and bullet-spattered, amid which they wrestled with the
Turks along a line from Ramleh to Jerusalem. So they would ask us
in the lull to come north towards the Dead Sea until, if possible,
we linked right up to its southern end, and renewed the continuous
front. Fortunately, this had already been discussed with Feisal,
who was preparing the convergent move on Tafileh, its necessary
first step.</p>

<p>It was the moment to ask Allenby what he would do next. He
thought he was immobilized till the middle of February, when he
would push down to Jericho. Much enemy food was being lightered up
the Dead Sea, and he asked me to note this traffic as a second
objective if the effort to Tafileh prevailed.</p>

<p>I, hoping to improve on this, replied that, should the Turks be
continually shaken, we might join him at the north end of the Dead
Sea. If he could put Feisal's fifty tons a day of supplies, stores
and ammunition into Jericho, we would abandon Akaba and transfer
our headquarters to the Jordan Valley. The Arab regulars, now some
three thousand strong, would suffice to make our retention of the
river's eastern bank reasonably secure.</p>

<p>This idea commended itself to Allenby and Dawnay. They could
almost promise us such facilities when the railway reached
Jerusalem some time towards the end of the coming January. We might
be able to move our base two months after the line was through.</p>

<p>This talk left us a clear course of operations. The Arabs were
to reach the Dead Sea as soon as possible; to stop the transport of
food up it to Jericho before the middle of February; and to arrive
at the Jordan before the end of March. Since the first movement
would take a month to start, and all preliminaries were in hand, I
could take a holiday. So I went down to Cairo, and stayed there a
week experimenting with insulated cable and explosives.</p>

<p>After the week it seemed best to return to Akaba, where we
arrived on Christmas Day; to find Snagge, as senior officer in
Akaba, entertaining the British community to dinner. He had
screened-in the after deck and built tables, which took the hosts
and the twenty-odd guests easily. Snagge stood godfather to the
land, in hospitality, in the loan of his ship's doctor and
workshop, and in cheerfulness.</p>

<p>In the early days of the revolt it had been the <i>Hardinge</i>
which played his role of providence to us. Once, at Yenbo, Feisal
had ridden in from the hills on a streaming day of winter, cold,
wet, miserable and tired. Captain Linberry sent a launch ashore and
invited him to the ship, where he found, waiting for him, a warm
cabin, a peaceful meal, and a bountiful bath. Afterwards he lay
back in an arm-chair, smoking one of his constant cigarettes, and
remarked dreamily to me that now he knew what the furnishings of
heaven would be.</p>

<p>Joyce told me that things were well. The situation had sensibly
changed since Maulud's victory. The Turks had concentrated in Aba
el Lissan. We were distracting them by raids against the line south
of Maan. Abdulla and Ali were doing the same near Medina; and the
Turks, being pinched to guard the railway, had to draw men from Aba
el Lissan to strengthen weak sections.</p>

<p>Maulud boldly threw out posts to places on the plateau, and
began to harry the supply caravans from Maan. He was hampered by
the intense cold, the rain and snow on the heights. Some of his
ill-clad men actually died of exposure. But the Turks lost equally
in men and much more in transport, since their mangy camels died
off rapidly in the storms and mud. The loss straitened them in
food-carrying and involved further withdrawals from Aba el
Lissan.</p>

<p>At last they were too weak to hold the wide position, and, early
in January, Maulud was able to force them out towards Mreigha. The
Beduin caught the Turks moving, and cut up the hindmost battalion.
This threw the Turks back precipitately, to Uheida, only six miles
from Maan, and when we pressed after menacingly, they withdrew to
Semna, the outpost line of Maan, three miles out. So by January the
seventh Maulud was containing Maan directly.</p>

<p>Prosperity gave us ten days' leisure; and as Joyce and myself
were rarely at liberty together we decided to celebrate the
occasion by taking a car-trip down the mud-flats towards
Mudowwara.</p>

<p>The cars were now at Guweira, in permanent camp. Gilman and
Dowsett, with their crews and fifty Egyptian soldiers, had spent
months in Wadi Itm, building, like engineers, a motor road through
the gorge. It had been a great work, and was now in order to
Guweira. So we took the Rolls tenders, filled them with spare
tyres, petrol, and food for four days, and set off on our exploring
trip.</p>

<p>The mud-flats were bone-dry and afforded perfect going. Our
tyres left only a faint white scar across their velvet surface, as
we twisted about the spacious smoothness at speed, skirting clumps
of tamarisk and roaring along under the great sandstone crags. The
drivers rejoiced for the first time in nine months, and flung
forward abreast in a mad race. Their speedometers touched
sixty-five; not bad for cars which had been months ploughing the
desert with only such running repairs as the drivers had time and
tools to give them.</p>

<p>Across the sandy neck from the first flat to the second we built
a corduroy road of brushwood. When this was ready, the cars came
steaming and hissing along it, dangerously fast to avoid getting
stuck, rocking over hummocks in a style which looked fatal for
springs. However, we knew it was nearly impossible to break a
Rolls-Royce, and so were sorrier for the drivers, Thomas, Rolls and
Sanderson. The jolts tore the steering-wheel from their grip, and
left them breathless with bleeding hands after the crossing.</p>

<p>We lunched and rested, and then had another burst of speed, with
a wild diversion in the middle when a gazelle was sighted over the
flat, and two of the great cars lurched aside in unavailing
chase.</p>

<p>At the end of this second flat, the Gaa of Disi, we had a rough
mile to the third flat of Abu Sawana, across which we had a final
glorious sprint of fifteen miles, over the mud and over the equally
firm flint plains beyond. We slept there that chilly night, happy
with bully beef and tea and biscuit, with English talk and laughter
round the fire, golden with its shower of sparks from the fierce
brushwood. When these things tired, there was soft sand beneath our
bodies and two blankets to wrap ourselves in. For me it was a
holiday, with not an Arab near, before whom I must play out my
tedious part.</p>

<p>In the morning we ran on nearly to Mudowwara, finding the
ground-surface excellent to the watershed. So our reconnaissance
had been a quick and easy success. At once we turned back, to fetch
the armoured cars and undertake an immediate operation, with the
help of the mountain gun section on Talbots.</p>

<p>This section was an oddment, which General Clayton had seen in
Egypt, and had sent down to us in an inspired moment. Its Talbots,
specially geared for heavy work, carried two ten-pounders with
British gunners. It was wicked to give good men such rotten tools;
yet their spirit seemed hardly affected by the inferior weapons.
Their commander, Brodie, was a silent Scotsman, never very buoyant
and never too anxious; a man who found difficulties shameful to
notice, and who stamped himself on his fellows. However hard the
duty given them, they always attacked it with such untroubled
determination that their will prevailed. On every occasion and in
every crisis they would be surely in place at their moment,
perspiring but imperturbable, with never a word in explanation or
complaint.</p>

<p>Eight imposing cars drove off from Guweira next day, and reached
our old stopping-place behind Mudowwara by sundown. This was
excellent; and we camped, intending to find a road to the railway
in the morning. Accordingly we set off early in a Rolls tender and
searched through the very nasty low hills till evening, when we
were in place behind the last ridge, above Tell Shahm, the second
station northward from Mudowwara.</p>

<p>We had talked vaguely of mining a train, but the country was too
open, and enemy blockhouses numerous. Instead we determined to
attack a little entrenched work exactly opposite our hiding-place.
So late in new year's morning, a day as cool as a good summer's day
in England, after a pleasant breakfast we rolled gently over a
stony plain to a hillock which overlooked the Turkish post. Joyce
and I got out of our cars and climbed its summit, to look on.</p>

<p>Joyce was in charge, and for the first time I was at a fight as
spectator. The novelty was most enjoyable. Armoured car work seemed
fighting de luxe, for our troops, being steel-covered, could come
to no hurt. Accordingly we made a field-day of it like the best
regular generals, sitting in laconic conference on our hill-top and
watching the battle intently through binoculars.</p>

<p>The Talbot battery opened the affair, coming spiritedly into
action just below our point; while the three armoured cars crawled
about the flanks of the Turkish earthwork like great dogs nosing
out a trail. The enemy soldiers popped up their heads to gaze, and
everything was very friendly and curious, till the cars slewed
round their Vickers and began to spray the trenches. Then the
Turks, realizing that it was an attack, got down behind their
parapets and fired at the cars raggedly. It was about as deadly as
trying to warm a rhinoceros with bird-shot: after a while they
turned their attention to Brodie's guns and peppered the earth
about them with bullets.</p>

<p>Obviously they did not mean to surrender, and obviously we had
no means at disposal to compel them. So we drew off, contented with
having prowled up and down the line, and proved the surface hard
enough for car-operations at deliberate speed. However, the men
looked for more, and to humour them we drove southward till
opposite Shahm. There Brodie chose a gun-position at two thousand
yards and began to throw shell after shell neatly into the station
area.</p>

<p>Hating this, the Turks trickled off to a blockhouse, while the
cars put leisurely bullets through the station doors and windows.
They might have entered it safely, had there been point in doing
so. As it was we called everybody off again, and returned into our
hiding-hills. Our anxiety and forethought had been all to reach the
railway through the manifold difficulties of the plains and hills.
When we did reach it, we were entirely unready for action, with not
a conception of what our tactics or method should be: yet we
learned much from this very indecision.</p>

<p>The certainty that in a day from Guweira we could be operating
along the railway, meant that traffic lay at our mercy. All the
Turks in Arabia could not fight a single armoured car in open
country. Thereby the situation of Medina, already bad, became
hopeless. The German Staff saw it, and after Falkenhayn's visit to
Maan, they repeatedly urged abandonment of everything south of that
point; but the old Turk party valued Medina as the last remnant of
their sovereignty in the Holy Places, their surviving claim upon
the Caliphate. Sentiment swung them to the decision, against
military expediency.</p>

<p>The British seemed curiously dense about Medina. They insisted
that it must be captured, and lavished money and explosives on the
operations which Ali and Abdulla continually undertook from their
Yenbo base. When I pleaded to the contrary, they treated my view as
a witty paradox. Accordingly, to excuse our deliberate inactivity
in the north, we had to make a show of impotence, which gave them
to understand that the Arabs were too poltroon to cut the line near
Maan and keep it cut. This reason gratified their sense of fitness,
for soldiers, always ready to believe ill of native action, took
its inferiority as a compliment. So we battened on our ill
reputation, which was an ungenerous stratagem, but the easiest. The
staff knew so much more of war than I did that they refused to
learn from me of the strange conditions in which Arab irregulars
had to act; and I could not be bothered to set up a kindergarten of
the imagination for their benefit.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXXIII</h3>

<p>On our return to Akaba domestic affairs engaged the remaining
free days. My part mostly concerned the bodyguard which I formed
for private protection, as rumour gradually magnified my
importance. On our first going up country from Rabegh and Yenbo,
the Turks had been curious: afterwards they were annoyed; to the
point of ascribing to the English the direction and motive force of
the Arab Revolt, much as we used to flatter ourselves by
attributing the Turkish efficiency to German influence.</p>

<center><a name="kinder" id="kinder"></a>
<p><img alt="" src="0100111h-images/0100111h-20.jpg">
</p>
</center>

<p>However, the Turks said it often enough to make it an article of
faith, and began to offer a reward of one hundred pounds for a
British officer alive or dead. As time went on they not only
increased the general figure, but made a special bid for me. After
the capture of Akaba the price became respectable; while after we
blew up Jemal Pasha they put Ali and me at the head of their list;
worth twenty thousand pounds alive or ten thousand dead.</p>

<p>Of course, the offer was rhetorical; with no certainty whether
in gold or paper, or that the money would be paid at all. Still,
perhaps, it might justify some care. I began to increase my people
to a troop, adding such lawless men as I found, fellows whose dash
had got them into trouble elsewhere. I needed hard riders and hard
livers; men proud of themselves, and without family. By good
fortune three or four of this sort joined me at the first, setting
a tone and standard.</p>

<p>One afternoon, I was quietly reading in Marshall's tent at Akaba
(I lodged with Marshall, our Scottish doctor, as often as I was in
camp) when there entered over the noiseless sand an Ageyly, thin,
dark, and short, but most gorgeously dressed. He carried on his
shoulder the richest Hasa saddle-bag I had ever seen. Its woollen
tapestry of green and scarlet, white, orange and blue, had tassels
woven over its sides in five rows, and from the middle and bottom
hung five-foot streamers, of geometric pattern, tasselled and
fringed.</p>

<p>Respectfully greeting me, the young man threw the saddle-bag on
my carpet, saying 'Yours' and disappeared suddenly, as he had come.
Next day, he returned with a camel-saddle of equal beauty, the long
brass horns of its cantles adorned with exquisite old Yemeni
engraving. On the third day he reappeared empty-handed, in a poor
cotton shirt, and sank down in a heap before me, saying he wished
to enter my service. He looked odd without his silk robes; for his
face, shrivelled and torn with smallpox, and hairless, might have
been of any age; while he had a lad's supple body, and something of
a lad's recklessness in his carriage.</p>

<p>His long black hair was carefully braided into three shining
plaits down each cheek. His eyes were weak, closed up to slits. His
mouth was sensual, loose, wet; and gave him a good-humoured, half
cynical expression. I asked him his name; he replied Abdulla,
surnamed el Nahabi, or the Robber; the nickname, he said, was an
inheritance from his respected father. His own adventures had been
unprofitable. He was born in Boreida, and while young had suffered
from the civil power for his impiety. When half-grown, a misfortune
in a married woman's house had made him leave his native town, in a
hurry, and take service with ibn Saud, Emir of Nejd.</p>

<p>In this service his hard swearing earned lashes and
imprisonment. Consequently he deserted to Kuweit, where again he
had been amorous. On his release he had moved to Hail, and enrolled
himself among the retainers of ibn Rashid, the Emir. Unfortunately
there he had disliked his officer to the point of striking him in
public with a camel-stick. Return was made in kind; and, after a
slow recovery in prison, he had once more been thrust friendless on
the world.</p>

<p>The Hejaz Railway was being built, and to its works he had come
in search of fortune: but a contractor docked his wages for
sleeping at noonday. He retorted by docking the contractor of his
head. The Turkish Government interfered, and he found life very
hard in the prison at Medina. However, through a window, he came to
Mecca, and for his proved integrity and camel-manship was made
post-carrier between Mecca and Jidda. To this employ he settled
down, laying aside his young extravagances, bringing to Mecca his
father and mother and setting them up in a shop to work for him,
with the capital provided by commission from merchants and
robbers.</p>

<p>After a year's prosperity he was waylaid, losing his camel and
its consignment. They seized his shop in compensation. From the
wreck he saved enough to fit himself out as a man at arms, in the
Sherifian camel-police. Merit made him a petty officer, but too
much attention was drawn to his section by a habit of fighting with
daggers, and by his foul mouth; a maw of depravity which had eaten
filth in the stews of every capital in Arabia. Once too often his
lips trembled with humour, sardonic, salacious, lying; and when
reduced, he charged his downfall to a jealous Ateibi, whom he
stabbed in Court before the eyes of the outraged Sherif
Sharraf.</p>

<p>Sharraf's stern sense of public decency punished Abdulla by the
severest of his chastisements, from which he very nearly died. When
well enough, he entered Sharraf's service. On the outbreak of war
he became orderly to ibn Dakhil, captain of the Ageyl with Feisal.
His reputation grew: but the mutiny at Wejh turned ibn Dakhil into
an ambassador. Abdulla missed the comradeship of the ranks, and ibn
Dakhil had given him a written character to enter my service.</p>

<p>The letter said that for two years he had been faithful, but
disrespectful; the wont of sons of shame. He was the most
experienced Ageyli, having served every Arabian prince and having
been dismissed each employment, after stripes and prison, for
offences of too great individuality. Ibn Dakhil said that the
Nahabi rode second to himself, was a master-judge of camels, and as
brave as any son of Adam; easily, since he was too blind-eyed to
see danger. In fact, he was the perfect retainer, and I engaged him
instantly.</p>

<p>In my service only once did he taste cells. That was at
Allenby's headquarters, when a despairing provost-marshal rang up
to say that a wild man, with weapons, found sitting on the
Commander-in-Chief's doorstep, had been led without riot to the
guard-room, where he was eating oranges as though for a wager, and
proclaiming himself my son, one of Feisal's dogs. Oranges were
running short.</p>

<p>So Abdulla experienced his first telephone conversation. He told
the A.P.M. that such a fitting would be a comfort in all prisons,
and took a ceremonious leave. He scouted absolutely the notion that
he might walk about Ramleh unarmed, and was given a pass to make
lawful his sword, dagger, pistol, and rifle. His first use of this
pass was to re-visit the guard-room with cigarettes for the
military police.</p>

<p>He examined the applicants for my service, and, thanks to him
and to the Zaagi, my other commander (a stiff man of normal officer
cut), a wonderful gang of experts grew about me. The British at
Akaba called them cut-throats; but they cut throats only to my
order. Perhaps in others' eyes it was a fault that they would
recognize no authority but mine. Yet when I was away they were kind
to Major Marshall, and would hold him in incomprehensible talk
about points of camels, their breeds and ailments, from dawn till
night time. Marshall was very patient; and two or three of them
would sit attentive by his bedside, from the first daylight,
waiting to continue his education as soon as he became
conscious.</p>

<p>A good half (nearly fifty of the ninety) were Ageyl, the nervous
Umber Nejdi villagers who made the colour and the parade in
Feisal's army, and whose care for their riding-camels was such a
feature of their service. They would call them by name, from a
hundred yards away, and leave them in charge of the kit when they
dismounted. The Ageyl, being mercenaries, would not do well unless
well paid, and for lack of that condition had fallen into
disrepute: yet the bravest single effort of the Arab war belonged
to that one of them who twice swam down the subterranean
water-conduit into Medina, and returned with a full report of the
invested town.</p>

<p>I paid my men six pounds a month, the standard army wage for a
man and camel, but mounted them on my own animals, so that the
money was clear income: this made the service enviable, and put the
eager spirits of the camp at my disposal. For my time-table's sake,
since I was more busy than most, my rides were long, hard and
sudden. The ordinary Arab, whose camel represented half his wealth,
could not afford to founder it by travelling my speed: also such
riding was painful for the man.</p>

<p>Consequently, I had to have with me picked riders, on my own
beasts. We bought at long prices the fastest and strongest camels
to be obtained. We chose them for speed and power, no matter how
hard and exhausting they might be under the saddle: indeed, often
we chose the hard-paced as the more enduring. They were changed or
rested in our own camel-hospital when they became thin: and their
riders were treated likewise. The Zaagi held each man bodily
responsible for his mount's condition, and for the fitness of his
saddlery.</p>

<p>Fellows were very proud of being in my bodyguard, which
developed a professionalism almost flamboyant. They dressed like a
bed of tulips, in every colour but white; for that was my constant
wear, and they did not wish to seem to presume. In half an hour
they would make ready for a ride of six weeks, that being the limit
for which food could be carried at the saddle-bow. Baggage camels
they shrank from as a disgrace. They would travel day and night at
my whim, and made it a point of honour never to mention fatigue. If
a new man grumbled, the others would silence him, or change the
current of his complaint, brutally.</p>

<p>They fought like devils, when I wanted, and sometimes when I did
not, especially with Turks or with outsiders. For one guardsman to
strike another was the last offence. They expected extravagant
reward and extravagant punishment. They made boast throughout the
army of their pains and gains. By this unreason in each degree they
were kept apt for any effort, any risk.</p>

<p>Abdulla and the Zaagi ruled them, under my authority, with a
savagery palliated only by the power of each man to quit the
service if he wished. Yet we had but one resignation. The others,
though adolescents full of carnal passion, tempted by this
irregular life, well-fed, exercised, rich, seemed to sanctify their
risk, to be fascinated by their suffering. Servitude, like other
conduct, was profoundly modified to Eastern minds by their
obsession with the antithesis between flesh and spirit. These lads
took pleasure in subordination; in degrading the body: so as to
throw into greater relief their freedom in equality of mind: almost
they preferred servitude as richer in experience than authority,
and less binding in daily care.</p>

<p>Consequently the relation of master and man in Arabia was at
once more free and more subject than I had experienced elsewhere.
Servants were afraid of the sword of justice and of the steward's
whip, not because the one might put an arbitrary term to their
existence, and the other print red rivers of pain about their
sides, but because these were the symbols and the means to which
their obedience was vowed. They had a gladness of abasement, a
freedom of consent to yield to their master the last service and
degree of their flesh and blood, because their spirits were equal
with his and the contract voluntary. Such boundless engagement
precluded humiliation, repining and regret.</p>

<p>In this pledging of their endurance, it disgraced men if, from
weakness of nerve or insufficiency of courage, they fell short of
the call. Pain was to them a solvent, a cathartic, almost a
decoration, to be fairly worn while they survived it. Fear, the
strongest motive in slothful man, broke down with us, since love
for a cause&mdash;or for a person&mdash;was aroused. For such an
object, penalties were discounted, and loyalty became open-eyed,
not obedient. To it men dedicated their being, and in its
possession they had no room for virtue or vice. Cheerfully they
nourished it upon what they were; gave it their lives; and, greater
than that, the lives of their fellowship: it being many times
harder to offer than to endure sacrifice.</p>

<p>To our strained eyes, the ideal, held in common, seemed to
transcend the personal, which before had been our normal measure of
the world. Did this instinct point to our happily accepting final
absorption in some pattern wherein the discordant selves might find
reasonable, inevitable purpose? Yet this very transcending of
individual frailty made the ideal transient. Its principle became
Activity, the primal quality, external to our atomic structure,
which we could simulate only by unrest of mind and soul and body,
beyond holding point. So always the ideality of the ideal vanished,
leaving its worshippers exhausted: holding for false what they had
once pursued.</p>

<p>However, for the time the Arabs were possessed, and cruelty of
governance answered their need. Besides, they were blood enemies of
thirty tribes, and only for my hand over them would have murdered
in the ranks each day. Their feuds prevented them combining against
me; while their unlikeness gave me sponsors and spies wherever I
went or sent, between Akaba and Damascus, between Beersheba and
Bagdad. In my service nearly sixty of them died.</p>

<p>With quaint justice, events forced me to live up to my
bodyguard, to become as hard, as sudden, as heedless. The odds
against me were heavy, and the climate cogged the die. In the short
winter I outdid them, with my allies of the frost and snow: in the
heat they outdid me. In endurance there was less disparity. For
years before the war I had made myself trim by constant
carelessness. I had learned to eat much one time; then to go two,
three, or four days without food; and after to overeat. I made it a
rule to avoid rules in food; and by a course of exceptions
accustomed myself to no custom at all.</p>

<p>So, organically, I was efficient in the desert, felt neither
hunger nor surfeit, and was not distracted by thought of food. On
the march I could go dry between wells, and, like the Arabs, could
drink greatly to-day for the thirst of yesterday and of
to-morrow.</p>

<p>In the same way, though sleep remained for me the richest
pleasure in the world, I supplied its place by the uneasy swaying
in the saddle of a night-march, or failed of it for night after
laborious night without undue fatigue. Such liberties came from
years of control (contempt of use might well be the lesson of our
manhood), and they fitted me peculiarly for our work: but, of
course, in me they came half by training, half by trying, out of
mixed choice and poverty, not effortlessly, as with the Arabs. Yet
in compensation stood my energy of motive. Their less taut wills
flagged before mine flagged, and by comparison made me seem tough
and active.</p>

<p>Into the sources of my energy of will I dared not probe. The
conception of antithetical mind and matter, which was basic in the
Arab self-surrender, helped me not at all. I achieved surrender (so
far as I did achieve it) by the very opposite road, through my
notion that mental and physical were inseparably one: that our
bodies, the universe, our thoughts and tactilities were conceived
in and of the molecular sludge of matter, the universal element
through which form drifted as clots and patterns of varying
density. It seemed to me unthinkable that assemblages of atoms
should cogitate except in atomic terms. My perverse sense of values
constrained me to assume that abstract and concrete, as badges, did
not denote oppositions more serious than Liberal and Conservative.
The practice of our revolt fortified the nihilist attitude in me.
During it, we often saw men push themselves or be driven to a cruel
extreme of endurance: yet never was there an intimation of physical
break. Collapse rose always from a moral weakness eating into the
body, which of itself, without traitors from within, had no power
over the will. While we rode we were disbodied, unconscious of
flesh or feeling: and when at an interval this excitement faded and
we did see our bodies, it was with some hostility, with a
contemptuous sense that they reached their highest purpose, not as
vehicles of the spirit, but when, dissolved, their elements served
to manure a field.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXXIV</h3>

<p>Remote from the fighting line, in Akaba, during this pause, we
saw the reverse of the shield, the corruption of our enthusiasm,
which made the moral condition of the base unsatisfactory. We
rejoiced when at last we were able to escape into the clean, fresh
hills about Guweira. The early winter gave us days hot and sunny,
or days overcast, with clouds massed about the head of the plateau
nine miles away, where Maulud was keeping his watch in the mist and
rain. The evenings held just enough of chill to add delightful
value to a thick cloak and a fire.</p>

<p>We waited in Guweira for news of the opening of our operation
against Tafileh, the knot of villages commanding the south end of
the Dead Sea. We planned to tackle it from west, south, and east,
at once; the east opening the ball by attacking Jurf, its nearest
station on the Hejaz line. Conduct of this attack had been trusted
to Sherif Nasir, the Fortunate. With him went Nuri Said, Jaafar's
chief of staff, commanding some regulars, a gun, and some
machine-guns. They were working from Jefer. After three days their
post came in. As usual Nasir had directed his raid with skill and
deliberation. Jurf, the objective, was a strong station of three
stone buildings with outer-works and trenches. Behind the station
was a low mound, trenched and walled, on which the Turks had set
two machine-guns and a mountain gun. Beyond the mound lay a high,
sharp ridge, the last spur of the hills which divided Jefer from
Bair.</p>

<p>The weakness of the defence lay in this ridge, for the Turks
were too few to hold both it and the knoll or station, and its
crest overlooked the railway. Nasir one night occupied the whole
top of the hill without alarm, and then cut the line above and
below the station. A few minutes later, when it was light enough to
see, Nuri Said brought his mountain gun to the edge of the ridge;
and, with a third lucky shot, a direct hit, silenced the Turkish
gun beneath his view.</p>

<p>Nasir grew greatly excited: the Beni Sakhr mounted their camels,
swearing they would charge in forthwith. Nuri thought it madness
while Turkish machine-guns were still in action from trenches: but
his words had no effect upon the Bedu. In desperation he opened a
rattling fire with all he had against the Turkish position, and the
Beni Sakhr swept round the foot of the main ridge and up over the
knoll in a flash. When they saw this camel-horde racing at them,
the Turks flung away their rifles and fled into the station. Only
two Arabs were fatally hurt.</p>

<p>Nuri ran down to the knoll. The Turkish gun was undamaged. He
slewed it round and discharged it point blank into the ticket
office. The Beni Sakhr mob yelled with joy to see the wood and
stones flying, jumped again on their camels and loped into the
station just as the enemy surrendered. Nearly two hundred Turks,
including seven officers, survived as our prisoners.</p>

<p>The Bedu became rich: besides the weapons, there were
twenty-five mules, and in the siding seven trucks of delicacies for
the officers' messes of Medina. There were things the tribesmen had
only heard of, and things they had never heard of: they were
supremely happy. Even the unfortunate regulars got a share, and
were able once more to enjoy olives, sesame paste, dried apricot,
and other sweet or pickled products of their native,
half-forgotten, Syria.</p>

<p>Nuri Said had artificial tastes, and rescued tinned meats and
liquors from the wilder men. There was one whole truck of tobacco.
As the Howeitat did not smoke, it was divided between the Beni
Sakhr and the regulars. By its loss the Medina garrison became
tobacco-less: their sad plight later so worked on Feisal, a
confirmed smoker, that he loaded some pack-camels with cheap
cigarettes and drove them into Tebuk with his compliments.</p>

<p>After the looting, the engineers fired charges under the two
engines, against the water-tower, in the pump, and between the
points of the sidings. They burned the captured trucks and damaged
a bridge; but perfunctorily, for, as usual after victory, everyone
was too loaded and too hot to care for altruistic labour. They
camped behind the station, and about midnight had an alarm, when
the noise and lights of a train came from the south and halted,
clearly with foreknowledge, by the break of the evening before.
Auda sent scouts to report.</p>

<p>Before they had returned a solitary sergeant walked into Nasir's
camp as a volunteer for the Sherif's army. He had been sent out by
the Turks to explore the station. His story was that there were
only sixty men and a mountain gun on the relief train, which, if he
went back with smooth news, might be surprised without a shot
fired. Nasir called Auda, who called the Howeitat, and they went
off silently to lay the trap: but just before they got there our
scouts decided to do their unaided best, and opened fire against
the coaches. In fear, the engine reversed, and rolled the train
back, unhurt, to Maan. It was the only sorrow of Jurf.</p>

<p>After this raid the weather once more broke. For three
successive days came falls of snow. Nasir's force with difficulty
regained the tents at Jefer. This plateau about Maan lay between
three and five thousand feet above sea level, open to all winds
from north and east. They blew from Central Asia, or from Caucasus,
terribly over the great desert to these low hills of Edom, against
which their first fury broke. The surplus bitterness lipped the
crest and made a winter, quite severe of its degree, below in
Judaea and Sinai.</p>

<p>Outside Beersheba and Jerusalem the British found it cold; but
our Arabs fled there to get warm. Unhappily the British supply
staff realized too late that we were fighting in a little Alp. They
would not give us tents for one-quarter of our troops, nor serge
clothing, nor boots, nor blankets enough to issue two to each man
of the mountain garrisons. Our soldiers, if they neither deserted
nor died, existed in an aching misery which froze the hope out of
them.</p>

<p>According to our plan the good news of Jurf was to send the
Arabs of Petra, under Sherif Abd el Mayin, at once up their hills
into the forest towards Shobek. It was an uncanny march in the hoar
mist, that of these frozen-footed peasants in their sheepskins, up
and down sharp valleys and dangerous hill-sides, out of whose
snowdrifts the heavy trunks of junipers, grudging in leaves, jutted
like castings in grey iron. The ice and frost broke down the
animals, and many of the men; yet these hardy highlanders, used to
being too cold throughout their winter, persisted in the
advance.</p>

<p>The Turks heard of them as they struggled slowly nearer, and
fled from the caves and shelters among the trees to the branch
railhead, littering the roads of their panic with cast baggage and
equipment.</p>

<p>Railhead of the forest railway, with its temporary sheds, was
commanded from low ridges by the Arab gun-fire, and no better than
a trap. The tribesmen, in a pack, tore the enemy to pieces as they
ran out from their burning and falling walls. One disciplined
company of proper troops, under an Albanian officer, fought their
way to the main line; but the Arabs killed or took the others, and
also the stores in Shobek, the old Crusader fort of Monreale,
poised high on a chalk cone above its winding valley. Abd el Mayein
put his headquarters there, and sent word to Nasir. Mastur, too,
was told. He drew his Motalga horse and foot from the comfort of
their tents in the sunny depths of Arabia and with them climbed the
hill-pass eastward towards Tafileh.</p>

<p>However, the advantage lay with Nasir, who leaped in one day
from Jefer, and after a whirlwind night appeared at dawn on the
rocky brink of the ravine in which Tafileh hid, and summoned it to
surrender on pain of bombardment: an idle threat, for Nuri Said
with the guns had gone back to Guweira. There were only one hundred
and eighty Turks in the village, but they had supporters in the
Muhaisin, a clan of the peasantry; not for love so much as because
Dhiab, the vulgar head-man of another faction, had declared for
Feisal. So they shot up at Nasir a stream of ill-directed
bullets.</p>

<p>The Howeitat spread out along the cliffs to return the peasants'
fire. This manner of going displeased Auda, the old lion, who raged
that a mercenary village folk should dare to resist their secular
masters, the Abu Tayi. So he jerked his halter, cantered his mare
down the path, and rode out plain to view beneath the easternmost
houses of the village. There he reined in, and shook a hand at
them, booming in his wonderful voice: 'Dogs, do you not know Auda?'
When they realized it was that implacable son of war their hearts
failed them, and an hour later Sherif Nasir in the town-house was
sipping tea with his guest the Turkish Governor, trying to console
him for the sudden change of fortune.</p>

<p>At dark Mastur rode in. His Motalga looked blackly at their
blood enemies the Abu Tayi, lolling in the best houses. The two
Sherifs divided up the place, to keep their unruly followers apart.
They had little authority to mediate, for by passage of time Nasir
was nearly adopted into the Abu Tayi, and Mastur into the Jazi.</p>

<p>When morning came the factions were bickering; and the day
passed anxiously; for besides these blood enemies, the Muhaisin
were fighting for authority among the villagers, and further
complications developed in two stranger elements: one a colony of
free-booting Senussi from North Africa, who had been intruded by
the Turks into some rich, but half-derelict plough-land; the other
a plaiative and active suburb of a thousand Armenians, survivors of
an infamous deportation by the Young Turks in 1915.</p>

<p>The people of Tafileh went in deadly fear of the future. We
were, as usual, short of food and short of transport, and they
would remedy neither ill. They had wheat or barley in their bins;
but hid it. They had pack-animals, asses and mules in abundance;
but drove them away for safety. They could have driven us away too,
but were, fortunately for us, short of the sticking point.
Incuriousness was the most potent ally of our imposed order; for
Eastern government rested not so much on consent or force, as on
the common supinity, hebetude, lack-a-daisiness, which gave a
minority undue effect.</p>

<p>Feisal had delegated command of this push towards the Dead Sea
to his young half-brother Zeid. It was Zeid's first office in the
north, and he set out eager with hope. As adviser he had Jaafar
Pasha, our general. His infantry, gunners and machine-gunners
stuck, for lack of food, at Petra; but Zeid himself and Jaafar rode
on to Tafileh.</p>

<p>Things were almost at a break. Auda affected a magnanimity very
galling to the Motalga boys, Metaab and Annad, sons of Abtan, whom
Auda's son had killed. They, lithe, definite, self-conscious
figures, began to talk big about revenge-torn-tits threatening a
hawk. Auda declared he would whip them in the market-place if they
were rude. This was very well, but their followers were two to
every man of his, and we should have the village in a blaze. The
young fellows, with Rahail, my ruffler, went flaunting in every
street.</p>

<p>Zeid thanked and paid Auda and sent him back to his desert. The
enlightened heads of the Muhaisin had to go as forced guests to
Feisal's tent. Dhiab, their enemy, was our friend: we remembered
regretfully the adage that the best allies of a
violently-successful new regime were not its partisans, but its
opponents. By Zeid's plenty of gold the economic situation
improved. We appointed an officer-governor and organized our five
villages for further attack.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXXV</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding, these plans quickly went adrift. Before they
had been agreed upon we were astonished by a sudden try of the
Turks to dislodge us. We had never dreamed of this, for it seemed
out of the question that they should hope to keep Tafileh, or want
to keep it. Allenby was just in Jerusalem, and for the Turks the
issue of the war might depend on their successful defence of the
Jordan against him. Unless Jericho fell, or until it fell, Tafileh
was an obscure village of no interest. Nor did we value it as a
possession; our desire was to get past it towards the enemy. For
men so critically placed as the Turks to waste one single casualty
on its recapture appeared the rankest folly.</p>

<p>Hamid Fakhri Pasha, commanding the 48th Division and the Amman
sector, thought otherwise, or had his orders. He collected about
nine hundred infantry, made up of three battalions (in January 1918
a Turkish battalion was a poor thing) with a hundred cavalry, two
mountain howitzers, and twenty-seven machine-guns, and sent them by
rail and road to Kerak. There he impressed all the local transport,
drew a complete set of civil officials to staff his new
administration in Tafileh, and marched southward to surprise
us.</p>

<p>Surprise us he did. We first heard of him when his cavalry
feelers fell on our pickets in Wadi Hesa, the gorge of great width
and depth and difficulty which cut off Kerak from Tafileh, Moab
from Edom. By dusk he had driven them back, and was upon us.</p>

<p>Jaafar Pasha had sketched a defence position on the south bank
of the great ravine of Tafileh; proposing, if the Turks attacked,
to give them the village, and defend the heights which overhung it,
behind. This seemed to me doubly unsound. The slopes were dead, and
their defence as difficult as their attack. They could be turned
from the east; and by quitting the village we threw away the local
people, whose votes and hands would be for the occupiers of their
houses.</p>

<p>However, it was the ruling idea&mdash;all Zeid had&mdash;and so
about midnight he gave the order, and servants and retainers loaded
up their stuff. The men-at-arms proceeded to the southern crest,
while the baggage train was sent off by the lower road to safety.
This move created panic in the town. The peasants thought we were
running away (I think we were) and rushed to save their goods and
lives. It was freezing hard, and the ground was crusted with noisy
ice. In the blustering dark the confusion and crying through the
narrow streets were terrible.</p>

<p>Dhiab the Sheikh had told us harrowing tales of the disaffection
of the townspeople, to increase the splendour of his own loyalty;
but my impression was that they were stout fellows of great
potential use. To prove it I sat out on my roof, or walked in the
dark up and down the steep alleys, cloaked against recognition,
with my guards unobtrusively about me within call. So we heard what
passed. The people were in a very passion of fear, nearly
dangerous, abusing everybody and everything: but there was nothing
pro-Turkish abroad. They were in horror of the Turks returning,
ready to do all in their physical capacity to support against them
a leader with fighting intention. This was satisfactory, for it
chimed with my hankering to stand where we were and fight
stiffly.</p>

<p>Finally, I met the young Jazi sheikhs Metaab and Annad,
beautiful in silks and gleaming silver arms, and sent them to find
their uncle, Hamd el Arar. Him I asked to ride away north of the
ravine, to tell the peasantry, who, by the noise, were still
fighting the Turks, that we were on our way up to help them. Hamd,
a melancholy, courtly, gallant cavalier, galloped off at once with
twenty of his relations, all that he could gather in the distracted
moment.</p>

<p>Their passage at speed through the streets added the last touch
required to perfect the terror. The housewives bundled their goods
pell-mell out of doors and windows, though no men were waiting to
receive them. Children were trampled on, and yelled, while their
mothers were yelling anyhow. The Motalga during their gallop fired
shot after shot into the air to encourage themselves, and, as
though to answer them, the flashes of the enemy rifles became
visible, outlining the northern cliffs in that last blackness of
sky before the dawn. I walked up the opposite heights to consult
with Sherif Zeid.</p>

<p>Zeid sat gravely on a rock, sweeping the country with
field-glasses for the enemy. As crises deepened, Zeid drew
detached, nonchalant. I was in a furious rage. The Turks should
never, by the rules of sane generalship, have ventured back to
Tafileh at all. It was simple greed, a dog-in-the-manger attitude
unworthy of a serious enemy, just the sort of hopeless thing a Turk
would do. How could they expect a proper war when they gave us no
chance to honour them? Our morale was continually being ruined by
their follies, for neither could our men respect their courage, nor
our officers respect their brains. Also, it was an icy morning, and
I had been up all night and was Teutonic enough to decide that they
should pay for my changed mind and plan.</p>

<p>They must be few in number, judging by their speed of advance.
We had every advantage, of time, of terrain, of number, of weather,
and could checkmate them easily: but to my wrath that was not
enough. We would play their kind of game on our pigmy scale;
deliver them a pitched battle such as they wanted; kill them all. I
would rake up my memory of the half-forgotten maxims of the
orthodox army text-book, and parody them in action.</p>

<p>This was villainous, for with arithmetic and geography for
allies we might have spared the suffering factor of humanity; and
to make a conscious joke of victory was wanton. We could have won
by refusing battle, foxed them by manoeuvring our centre as on
twenty such occasions before and since: yet bad temper and conceit
united for this time to make me not content to know my power, but
determined to give public advertisement of it to the enemy and to
everyone. Zeid, now convinced of the inconvenience of the
defence-line, was very ready to listen to the voice of the
tempter.</p>

<p>First I suggested that Abdulla go forward with two Hotchkiss
guns to test the strength and disposition of the enemy. Then we
talked of what next; very usefully, for Zeid was a cool and gallant
little fighter, with the temperament of a professional officer. We
saw Abdulla climb the other bank. The shooting became intense for a
time, and then faded into distance. His coming had stimulated the
Motalga horsemen and the villagers, who fell on the Turkish cavalry
and drove them over a first ridge, across a plain two miles wide,
and over a ridge beyond it down the first step of the great Hesa
depression.</p>

<p>Behind this lay the Turkish main body, just getting on the road
again after a severe night which had stiffened them in their
places. They came properly into action, and Abdulla was checked at
once. We heard the distant rolling of machine-gun fire, growing up
in huge bursts, laced by a desultory shelling. Our ears told us
what was happening as well as if we saw it, and the news was
excellent. I wanted Zeid to come forward at once on that authority:
but his caution stepped in and he insisted that we wait exact word
from his advance-guard, Abdulla.</p>

<p>This was not necessary, according to book, but they knew I was a
sham soldier, and took licence to hesitate over my advice when it
came peremptorily. However, I held a hand worth two of that and
went off myself for the front to prejudge their decision. On the
way I saw my bodyguard, turning over the goods exposed for removal
in the streets, and finding much of interest to themselves. I told
them to recover our camels and to bring their Hotchkiss automatic
to the north bank of the gorge in a hurry.</p>

<p>The road dipped into a grove of fig-trees, knots of blue snaky
boughs; bare, as they would be long after the rest of nature was
grown green. Thence it turned eastward, to wind lengthily in the
valley to the crest. I left it, climbing straight up the cliffs. An
advantage of going barefoot was a new and incredible sureness upon
rock when the soles had got hard by painful insistence, or were too
chilled to feel jags and scrapes. The new way, while warming me,
also shortened my time appreciably, and very soon, at the top, I
found a level bit, and then a last ridge overlooking the
plateau.</p>

<p>This last straight bank, with Byzantine foundations in it,
seemed very proper for a reserve or ultimate line of defence for
Tafileh. To be sure, we had no reserve as yet&mdash;no one had the
least notion who or what we would have anywhere&mdash;but, if we
did have anybody, here was their place: and at that precise moment
Zeid's personal Ageyl became visible, hiding coyly in a hollow. To
make them move required words of a strength to unravel their
plaited hair: but at last I had them sitting along the skyline of
Reserve Ridge. They were about twenty, and from a distance looked
beautiful, like 'points' of a considerable army. I gave them my
signet as a token, with orders to collect there all new comers,
especially my fellows with their gun.</p>

<p>As I walked northward towards the fighting, Abdulla met me, on
his way to Zeid with news. He had finished his ammunition, lost
five men from shell-fire, and had one automatic gun destroyed. Two
guns, he thought the Turks had. His idea was to get up Zeid with
all his men and fight: so nothing remained for me to add to his
message; and there was no subtlety in leaving alone my happy
masters to cross and dot their own right decision.</p>

<p>He gave me leisure in which to study the coming battlefield. The
tiny plain was about two miles across, bounded by low green ridges,
and roughly triangular, with my reserve ridge as base. Through it
ran the road to Kerak, dipping into the Hesa valley. The Turks were
fighting their way up this road. Abdulla's charge had taken the
western or left-hand ridge, which was now our firing-line.</p>

<p>Shells were falling in the plain as I walked across it, with
harsh stalks of wormwood stabbing into my wounded feet. The enemy
fusing was too long, so that the shells grazed the ridge and burst
away behind. One fell near me, and I learned its calibre from the
hot cap. As I went they began to shorten range, and by the time I
got to the ridge it was being freely sprinkled with shrapnel.
Obviously the Turks had got observation somehow, and looking round
I saw them climbing along the eastern side beyond the gap of the
Kerak road. They would soon outflank us at our end of the western
ridge.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXXVI</h3>

<p>'Us' proved to be about sixty men, clustered behind the ridge in
two bunches, one near the bottom, one by the top. The lower was
made up of peasants, on foot, blown, miserable, and yet the only
warm things I had seen that day. They said their ammunition was
finished, and it was all over. I assured them it was just beginning
and pointed to my populous reserve ridge, saying that all arms were
there in support. I told them to hurry back, refill their belts and
hold on to it for good. Meanwhile we would cover their retreat by
sticking here for the few minutes yet possible.</p>

<p>They ran off, cheered, and I walked about among the upper group
quoting how one should not quit firing from one position till ready
to fire from the next. In command was young Metaab, stripped to his
skimp riding-drawers for hard work, with his black love-curls awry,
his face stained and haggard. He was beating his hands together and
crying hoarsely with baffled vexation, for he had meant to do so
well in this, his first fight for us.</p>

<p>My presence at the last moment, when the Turks were breaking
through, was bitter; and he got angrier when I said that I only
wanted to study the landscape. He thought it flippancy, and
screamed something about a Christian going into battle unarmed. I
retorted with a quip from Clausewitz, about a rearguard effecting
its purpose more by being than by doing: but he was past laughter,
and perhaps with justice, for the little flinty bank behind which
we sheltered was crackling with fire. The Turks, knowing we were
there, had turned twenty machine-guns upon it. It was four feet
high and fifty feet long, of bare flinty ribs, off which the
bullets slapped deafeningly: while the air above so hummed or
whistled with ricochets and chips that it felt like death to look
over. Clearly we must leave very soon, and as I had no horse I went
off first, with Metaab's promise that he would wait where he was if
he dared, for another ten minutes.</p>

<p>The run warmed me. I counted my paces, to help in ranging the
Turks when they ousted us; since there was only that one position
for them, and it was poorly protected against the south. In losing
this Motalga ridge we would probably win the battle. The horsemen
held on for almost their ten minutes, and then galloped off without
hurt. Metaab lent me his stirrup to hurry me along, till we found
ourselves breathless among the Ageyl. It was just noon, and we had
leisure and quiet in which to think.</p>

<p>Our new ridge was about forty feet up, and a nice shape for
defence. We had eighty men on it, and more were constantly
arriving. My guards were in place with their gun; Lutfi, an
engine-destroyer, rushed up hotly with his two, and after him came
another hundred Ageyl. The thing was becoming a picnic, and by
saying 'excellent' and looking overjoyed, we puzzled the men, and
made them consider the position dispassionately. The automatics
were put on the skyline, with orders to fire occasional shots,
short, to disturb the Turks a little, but not too much, after the
expedient of Massena in delaying enemy deployment. Otherwise a lull
fell; I lay down in a sheltered place which caught a little sun,
and no wind, and slept a blessed hour, while the Turks occupied the
old ridge, extending over it like a school of geese, and about as
wisely. Our men left them alone, being contented with a free
exhibition of themselves.</p>

<p>In the middle of the afternoon Zeid arrived, with Mastur, Rasim
and Abdulla. They brought our main body, comprising twenty mounted
infantry on mules, thirty Motalga horsemen, two hundred villagers,
five automatic rifles, four machine-guns and the Egyptian Army
mountain gun which had fought about Medina, Petra and Jurf. This
was magnificent, and I woke up to welcome them.</p>

<p>The Turks saw us crowding, and opened with shrapnel and
machine-gun fire: but they had not the range and fumbled it. We
reminded one another that movement was the law of strategy, and
started moving. Rasim became a cavalry officer, and mounted with
all our eighty riders of animals to make a circuit about the
eastern ridge and envelop the enemy's left wing, since the books
advised attack not upon a line, but upon a point, and by going far
enough along any finite wing it would be found eventually reduced
to a point of one single man. Rasim liked this, my conception of
his target.</p>

<p>He promised, grinningly, to bring us that last man: but Hamd el
Arar took the occasion more fittingly. Before riding off he devoted
himself to the death for the Arab cause, drew his sword
ceremoniously, and made to it, by name, a heroic speech. Rasim took
five automatic guns with him; which was good.</p>

<p>We in the centre paraded about, so that their departure might be
unseen of the enemy, who were bringing up an apparently endless
procession of machine-guns and dressing them by the left at
intervals along the ridge, as though in a museum. It was lunatic
tactics. The ridge was flint, without cover for a lizard. We had
seen how, when a bullet struck the ground, it and the ground
spattered up in a shower of deadly chips. Also we knew the range,
and elevated our Vickers guns carefully, blessing their long,
old-fashioned sights; our mountain gun was propped into place ready
to let go a sudden burst of shrapnel over the enemy when Rasim was
at grips.</p>

<p>As we waited, a reinforcement was announced of one hundred men
from Aima. They had fallen out with Zeid over war-wages the day
previous, but had grandly decided to sink old scores in the crisis.
Their arrival convinced us to abandon Marshal Foch and to attack
from, at any rate, three sides at once. So we sent the Aima men,
with three automatic guns, to outflank the right, or western wing.
Then we opened against the Turks from our central position, and
bothered their exposed lines with hits and ricochets.</p>

<p>The enemy felt the day no longer favourable. It was passing, and
sunset often gave victory to defenders yet in place. Old General
Hamid Fakhri collected his Staff and Headquarters, and told each
man to take a rifle. 'I have been forty years a soldier, but never
saw I rebels fight like these. Enter the ranks'...but he was too
late. Rasim pushed forward an attack of his five automatic guns,
each with its two-man crew. They went in rapidly, unseen till they
were in position, and crumpled the Turkish left.</p>

<p>The Aima men, who knew every blade of grass on these, their own
village pastures, crept, unharmed, within three hundred yards of
the Turkish machine-guns. The enemy, held by our frontal threat,
first knew of the Aima men when they, by a sudden burst of fire,
wiped out the gun-teams and flung the right wing into disorder. We
saw it, and cried advance to the camel men and levies about us.</p>

<p>Mohamed el Ghasib, comptroller of Zeyd's household, led them on
his camel, in shining wind-billowed robes, with the crimson banner
of the Ageyl over his head. All who had remained in the centre with
us, our servants, gunners and machine-gunners, rushed after him in
a wide, vivid line.</p>

<p>The day had been too long for me, and I was now only shaking
with desire to see the end: but Zeid beside me clapped his hands
with joy at the beautiful order of our plan unrolling in the frosty
redness of the setting sun. On the one hand Rasim's cavalry were
sweeping a broken left wing into the pit beyond the ridge: on the
other the men of Aima were bloodily cutting down fugitives. The
enemy centre was pouring back in disorder through the gap, with our
men after them on foot, on horse, on camel. The Armenians,
crouching behind us all day anxiously, now drew their knives and
howled to one another in Turkish as they leaped forward.</p>

<p>I thought of the depths between here and Kerak, the ravine of
Hesa, with its broken, precipitous paths, the undergrowth, the
narrows and defiles of the way. It was going to be a massacre and I
should have been crying-sorry for the enemy; but after the angers
and exertions of the battle my mind was too tired to care to go
down into that awful place and spend the night saving them. By my
decision to fight, I had killed twenty or thirty of our six hundred
men, and the wounded would be perhaps three times as many. It was
one-sixth of our force gone on a verbal triumph, for the
destruction of this thousand poor Turks would not affect the issue
of the war.</p>

<p>In the end we had taken their two mountain howitzers (Skoda
guns, very useful to us), twenty-seven machine-guns, two hundred
horses and mules, two hundred and fifty prisoners. Men said only
fifty got back, exhausted fugitives, to the railway. The Arabs on
their track rose against them and shot them ignobly as they ran.
Our own men gave up the pursuit quickly, for they were tired and
sore and hungry, and it was pitifully cold. A battle might be
thrilling at the moment for generals, but usually their imagination
played too vividly beforehand, and made the reality seem sham; so
quiet and unimportant that they ranged about looking for its
fancied core.</p>

<p>This evening there was no glory left, but the terror of the
broken flesh, which had been our own men, carried past us to their
homes.</p>

<p>As we turned back it began to snow; and only very late, and by a
last effort did we get our hurt men in. The Turkish wounded lay
out, and were dead next day. It was indefensible, as was the whole
theory of war: but no special reproach lay on us for it. We risked
our lives in the blizzard (the chill of victory bowing us down) to
save our own fellows; and if our rule was not to lose Arabs to kill
even many Turks, still less might we lose them to save Turks.</p>

<p>Next day and the next it snowed yet harder. We were
weatherbound, and as the days passed in monotony we lost the hope
of doing. We should have pushed past Kerak on the heels of victory,
frighting the Turks to Amman with our rumour: as it was, nothing
came of all the loss and effort, except a report which I sent over
to the British headquarters in Palestine for the Staffs
consumption. It was meanly written for effect, full of quaint
smiles and mock simplicities; and made them think me a modest
amateur, doing his best after the great models; not a clown,
leering after them where they with Foch, bandmaster, at their head
went drumming down the old road of effusion of blood into the house
of Clausewitz. Like the battle, it was a nearly-proof parody of
regulation use. Headquarters loved it, and innocently, to crown the
jest, offered me a decoration on the strength of it. We should have
more bright breasts in the Army if each man was able without
witnesses, to write out his own despatch.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXXVII</h3>

<p>Hesa's sole profit lay, then, in its lesson to myself. Never
again were we combative, whether in jest, or betting on a
certainty. Indeed, only three days later, our honour was partially
redeemed by a good and serious thing we arranged through Abdulla el
Feir, who was camped beneath us in the paradise of the Dead Sea's
southern shore, a plain gushing with brooks of sweet water, and
rich in vegetation. We sent him news of victory, with a project to
raid the lake-port of Kerak and destroy the Turks' flotilla.</p>

<p>He chose out some seventy horsemen, of the Beersheba Beduin.
They rode in the night along the shelf of track between the hills
of Moab and the Sea's brim as far as the Turkish post; and in the
first greyness, when their eyes could reach far enough for a
gallop, they burst out of their undergrowth upon motor launch and
sailing lighters, harboured in the northern bight, with the
unsuspecting crews sleeping on the beach or in the reed-huts near
by.</p>

<p>They were from the Turkish Navy, not prepared for land fighting,
still less for receiving cavalry: they were awakened only by the
drumming of our horses' hooves in the headlong charge: and the
engagement ended at the moment. The huts were burned, the stores
looted, the shipping taken out to deep sea and scuttled. Then,
without a casualty, and with their sixty prisoners, our men rode
back praising themselves. January the twenty-eighth; and we had
attained our second objective&mdash;the stopping of Dead Sea
traffic&mdash;a fortnight sooner than we had promised Allenby.</p>

<p>The third objective had been the Jordan mouth by Jericho, before
the end of March; and it would have been a fair prospect, but for
the paralysis which weather and distaste for pain had brought upon
us since the red day of Hesa. Conditions in Tafileh were mended.
Feisal had sent us ammunition and food. Prices fell, as men grew to
trust our strength. The tribes about Kerak, in daily touch with
Zeid, purposed to join him in arms so soon as he moved forward.</p>

<p>Just this, however, we could not do. The winter's potency drove
leaders and men into the village and huddled them in a lack-lustre
idleness against which counsels of movement availed little. Indeed,
Reason, also, was within doors. Twice I ventured up to taste the
snow-laden plateau, upon whose even face the Turkish dead, poor
brown pats of stiffened clothes, were littered: but life there was
not tolerable. In the day it thawed a little and in the night it
froze. The wind cut open the skin: fingers lost power, and sense of
feel: cheeks shivered like dead leaves till they could shiver no
more, and then bound up their muscles in a witless ache.</p>

<p>To launch out across the snow on camels, beasts singularly inept
on slippery ground, would be to put ourselves in the power of
however few horsemen wished to oppose us; and, as the days dragged
on, even this last possibility was withdrawn. Barley ran short in
Tafileh, and our camels, already cut off by the weather from
natural grazing, were now also cut off from artificial food. We had
to drive them down into the happier Ghor, a day's journey from our
vital garrison.</p>

<p>Though so far by the devious road, yet in direct distance the
Ghor lay little more than six miles away, and in full sight, five
thousand feet below. Salt was rubbed into our miseries by the
spectacle of that near winter garden beneath us by the lake-side.
We were penned in verminous houses of cold stone; lacking fuel,
lacking food; stormbound in streets like sewers, amid blizzards of
sleet and an icy wind: while there in the valley was sunshine upon
spring grass, deep with flowers, upon flocks in milk and air so
warm that men went uncloaked.</p>

<p>My private party were more fortunate than most, as the Zaagi had
found us an empty unfinished house, of two sound rooms and a court.
My money provided fuel, and even grain for our camels, which we
kept sheltered in a corner of the yard, where Abdulla, the animal
lover, could curry them and teach every one by name to take a gift
of bread, like a kiss, from his mouth, gently, with her loose lips,
when he called her. Still, they were unhappy days, since to have a
fire was to be stifled with green smoke, and in the window-spaces
were only makeshift shutters of our own joinery. The mud roof
dripped water all the day long, and the fleas on the stone floor
sang together nightly, for praise of the new meats given them. We
were twenty-eight in the two tiny rooms, which reeked with the sour
smell of our crowd.</p>

<p>In my saddle-bags was a <i>Morte D'Arthur</i>. It relieved my
disgust. The men had only physical resources; and in the confined
misery their tempers roughened. Their oddnesses, which ordinary
time packed with a saving film of distance, now jostled me angrily;
while a grazed wound in my hip had frozen, and irritated me with
painful throbbing. Day by day, the tension among us grew, as our
state became more sordid, more animal.</p>

<p>At last Awad, the wild Sherari, quarrelled with little Mahmas;
and in a moment their daggers clashed. The rest nipped the tragedy,
so that there was only a slight wounding: but it broke the greatest
law of the bodyguard, and as both example and guilt were blatant,
the others went packing into the far room while their chiefs
forthwith executed sentence. However, the Zaagi's shrill
whip-strokes were too cruel for my taught imagination, and I
stopped him before he was well warmed. Awad, who had lain through
his punishment without complaint, at this release levered himself
slowly to his knees and with bent legs and swaying head staggered
away to his sleeping-place.</p>

<p>It was then the turn of the waiting Mahmas, a tight-lipped youth
with pointed chin and pointed forehead, whose beady eyes dropped at
the inner corners with an indescribable air of impatience. He was
not properly of my guard, but a camel-driver; for his capacity fell
far below his sense of it, and a constantly-hurt pride made him
sudden and fatal in companionship. If worsted in argument, or
laughed at, he would lean forward with his always handy little
dagger and rip up his friend. Now he shrank into a corner showing
his teeth, vowing, across his tears, to be through those who hurt
him. Arabs did not dissect endurance, their crown of manhood, into
material and moral, making allowance for nerves. So Mabmas' crying
was called fear, and when loosed, he crept out disgraced into the
night to hide.</p>

<p>I was sorry for Awad: his hardness put me to shame. Especially I
was ashamed when, next dawn, I heard a limping step in the yard,
and saw him attempting to do his proper duty by the camels. I
called him in to give him an embroidered head-cloth as reward for
faithful service. He came pitiably sullen, with a shrinking, mobile
readiness for more punishment: my changed manner broke him down. By
afternoon he was singing and shouting, happier than ever, as he had
found a fool in Tafileh to pay him four pounds for my silken
gift.</p>

<p>Such nervous sharpening ourselves on each other's faults was so
revolting that I decided to scatter the party, and to go off myself
in search of the extra money we should need when fine weather came.
Zeid had spent the first part of the sum set aside for Tafileh and
the Dead Sea; partly on wages, partly on supplies and in rewards to
the victors of Seil Hesa. Wherever we next put our front line, we
should have to enlist and pay fresh forces, for only local men knew
the qualities of their ground instinctively; and they fought best,
defending their homes and crops against the enemy.</p>

<p>Joyce might have arranged to send me money: but not easily in
this season. It was surer to go down myself: and more virtuous than
continued fetor and promiscuity in Tafileh. So five of us started
off on a day which promised to be a little more open than usual. We
made good time to Reshidiya and as we climbed the saddle beyond,
found ourselves momentarily above the clouds in a faint
sunshine.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the weather drew down again and the wind
hardened from the north and east, and made us sorry to be out on
the bare plain. When we had forded the running river of Shobek,
rain began to fall, first in wild gusts, but then more steadily,
reeding down over our left shoulders and seeming to cloak us from
the main bleakness of wind. Where the rain-streaks hit the ground
they furred out whitely like a spray. We pushed on without halting
and till long after sunset urged our trembling camels, with many
slips, and falls across the greasy valleys. We made nearly two
miles an hour, despite our difficulties; and progress was become so
exciting and unexpected that its mere exercise kept us warm.</p>

<p>It had been my intention to ride all night: but, near Odroh,
mist came down about us in a low ring curtain, over which the
clouds, like tatters of a veil, spun and danced high up across the
calmness of the sky. The perspective seemed to change, so that far
hills looked small, and near hillocks great. We bore too much to
the right.</p>

<p>This open country, though appearing hard, broke rottenly beneath
their weight and let our camels in, four or five inches deep, at
every stride. The poor beasts had been chilled all day, and had
bumped down so often that they were stiff with bruises.
Consequently, they made unwilling work of the new difficulties.
They hurried for a few steps, stopped abruptly, looked round, or
tried to dart off sideways.</p>

<p>We prevented their wishes, and drove them forward till our blind
way met rocky valleys, with a broken skyline; dark to right and
left, and in front apparent hills where no hills should be. It
froze again, and the slabby stones of the valley became iced. To
push farther, on the wrong road, through such a night was folly. We
found a larger outcrop of rock. Behind it, where there should have
been shelter, we couched our camels in a compact group, tails to
wind: facing it, they might die of cold. We snuggled down beside
them, hoping for warmth and sleep.</p>

<p>The warmth I, at least, never got, and hardly the sleep. I dozed
once only to wake with a start when slow fingers seemed to stroke
my face. I stared out into a night livid with large, soft
snowflakes. They lasted a minute or two; but then followed rain,
and after it more frost, while I squatted in a tight ball, aching
every way but too miserable to move, till dawn. It was a hesitant
dawn, but enough: I rolled over in the mud to see my men, knotted
in their cloaks, cowering abandoned against the beasts' flanks. On
each man's face weighed the most dolorous expression of resigned
despair.</p>

<p>They were four southerners, whom fear of the winter had turned
ill at Tafileh, and who were going to rest in Guweira till it was
warm again: but here in the mist they had made up their minds, like
he-camels, that death was upon them: and, though they were too
proud to grumble at it, they were not above showing me silently
that this which they made for my sake was a sacrifice. They did not
speak or move in reply to me. Under a flung camel it was best to
light a slow fire, to raise it: but I took the smallest of these
dummies by the head-curls, and proved to him that he was still
capable of feeling. The others got to their feet, and we kicked up
the stiff camels. Our only loss was a water-skin, frozen to the
ground.</p>

<p>With daylight the horizon had grown very close, and we saw that
our proper road was a quarter of a mile to our left. Along it we
struggled afoot. The camels were too done to carry our weight (all
but my own died later of this march) and it was so muddy in the
clay bottoms that we ourselves slid and fell like them. However,
the Deraa trick helped, of spreading wide the toes and hooking them
downward into the mud at each stride: and by this means, in a
group, clutching and holding one another, we maintained
progress.</p>

<p>The air seemed cold enough to freeze anything, but did not: the
wind, which had changed during the night, swept into us from the
west in hindering buzzards. Our cloaks bellied out and dragged like
sails, against us. At last we skinned them off, and went easier,
our bare shirts wrapped tightly about us to restrain their slapping
tails. The whirling direction of the squalls was shown to our eyes
by the white mist they carried across hill and dale. Our hands were
numbed into insensibility, so that we knew the cuts on them only by
red stains in their plastered mud: but our bodies were not so
chill, and for hours quivered under the hailstones of each storm.
We twisted ourselves to get the sharpness on an unhurt side, and
held our shirts free from the skin, to shield us momentarily.</p>

<p>By late afternoon we had covered the ten miles to Aba el Lissan.
Maulud's men were gone to ground, and no one hailed us; which was
well, for we were filthy and miserable; stringy like shaven cats.
Afterwards the going was easier, the last two miles to the head of
Shtar being frozen like iron. We remounted our camels, whose breath
escaped whitely through their protesting nostrils, and raced up to
the first wonderful glimpse of the Guweira plain, warm, red and
comfortable, as seen through the cloud-gaps. The clouds had ceiled
the hollow strangely, cutting the mid-sky in a flat layer of curds
at the level of the hilltop on which we stood: we gazed on them
contentedly for minutes. Every little while a wisp of their fleecy
sea-foam stuff would be torn away and thrown at us. We on the wall
of bluffs would feel it slash across our faces; and, turning, would
see a white hem draw over the rough crest, tear to shreds, and
vanish in a powdering of hoar grains or a trickle of water across
the peat soil.</p>

<p>After having wondered at the sky we slid and ran gaily down the
pass to dry sand in a calm mild air. Yet the pleasure was not
vivid, as we had hoped. The pain of the blood fraying its passage
once more about our frozen limbs and faces was much faster than the
pain of its driving out: and we grew sensible that our feet had
been torn and bruised nearly to pulp among the stones. We had not
felt them tender while in the icy mud; but this warm, salty sand
scoured the cuts. In desperation we climbed up our sad camels, and
beat them woodenly towards Guweira. However, the change had made
them happier, and they brought us home there sedately, but with
success.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXXVIII</h3>

<p>Lazy nights, three of them, in the armoured car tents at Guweira
were pleasant, with Alan Dawnay, Joyce, and others talking, and
Tafileh to boast about. Yet these friends were a little grieved at
my luck, for their great expedition with Feisal a fortnight ago to
overwhelm Mudowwara had turned out unprofitably. Partly it was the
ancient problem of the co-operation of regulars with irregulars;
partly it was the fault of old Mohammed Ali el Beidawi, who, put
over the Beni Atiyeh, had come with them to water, cried,
'Noon-halt!' and sat there for two months, pandering to that
hedonistic streak among the Arabs which made them helpless slaves
of carnal indulgence. In Arabia, where superfluities lacked, the
temptation of necessary food lay always on men. Each morsel which
passed their lips might, if they were not watchful, become a
pleasure. Luxuries might be as plain as running water or a shady
tree, whose rareness and misuse often turned them into lusts. Their
story reminded me of Apollonius' 'Come off it, you men of Tarsus,
sitting on your river like geese, drunken with its white
water!'</p>

<p>Then thirty thousand pounds in gold came up from Akaba for me
and my cream camel, Wodheiha, the best of my remaining stud. She
was Ateiba-bred and had won many races for her old owner: also, she
was in splendid condition, fat but not too fat, her pads hardened
by much practice over the northern flints, and her coat thick and
matted. She was not tall, and looked heavy, but was docile and
smooth to ride, turning left or right if the saddle-horn were
tapped on the required side. So I rode her without a stick,
comfortably reading a book when the march permitted.</p>

<p>As my proper men were at Tafileh or Azrak, or out on mission, I
asked Feisal for temporary followers. He lent me his two Ateiba
horsemen, Serj and Rameid; and, to help carry my gold, added to the
party Sheikh Motlog, whose worth we had discovered when our
armoured cars explored the plains below Mudowwara for Tebuk.</p>

<p>Motlog had gone as sponsor, pointing out the country from a
perch high on the piled baggage of a box-Ford. They were dashing in
and out of sand-hills at speed, the Fords swaying like launches in
a swell. At one bad bend they skidded half-round on two wheels
crazily. Motlog was tossed out on his head. Marshall stopped the
car and ran back contrite, with ready excuses for the driving; but
the Sheikh, ruefully rubbing his head, said gently 'Don't be angry
with me. I have not learnt to ride these things'.</p>

<p>The gold was in thousand-pound bags. I gave two bags each to
fourteen of Motlog's twenty men, and took the last two myself. A
bag weighed twenty-two pounds, and in the awful road-conditions two
were weight enough for a camel, and swung fairly on either side in
the saddle-bags. We started at noon, hoping to make a good first
stage before getting into the trouble of the hills: but
unfortunately it turned wet after half an hour, and a steady rain
soaked us through and through, and made our camels' hair curl like
a wet dog's.</p>

<p>Motlog at that precise stage saw a tent, Sherif Fahad's, in the
corner of a sandstone pike. Despite my urging, he voted to spend
the night there, and see what it looked like on the hills
to-morrow. I knew this would be a fatal course, wasting days in
indecision: so I said farewell to him and rode on with my two men,
and with six Shobek-bound Howeitat, who had joined our caravan.</p>

<p>The argument had delayed us, and consequently we only reached
the foot of the pass at dark. By the sad, soft rain we were made
rather sorry for our virtue, inclined to envy Motlog his
hospitality with Fahad, when suddenly a red spark to our left drew
us across to find Saleh ibn Shefia camped there in a tent and three
caves, with a hundred of his freed-men fighters from Yenbo. Saleh,
the son of poor old Mohammed, our jester, was the proper lad who
had carried Wejh by assault on Vickery's field-day.</p>

<p>'<i>Cheyf ent?</i> (How are you?') said I earnestly twice or
thrice. His eyes sparkled at the Juheina manner. He came near me
and with bowed head and intense voice poured out a string of twenty
'<i>Cheyf ents</i>' before drawing breath. I disliked being
outdone, so replied with a dozen as solemnly. He took me up with
another of his long bursts, many more than twenty this time. So I
gave up trying to learn how many are the possible repetitions of
salutations in Wadi Yenbo.</p>

<p>He welcomed me, in spite of my drenched condition, to his own
carpet in his tent and gave me a new garment of his mother's
sewing, while waiting for the hot stew of meat and rice. Then we
lay down and slept a full night of great satisfaction, hearing the
patter of rain on the double canvas of his Meccan tent.</p>

<p>In the morning we were off at dawn, munching a handful of
Sal-eh's bread. As we set foot on the ascent, Serj looked up and
said, 'The mountain wears his skull-cap'. There was a white dome of
snow on every crest; and the Ateiba pushed quickly and curiously up
the pass to feel this new wonder with their hands. The camels, too,
were ignorant, and stretched their slow necks down to sniff its
whiteness twice or thrice in tired inquiry; but then drew their
heads away and looked forward without life-interest, once more.</p>

<p>Our inactivity lasted only another moment; for, as we put our
heads over the last ridge, a wind from the north-east took us in
the teeth, with a cold so swift and biting that we gasped for
breath and turned hurriedly back into shelter. It seemed as if it
would be fatal to face it; but that we knew was silly: so we pulled
ourselves together and rode hard through its first extreme to the
half-shelter of the valley. Serj and Rameid, terrified by these new
pains in their lungs, thought they were strangling; and to spare
them the mental struggle of passing a friendly camp, I led our
little party aside behind Maulud's hill, so that we saw nothing of
his weather-beaten force.</p>

<p>These men of Maulud's had been camped in this place, four
thousand feet above the sea, for two months without relief. They
had to live in shallow dug-outs on the hill-side. They had no fuel
except the sparse, wet wormwood, over which they were just able to
bake their necessary bread every other day. They had no clothes but
khaki drill uniform of the British summer sort. They slept in their
rain-sodden verminous pits on empty or half-empty flour-sacks, six
or eight of them together in a knotted bunch, that enough of the
worn blankets might be pooled for warmth.</p>

<p>Rather more than half of them died or were injured by the cold
and wet; yet the others maintained their watch, exchanging shots
daily with the Turkish outposts, and protected only by the
inclement weather from crushing counter-attack. We owed much to
them, and more to Maulud, whose fortitude stiffened them in their
duty.</p>

<p>The old scarred warrior's history in the Turkish army was a
catalogue of affairs provoked by his sturdy sense of Arab honour
and nationality, a creed for which three or four times he had
sacrificed his prospects. It must have been a strong creed which
enabled him to endure cheerfully three winter months in front of
Maan and to share out enough spirit among five hundred ordinary men
to keep them stout-heartedly about him.</p>

<p>We, for our one day, had a fill of hardship. Just on the ridge
about Aba el Lissan the ground was crusted with frost, and only the
smart of the wind in our eyes hindered us: but then our troubles
began. The camels came to a standstill in the slush at the bottom
of a twenty-foot bank of slippery mud, and lowed at it helplessly,
as if to say that they could not carry us up that. We jumped off to
help them, and slid back ourselves just as badly. At last we took
off our new, cherished boots, donned to armour us against the
winter; and hauled the camels up the glacis barefoot, as on the
journey down.</p>

<p>That was the end of our comfort, and we must have been off
twenty times before sunset. Some of the dismounts were involuntary,
when our camels side-slipped under us, and came down with the
jingle of coin ringing through the hollow rumble of their cask-like
bellies. While they were strong this falling made them as angry as
she-camels could be: afterwards they grew plaintive, and finally
afraid. We also grew short with one another, for the foul wind gave
us no rest. Nothing in Arabia could be more cutting than a north
wind at Maan, and to-day's was of the sharpest and strongest. It
blew through our clothes as if we had none, fixed our fingers in
claws not able to hold either halter or riding-stick, and cramped
our legs so that we had no grip of the saddle-pin. Consequently,
when thrown from our falling beasts we pitched off, to crash
stiffly on the ground, still frozen-brittle in the cross-legged
attitude of riding.</p>

<p>However, there was no rain, and the wind felt like a drying one,
so we held on steadily to the north. By evening we had almost made
the rivulet of Basta. This meant that we were travelling more than
a mile an hour; and for fear lest on the morrow we and our camels
would both be too tired to do so well, I pushed on in the dark
across the little stream. It was swollen, and the beasts jibbed at
it, so that we had to lead the way on foot, through three feet of
chilly water. Over the high ground, beyond, the wind buffeted us
like an enemy: at about nine o'clock the others flung themselves
crying down on the ground and refused to go further. I too, was
very near crying; sustained, indeed, only by my annoyance with
their open lamentations; and therefore reluctantly glad at heart to
yield to their example. We built up the nine camels in a phalanx,
and lay between them in fair comfort, listening to the driving
wrack clashing about us as loud as the surges by night round a ship
at sea. The visible stars were brilliant, seeming to change groups
and places waywardly between the clouds which scudded over our
heads. We had each two army blankets, and a packet of cooked bread;
so we were armed against evil and could sleep securely in the mud
and cold.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXXIX</h3>

<p>At dawn we went forward refreshed: but the weather had turned
soft, with a greyness through which loomed the sad wormwood-covered
hills. Upon their slopes the limestone ribs of this very old earth
stood wearily exposed. In their hollows our difficulties increased
with the mud. The misty valleys were sluggish streams of melting
snow: and at last new thick showers of wet flakes began to fall. We
reached the desolate ruins of Odroh in a midday like twilight: a
wind was blowing and dying intermittently, and slow-moving banks of
cloud and drizzle closed us about.</p>

<p>I bore right, to avoid the Beduin between us and Shobek: but our
Howeitat companions led us straight upon their camp. We had ridden
six miles in seven hours, and they were exhausted. The two Ateiba
were not only exhausted, but demoralized, and swore mutinously that
nothing in the world should keep us from the tribal tents. We
wrangled by the roadside under the soft drift.</p>

<p>For myself I felt quite fresh and happy, averse from the delay
of needless tribal hospitality. Zeid's penniless state was
excellent pretext for a trial of strength with the Edomite winter.
Shobek was only ten miles further, and daylight had yet five hours
to run. So I decided to go on alone. It would be quite safe, for in
such weather neither Turk nor Arab was abroad, and the roads were
mine. I took their four thousand pounds from Serj and Rameid, and
cursed them into the valley for cowards: which really they were
not. Rameid was catching his breath in great sobs, and Serfs
nervous pain marked each lurch of his camel with a running moan.
They raved with miserable rage when I dismissed them and turned
away.</p>

<p>The truth was that I had the best camel. The excellent Wodheiha
struggled gamely forward under the weight of the extra gold. In
flat places I rode her: at ascents and descents we used to slide
together side by side with comic accidents, which she seemed rather
to enjoy.</p>

<p>By sunset the snow-fall ceased; we were coming down to the river
of Shobek, and could see a brown track straggling over the opposite
hill towards the village. I tried a short cut, but the frozen crust
of the mudbanks deceived me, and I crashed through the cat-ice
(which was sharp, like knives) and bogged myself so deeply that I
feared I was going to pass the night there, half in and half out of
the sludge: or wholly in, which would be a tidier death.</p>

<p>Wodheiha, sensible beast, had refused to enter the morass: but
she stood at a loss on the hard margin, and looked soberly at my
mudlarking. However, I managed, with the still-held head-stall, to
persuade her a little nearer. Then I flung my body suddenly
backward against the squelching quag, and, grabbing wildly behind
my head, laid hold of her fetlock. She was frightened, and started
back: and her purchase dragged me clear. We crawled farther down
the bed to a safe place, and there crossed: after I had
hesitatingly sat in the stream and washed off the weight of
stinking clay.</p>

<p>Shiveringly I mounted again. We went over the ridge and down to
the base of the shapely cone, whose mural crown was the ring-wall
of the old castle of Monreale, very noble against the night sky.
The chalk was hard, and it was freezing; snow-drifts lay a foot
deep each side of the spiral path which wound up the hill. The
white ice crackled desolately under my naked feet as we neared the
gate, where, to make a stage entry, I climbed up by Wodheiha's
patient shoulder into the saddle. Then I repented, since only by
throwing myself sideways along her neck did I avoid the voussoirs
of the arch as she crashed underneath in half-terror of this
strange place.</p>

<p>I knew that Sherif Abd el Main should be still at Shobek, so
rode boldly up the silent street in the reeded starlight, which
played with the white icicles and their underlying shadow among the
walls and snowy roofs and ground. The camel stumbled doubtfully
over steps hidden beneath a thick covering of snow: but I had no
care of that, having reached my night's goal, and having so powdery
a blanket to fall on. At the crossways I called out the salutation
of a fair night: and after a minute, a husky voice protested to God
through the thick sacking which stuffed a loophole of the mean
house on my right. I asked for Abd el Mayein, and was told 'in the
Government house' which lay at the further end of the old castle's
enceinte.</p>

<p>Arrived there I called again. A door was flung open, and a cloud
of smoky light streamed recklessly across, whirling with motes,
through which black faces peered to know who I was. I hailed them
friendly, by name, saying that I was come to eat a sheep with the
master: upon which these slaves ran out, noisy with astonishment,
and relieved me of Wodheiha, whom they led into the reeking stable
where themselves lived. One lit me with a flaming spar up the stone
outside stairs to the house door, and between more servants, down a
winding passage dripping with water from the broken roof, into a
tiny room. There lay Abd el Muein upon a carpet, face down,
breathing the least smoky level of air.</p>

<p>My legs were shaky, so I dropped beside him, and gladly copied
his position to avoid the choking fumes of a brass brazier of
flaming wood which crackled in a recessed shot-window of the mighty
outer wall. He searched out for me a waist-cloth, while I stripped
off my things and hung them to steam before the fire, which became
less smarting to the eyes and throat as it burned down into red
coals. Meanwhile Abd el Mayin clapped his hands for supper to be
hastened and served <i>fauzari</i> (tea in Harith slang, so named
from his cousin, governor of their village) hot and spiced and
often, till the mutton, boiled with raisins in butter, was carried
in.</p>

<p>He explained, with his blessings on the dish, that next day they
would starve or rob, since he had here two hundred men, and no food
or money, and his messengers to Feisal were held up in the snow.
Whereat I, too, clapped hands, commanding my saddle-bags, and
presented him with five hundred pounds on account, till his subsidy
came. This was good payment for the food, and we were very merry
over my oddness of riding alone, in winter, with a hundredweight
and more of gold for baggage. I repeated that Zeid, like himself,
was straitened; and told of Serj and Rameid with the Arabs. The
Sherif s eyes darkened, and he made passes in the air with his
riding-stick. I explained, in extenuation of their failure, that
the cold did not trouble me, since the English climate was of this
sort most of the year. 'God forbid it,' said Abd el Muyein.</p>

<p>After an hour he excused himself, because he had just married a
Shobek wife. We talked of their marriage, whose end was the bearing
of children: I withstood it, quoting old Dionysus of Tarsus.</p>

<p>At his sixty years without marriage they were shocked, holding
procreation and evacuation alike as inevitable movements of the
body; they repeated their half of the commandment to honour
parents. I asked how they could look with pleasure on children,
embodied proofs of their consummated lust? And invited them to
picture the minds of the children, seeing crawl wormlike out of the
mother that bloody, blinded thing which was themselves! It sounded
to him a most excellent joke, and after it we rolled up in the rugs
and slept warmly. The fleas were serried, but my nakedness, the
Arab defence against a verminous bed, lessened their plague: and
the bruises did not prevail because I was too tired.</p>

<p>In the morning I rose with a splitting headache, and said I must
go on. Two men were found to ride with me, though all said we
should not reach Tafileh that night. However, I thought it could
not he worse than yesterday; so we skated timorously down the rapid
path to the plain across which still stretched the Roman road with
its groups of fallen milestones, inscribed by famous emperors.</p>

<p>From this plain the two faint-hearts with me slipped back to
their fellows on the castle-hill. I proceeded, alternately on and
off my camel, like the day before, though now the way was all too
slippery, except on the ancient paving, the last footprint of
Imperial Rome which had once, so much more preciously, played the
Turk to the desert dwellers. On it I could ride: but I had to walk
and wade the dips where the floods of fourteen centuries had washed
the road's foundations out. Rain came on, and soaked me, and then
it blew fine and freezing till I crackled in armour of white silk,
like a theatre knight: or like a bridal cake, hard iced.</p>

<p>The camel and I were over the plain in three hours; wonderful
going: but our troubles were not ended. The snow was indeed as my
guides had said, and completely hid the path, which wound uphill
between walls and ditches, and confused piles of stone. It cost me
an infinity of pain to turn the first two comers. Wodheiha, tired
of wading to her bony knees in useless white stuff, began
perceptibly to flag. However, she got up one more steep bit, only
to miss the edge of the path in a banked place. We fell together
some eighteen feet down the hill-side into a yard-deep drift of
frozen snow. After the fall she rose to her feet whimpering and
stood still, in a tremble.</p>

<p>When he-camels so baulked, they would die on their spot, after
days; and I feared that now I had found the limit of effort in
she-camels. I plunged to my neck in front of her, and tried to tow
her out, vainly. Then I spent a long time hitting her behind. I
mounted, and she sat down. I jumped off, heaved her up, and
wondered if, perhaps, it was that the drift was too thick. So I
carved her a beautiful little road, a foot wide, three deep, and
eighteen paces long, using my bare feet and hands as tools. The
snow was so frozen on the surface that it took all my weight first,
to break it down, and then to scoop it out. The crust was sharp,
and cut my wrists and ankles till they bled freely, and the
roadside became lined with pink crystals, looking like pale, very
pale, water-melon flesh.</p>

<p>Afterwards I went back to Wodheiha, patiently standing there,
and climbed into the saddle. She started easily. We went running at
it, and such was her speed that the rush carried her right over the
shallow stuff, back to the proper road. Up this we went cautiously,
with me, afoot, sounding the path in front with my stick, or
digging new passes when the drifts were deep. In three hours we
were on the summit, and found it wind-swept on the western side. So
we left the track, and scrambled unsteadily along the very broken
crest, looking down across the chessboard houses of Dana village,
into sunny Arabah, fresh and green thousands of feet below.</p>

<p>When the ridge served no more we did further heavy work, and at
last Wodheiha baulked again. It was getting serious, for the
evening was near; suddenly I realized the loneliness, and that if
the night found us yet beyond help on this hill-top, Wodheiha would
die, and she was a very noble beast. There was also the solid
weight of gold, and I felt not sure how far, even in Arabia, I
could safely put six thousand sovereigns by the roadside with a
signet as mark of ownership, and leave them for a night. So I took
her back a hundred yards along our beaten track, mounted, and
charged her at the bank. She responded. We burst through and over
the northern lip which looked down on the Senussi village of
Rasheidiya.</p>

<p>This face of the hill, sheltered from the wind and open to the
sun all afternoon, had thawed. Underneath the superficial snow lay
wet and muddy ground; and when Wodheiha ran upon this at speed her
feet went from under her and she sprawled, with her four feet
locked. So on her tail, with me yet in the saddle, we went sliding
round and down a hundred feet. Perhaps it hurt the tail (there were
stones under the snow) for on the level she sprang up unsteadily,
grunting, and lashed it about like a scorpion's. Then she began to
run at ten miles an hour down the greasy path towards Rasheidiya,
sliding and plunging wildly: with me, in terror of a fall and
broken bones, clinging to the horns of the saddle.</p>

<p>A crowd of Arabs, Zeid's men, weather-bound here on their way to
Feysal, ran out when they heard her trumpeting approach, and
shouted with joy at so distinguished an entry to the village. I
asked them the news; they told me all was well. Then I remounted,
for the last eight miles into Tafileh, where I gave Zeid his
letters and some money, and went gladly to bed...flea-proof for
another night.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XC</h3>

<p>Morning found me nearly snow-blind, but glad and vigorous. I
cast about for something to fill the inactive days before the other
gold arrived. The final judgement was to make a personal
examination of the approaches to Kerak, and the ground over which
we would later advance to Jordan. I asked Zeid to take from Motlog
the coming twenty-four thousand pounds, and spend what was
necessary for current expenses until my return.</p>

<p>Zeid told me there was another Englishman in Tafileh. The news
astonished me, and I went off to meet Lieutenant Kirkbride, a young
Arabic-speaking staff officer sent by Deedes to report intelligence
possibilities on the Arab Front. It was the beginning of a
connection profitable to us, and creditable to Kirkbride; a
taciturn, enduring fellow, only a boy in years, but ruthless in
action, who messed for eight months with the Arab officers, their
silent companion.</p>

<p>The cold had passed off and movement, even on the heights, was
practicable. We crossed Wadi Hesa, and rode as far as the edge of
the Jordan Valley, whose depths were noisy with Allenby's advance.
They said the Turks yet held Jericho. Thence we turned back to
Tafileh, after a reconnaissance very assuring for our future. Each
step of our road to join the British was possible: most of them
easy. The weather was so fine that we might reasonably begin at
once: and could hope to finish in a month.</p>

<p>Zeid heard me coldly. I saw Motlog next him, and greeted him
sarcastically, asking what was his tally of the gold: then I began
to repeat my programme of what we might fairly do. Zeid stopped me:
'But that will need a lot of money.' I said, 'Not at all': our
funds in hand would cover it, and more. Zeid replied that he had
nothing; and when I gaped at him, muttered rather shamefacedly that
he had spent all I brought. I thought he was joking: but he went on
to say that so much had been due to Dhiab, sheikh of Tafileh; so
much to the villagers; so much to the Jazi Howeitat; so much to the
Beni Sakhr.</p>

<p>Only for a defensive was such expenditure conceivable. The
peoples named were elements centring in Tafileh, men whose blood
feuds made them impossible for use north of Wadi Hesa. Admittedly,
the Sherifs, as they advanced, enrolled all the men of every
district at a monthly wage: but it was perfectly understood that
the wage was fictitious, to be paid only if they had been called on
for active service. Feisal had more than forty thousand on his
Akaba books: while his whole subsidy from England would not pay
seventeen thousand. The wages of the rest were nominally due and
often asked for: but not a lawful liability. However, Zeid said
that he had paid them.</p>

<p>I was aghast; for this meant the complete ruin of my plans and
hopes, the collapse of our effort to keep faith with Allenby. Zeid
stuck to his word that the money was all gone. Afterwards I went
off to learn the truth from Nasir, who was in bed with fever. He
despondently said that everything was wrong&mdash;Zeid too young
and shy to counter his dishonest, cowardly counsellors.</p>

<p>All night I thought over what could be done, but found a blank;
and when morning came could only send word to Zeid that, if he
would not return the money, I must go away. He sent me back his
supposed account of the spent money. While we were packing, Joyce
and Marshall arrived. They had ridden from Guweira to give me a
pleasant surprise. I told them why it had happened that I was going
back to Allenby to put my further employment in his hands. Joyce
made a vain appeal to Zeid, and promised to explain to Feisal.</p>

<p>He would close down my affairs and disperse my bodyguard. So I
was able, with only four men, to set off, late that very afternoon,
for Beersheba, the quickest way to British Headquarters. The coming
of spring made the first part of the ride along the edge of the
Araba scarp surpassingly beautiful, and my farewell mood showed me
its beauties, keenly. The ravines were clothed below with trees:
but near to us, by the top, their precipitous flanks, as seen from
above, were a patchwork of close lawns, which tipped toward
downright faces of bare rock of many colours. Some of the colours
were mineral, in the rock itself: but others were accidental, due
to water from the melting snow falling over the cliff-edge, either
in drifts of dusty spray, or diamond-strings down hanging tresses
of green fern.</p>

<p>At Buseira, the little village on a hull of rock over the abyss,
they insisted that we halt to eat. I was willing, because if we fed
our camels here with a little barley we might ride all night and
reach Beersheba on the morrow: but to avoid delay I refused to
enter their houses, and instead ate in the little cemetery, off a
tomb, into whose joints were cemented plaits of hair, the
sacrificed head-ornaments of mourners. Afterwards we went down the
zigzags of the great pass into the hot bottom of Wadi Dhahal, over
which the cliffs and the hills so drew together that hardly did the
stars shine into its pitchy blackness. We halted a moment while our
camels stilled the nervous trembling of their forelegs after the
strain of the terrible descent. Then we plashed, fetlock deep, down
the swift stream, under a long arch of rustling bamboos, which met
so nearly over our heads that their fans brushed our faces. The
strange echoes of the vaulted passage frightened our camels into a
trot.</p>

<p>Soon we were out of it, and out of the horns of the valley,
scouring across the open Araba. We reached the central bed, and
found that we were off the track&mdash;not wonderful, for we were
steering only on my three-year-old memories of Newcombe's map. A
half-hour was wasted in finding a ramp for the camels, up the earth
cliff.</p>

<p>At last we found one, and threaded the windings of the marly
labyrinth beyond&mdash;a strange place, sterile with salt, like a
rough sea suddenly stilled, with all its tossing waves transformed
into hard, fibrous earth, very grey under to-night's half-moon.
Afterwards we aimed westward till the tall branched tree of Husb
outlined itself against the sky, and we heard the murmurings of the
great spring which flowed out from the roots. Our camels drank a
little. They had come down five thousand feet from the Tafileh
hills, and had to climb up three thousand now to Palestine.</p>

<p>In the little foot-hills before Wadi Murra, suddenly, we saw a
fire of large logs, freshly piled, and still at white heat. No one
was visible, proof that the kindlers were a war party: yet it was
not kindled in nomad fashion. The liveliness showed that they were
still near it: the size that they were many: so prudence made us
hurry on. Actually it was the camp-fire of a British section of
Ford cars, under the two famous Macs, looking for a car-road from
Sinai to Akaba. They were hidden in the shadows, covering us with
their Lewis guns.</p>

<p>We climbed the pass as day broke. There was a little rain, balmy
after the extreme of Taflleh. Rags of thinnest cloud stood
unreasonably motionless in the hills, as we rode over the
comfortable plain, to Beersheba, about noon: a good performance,
down and up hills for nearly eighty miles.</p>

<p>They told us Jericho was just taken. I went through to Allenby's
headquarters. Hogarth was there on the platform. To him I confessed
that I had made a mess of things: and had come to beg Allenby to
find me some smaller part elsewhere. I had put all myself into the
Arab business, and had come to wreck because of my sick judgement;
the occasion being Zeid, own brother to Feisal, and a little man I
really liked. I now had no tricks left worth a meal in the Arab
market-place, and wanted the security of custom: to be conveyed; to
pillow myself on duty and obedience: irresponsibly.</p>

<p>I complained that since landing in Arabia I had had options and
requests, never an order: that I was tired to death of free-will,
and of many things beside free-will. For a year and a half I had
been in motion, riding a thousand miles each month upon camels:
with added nervous hours in crazy aeroplanes, or rushing across
country in powerful cars. In my last five actions I had been hit,
and my body so dreaded further pain that now I had to force myself
under fire. Generally I had been hungry: lately always cold: and
frost and dirt had poisoned my hurts into a festering mass of
sores.</p>

<p>However, these worries would have taken their due petty place,
in my despite of the body, and of my soiled body in particular, but
for the rankling fraudulence which had to be my mind's habit: that
pretence to lead the national uprising of another race, the daily
posturing in alien dress, preaching in alien speech: with behind it
a sense that the 'promises' on which the Arabs worked were worth
what their armed strength would be when the moment of fulfilment
came. We had deluded ourselves that perhaps peace might find the
Arabs able, unhelped and untaught, to defend themselves with paper
tools. Meanwhile we glozed our fraud by conducting their necessary
war purely and cheaply. But now this gloss had gone from me.
Chargeable against my conceit were the causeless, ineffectual
deaths of Hesa. My will had gone and I feared to be alone, lest the
winds of circumstance, or power, or lust, blow my empty soul
away.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XCI</h3>

<p>Diplomatically, Hogarth replied not a word, but took me to
breakfast with Clayton. There I gathered that Smuts had come from
the War Cabinet to Palestine, with news which had changed our
relative situation. For days they had been trying to get me to the
Conferences, and finally had sent out aeroplanes to find Tafileh;
but the pilots had dropped their messages near Shobek, among Arabs
too weather-daunted to move.</p>

<p>Clayton said that in the new conditions there could be no
question of letting me off. The East was only now going to begin.
Allenby told me that the War Cabinet were leaning heavily on him to
repair the stalemate of the West. He was to take at least Damascus;
and, if possible, Aleppo, as soon as he could. Turkey was to be put
out of the war once and for all. His difficulty lay with his
eastern flank, the right, which to-day rested on Jordan. He had
called me to consider if the Arabs could relieve him of its
burden.</p>

<p>There was no escape for me. I must take up again my mantle of
fraud in the East. With my certain contempt for half-measures I
took it up quickly and wrapped myself in it completely. It might be
fraud or it might be farce: no one should say that I could not play
it. So I did not even mention the reasons which had brought me
across; but pointed out that this was the Jordan scheme seen from
the British angle. Allenby assented, and asked if we could still do
it. I said: not at present, unless new factors were first
discounted.</p>

<p>The first was Maan. We should have to take it before we could
afford a second sphere. If more transport gave a longer range to
the units of the Arab Regular Army, they could take position some
miles north of Maan and cut the railway permanently, so forcing the
Maan garrison to come out and fight them; and in the field the
Arabs would easily defeat the Turks. We would require seven hundred
baggage camels; more guns and machine-guns; and, lastly, assurance
against flank attack from Amman, while we dealt with Maan.</p>

<p>On this basis a scheme was worked out. Allenby ordered down to
Akaba two units of the Camel Transport Corps, an organization of
Egyptians under British officers, which had proved highly
successful in the Beersheba campaign. It was a great gift, for its
carrying capacity ensured that we should now be able to keep our
four thousand regulars eighty miles in advance of their base. The
guns and machine-guns were also promised. As for shielding us
against attack from Amman, Allenby said that was easily arranged.
He intended, for his own flank's security, shortly to take Salt,
beyond Jordan, and hold it with an Indian Brigade. A Corps
Conference was due next day, and I was to stay for it.</p>

<p>At this Conference it was determined that the Arab Army move
instantly to the Maan Plateau, to take Maan. That the British cross
the Jordan, occupy Salt, and destroy south of Amman as much of the
railway as possible; especially the great tunnel. It was debated
what share the Amman Arabs should take in the British operation.
Bols thought we should join in the advance. I opposed this, since
the later retirement to Salt would cause rumour and reaction, and
it would be easier if we did not enter till this had spent
itself.</p>

<p>Chetwode, who was to direct the advance, asked how his men were
to distinguish friendly from hostile Arabs, since their tendency
was a prejudice against all wearing skirts. I was sitting skirted
in their midst and replied, naturally, that skirt-wearers disliked
men in uniform. The laugh clinched the question, and it was agreed
that we support the British retention of Salt only after they came
to rest there. As soon as Maan fell, the Arab Regulars would move
up and draw supplies from Jericho. The seven hundred camels would
come along, still giving them eighty miles' radius of action. This
would be enough to let them work above Amman in Allenby's grand
attack along the line from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea, the
second phase of the operation, directed to the capture of
Damascus.</p>

<p>My business was finished. I went to Cairo for two days, and then
was flown to Akaba, to make my new terms with Feisal. I told him I
thought they had treated me badly, in diverting without my
knowledge money of the special account which, by agreement, I had
drawn solely for the Dead Sea campaign. Consequently, I had left
Zeid, it being impossible for a flouted adviser to carry on.</p>

<p>Allenby had sent me back. But my return did not mean that the
damage was repaired. A great opportunity had been missed, and a
valuable advance thrown away. The Turks would retake Tafileh in a
week's time without difficulty. Feisal was distressed lest the loss
of Tafileh do his reputation harm; and shocked by my little
interest in its fate. To comfort him, I pointed out that it now
meant nothing to us. The two interests were the extremes of his
area, Amman and Maan. Tafileh was not worth losing a man over;
indeed, if the Turks moved there, they would weaken either Maan or
Amman, and make our real work easier.</p>

<p>He was a little reconciled by this, but sent urgent warnings to
Zeid of the coining danger: without avail, for six days later the
Turks retook Tafileh. Meanwhile, Feisal re-arranged the basis of
his army funds. I gave him the good news that Allenby, as thanks
for the Dead Sea and Aba el Lissan, had put three hundred thousand
pounds into my independent credit, and given us a train of seven
hundred pack-camels complete with personnel and equipment.</p>

<p>This raised great joy in all the army, for the baggage columns
would enable us to prove the value in the field of the Arab regular
troops on whose training and organization Joyce, Jaafar, and so
many Arab and English officers had worked for months. We arranged
rough time-tables and schemes: then I shipped busily back to
Egypt.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XCII</h3>

<p>In Cairo, where I spent four days, our affairs were now far from
haphazard. Allenby's smile had given us Staff. We had supply
officers, a shipping expert, an ordnance expert, an intelligence
branch: under Alan Dawnay, brother of the maker of the Beersheba
plan, who had now gone to France. Dawnay was Allenby's greatest
gift to us&mdash;greater than thousands of baggage camels. As a
professional officer, he had the class-touch: so that even the
reddest hearer recognized an authentic redness. His was an
understanding mind, feeling instinctively the special qualities of
rebellion: at the same time, his war-training enriched his
treatment of this antithetic subject. He married war and rebellion
in himself; as, of old in Yenbo, it had been my dream every regular
officer would. Yet, in three years' practice, only Dawnay
succeeded.</p>

<p>He could not take complete, direct command, because he did not
know Arabic; and because of his Flanders-broken health. He had the
gift, rare among Englishmen, of making the best of a good thing. He
was exceptionally educated, for an Army officer, and imaginative.
His perfect manner made him friends with all races and classes.
From his teaching we began to learn the technique of fighting in
matters we had been content to settle by rude and wasteful rules of
thumb. His sense of fitness remodelled our standing.</p>

<p>The Arab Movement had lived as a wild-man show, with its means
as small as its duties and prospects. Henceforward Allenby counted
it as a sensible part of his scheme; and the responsibility upon us
of doing better than he wished, knowing that forfeit for our
failure would necessarily be part-paid in his soldiers' lives,
removed it terrifyingly further from the sphere of joyous
adventure.</p>

<p>With Joyce we laid our triple plan to support Allenby's first
stroke. In our center the Arab regulars, under Jaafar, would occupy
the line a march north of Maan. Joyce with our armoured cars would
slip down to Mudowwara, and destroy the railway&mdash;permanently
this time, for now we were ready to cut off Medina. In the north,
Merzuk, with myself, would join Allenby when he fell back to Salt
about March the thirtieth. Such a date gave me leisure: and I
settled to go to Shobek, with Zeid and Nasir.</p>

<p>It was springtime: very pleasant after the biting winter, whose
excesses seemed dream-like, in the new freshness and strength of
nature: for there was strength in this hill-top season, when a
chill sharpness at sundown corrected the languid noons.</p>

<p>All life was alive with us: even the insects. In our first night
I had laid my cashmere head-cloth on the ground under my head as
pad: and at dawn, when I took it up again, twenty-eight lice were
tangled in its snowy texture. Afterwards we slept on our
saddle-covers, the tanned fleece hooked last of all over the
saddle-load to make a slippy and sweat-proof seat for the rider.
Even so, we were not left alone. The camel-ticks, which had drunk
themselves (with blood from our tethered camels) into tight
slaty-blue cushions, thumbnail wide, and thick, used to creep under
us, hugging the leathern underside of the sheepskins: and if we
rolled on them in the night, our weight burst them to brown mats of
blood and dust.</p>

<p>While we were in this comfortable air, with milk plentiful about
us, news came from Azrak, of Ali ibn el Hussein and the Indians
still on faithful watch. One Indian had died of cold, and also
Daud, my Ageyli boy, the friend of Farraj. Farraj himself told
us.</p>

<p>These two had been friends from childhood, in eternal gaiety:
working together, sleeping together, sharing every scrape and
profit with the openness and honesty of perfect love. So I was not
astonished to see Farraj look dark and hard of face, leaden-eyed
and old, when he came to tell me that his fellow was dead; and from
that day till his service ended he made no more laughter for us. He
took punctilious care, greater even than before, of my camel, of
the coffee, of my clothes and saddles, and fell to praying his
three regular prayings every day. The others offered themselves to
comfort him, but instead he wandered restlessly, grey and silent,
very much alone.</p>

<p>When looked at from this torrid East, our British conception of
woman seemed to partake of the northern climate which had also
contracted our faith. In the Mediterranean, woman's influence and
supposed purpose were made cogent by an understanding in which she
was accorded the physical world in simplicity, unchallenged, like
the poor in spirit. Yet this same agreement, by denying equality of
sex, made love, companionship and friendliness impossible between
man and woman. Woman became a machine for muscular exercise, while
man's psychic side could be slaked only amongst his peers. Whence
arose these partnerships of man and man, to supply human nature
with more than the contact of flesh with flesh.</p>

<p>We Westerners of this complex age, monks in our bodies' cells,
who searched for something to fill us beyond speech and sense,
were, by the mere effort of the search, shut from it for ever. Yet
it came to children like these unthinking Ageyl, content to receive
without return, even from one another. We racked ourselves with
inherited remorse for the flesh-indulgence of our gross birth,
striving to pay for it through a lifetime of misery; meeting
happiness, life's overdraft, by a compensating hell, and striking a
ledger-balance of good or evil against a day of judgement.</p>

<p>Meanwhile at Aba el Lissan things went not well with our scheme
to destroy the Maan garrison by posting the Arab Army across the
railway in the north, and forcing them to open battle, as Allenby
attacked their base and supports at Amman. Feisal and Jaafar liked
the scheme, but their officers clamoured for direct attack on Maan.
Joyce pointed out their weakness in artillery and machine-guns,
their untried men, the greater strategical wisdom of the railway
scheme: it was of no effect. Maulud, hot for immediate assault,
wrote memoranda to Feisal upon the danger of English interference
with Arab liberty. At such a moment Joyce fell ill of pneumonia,
and left for Suez. Dawnay came up to reason with the malcontents.
He was our best card, with his proved military reputation,
exquisite field-boots, and air of well-dressed science; but he came
too late, for the Arab officers now felt their honour to be
engaged.</p>

<p>We agreed that we must give them their heads on the point,
though we were really all-powerful, with the money, the supplies,
and now the transport, in our hands. However, if the people were
slattern, why, then, they must have a slatternly government: and
particularly must we go slow with that self-governing democracy,
the Arab Army, in which service was as voluntary as enlistment.
Between us we were familiar with the Turkish, the Egyptian and the
British Armies: and championed our respective task-masters. Joyce
alleged the parade-magnificence of his Egyptians&mdash;formal men,
who loved mechanical movement and surpassed British troops in
physique, in smartness, in perfection of drill. I maintained the
frugality of the Turks, that shambling, ragged army of serfs. The
British Army we all were acquainted with in a fashion; and as we
contrasted services we found variety of obedience according to the
degree of ordered force which served each as sanction.</p>

<p>In Egypt soldiers belonged to their service without check of
public opinion. Consequently they had a peace-incentive to
perfection of formal conduct. In Turkey the men were, in theory,
equally the officers': body and soul: but their lot was mitigated
by the possibility of escape. In England the voluntary recruit
served as utterly as any Turk, except that the growth of civil
decency had taken away from authority the resource of inflicting
direct physical pain: but in practice, upon our less obtuse
population, the effects of pack-drill or fatigues fell little short
of an Oriental system.</p>

<p>In the regular Arab Army there was no power of punishment
whatever: this vital difference showed itself in all our troops.
They had no formality of discipline; there was no subordination.
Service was active; attack always imminent: and, like the Army of
Italy, men recognized the duty of defeating the enemy. For the rest
they were not soldiers, but pilgrims, intent always to go the
little farther.</p>

<p>I was not discontented with this state of things, for it had
seemed to me that discipline, or at least formal discipline, was a
virtue of peace: a character or stamp by which to mark off soldiers
from complete men, and obliterate the humanity of the individual.
It resolved itself easiest into the restrictive, the making men not
do this or that: and so could be fostered by a rule severe enough
to make them despair of disobedience. It was a process of the mass,
an element of the impersonal crowd, inapplicable to one man, since
it involved obedience, a duality of will. It was not to impress
upon men that their will must actively second the officer's, for
then there would have been, as in the Arab Army and among
irregulars, that momentary pause for thought transmission, or
digestion; for the nerves to resolve the relaying private will into
active consequence. On the contrary, each regular Army sedulously
rooted out this significant pause from its companies on parade. The
drill-instructors tried to make obedience an instinct, a mental
reflex, following as instantly on the command as though the motor
power of the individual wills had been invested together in the
system.</p>

<p>This was well, so far as it increased quickness: but it made no
provision for casualties, beyond the weak assumption that each
subordinate had his will-motor not atrophied, but reserved in
perfect order, ready at the instant to take over his late
superior's office; the efficiency of direction passing smoothly
down the great hierarchy till vested in the senior of the two
surviving privates.</p>

<p>It had the further weakness, seeing men's jealousy, of putting
power in the hands of arbitrary old age, with its petulant
activity: additionally corrupted by long habit of control, an
indulgence which ruined its victim, by causing the death of his
subjunctive mood. Also, it was an idiosyncrasy with me to distrust
instinct, which had its roots in our animality. Reason seemed to
give men something deliberately more precious than fear or pain:
and this made me discount the value of peace smartness as a
war-education.</p>

<p>For with war a subtle change happened to the soldier. Discipline
was modified, supported, even swallowed by an eagerness of the man
to fight. This eagerness it was which brought victory in the moral
sense, and often in the physical sense, of the combat. War was made
up of crises of intense effort. For psychological reasons
commanders wished for the least duration of this maximum effort:
not because the men would not try to give it&mdash;usually they
would go on till they dropped&mdash;but because each such effort
weakened their remaining force. Eagerness of the kind was nervous,
and, when present in high power, it tore apart flesh and
spirit.</p>

<p>To rouse the excitement of war for the creation of a military
spirit in peace-time would be dangerous, like the too-early doping
of an athlete. Consequently discipline, with its concomitant
'smartness' (a suspect word implying superficial restraint and
pain) was invented to take its place. The Arab Army, born and
brought up in the fighting line, had never known a peace-habit, and
was not faced with problems of maintenance till armistice-time:
then it failed signally.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XCIII</h3>

<p>After Joyce and Dawnay had gone, I rode off from Aba el Lissan,
with Mirzuk. Our starting day promised to crown the
spring-freshness of this lofty tableland. A week before there had
been a furious blizzard, and some of the whiteness of the snow
seemed to have passed into the light. The ground was vivid with new
grass; and the sunlight, which slanted across us, pale like straw,
mellowed the fluttering wind.</p>

<p>With us journeyed two thousand Sirhan camels, carrying our
ammunition and food. For the convoy's sake we marched easily, to
reach the railway after dark. A few of us rode forward, to search
the line by daylight, and be sure of peace during the hours these
scattered numbers would consume in crossing.</p>

<p>My bodyguard was with me, and Mirzuk had his Ageyl, with two
famous racing camels. The gaiety of the air and season caught them.
Soon they were challenging to races, threatening one another, or
skirmishing. My imperfect camel-riding (and my mood) forbade me to
thrust among the lads, who swung more to the north, while I worked
on, ridding my mind of the lees of camp-clamour and intrigue. The
abstraction of the desert landscape cleansed me, and rendered my
mind vacant with its superfluous greatness: a greatness achieved
not by the addition of thought to its emptiness, but by its
subtraction. In the weakness of earth's life was mirrored the
strength of heaven, so vast, so beautiful, so strong.</p>

<p>Near sunset the line became visible, curving spaciously across
the disclosed land, among low tufts of grass and bushes. Seeing
everything was peaceful I pushed on, meaning to halt beyond and
watch the others over. There was always a little thrill in touching
the rails which were the target of so many of our efforts.</p>

<p>As I rode up the bank my camel's feet scrambled in the loose
ballast, and out of the long shadow of a culvert to my left, where,
no doubt, he had slept all day, rose a Turkish soldier. He glanced
wildly at me and at the pistol in my hand, and then with sadness at
his rifle against the abutment, yards beyond. He was a young man;
stout, but sulky-looking. I stared at him, and said, softly, 'God
is merciful'. He knew the sound and sense of the Arabic phrase, and
raised his eyes like a flash to mine, while his heavy sleep-ridden
face began slowly to change into incredulous joy.</p>

<p>However, he said not a word. I pressed my camel's hairy shoulder
with my foot, she picked her delicate stride across the metals and
down the further slope, and the little Turk was man enough not to
shoot me in the back, as I rode away, feeling warm towards him, as
ever towards a life one has saved. At a safe distance I glanced
back. He put thumb to nose, and twinkled his fingers at me.</p>

<p>We lit a coffee-fire as beacon for the rest, and waited till
their dark lines passed by. Next day we marched to Wadi el Jinz; to
flood-pools, shallow eyes of water set in wrinkles of the clay,
their rims lashed about with scrubby stems of brushwood. The water
was grey, like the marly valley bed, but sweet. There we rested for
the night, since the Zaagi had shot a bustard, and Xenophon did
rightly call its white meat good. While we feasted the camels
feasted. By the bounty of spring they were knee-deep in succulent
green-stuff.</p>

<p>A fourth easy march took us to the Atara, our goal, where our
allies, Mifleh, Fahad and Adhub, were camped. Fahad was still
stricken, but Mifleh, with honeyed words, came out to welcome us,
his face eaten up by greed, and his voice wheezy with it.</p>

<p>Our plan, thanks to Allenby's lion-share, promised simply. We
would, when ready, cross the line to Themed, the main Beni Sakhr
watering. Thence under cover of a screen of their cavalry we would
move to Madeba, and fit it as our headquarters, while Allenby put
the Jericho-Salt road in condition. We ought to link up with the
British comfortably without firing a shot.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we had only to wait in the Atatir, which to our joy
were really green, with every hollow a standing pool, and the
valley beds of tall grass prinked with flowers. The chalky ridges,
sterile with salt, framed the water-channels delightfully. From
their tallest point we could look north and south, and see how the
rain, running down, had painted the valleys across the white in
broad stripes of green, sharp and firm like brush-strokes.
Everything was growing, and daily the picture was fuller and
brighter till the desert became like a rank water-meadow. Playful
packs of winds came crossing and tumbling over one another, their
wide, brief gusts surging through the grass, to lay it momentarily
in swathes of dark and light satin, like young corn after the
roller. On the hill we sat and shivered before these sweeping
shadows, expecting a heavy blast&mdash;and there would come into
our faces a warm and perfumed breath, very gentle, which passed
away behind us as a silver-grey light down the plain of green. Our
fastidious camels grazed an hour or so, and then lay down to
digest, bringing up stomach-load after stomach-load of
butter-smelling green cud, and chewing weightily.</p>

<p>At last news came that the English had taken Amman. In half an
hour we were making for Themed, across the deserted line. Later
messages told us that the English were falling back, and though we
had forewarned the Arabs of it, yet they were troubled. A further
messenger reported how the English had just fled from Salt. This
was plainly contrary to Allenby's intention, and I swore straight
out that it was not true. A man galloped in to say that the English
had broken only a few rails south of Amman, after two days of vain
assaults against the town. I grew seriously disturbed in the
conflict of rumour, and sent Adhub, who might be trusted not to
lose his head, to Salt with a letter for Chetwode or Shea, asking
for a note on the real situation. For the intervening hours we
tramped restlessly over the fields of young barley, our minds
working out plan after plan with feverish activity.</p>

<p>Very late at night Adhub's racing horse-hooves echoed across the
valley and he came in to tell us that Jemal Pasha was now in Salt,
victorious, hanging those local Arabs who had welcomed the English.
The Turks were still chasing Allenby far down the Jordan Valley. It
was thought that Jerusalem would be recovered. I knew enough of my
countrymen to reject that possibility; but clearly things were very
wrong. We slipped off, bemused, to the Atatir again.</p>

<p>This reverse, being unawares, hurt me the more. Allenby's plan
had seemed modest, and that we should so fall down before the Arabs
was deplorable. They had never trusted us to do the great things
which I foretold; and now their independent thoughts set out to
enjoy the springtide here. They were abetted by some gipsy families
from the north with the materials of their tinkering trade on
donkeys. The Zebn tribesmen greeted them with a humour I little
understood&mdash;till I saw that, beside their legitimate profits
of handicraft, the women were open to other advances.</p>

<p>Particularly they were easy to the Ageyl; and for a while they
prospered exceedingly, since our men were eager and very generous.
I also made use of them. It seemed a pity to be at a loose end so
near to Amman, and not bother to look at it. So Farraj and I hired
three of the merry little women, wrapped ourselves up like them,
and strolled through the village. The visit was successful, though
my final determination was that the place should be left alone. We
had one evil moment, by the bridge, when we were returning. Some
Turkish soldiers crossed our party, and taking us all five for what
we looked, grew much too friendly. We showed a coyness, and good
turn of speed for gipsy women, and escaped intact. For the future I
decided to resume my habit of wearing ordinary British soldiers'
rig in enemy camps. It was too brazen to be suspect.</p>

<p>After this I determined to order the Indians from Azrak back to
Feisal, and to return myself. We started on one of those clean
dawns which woke up the senses with the sun, while the intellect,
tired after the thinking of the night, was yet abed. For an hour or
two on such a morning the sounds, scents and colours of the world
struck man individually and directly, not filtered through or made
typical by thought; they seemed to exist sufficiently by
themselves, and the lack of design and of carefulness in creation
no longer irritated.</p>

<p>We marched southward along the railway, expecting to cross the
slower-moving Indians from Azrak; our little party on prize camels
swooping from one point of vantage to another, on the look-out. The
still day encouraged us to speed over all the flint-strewn ridges,
ignoring the multitude of desert paths which led only to the
abandoned camps of last year, or of the last thousand or ten
thousand years: for a road, once trodden into such flint and
limestone, marked the face of the desert for so long as the desert
lasted.</p>

<p>By Faraifra we saw a little patrol of eight Turks marching up
the line. My men, fresh after the holiday in the Atatir, begged me
to ride on them. I thought it too trifling, but when they chafed,
agreed. The younger ones instantly rushed forward at a gallop. I
ordered the rest across the line, to drive the enemy away from
their shelter behind a culvert. The Zaagi, a hundred yards to my
right, seeing what was wanted, swerved aside at once. Mohsin
followed him a moment later, with his section; whilst Abdulla and I
pushed forward steadily on our side, to take the enemy on both
flanks together.</p>

<p>Farraj, riding in front of everyone, would not listen to our
cries nor notice the warning shots fired past his head. He looked
round at our manoeuvre, but himself continued to canter madly
towards the bridge, which he reached before the Zaagi and his party
had crossed the line. The Turks held their fire, and we supposed
them gone down the further side of the embankment into safety; but
as Farraj drew rein beneath the archway, there was a shot, and he
seemed to fall or leap out of the saddle, and disappeared. A while
after, the Zaagi got into position on the bank and his party fired
twenty or thirty ragged shots, as though the enemy was still
there.</p>

<p>I was very anxious about Farraj. His camel stood unharmed by the
bridge, alone. He might be hit, or might be following the enemy. I
could not believe that he had deliberately ridden up to them in the
open and halted; yet it looked like it. I sent Feheyd to the Zaagi
and told him to rush along the far side as soon as possible, whilst
we went at a fast trot straight in to the bridge.</p>

<p>We reached it together, and found there one dead Turk, and
Farraj terribly wounded through the body, lying by the arch just as
he had fallen from his camel. He looked unconscious; but, when we
dismounted, greeted us, and then fell silent, sunken in that
loneliness which came to hurt men who believed death near. We tore
his clothes away and looked uselessly at the wound. The bullet had
smashed right through him, and his spine seemed injured. The Arabs
said at once that he had only a few hours to live.</p>

<p>We tried to move him, for he was helpless, though he showed no
pain. We tried to stop the wide, slow bleeding, which made
poppy-splashes in the grass; but it seemed impossible, and after a
while he told us to let him alone, as he was dying, and happy to
die, since he had no care of life. Indeed, for long he had been so,
and men very tired and sorry often fell in love with death, with
that triumphal weakness coming home after strength has been
vanquished in a last battle.</p>

<p>While we fussed about him Abd el Latif shouted an alarm. He
could see about fifty Turks working up the line towards us, and
soon after a motor trolley was heard coming from the north. We were
only sixteen men, and had an impossible position. I said we must
retire at once, carrying Farraj with us. They tried to lift him,
first in his cloak, afterwards in a blanket; but consciousness was
coming back, and he screamed so pitifully that we had not the heart
to hurt him more.</p>

<p>We could not leave him where he was, to the Turks, because we
had seen them burn alive our hapless wounded. For this reason we
were all agreed, before action, to finish off one another, if badly
hurt: but I had never realized that it might fall to me to kill
Farraj.</p>

<p>I knelt down beside <i>him</i>, holding my pistol near the
ground by his head, so that he should not see my purpose; but he
must have guessed it, for he opened his eyes, and clutched me with
his harsh, scaly hand, the tiny hand of these unripe Nejd fellows.
I waited a moment, and he said, Daud will be angry with you', the
old smile coming back so strangely to this grey shrinking face. I
replied, 'salute him from me'. He returned the formal answer, 'God
will give you peace', and at last wearily closed his eyes.</p>

<p>The Turkish trolley was now very close, swaying down the line
towards us like a dung-beetle: and its machine-gun bullets stung
the air about our heads as we fled back into the ridges. Mohsin led
Farraj's camel, on which were his sheepskin and trappings, still
with the shape of his body in them, just as he had fallen by the
bridge. Near dark we halted; and the Zaagi came whispering to me
that all were wrangling as to who should ride the splendid animal
next day. He wanted her for himself; but I was bitter that these
perfected dead had again robbed my poverty: and to cheapen the
great loss with a little one I shot the poor beast with my second
bullet.</p>

<p>Then the sun set on us. Through the breathless noon in the
valleys of Kerak the prisoned air had brooded stagnantly without
relief, while the heat sucked the perfume from the flowers. With
darkness the world moved once more, and a breath from the west
crept out over the desert. We were miles from the grass and
flowers, but suddenly we felt them all about us, as waves of this
scented air drew past us with a sticky sweetness. However, quickly
it faded, and the night-wind, damp and wholesome, followed. Abdulla
brought me supper, rice and camel-meat (Farraj's camel). Afterwards
we slept.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XCIV</h3>

<p>In the morning, near Wadi el Jinz, we met the Indians, halted by
a solitary tree. It was like old times, like our gentle and
memorable ride to the bridges the year before, to be going again
across country with Hassan Shah, hearing the Vickers guns still
clinking in the carriers, and helping the troopers re-tie their
slipping loads, or saddles. They seemed just as unhandy with camels
as at first; so not till dusk did we cross the railway.</p>

<p>There I left the Indians, because I felt restless, and movement
fast in the night might cure my mind. So we pressed forward all the
chill darkness, riding for Odroh. When we topped its rise we
noticed gleams of fire to our left: bright flashes went up
constantly, it might be from about Jerdun. We drew rein and heard
the low boom of explosions: a steady flame appeared, grew greater
and divided into two. Perhaps the station was burning. We rode
quick, to ask Mastur.</p>

<p>However, his place was deserted, with only a jackal on the old
camping-ground. I decided to push ahead to Feisal. We trotted our
fastest, as the sun grew higher in the heavens. The road was
bestial with locusts&mdash;though from a little distance they
looked beautiful, silvering the air with the shimmer of their
wings. Summer had come upon us unawares; my seventh consecutive
summer in this East.</p>

<p>As we approached, we heard firing in front, on Semna, the
crescent mound which covered Maan. Parties of troops walked gently
up its face to halt below the crest. Evidently we had taken the
Semna, so we rode towards the new position. On the flat, this side
of it, we met a camel with litters. The man leading it said,
'Maulud Pasha', pointing to his load. I ran up, crying, 'Is Maulud
hit?' for he was one of the best officers in the army, a man also
most honest towards us; not, indeed, that admiration could anyhow
have been refused so sturdy and uncompromising a patriot. The old
man replied out of his litter in a weak voice, saying, 'Yes,
indeed, Lurens Bey, I am hurt: but, thanks be to God, it is
nothing. We have taken Semna'. I replied that I was going there.
Maulud craned himself feverishly over the edge of the litter,
hardly able to see or speak (his thigh-bone was splintered above
the knee), showing me point after point, for organizing the
hill-side defensively.</p>

<p>We arrived as the Turks were beginning to throw half-hearted
shells at it. Nuri Said was commanding in Maulud's place. He stood
coolly on the hill-top. Most men talked faster under fire, and
acted a betraying ease and joviality. Nuri grew calmer, and Zeid
bored.</p>

<p>I asked where Jaafar was. Nuri said that at midnight he was due
to have attacked Jerdun. I told him of the night-flares, which must
have marked his success. While we were glad together his messengers
arrived reporting prisoners and machine-guns; also the station and
three thousand rails destroyed. So splendid an effort would settle
the northern line for weeks. Then Nuri told me that the preceding
dawn he had rushed Ghadir el Haj station and wrecked it, with five
bridges and a thousand rails. So the southern line was also
settled.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon it grew deadly quiet. Both sides stopped
their aimless shelling. They said that Feisal had moved to Uheida.
We crossed the little flooded stream, by a temporary hospital where
Maulud lay. Mahmud, the red-bearded, defiant doctor, thought that
he would recover without amputation. Feisal was on the hilltop, on
the very edge, black against the sun, whose light threw a queer
haze about his slender figure, and suffused his head with gold,
through the floss-silk of his head-cloth. I made my camel kneel.
Feisal stretched out his hands crying, Please God, good?' I
replied, 'The praise and the victory be to God'. And he swept me
into his tent that we might exchange the news.</p>

<p>Feisal had heard from Dawnay more than I knew of the British
failure before Amman; of the bad weather and confusion, and how
Allenby had telephoned to Shea, and made one of his lightning
decisions to cut the loss; a wise decision, though it hurt us
sorely.</p>

<p>Joyce was in hospital, but mending well; and Dawnay lay ready at
Guweira to start for Mudowwara with all the cars.</p>

<p>Feisal asked me about Semna and Jaafar, and I told him what I
knew, and Nuri's opinion, and the prospect. Nuri had complained
that the Abu Tayi had done nothing for him all day. Auda denied it;
and I recalled the story of our first taking the plateau, and the
gibe by which I had shamed them into the charge at Aba el Lissan.
The tale was new to Feisal. Its raking-up hurt old Auda deeply. He
swore vehemently that he had done his best to-day, only conditions
were not favourable for tribal work: and, when I withstood him
further, he went out of the tent, very bitter.</p>

<p>Maynard and I spent the next days watching operations. The Abu
Tayi captured two outposts east of the station, while Saleh ibn
Shefia took a breastwork with a machine-gun and twenty prisoners.
These gains gave us liberty of movement round Maan; and on the
third day Jaafar massed his artillery on the southern ridge, while
Nuri Said led a storming party into the sheds of the railway
station. As he reached their cover the French guns ceased fire. We
were wandering in a Ford car, trying to keep up with the successive
advances, when Nuri, perfectly dressed and gloved, smoking his
briar pipe, met us and sent us back to Captain Pisani, artillery
commander, with an urgent appeal for support. We found Pisani
wringing his hands in despair, every round expended. He said he had
implored Nuri not to attack at this moment of his penury.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do, but see our men volleyed out of the
railway station again. The road was littered with crumpled khaki
figures, and the eyes of the wounded, gone rich with pain, stared
accusingly at us. The control had gone from their broken bodies and
their torn flesh shook them helplessly. We could see everything and
think dispassionately, but it was soundless: our hearing had been
taken away by the knowledge that we had failed.</p>

<p>Afterwards we understood that we had never expected such
excellent spirit from our infantry, who fought cheerfully under
machine-gun fire, and made clever use of ground. So little leading
was required that only three officers were lost. Maan showed us
that the Arabs were good enough without British stiffening. This
made us more free to plan: so the failure was not unredeemed.</p>

<p>On the morning of April the eighteenth, Jaafar wisely decided
that he could not afford more loss, and drew back to the Semna
positions while the troops rested. Being an old college friend of
the Turkish Commandant, he sent him a white-flagged letter,
inviting surrender. The reply said that they would love it, but had
orders to hold out to the last cartridge. Jaafar offered a respite,
in which they could fire off their reserves: but the Turks
hesitated till Jemal Pasha was able to collect troops from Amman,
re-occupy Jerdun, and pass a pack-convoy of food and ammunition
into the beleaguered town. The railway remained broken for
weeks.</p>

<p>Forthwith I took car to join Dawnay. I was uneasy at a regular
fighting his first guerilla battle with that most involved and
intricate weapon, the armoured car. Also Dawnay was no Arabist, and
neither Peake, his camel-expert, nor Marshall, his doctor, was
fluent. His troops were mixed, British, Egyptian and Bedouin. The
last two were antipathetic. So I drove into his camp above Tell
Shahm after midnight, and offered myself, delicately, as an
interpreter.</p>

<p>Fortunately he received me well, and took me round his lines. A
wonderful show. The cars were parked geometrically here; armoured
cars there; sentries and pickets were out, with machine-guns ready.
Even the Arabs were in a tactical place behind a hill, in support,
but out of sight and hearing: by some magic Sherif Hazaa and
himself had kept them where they were put. My tongue coiled into my
cheek with the wish to say that the only thing lacking was an
enemy.</p>

<p>His conversation as he unfolded his plan deepened my admiration
to unplumbed depths. He had prepared operation orders;
orthodox-sounding things with zero times and a sequence of
movements. Each unit had its appointed duty. We would attack the
'plain post' at dawn (armoured cars) from the vantage of the
hillock on which Joyce and myself had sat and laughed ruefully the
last abortive time. The cars, with closed cut-out, would 'take
station' before daylight, and carry the trenches by surprise.
Tenders 1 and 3 would then demolish bridges A and B on the
operations' plan (scale 1/250,000) at zero 1.30 hours while the
cars moved to Rock Post, and with the support of Hazaa and the
Arabs rushed it (zero 2.15).</p>

<p>Hornby and the explosives, in Talbots No., 40531 and 41226,
would move after them, and demolish bridges D, E and F, while the
force lunched. After lunch, when the low sun permitted sight
through the mirage, at zero 8 hours to be exact, the united mass
would attack South Post; the Egyptians from the East, the Arabs
from the North, covered by long range machine-gun fire from the
cars, and by Brodie's ten-pounder guns, sited on Observation
Hill.</p>

<p>The post would fall and the force transport itself to the
station of Tell Shahm, which would be shelled by Brodie from the
North-West, bombed by aeroplanes flying from the mud-flats of Rum
(at zero 10 hours) and approached by armoured cars from the west.
The Arabs would follow the cars, while Peake with his Camel Corps
descended from South Post. The station will be taken at zero 11.30'
said the scheme, breaking into humour at the last. But there it
failed, for the Turks, ignorantly and in haste, surrendered ten
minutes too soon, and made the only blot on a bloodless day.</p>

<p>In a liquid voice I inquired if Hazaa understood. I was informed
that as he had no watch to synchronize (by the way, would I please
put mine right now?) he would make his first move when the cars
turned northward and time his later actions by express order. I
crept away and hid myself for an hour's sleep.</p>

<p>At dawn we saw the cars roll silently on top of the sleeping
sandy trenches, and the astonished Turks walk out with their hands
up. It was like picking a ripe peach. Hornby dashed up in his two
Rolls tenders, put a hundredweight of gun-cotton under bridge A and
blew it up convincingly. The roar nearly lifted Dawnay and myself
out of our third tender, in which we sat grandly overseeing all:
and we ran in, to show Hornby the cheaper way of the drainage holes
as mine-chambers. Subsequent bridges came down for ten slabs
apiece.</p>

<p>While we were at bridge B the cars concentrated their
machine-guns on the parapet of Hock Post', a circle of thick stone
walls (very visible from their long early shadows) on a knoll too
steep for wheels. Hazaa was ready, willing and excited, and the
Turks so frightened by the splashing and splattering of the four
machine-guns that the Arabs took them almost in their stride. That
was peach the second.</p>

<p>Then it was interval for the others, but activity for Hornby,
and for myself, now assistant-engineer. We ran down the line in our
Rolls-Royces, carrying two tons of gun-cotton; bridges and rails
roared up wherever fancy dictated. The crews of the cars covered
us; and sometimes covered themselves, under their cars, when
fragments came sailing musically through the smoky air. One
twenty-pound flint clanged plumb on a turret-head and made a
harmless dint. At intervals everybody took photographs of the happy
bursts. It was fighting de luxe, and demolition de luxe: we enjoyed
ourselves. After the peripatetic lunch-hour we went off to see the
fall of 'south post'. It fell to its minute, but not properly.
Hazaa and his Amran were too wound up to advance soberly in
alternate rushes like Peake and the Egyptians. Instead they thought
it was a steeplechase, and did a camel-charge up the mound over
breastwork and trenches. The war-weary Turks gave it up in
disgust.</p>

<p>Then came the central act of the day, the assault upon the
station. Peake drew down towards it from the north, moving his men
by repeated exposure of himself; hardly, for they were not fierce
for honour. Brodie opened on it with his usual nicety, while the
aeroplanes circled round in their cold-blooded way, to drop
whistling bombs into its trenches. The armoured cars went forward
snuffling smoke, and through this haze a file of Turks waving white
things rose out of their main trench in a dejected fashion.</p>

<p>We cranked up our Rolls tenders; the Arabs leaped on to their
camels; Peake's now-bold men broke into a run, and the force
converged wildly upon the station. Our car won; and I gained the
station bell, a dignified piece of Damascus brass-work. The next
man took the ticket punch and the third the office stamp, while the
bewildered Turks stared at us, with a growing indignation that
their importance should be merely secondary.</p>

<p>A minute later, with a howl, the Beduin were upon the maddest
looting of their history. Two hundred rifles, eighty thousand
rounds of ammunition, many bombs, much food and clothing were in
the station, and everybody smashed and profited. An unlucky camel
increased the confusion by firing one of the many Turkish
trip-mines as it entered the yard. The explosion blew it arse over
tip, and caused a panic. They thought Brodie was opening up
again.</p>

<p>In the pause the Egyptian officer found an unbroken storehouse,
and put a guard of soldiers over it, because they were short of
food. Hazaa's wolves, not yet sated, did not recognize the
Egyptians' right to share equally. Shooting began: but by mediation
we obtained that the Egyptians pick first what rations they needed:
afterwards there followed a general scramble, which burst the
store-room walls.</p>

<p>The profit of Shahm was so great that eight out of every ten of
the Arabs were contented with it. In the morning only Hazaa and a
handful of men remained with us for further operations. Dawnay's
programme said Ramleh station; but his orders were inchoate, since
the position had not been examined. So we sent down Wade in his
armoured car, with a second car in support. He drove on,
cautiously, stage by stage, in dead silence. At last, without a
shot fired, he entered the station yard, carefully, for fear of the
mines, whose trip and trigger wires diapered the ground.</p>

<p>The station was closed up. He put half a belt through the door
and shutters, and, getting no reply, slipped out of his car,
searched the building, and found it empty of men, though full
enough of desirable goods to make Hazaa and the faithful remnant
prize their virtue aloud. We spent the day destroying miles more of
the unoccupied line, till we judged that we had done damage to
occupy the largest possible repair party for a fortnight.</p>

<p>The third day was to be Mudowwara, but we had no great hope or
force left. The Arabs were gone, Peake's men too little warlike.
However, Mudowwara might panic like Ramleh, so we slept the night
by our latest capture. The unwearied Dawnay set out sentries, who,
emulous of their smart commanding officer, did a Buckingham Palace
stunt up and down beside our would-be sleeping heads, till I got
up, and instructed them in the arts of desert-watching.</p>

<p>In the morning we set off to look at Mudowwara, driving like
kings splendidly in our roaring cars over the smooth plains of sand
and flint, with the low sun pale behind us in the east. The light
hid us till we were close in and saw that a long train stood in the
station. Reinforcement or evacuation? A moment afterwards they let
fly at us with four guns, of which two were active and accurate
little Austrian mountain howitzers. At seven thousand yards they
did admirable shooting, while we made off in undignified haste to
some distant hollows. Thence we made a wide circuit to where, with
Zaal, we had mined our first train. We blew up the long bridge
under which the Turkish patrol had slept out that tense midday.
Afterwards we returned to Ramleh, and persevered in destroying line
and bridges, to make our break permanent, a demolition too serious
for Fakhri ever to restore: while Feisal sent Mohammed el Dheilan
against the yet intact stations between our break and Maan. Dawnay
joined up with them, geographically, below the escarpment, a day
later; and so this eighty miles from Maan to Mudowwara, with its
seven stations, fell wholly into our hands. The active defence of
Medina ended with this operation.</p>

<p>A new officer, Young, came from Mesopotamia to reinforce our
staff. He was a regular of exceptional quality, with long and wide
experience of war, and perfect fluency in Arabic. His intended role
was to double mine, with the tribes, that our activity against the
enemy might be broader, and better directed. To let him play
<i>himself</i> in to our fresh conditions, I handed him over the
possibility of combining Zeid, Nasir and Mirzuk into an eighty-mile
long interruption of the railway from Maan northward, while I went
down to Akaba and took ship for Suez, to discuss futures with
Allenby.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XCV</h3>

<p>Dawnay met me, and we talked over our brief before going up to
Allenby's camp. There General Bols smiled happily at us, and said,
Well, we're in Salt all right'. To our amazed stares he went on
that the chiefs of the Beni Sakhr had come into Jericho one
morning, to offer the immediate co-operation of their twenty
thousand tribesmen at Themed; and in his bath next day he had
thought out a scheme, and fixed it all right.</p>

<p>I asked who the chief of the Beni Sakhr was, and he said Tahad':
triumphing in his efficient inroad into what had been my province.
It sounded madder and madder. I knew that Fahad could not raise
four hundred men; and, that at the moment there was not a tent on
Themed: they had moved south, to Young.</p>

<p>We hurried to the office for the real story, and learned that it
was, unfortunately, as Bols had said. The British cavalry had gone
impromptu up the hills of Moab on some airy promise of the Zebn
sheikhs; greedy fellows who had ridden into Jerusalem only to taste
Allenby's bounty but had there been taken at their mouth-value.</p>

<p>In this season there was no third partner at G.H.Q. Guy Dawnay,
brother of our gladiator, he who had made the Jerusalem plan, had
gone to Haig's staff: Bartholomew, who was to work out the autumn
drive upon Damascus, was still with Chetwode. So the executive of
Allenby's work in these months was unequal to the conception.</p>

<p>For, of course, this raid miscarried, while I was still in
Jerusalem, solacing myself against the inadequacy of Bols with
Storrs, now the urbane and artful Governor of the place. The Beni
Sakhr were supine in their tents or away with Young. General
Chauvel, without the help of one of them, saw the Turks re-open the
Jordan fords behind his back and seize the road by which he had
advanced. We escaped heavy disaster only because Allenby's instinct
for a situation showed him his danger just in time. Yet we suffered
painfully. The check taught the British to be more patient with
Feisal's difficulties; convinced the Turks that the Amman sector
was their danger point; and made the Beni Sakhr feel that the
English were past understanding: not great fighting men, perhaps,
but ready on the spur of the moment to be odd. So, in part, it
redeemed the Amman failure by its deliberate repetition of what had
looked accidental. At the same time it ruined the hopes which
Feisal had entertained of acting independently with the Beni Sakhr.
This cautious and very wealthy tribe asked for dependable
allies.</p>

<p>Our movement, clean-cut while alone with a simple enemy, was now
bogged in its partner's contingencies. We had to take our tune from
Allenby, and he was not happy. The German offensive in France was
stripping him of troops. He would retain Jerusalem, but could not
afford a casualty, much less an attack, for months. The War Office
promised him Indian divisions from Mesopotamia, and Indian drafts.
With these he would rebuild his army on the Indian model; perhaps,
after the summer, he might be again in fighting trim: but for the
moment we must both just hold on.</p>

<p>This he told me on May the fifth, the date chosen under the
Smuts arrangement for the heave northward of the whole army as
prelude to the fall of Damascus and Aleppo. As first phase of this
arrangement we had undertaken the liability of Maan: and Allenby's
pause stuck us with this siege of a superior force. In addition,
the Turks from Amman might now have leisure to sweep us off Aba el
Lissan, back to Akaba. In so nasty a situation the common habit of
joint operations&mdash;cursing the other partner&mdash;weighed
strongly upon me. However, Allenby's staunchness was aiming to
relieve us. He was threatening the enemy by a vast bridge-head
across Jordan, as if he were about to cross a third time. So he
would keep Amman tender. To strengthen us on our plateau he offered
what technical equipment we needed.</p>

<p>We took the opportunity to ask for repeated air-raids on the
Hejaz Railway. General Salmond was called in, and proved as
generous, in word and deed, as the Commander-in-Chief. The Royal
Air Force kept up a dull, troublesome pressure on Amman from now
till the fall of Turkey. Much of the inactivity of the enemy in our
lean season was due to the disorganization of their railway by
bombing. At tea-time Allenby mentioned the Imperial Camel Brigade
in Sinai, regretting that in the new stringency he must abolish it
and use its men as mounted reinforcements. I asked: 'What are you
going to do with their camels?' He laughed, and said, 'Ask
'Q'.'</p>

<p>Obediently, I went across the dusty garden, broke in upon the
Quartermaster-General, Sir Walter Campbell&mdash;very
Scotch&mdash;and repeated my question. He answered firmly that they
were earmarked as divisional transport for the second of the new
Indian divisions. I explained that I wanted two thousand of them.
His first reply was irrelevant; his second conveyed that I might go
on wanting. I argued, but he seemed unable to see my side at all.
Of course, it was of the nature of a 'Q' to be costive.</p>

<p>I returned to Allenby and said aloud, before his party, that
there were for disposal two thousand, two hundred riding-camels,
and thirteen hundred baggage camels. All were provisionally
allotted to transport; but, of course, riding-camels were
riding-camels. The staff whistled, and looked wise; as though they,
too, doubted whether riding-camels could carry baggage. A
technicality, even a sham one, might be helpful. Every British
officer understood animals, as a point of honour. So I was not
astonished when Sir Walter Campbell was asked to dine with the
Commander-in-Chief that night.</p>

<p>We sat on the right hand and on the left, and with the soup
Allenby began to talk about camels. Sir Walter broke out that the
providential dispersing of the camel brigade brought the transport
of the &mdash;th Division up to strength; a godsend, for the Orient
had been vainly ransacked for camels. He over-acted. Allenby, a
reader of Milton, had an acute sense of style: and the line was a
weak one. He cared nothing for strengths, the fetish of
administrative branches.</p>

<p>He looked at me with a twinkle, 'And what do you want them for?'
I replied hotly, 'To put a thousand men into Deraa any day you
please'. He smiled and shook his head at Sir Walter Campbell,
saying sadly, 'Q, you lose'. The goat became giddy and the sheep
sheepish. It was an immense, a regal gift; the gift of unlimited
mobility. The Arabs could now win their war when and where they
liked.</p>

<p>Next morning I was off to join Feisal in his cool eyrie at Aba
el Lissan. We discussed histories, tribes, migration, sentiments,
the spring rains, pasture, at length. Finally, I remarked that
Allenby had given us two thousand camels. Feisal gasped and caught
my knee, saying, 'How?' I told him all the story. He leaped up and
kissed me; then he clapped his hands loudly. Hejris' black shape
appeared at the tent-door. 'Hurry,' cried Feisal, 'call them.'
Hejris asked whom. 'Oh, Fahad, Abdulla el Feir, Auda, Motlog,
Zaal...' 'And not Mirzuk?' queried Hejris mildly. Feisal shouted at
him for a fool, and the black ran off; while I said, 'It is nearly
finished. Soon you can let me go'. He protested, saying that I must
remain with them always, and not just till Damascus, as I had
promised in Urn Lejj. I, who wanted so to get away.</p>

<p>Feet came pattering to the tent-door, and paused, while the
chiefs recovered their grave faces and set straight their
head-cloths for the entry. One by one they sat down stilly on the
rugs, each saying unconcernedly, 'Please God, good?' To each Feisal
replied, 'Praise God!' and they stared in wonder at his dancing
eyes.</p>

<p>When the last had rustled in, Feisal told them that God had sent
the means of victory&mdash;two thousand riding-camels. Our war was
to march unchecked to freedom, its triumphant end. They murmured in
astonishment; doing their best, as great men, to be calm; eyeing me
to guess my share in the event. I said, The bounty of Allenby...'
Zaal cut in swiftly for them all, 'God keep his life and yours'. I
replied, We have been made victorious', stood up, with a 'by your
leave' to Feisal, and slipped away to tell Joyce. Behind my back
they burst out into wild words of their coming wilder deeds:
childish, perhaps, but it would be a pretty war in which each man
did not feel that he was winning it.</p>

<p>Joyce also was gladdened and made smooth by the news of the two
thousand camels. We dreamed of the stroke to which they should be
put: of their march from Beersheba to Akaba: and where for two
months we could find grazing for this vast multitude of animals;
they must be broken from barley if they were to be of use to
us.</p>

<p>These were not pressing thoughts. We had, meanwhile, the need to
maintain ourselves all summer on the plateau, besieging Maan, and
keeping the railways cut. The task was difficult.</p>

<p>First, about supply. I had just thrown the existing arrangements
out of gear. The Egyptian Camel Transport companies had been
carrying steadily between Akaba and Aba el Lissan, but carrying
less and marching less than our least sanguine estimate. We urged
them to increase weights and speeds, but found ourselves up against
cast-iron corps regulations, framed to keep down the figures of
animal wastage. By increasing them slightly, we could double the
carrying capacity of the column; consequently, I had offered to
take over the animals and send back the Egyptian camel-men.</p>

<p>The British, being short of labour, jumped at my idea; almost
too quickly. We had a terrible scramble to improvise drivers upon
the moment. Goslett, single-handed, had hitherto done supplies,
transport, ordnance, paymaster, base commandant. The extra work was
cruelty to him. So Dawnay found Scott, a perfect Irishman, for base
commandant. He had good temper, capacity, spirit. Akaba breathed
quietly. Ordnance we gave to Bright, sergeant or sergeant-major:
and Young took over transport and quartermaster work.</p>

<p>Young had overstrained himself, riding furiously between Naimat,
Hejaia and Beni Sakhr, between Nasir and Mirzuk and Feisal,
striving to combine and move them in one piece. Incidentally he had
furiously overstrained the Arabs. In transport duties his drive and
ability would be better employed. Using his full power, he grappled
with the chaos. He had no stores for his columns, no saddles, no
clerks, no veterinaries, no drugs and few drivers, so that to run a
harmonious and orderly train was impossible; but Young very nearly
did it, in his curious ungrateful way. Thanks to him, the supply
problem of the Arab regulars on the plateau was solved.</p>

<p>All this time the face of our Revolt was growing. Feisal, veiled
in his tent, maintained incessantly the teaching and preaching of
his Arab movement. Akaba boomed: even our field-work was going
well. The Arab regulars had just had their third success against
Jerdun, the battered station which they made it almost a habit to
take and lose. Our armoured cars happened on a Turkish sortie from
Maan and smashed it in such style that the opportunity never
recurred. Zeid, in command of half the army posted north of Uheida,
was showing great vigour. His gaiety of spirit appealed more to the
professional officers than did Feisal's poetry and lean
earnestness; so this happy association of the two brothers gave
every sort of man a sympathy with one or other of the leaders of
the revolt.</p>

<p>Yet there were clouds in the north. At Amman was a forcible
Turkish concentration of troops earmarked for Maan when supply
conditions would let them move. This supply reserve was being put
in by rail from Damascus, as well as the bombing attacks of the
Royal Air Force from Palestine permitted.</p>

<p>To make head against them, Nasir, our best guerilla general, had
been appointed, in advance of Zeid, to do something great against
the railway. He had camped in Wadi Hesa, with Hornby, full of
explosives, and Peake's trained section of Egyptian Army Camel
Corps to help in demolition. Time, till Allenby recovered, was what
we had to fight for, and Nasir would very much help our desire if
he secured us a month's breathing space by playing the intangible
ghost at the Turkish Army. If he failed we must expect the relief
of Maan and an onslaught of the reinvigorated enemy upon Aba el
Lissan.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XCVI</h3>

<p>Nasir attacked Hesa station in his old fashion, cutting the line
to north and south the night before, and opening a sharp
bombardment of the buildings when it was light enough to see. Rasim
was the gunner and the gun our Krupp antiquity of Medina, Wejh and
Tafileh. When the Turks weakened, the Arabs charged into the
station, Beni Sakhr and Howeitat vying for the lead.</p>

<p>We had, of course, no killed; as was ever the way with such
tactics. Hornby and Peake reduced the place to a heap of ruins.
They blew in the well, the tanks, engines, pumps, buildings, three
bridges, rolling stock, and about four miles of rail. Next day
Nasir moved north, and destroyed Faraifra station. Peake and Hornby
continued work that day and the day following. Altogether it
sounded like our biggest demolition. I determined to go up and see
for myself.</p>

<p>A dozen of my men marched with me. Below the Rasheidiya ridge we
came to the lone tree, Shejerat el Tayar. My Hauranis drew rein
under its thorny branches, on which were impaled many tatters of
wayfarers' offered clothes. Mohammed said, 'Upon you, O Mustafa'.
Reluctantly Mustafa let himself down from his saddle and piece by
piece took off his clothes, till nearly naked, when he lay down
arching himself over the tumbled cairn. The other men dismounted,
picked each a thorn, and in solemn file drove them (hard and sharp
as brass) deep into his flesh and left them standing there. The
Ageyl stared open-mouthed at the ceremony, but before it ended
swung themselves monkey-like down, grinning lewdly, and stabbed in
their thorns where they would be most painful. Mustafa shivered
quietly till he heard Mohammed say, 'Get up', using the feminine
inflexion. He sadly pulled out the thorns, dressed, and remounted.
Abdulla knew no reason for the punishment: and the Hauranis' manner
showed that they did not wish me to ask them. We reached Hesa to
find Nasir, with six hundred men, concealed under cliffs and
bushes, afraid of enemy aircraft, which had killed many. One bomb
had fallen into a pool while eleven camels had been drinking, and
had thrown them all, dead, in a ring about the water-side among
torn flowers of oleander. We wrote to Air-Vice-Marshal Salmond for
a revengeful counter-stroke.</p>

<p>The railway was still in Nasir's hand, and whenever they had
explosives Hornby and Peake went down to it. They had blown in a
cutting, and were developing a new rail-demolition, turning over
each section by main force, as it was cut. From Sultani in the
north to Jurf in the south, the damage extended. Fourteen miles.
Nasir fully understood the importance of maintaining his activity,
and there seemed a fair hope of his lasting. He had found a
comfortable and bomb-proof cave between two limestone reefs which,
articulated like teeth, broke out from the green hill-side. The
heat and flies in the valley were not yet formidable. It was
running with water: fertile with pasture. Behind lay Tafileh; and
if Nasir were hard pressed he had only to send a message, and the
mounted peasantry of the villages, on their rough ponies jangling
with shrill bells, would come pouring over the range to his
support.</p>

<p>The day of our arrival the Turks sent a force of camel corps,
cavalry and infantry, down to re-occupy Faraifra as a first
counter-stroke. Nasir at once was up and at them. While his
machine-guns kept down the Turks' heads, the Abu Tayi charged up to
within a hundred yards of the crumbling wall which was the only
defence, and cut out all the camels and some horses. To expose
riding-animals to the sight of Beduins was a sure way to lose
them.</p>

<p>Afterwards I was down with Auda, near the fork of the valley,
when there came the throbbing and moaning overhead of Mercedes
engines. Nature stilled itself before the master noise; even the
birds and insects hushed. We crawled between fallen boulders, and
heard the first bomb drop lower in the valley where Peake's camp
lay hidden in a twelve-foot oleander thicket. The machines were
flying towards us, for the next bombs were nearer; and the last
fell just in front, with a shattering, dusty roar, by our captured
camels.</p>

<p>When the smoke cleared, two of them were kicking in agony on the
ground. A faceless man, spraying blood from a fringe of red flesh
about his neck, stumbled screaming towards our rocks. He crashed
blindly over one and another, tripping and scrambling with arms
outstretched, maddened by pain. In a moment he lay quiet, and we
who had scattered from him ventured near: but he was dead.</p>

<p>I went back to Nasir, safe in his cave with Nawaf el Faiz,
brother of Mithgal, head of the Beni Sakhr. Nawaf, a shifty man,
was so full and careful of his pride that he would stoop to any
private meanness to preserve it publicly: but then he was mad, like
all the Faiz clan; uncertain like them; and voluble, with
flickering eyes.</p>

<p>Our acquaintance of before the war had been renewed secretly a
year before, when three of us crept in after sunset to their rich
family tents near Ziza. Fawaz, the senior Faiz, was a notable Arab,
a committeeman of the Damascus group, prominent in the party of
independence. He received me with fair words and hospitality, fed
us richly, and brought out, after we had talked, his richest
bed-quilts.</p>

<p>I had slept an hour or two when a charged voice whispered
through a smoke-smelling beard into my ear. It was Nawaf, the
brother, to say that, behind the friendly seeming, Fawaz had sent
horsemen to Ziza, and soon the troops would be here to take me. We
were certainly caught. My Arabs crouched in their place, meaning to
fight like cornered animals, and kill at least some of the enemy
before they themselves died. Such tactics displeased me. When
combats came to the physical, bare hand against hand, I was
finished. The disgust of being touched revolted me more than the
thought of death and defeat: perhaps because one such terrible
struggle in my youth had given me an enduring fear of contact: or
because I so reverenced my wits and despised my body that I would
not be beholden to the second for the life of the first.</p>

<p>I whispered to Nawaf for counsel. He crawled back through the
tent-curtain; we followed dragging my few things in their light
saddle-pouch. Behind the next tent, his own, sat the camels,
knee-haltered and saddled. We mounted circumspectly. Nawaf led out
his mare, and guided us, loaded rifle across his thigh, to the
railway and beyond it into the desert. There he gave us the
star-direction of our supposed goal in Bair. A few days later
Sheikh Fawaz was dead.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XCVII</h3>

<p>I explained to Feisal that Nasir's cutting of the line would
endure another month; and, after the Turks had got rid of him, it
would be yet a third month before they attacked us in Aba el
Lissan. By then our new camels should be fit for use in an
offensive of our own. I suggested that we ask his father, King
Hussein, to transfer to Akaba the regular units at present with Ali
and Abdulla. Their reinforcement would raise us to ten thousand
strong, in uniformed men.</p>

<p>We would divide them into three parts. The immobile would
constitute a retaining force to hold Maan quiet. A thousand, on our
new camels, would attack the Deraa-Damascus sector. The balance
would form a second expedition, of two or three thousand infantry,
to move into the Beni Sakhr country and connect with Allenby at
Jericho. The long-distance mounted raid, by taking Deraa or
Damascus, would compel the Turks to withdraw from Palestine one
division, or even two, to restore their communications. By so
weakening the enemy, we would give Allenby the power to advance his
line, at any rate to Nablus. The fall of Nablus would cut the
lateral communication which made the Turks strong in Moab; and they
would be compelled to fall back on Amman, yielding us quiet
possession of the Jordan bottom. Practically I was proposing that
we use up the Hauran Arabs to let us reach Jericho, half-way to our
Damascus goal. Feisal fell in with the proposal, and gave me
letters to his father advising it. Unhappily the old man was,
nowadays, little inclined to take his advice, out of green-eyed
hatred for this son who was doing too well and was being
disproportionately helped by the British. For dealing with the King
I relied on joint-action by Wingate and Allenby, his paymasters. I
decided to go up to Egypt personally, to press them to write him
letters of the necessary stiffness. In Cairo, Dawnay agreed both to
the transfer of the southern regulars, and to the independent
offensive. We went to Wingate, argued it, and convinced him that
the ideas were good. He wrote letters to King Hussein, strongly
advising the reinforcement of Feisal. I pressed him to make clear
to the King that the continuance of a war-subsidy would depend on
his giving effect to our advice: but he refused to be stringent,
and couched the letter in terms of politeness, which would be lost
on the hard and suspicious old man in Mecca.</p>

<p>Yet the effort promised so much for us that we went up to
Allenby, to beg his help with the King. At G.H.Q., we felt a
remarkable difference in the air. The place was, as always,
throbbing with energy and hope, but now logic and co-ordination
were manifest in an uncommon degree. Allenby had a curious
blindness of judgement in choosing men, due largely to his positive
greatness, which made good qualities in his subordinates seem
superfluous; but Chetwode, not content, had interposed again,
setting up Bartholomew, his own Chief of Staff, in the third place
of the hierarchy. Bartholomew, not made, like Dawnay, with many
foreign sides to his imagination, was yet more intricate, yet more
polished as a soldier, more careful and conscientious, and seemed a
friendly team-leader.</p>

<p>We unrolled before him our scheme to start the ball rolling in
the autumn, hoping by our pushes to make it possible for him to
come in later vigorously to our support. He listened smiling, and
said that we were three days too late. Their new army was arriving
to time from Mesopotamia and India; prodigious advances in grouping
and training were being made. On June the fifteenth it had been the
considered opinion of a private conference that the army would be
capable of a general and sustained offensive in September.</p>

<p>The sky was, indeed, opening over us; and we went in to Allenby,
who said outright that late in September he would make a grand
attack to fulfil the Smuts' plan even to Damascus and Aleppo. Our
role would be as laid down in the spring; we must make the Deraa
raid on the two thousand new camels. Times and details would be
fixed as the weeks went on, and as Bartholomew's calculations took
shape.</p>

<p>Our hopes of victory had been too often dashed for me to take
this as assured. So, for second string, I got Allenby's blessing
upon the transfer of Ali's and Abdulla's khaki-clad contingents;
and set off, fortified, to Jeddah, where I had no more success than
I expected. The King had got wind of my purpose and took refuge, on
the pretext of Ramadhan, in Mecca, his inaccessible capital. We
talked over the telephone, King Hussein sheltering himself behind
the incompetence of the operators in the Mecca exchange, whenever
the subject turned dangerous. My thronged mind was not in the mood
for farce, so I rang off, put Feisal's, Wingate's and Allenby's
letters back unopened into my bag and returned to Cairo in the next
ship.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XCVIII</h3>

<p>On July the eleventh Dawnay and I were again talking to Allenby
and Bartholomew, and, of their generosity and confidence, seeing
the undress working of a general's mind. It was an experience:
technical, reassuring, and very valuable to me, who was mildly a
general, too, in my own odd show. Bols was on leave while the plans
were working out. Sir Walter Campbell also was absent; Bartholomew
and Evans, their deputies, plotted to re-arrange the army
transport, regardless of formations, with such elasticity that any
pursuit could be sustained.</p>

<p>Allenby's confidence was like a wall. Before the attack he went
to see his troops massed in secrecy, waiting the signal, and told
them he was sure, with their good help, of thirty thousand
prisoners; this, when the whole game turned on a chance!
Bartholomew was most anxious. He said it would be desperate work to
have the whole army re-formed by September, and, even if they were
ready (actually some brigades existed as such for the first time
when they went over) we must not assume that the attack would
follow as planned. It could be delivered only in the coastal
sector, opposite Ramleh, the railhead, where only could a necessary
reserve of stores be gathered. This seemed so obvious that he could
not dream of the Turks staying blind, though momently their
dispositions ignored it.</p>

<p>Allenby's plan was to collect the bulk of his infantry and all
his cavalry under the orange and olive groves of Ramlegh just
before September the nineteenth. Simultaneously he hoped to make in
the Jordan Valley such demonstrations as should persuade the Turks
of a concentration there in progress. The two raids to Salt had
fixed the Turks' eyes exclusively beyond Jordan. Every move there,
whether of British or Arabs, was accompanied by counter-precautions
on the Turks' part, showing how fearful they were. In the coast
sector, the area of real danger, the enemy had absurdly few men.
Success hung on maintaining them in this fatal misappreciation.</p>

<p>After the Meinertzhagen success, deceptions, which for the
ordinary general were just witty hors d'oeuvres before battle,
became for Allenby a main point of strategy. Bartholomew would
accordingly erect (near Jericho) all condemned tents in Egypt;
would transfer veterinary hospitals and sick lines there; would put
dummy camps, dummy horses and dummy troops wherever there was
plausible room; would throw more bridges across the river; would
collect and open against enemy country all captured guns; and on
the right days would ensure the movement of non-combatant bodies
along the dusty roads, to give the impression of eleventh-hour
concentrations for an assault. At the same time the Royal Air Force
was going to fill the air with husbanded formations of the latest
fighting machines. The preponderance of these would deprive the
enemy for days of the advantage of air reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Bartholomew wished us to supplement his efforts with all vigour
and ingenuity, from our side of Amman. Yet he warned us that, even
with this, success would hang on a thread, since the Turks could
save themselves and their army, and give us our concentration to do
over again, by simply retiring their coast sector seven or eight
miles. The British Army would then be like a fish flapping on dry
land, with its railways, its heavy artillery, its dumps, its
stores, its camps all misplaced; and without olive groves in which
to hide its concentration next time. So, while he guaranteed that
the British were doing their utmost, he implored us not to engage
the Arabs, on his behalf, in a position from which they could not
escape.</p>

<p>The noble prospect sent Dawnay and myself back to Cairo in great
fettle and cogitation. News from Akaba had raised again the
question of defending the plateau against the Turks, who had just
turned Nasir out of Hesa and were contemplating a stroke against
Aba el Lissan about the end of August, when our Deraa detachment
should start. Unless we could delay the Turks another fortnight,
their threat might cripple us. A new factor was urgently
required.</p>

<p>At this juncture Dawnay was inspired to think of the surviving
battalion of the Imperial Camel Corps. Perhaps G.H.Q., might lend
it us to confuse the Turks' reckoning. We telephoned Bartholomew,
who understood, and backed our request to Bols in Alexandria, and
to Allenby. After an active telegraphing, we got our way. Colonel
Buxton, with three hundred men, was lent to us for a month on two
conditions: first, that we should forthwith furnish their scheme of
operations; second, that they should have no casualties.
Bartholomew felt it necessary to apologize for the last
magnificent, heartwarming condition, which he thought
unsoldierly.</p>

<p>Dawnay and I sat down with a map and measured that Buxton should
march from the Canal to Akaba; thence, by Rum, to carry Mudowwara
by night-attack; thence by Bair, to destroy the bridge and tunnel
near Amman; and back to Palestine on August the thirtieth. Their
activity would give us a peaceful month, in which our two thousand
new camels could learn to graze, while carrying the extra dumps of
forage and food which Buxton's force would expect.</p>

<p>As we worked out these schemes, there came from Akaba one more
elaborate, worked out graphically by Young for Joyce, on our June
understanding for independent Arab operations in Hauran. They had
figured out the food, ammunition, forage, and transport for two
thousand men of all ranks, from Aba el Lissan to Deraa. They had
taken into consideration all our resources and worked out schedules
by which dumps would be completed and the attack begun in
November.</p>

<p>Even had Allenby not pulled his army together this scheme would
have broken down intrinsically. It depended on the immediate
reinforcement of the Arab Army at Aba el Lissan, which King Hussein
had refused; also November was too near to winter with its muddy
impassable roads in the Hauran.</p>

<p>Weather and strengths might be matters of opinion: but Allenby
meant to attack on September the nineteenth, and wanted us to lead
off not more than four nor less than two days before he did. His
words to me were that three men and a boy with pistols in front of
Deraa on September the sixteenth would fill his conception; would
he better than thousands a week before or a week after. The truth
was, he cared nothing for our fighting power, and did not reckon us
part of his tactical strength. Our purpose, to him, was moral,
psychological, diathetic; to keep the enemy command intent upon the
trans-Jordan front. In my English capacity I shared this view, but
on my Arab side both agitation and battle seemed equally important,
the one to serve the joint success, the other to establish Arab
self-respect, without which victory would not be wholesome.</p>

<p>So, unhesitatingly, we laid the Young scheme aside and turned to
build up our own. To reach Deraa from Aba el Lissan would take a
fortnight: the cutting of the three railways and withdrawal to
reform in the desert, another week. Our raiders must carry their
maintenance for three weeks. The picture of what this meant was in
my head&mdash;we had been doing it for two years&mdash;and so at
once I gave Dawnay my estimate that our two thousand camels, in a
single journey, without advanced depots or supplementary supply
columns, would suffice five hundred regular mounted infantry, the
battery of French quick-firing "point 65" mountain guns,
proportionate machine-guns, two armoured cars, sappers,
camel-scouts, and two aeroplanes until we had fulfilled our
mission. This seemed like a liberal reading of Allenby's three men
and a boy. We told Bartholomew, and received G.H.Q. blessing.</p>

<p>Young and Joyce were not best pleased when I returned to say
that the great schedule had been torn up. I did not call their
plans top-heavy and too late: I threw the onus of change on
Allenby's recovery. My new proposal&mdash;for which in advance I
had pledged their performance&mdash;was an intricate dovetailing in
the next crowded month and a half, of a 'spoiling' raid by the
British Camel Corps and the main raid to surprise the Turks by
Deraa.</p>

<p>Joyce felt that I had made a mistake. To introduce foreigners
would unman the Arabs; and to let them go a month later would be
even worse. Young returned a stubborn, combative 'impossible' to my
idea. The Camel Corps would engross the baggage camels, which
otherwise might have enabled the Deraa force to reach its goal. By
trying to do two greedy things I should end in doing neither. I
argued my case and we had a battle.</p>

<p>In the first place I tackled Joyce concerning the Imperial Camel
Corps. They would arrive one morning at Akaba&mdash;no Arab
suspecting them&mdash;and would vanish equally suddenly towards
Rumm. From Mudowwara to Kissir bridge they would march in the
desert, far from the sight of the Arab Army, and from the hearing
of the villages. In the resultant vagueness the enemy intelligence
would conclude that the whole of the defunct camel brigade was now
on Feisal's front. Such an accession of shock-strength to Feisal
would make the Turks very tender of the safety of their railway:
while Buxton's appearance at Kissir, apparently on preliminary
reconnaissance, would put credence into the wildest tales of our
intention shortly to attack Amman. Joyce, disarmed by these
reasonings, now backed me with his favourable opinion.</p>

<p>For Young's transport troubles I had little sympathy. He, a new
comer, said my problems were insoluble: but I had done such things
casually, without half his ability and concentration; and knew they
were not even difficult. For the Camel Corps, we left him to
grapple with weights and time-tables, since the British Army was
his profession; and though he would not promise anything (except
that it could not be done), done of course it was, and two or three
days before the necessary time. The Deraa raid was a different
proposition, and point by point I disputed his conception of its
nature and equipment.</p>

<p>I crossed out forage, the heaviest item, after Bair. Young
became ironic upon the patient endurance of camels: but this year
the pasture was grand in the Azrak Deraa region. From the men's
food I cut off provision for the second attack, and the return
journey. Young supposed aloud that the men would fight well hungry.
I explained that we would live on the country. Young thought it a
poor country to live on. I called it very good.</p>

<p>He said that the ten days' march home after the attacks would be
a long fast: but I had no intention of coming back to Akaba. Then
might he ask if it was defeat or victory which was in my mind? I
pointed out how each man had a camel under him, and if we killed
only six camels a day the whole force would feed abundantly. Yet
this did not solace him. I went on to cut down his petrol, cars,
ammunition, and everything else to the exact point, without margin,
which would meet what we planned. In riposte he became aggressively
regular. I prosed forth on my hoary theorem that we lived by our
raggedness and beat the Turk by our uncertainty. Young's scheme was
faulty, because precise.</p>

<p>Instead, we would march a camel column of one thousand men to
Azrak where their concentration must be complete on September the
thirteenth. On the sixteenth we would envelop Deraa, and cut its
railways. Two days later we would fall back east of the Hejaz
Railway and wait events with Allenby. As reserve against accident
we would purchase barley in Jebel Druse, and store it at Azrak.</p>

<p>Nuri Shaalan would accompany us with a contingent of Rualla:
also the Serdiyeh; the Serahin; and Haurani peasants of the 'Hollow
Land', under Talal el Hareidhin. Young thought it a deplorable
adventure. Joyce, who had loved our dog-fight conference, was game
to try, though doubting I was ambitious. However, it was sure that
both would do their best, since the thing was already settled; and
Dawnay had helped the organizing side by getting us from G.H.Q.,
the loan of Stirling, a skilled staff officer, tactful and wise.
Stirling's passion for horses was a passport to intimacy with
Feisal and the chiefs.</p>

<p>Among the Arab officers were distributed some British military
decorations, tokens of their gallantry about Maan. These marks of
Allenby's esteem heartened the Arab Army. Nuri Pasha Said offered
to command the Deraa expedition, for which his courage, authority
and coolness marked him as the ideal leader. He began to pick for
it the best four hundred men in the army.</p>

<p>Pisani, the French commandant, fortified by a Military Cross,
and in urgent pursuit of a D.S.O., took bodily possession of the
four Schneider guns which Cousse had sent down to us after Bremond
left; and spent agonized hours with Young, trying to put the
scheduled ammunition, and mule-forage, with his men and his own
private kitchen on to one-half the requisite camels. The camps
buzzed with eagerness and preparation, and all promised well.</p>

<p>Our own family rifts were distressing, but inevitable. The Arab
affair had now outgrown our rough and ready help-organization. But
the next was probably the last act, and by a little patience we
might make our present resources serve. The troubles were only
between ourselves, and thanks to the magnificent unselfishness of
Joyce, we preserved enough of team-spirit to prevent a complete
breakdown, however high-handed I appeared: and I had a reserve of
confidence to carry the whole thing, if need be, on my shoulders.
They used to think me boastful when I said so: but my confidence
was not so much ability to do a thing perfectly, as a preference
for botching it somehow rather than letting it go altogether by
default.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XCIX</h3>

<p>It was now the end of July, and by the end of August the Deraa
expedition must be on the road. In the meantime Buxton's Camel
Corps had to be guided through their programme, Nuri Shaalan
warned, the armoured cars taught their road to Azrak, and
landing-grounds found for aeroplanes. A busy month. Nuri Shaalan,
the furthest, was tackled first. He was called to meet Feisal at
Jefer about August the seventh. Buxton's force seemed the second
need. I told Feisal, under seal, of their coming. To ensure their
having no casualties, they must strike Mudowwara with absolute
surprise. I would guide them myself to Rumm, in the first critical
march through the fag-ends of Howeitat about Akaba.</p>

<p>Accordingly I went down to Akaba, where Buxton let me explain to
each company their march, and the impatient nature of the Allies
whom they, unasked, had come to help; begging them to turn the
other cheek if there was a row; partly because they were better
educated than the Arabs, and therefore less prejudiced; partly
because they were very few. After such solemnities came the ride up
the oppressive gorge of Itm, under the red cliffs of Nejed and over
the breast-like curves of Imran&mdash;that slow preparation for
Rumm's greatness&mdash;till we passed through the gap before the
rock Khuzail, and into the inner shrine of the springs, with its
worship-compelling coolness. There the landscape refused to be
accessory, but took the skies, and we chattering humans became dust
at its feet.</p>

<p>In Rumm the men had their first experience of watering in
equality with Arabs, and found it troublesome. However, they were
wonderfully mild, and Buxton was an old Sudan official, speaking
Arabic, and understanding nomadic ways; very patient,
good-humoured, sympathetic. Hazaa was helpful in admonishing the
Arabs, and Stirling and Marshall, who accompanied the column, were
familiars of the Beni Atiyeh. Thanks to their diplomacy, and to the
care of the British rank and file, nothing untoward happened.</p>

<p>I stayed at Rumm for their first day, dumb at the unreality of
these healthy-looking fellows, like stiff-bodied school boys in
their shirt-sleeves and shorts, as they wandered, anonymous and
irresponsible, about the cliffs which had been my private resort.
Three years of Sinai had burned the colour from their tanned faces,
in which the blue eyes flickered weakly against the dark possessed
gaze of the Beduin. For the rest they were a broad-faced,
low-browed people, blunt-featured beside the fine-drawn Arabs whom
generations of in-breeding had sharpened to a radiance ages older
than the primitive, blotched, honest Englishmen. Continental
soldiers looked lumpish beside our lean-bred fellows: but against
my supple Nejdis the British in their turn looked lumpish.</p>

<p>Later I rode for Akaba, through the high-walled Itm, alone now
with six silent, unquestioning guards, who followed after me like
shadows, harmonious and submerged in their natural sand and bush
and hill; and a home-sickness came over me, stressing vividly my
outcast life among these Arabs, while I exploited their highest
ideals and made their love of freedom one more tool to help England
win.</p>

<p>It was evening, and on the straight bar of Sinai ahead the low
sun was falling, its globe extravagantly brilliant in my eyes,
because I was dead-tired of my life, longing as seldom before for
the moody skies of England. This sunset was fierce, stimulant,
barbaric; reviving the colours of the desert like a
draught&mdash;as indeed it did each evening, in a new miracle of
strength and heat&mdash;while my longings were for weakness, chills
and grey mistiness, that the world might not be so crystalline
clear, so definitely right and wrong.</p>

<p>We English, who lived years abroad among strangers, went always
dressed in the pride of our remembered country, that strange entity
which had no part with the inhabitants, for those who loved England
most, often liked Englishmen least. Here, in Arabia, in the war's
need, I was trading my honesty for her sustenance, inevitably.</p>

<p>In Akaba the rest of my bodyguard were assembled, prepared for
victory, for I had promised the Hauran men that they should pass
this great feast in their freed villages: and its date was near. So
for the last time we mustered on the windy beach by the sea's edge,
the sun on its brilliant waves glinting in rivalry with my flashing
and changing men. They were sixty. Seldom had the Zaagi brought so
many of his troop together, and as we rode into the brown hills for
Guweira he was busy sorting them in Ageyl fashion, centre and
wings, with poets and singers on the right and left. So our ride
was musical. It hurt him I would not have a banner, like a
prince.</p>

<p>I was on my Ghazala, the old grandmother camel, now again
magnificently fit. Her foal had lately died, and Abdulla, who rode
next me, had skinned the little carcase, and carried the dry pelt
behind his saddle, like a crupper piece. We started well, thanks to
the Zaagi's chanting, but after an hour Ghazala lifted her head
high, and began to pace uneasily, picking up her feet like a
sword-dancer.</p>

<p>I tried to urge her: but Abdulla dashed alongside me, swept his
cloak about him, and sprang from his saddle, calfs skin in hand. He
lighted with a splash of gravel in front of Ghazala, who had come
to a standstill, gently moaning. On the ground before her he spread
the little hide, and drew her head down to it. She stopped crying,
shuffled its dryness thrice with her lips; then again lifted her
head and, with a whimper, strode forward. Several times in the day
this happened; but afterwards she seemed to forget.</p>

<p>At Guweira, Siddons had an aeroplane waiting. Nuri Shaalan and
Feisal wanted me at once in Jefer. The air was thin and bumpy, so
that we hardly scraped over the crest of Shtar. I sat wondering if
we would crash, almost hoping it. I felt sure Nuri was about to
claim fulfilment of our dishonourable half-bargain, whose execution
seemed more impure than its thought. Death in the air would be a
clean escape; yet I scarcely hoped it, not from fear, for I was too
tired to be much afraid: nor from scruple, for our lives seemed to
me absolutely our own, to keep or give away: but from habit, for
lately I had risked myself only when it seemed profitable to our
cause.</p>

<p>I was busy compartmenting-up my mind, finding instinct and
reason as ever at strong war. Instinct said 'Die', but reason said
that was only to cut the mind's tether, and loose it into freedom:
better to seek some mental death, some slow wasting of the brain to
sink it below these puzzlements. An accident was meaner than
deliberate fault. If I did not hesitate to risk my life, why fuss
to dirty it? Yet life and honour seemed in different categories,
not able to be sold one for another: and for honour, had I not lost
that a year ago when I assured the Arabs that England kept her
plighted word?</p>

<p>Or was honour like the Sybil's leaves, the more that was lost
the more precious the little left? Its part equal to the whole? My
self-secrecy had left me no arbiter of responsibility. The debauch
of physical work yet ended in a craving for more, while the
everlasting doubt, the questioning, bound up my mind in a giddy
spiral and left me never space for thought.</p>

<p>So we came at last, alive, to Jefer, where met us Feisal and
Nuri in the smoothest spirits, with no mention of my price. It
seemed incredible that this old man had freely joined our youth.
For he was very old; livid, and worn, with a grey sorrow and
remorse about him and a bitter smile the only mobility of his face.
Upon his coarse eyelashes the eyelids sagged down in tired folds,
through which, from the overhead sun, a red light glittered into
his eye-sockets and made them look like fiery pits in which the man
was slowly burning. Only the dead black of his dyed hair, only the
dead skin of the face, with its net of lines, betrayed his seventy
years.</p>

<p>There was ceremonial talk about this little-spoken leader, for
with him were the head men of his tribe, famous sheikhs so bodied
out with silks of their own wearing, or of Feisal's gift, that they
rustled like women while moving in slow state like oxen. First of
them was Fans: like Hamlet, not forgiving Nuri his murdered father,
Sottam: a lean man with drooping moustache, and white, unnatural
face, who met the hidden censure of the world with a soft manner
and luscious, deprecating voice. '<i>Yifham</i>' he squeaked of me
in astonishment 'He understands our Arabic'. Trad and Sultan were
there, round-eyed, grave, and direct-spoken; honourable figures of
men, and great leaders of cavalry. Also Mijhem, the rebellious, had
been brought in by Feisal and reconciled with his unwilling uncle,
who seemed only half to tolerate his small-featured bleak presence
beside him, though Mijhem's manner was eagerly friendly.</p>

<p>Mijhem was a great leader too, Trad's rival in the conduct of
raids, but weak and cruel at heart. He sat next Khalid, Trad's
brother, another healthy, cheerful rider, like Trad in face, but
not so full a man. Durzi ibn Dughmi swelled in and welcomed me,
reminding me ungratefully of his greediness at Nebk: a one-eyed,
sinister, hook-nosed man; heavy, menacing and mean, but brave.
There was the Khaffaji, the spoilt child of Nuri's age, who looked
for equality of friendliness from me, because of his father, and
not for any promise in himself: he was young enough to be glad of
the looming adventure of war and proud of his new bristling
weapons.</p>

<p>Bender, the laughing boy, fellow in years and play with the
Khaffaji, tripped me before them all by begging for a place in my
bodyguard. He had heard from my Rahail, his foster-brother, of
their immoderate griefs and joys, and servitude called to him with
its unwholesome glamour. I fenced, and when he pleaded further,
turned it by muttering that I was not a King to have Shaalan
servants. Nuri's sombre look met mine for a moment, in
approval.</p>

<p>Beside me sat Rahail, peacocking his lusty self in strident
clothes. Under cover of the conversation he whispered me the name
of each chief. They had not to ask who I was, for my clothes and
appearance were peculiar in the desert. It was notoriety to be the
only cleanshaven one, and I doubled it by wearing always the
suspect pure silk, of the whitest (at least outside), with a gold
and crimson Meccan head-rope, and gold dagger. By so dressing I
staked a claim which Feisal's public consideration of me
confirmed.</p>

<p>Many times in such councils had Feisal won over and set aflame
new tribes, many times had the work fallen to me; but never until
to-day had we been actively together in one company, reinforcing
and relaying one another, from our opposite poles: and the work
went like child's play; the Rualla melted in our double heat. We
could move them with a touch and a word. There was tenseness, a
holding of breath, the glitter of belief in their thin eyes so
fixed on us.</p>

<p>Feisal brought nationality to their minds in a phrase, which set
them thinking of Arab history and language; then he dropped into
silence for a moment: for with these illiterate masters of the
tongue words were lively, and they liked to savour each, unmingled,
on the palate. Another phrase showed them the spirit of Feisal,
their fellow and leader, sacrificing everything for the national
freedom; and then silence again, while they imagined him day and
night in his tent, teaching, preaching, ordering and making
friends: and they felt something of the idea behind this pictured
man sitting there iconically, drained of desires, ambitions,
weakness, faults; so rich a personality enslaved by an abstraction,
made one-eyed, one armed, with the one sense and purpose, to live
or die in its service.</p>

<p>Of course it was a picture-man; not flesh and blood, but
nevertheless true, for his individuality had yielded its third
dimension to the idea, had surrendered the world's wealth and
artifices. Feisal was hidden in his tent, veiled to remain our
leader: while in reality he was nationality's best servant, its
tool, not its owner. Yet in the tented twilight nothing seemed more
noble.</p>

<p>He went on to conjure up for them the trammelled enemy on the
eternal defensive, whose best end was to have done no more than the
necessary. While we abstinents swam calmly and coolly in the
friendly silence of the desert, till pleased to come ashore.</p>

<p>Our conversation was cunningly directed to light trains of their
buried thoughts; that the excitement might be their own and the
conclusions native, not inserted by us. Soon we felt them kindle:
we leaned back, watching them move and speak, and vivify each other
with mutual heat, till the air was vibrant, and in stammered
phrases they experienced the first heave and thrust of notions
which ran up beyond their sight. They turned to hurry us,
themselves the begetters, and we laggard strangers: strove to make
us comprehend the full intensity of their belief; forgot us;
flashed out the means and end of our desire. A new tribe was added
to our comity: though Nuri's plain 'Yes' at the end carried more
than all had said.</p>

<p>In our preaching there was nothing merely nervous. We did our
best to exclude the senses, that our support might be slow,
durable, unsentimental. We wanted no rice-converts. Persistently we
did refuse to let our abundant and famous gold bring over those not
spiritually convinced. The money was a confirmation; mortar, not
building stone. To have bought men would have put our movement on
the base of interest; whereas our followers must be ready to go all
the way without other mixture in their motives than human frailty.
Even I, the stranger, the godless fraud inspiring an alien
nationality, felt a delivery from the hatred and eternal
questioning of self in my imitation of their bondage to the idea;
and this despite the lack of instinct in my own performance.</p>

<p>For naturally I could not long deceive myself; but my part was
worked out so flippantly that none but Joyce, Nesib and Mohammed el
Dheilan seemed to know I was acting. With man-instinctive, anything
believed by two or three had a miraculous sanction to which
individual ease and life might honestly be sacrificed. To
man-rational, wars of nationality were as much a cheat as religious
wars, and nothing was worth fighting for: nor could fighting, the
act of fighting, hold any need of intrinsic virtue. Life was so
deliberately private that no circumstances could justify one man in
laying violent hands upon another's: though a man's own death was
his last free will, a saving grace and measure of intolerable
pain.</p>

<p>We made the Arabs strain on tip-toe to reach our creed, for it
led to works, a dangerous country where men might take the deed for
the will. My fault, my blindness of leadership (eager to find a
quick means to conversion) allowed them this finite image of our
end, which properly existed only in unending effort towards
unattainable imagined light. Our crowd seeking light in things were
like pathetic dogs snuffling round the shank of a lamp-post. It was
only myself who valeted the abstract, whose duty took him beyond
the shrine.</p>

<p>The irony was in my loving objects before life or ideas; the
incongruity in my answering the infectious call of action, which
laid weight on the diversity of things. It was a hard task for me
to straddle feeling and action. I had had one craving all my
life&mdash;for the power of self-expression in some imaginative
form&mdash;but had been too diffuse ever to acquire a technique. At
last accident, with perverted humour, in casting me as a man of
action had given me place in the Arab Revolt, a theme ready and
epic to a direct eye and hand, thus offering me an outlet in
literature, the technique-less art. Whereupon I became excited only
over mechanism. The epic mode was alien to me, as to my generation.
Memory gave me no clue to the heroic, so that I could not feel such
men as Auda in myself. He seemed fantastic as the hills of Rumm,
old as Mallory.</p>

<p>Among the Arabs I was the disillusioned, the sceptic, who envied
their cheap belief. The unperceived sham looked so well-fitting and
becoming a dress for shoddy man. The ignorant, the superficial, the
deceived were the happy among us. By our swindle they were
glorified. We paid for them our self-respect, and they gained the
deepest feeling of their lives. The more we condemned and despised
ourselves, the more we could cynically take pride in them, our
creatures. It was so easy to overcredit others: so impossible to
write down their motives to the level of our own uncharitable
truth. They were our dupes, wholeheartedly fighting the enemy. They
blew before our intentions like chaff, being not chaff, but the
bravest, simplest and merriest of men. <i>Credo quia sum</i>? But
did not the being believed by many make for a distorted
righteousness? The mounting together of the devoted hopes of years
from near-sighted multitudes, might endow even an unwilling idol
with Godhead, and strengthen It whenever men prayed silently to
Him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER C</h3>

<p>Upon this text my mind went weaving across its dusty space, amid
the sunbeam thoughts and their dancing motes of idea. Then I saw
that this preferring the Unknown to the God was a scapegoat idea,
which lulled only to a false peace. To endure by order, or because
it was a duty&mdash;that was easy. The soldier suffered only
involuntary knocks; whereas our will had to play the ganger till
the workmen fainted, to keep in a safe place and thrust others into
danger. It might have been heroic to have offered up my own life
for a cause in which I could not believe: but it was a theft of
souls to make others die in sincerity for my graven image. Because
they accepted our message as truth, they were ready to be killed
for it; a condition which made their acts more proper than
glorious, a logical bastard fortitude, suitable to a profit and
loss balance of conduct. To invent a message, and then with open
eye to perish for its self-made image&mdash;that was greater.</p>

<p>The whole business of the movement seemed to be expressible only
in terms of death and life. Generally we were conscious of our
flesh because it hurt us. Joy came sharper from our long habitude
of pain; but our resources in suffering seemed greater than our
capacity for gladness. Lethargy played its part here. Both emotions
were in our gift, for our pain was full of eddies, confusing its
purity.</p>

<p>A reef on which many came to a shipwreck of estimation was the
vanity that our endurance might win redemption, perhaps for all a
race. Such false investiture bred a hot though transient
satisfaction, in that we felt we had assumed another's pain or
experience, his personality. It was triumph, and a mood of
enlargement; we had avoided our sultry selves, conquered our
geometrical completeness, snatched a momentary 'change of
mind'.</p>

<p>Yet in reality we had borne the vicarious for our own sakes, or
at least because it was pointed for our benefit: and could escape
from this knowledge only by a make-belief in sense as well as in
motive.</p>

<p>The self-immolated victim took for his own the rare gift of
sacrifice; and no pride and few pleasures in the world were so
joyful, so rich as this choosing voluntarily another's evil to
perfect the self. There was a hidden selfishness in it, as in all
perfections. To each opportunity there could be only one vicar, and
the snatching of it robbed the fellows of their due hurt. Their
vicar rejoiced, while his brethren were wounded in their manhood.
To accept humbly so rich a release was imperfection in them: their
gladness at the saving of its cost was sinful in that it made them
accessory, part-guilty of inflicting it upon their mediator. His
purer part, for the mediator, might have been to stand among the
crowd, to watch another win the cleanness of a redeemer's name. By
the one road lay self-perfection, by the other self-immolation, and
a making perfect of the neighbour. Hauptmann told us to take as
generously as we gave: but rather we seemed like the cells of a
bee-comb, of which one might change, or swell itself, only at the
cost of all.</p>

<p>To endure for another in simplicity gave a sense of greatness.
There was nothing loftier than a cross, from which to contemplate
the world. The pride and exhilaration of it were beyond conceit.
Yet each cross, occupied, robbed the late-comers of all but the
poor part of copying: and the meanest of things were those done by
example. The virtue of sacrifice lay within the victim's soul.</p>

<p>Honest redemption must have been free and child-minded. When the
expiator was conscious of the under-motives and the after-glory of
his act, both were wasted on him. So the introspective altruist
appropriated a share worthless, indeed harmful, to himself, for had
he remained passive, his cross might have been granted to an
innocent. To rescue simple ones from such evil by paying for them
his complicated self would be avaricious in the modern man. He,
thought-riddled, could not share their belief in others' discharge
through his agony, and they, looking on him without understanding,
might feel the shame which was the manly disciple's lot: or might
fail to feel it, and incur the double punishment of ignorance.</p>

<p>Or was this shame, too, a self-abnegation, to be admitted and
admired for its own sake? How was it right to let men die because
they did not understand? Blindness and folly aping the way of right
were punished more heavily than purposed evil, at least in the
present consciousness and remorse of man alive. Complex men who
knew how self-sacrifice uplifted the redeemer and cast down the
bought, and who held back in his knowledge, might so let a foolish
brother take the place of false nobility and its later awakened due
of heavier sentence. There seemed no straight walking for us
leaders in this crooked lane of conduct, ring within ring of
unknown, shamefaced motives cancelling or double-charging their
precedents.</p>

<p>Yet I cannot put down my acquiescence in the Arab fraud to
weakness of character or native hypocrisy: though of course I must
have had some tendency, some aptitude, for deceit, or I would not
have deceived men so well, and persisted two years in bringing to
success a deceit which others had framed and set afoot. I had had
no concern with the Arab Revolt in the beginning. In the end I was
responsible for its being an embarrassment to the inventors. Where
exactly in the interim my guilt passed from accessory to principal,
upon what headings I should be condemned, were not for me to say.
Suffice it that since the march to Akaba I bitterly repented my
entanglement in the movement, with a bitterness sufficient to
corrode my inactive hours, but insufficient to make me cut myself
clear of it. Hence the wobbling of my will, and endless, vapid
complainings.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CI</h3>

<p>Siddons flew me back to Guweira that evening, and in the night
at Akaba I told Dawnay, just arrived, that life was full, but
slipping smoothly. Next morning we heard by aeroplane how Buxton's
force had fared at Mudowwara. They decided to assault it before
dawn mainly by means of bombers, in three parties, one to enter the
station, the other two for the main redoubts.</p>

<p>Accordingly, before midnight white tapes were laid as guides to
the zero point. The opening had been timed for a quarter to four
but the way proved difficult to find, so that daylight was almost
upon them before things began against the southern redoubt. After a
number of bombs had burst in and about it, the men rushed up and
took it easily&mdash;to find that the station party had achieved
their end a moment before. These alarms roused the middle redoubt,
but only for defeat. Its men surrendered twenty minutes later.</p>

<p>The northern redoubt, which had a gun, seemed better-hearted and
splashed its shot freely into the station yard, and at our troops.
Buxton, under cover of the southern redoubt, directed the fire of
Brodie's guns which, with their usual deliberate accuracy, sent in
shell after shell. Siddons came over in his machines and bombed it,
while the Camel Corps from north and east and west subjected the
breastworks to severe Lewis gun-fire. At seven in the morning the
last of the enemy surrendered quietly. We had lost four killed and
ten wounded. The Turks lost twenty-one killed, and one hundred and
fifty prisoners, with two field-guns and three machine-guns.</p>

<p>Buxton at once set the Turks to getting steam on the pumping
engine, so that he could water his camels, while men blew in the
wells, and smashed the engine-pumps, with two thousand yards of
rail. At dusk, charges at the foot of the great water-tower
spattered it in single stones across the plain: Buxton a moment
later called 'Walk&mdash;march!' to his men, and the four-hundred
camels, rising like one and roaring like the day of judgement,
started off for Jefer. Dawnay went up very brightly to Aba el
Lissan, to greet Feisal. Allenby had sent him across to give Feisal
a warning message. He was to beg him to do nothing rash, as the
British push was a chance, and if it failed the Arabs would be on
the wrong side of Jordan to be given help. Particularly, Allenby
begged Feisal not to rush upon Damascus, but to hold his hand till
events were surely favourable.</p>

<p>This very sound and proper caution had come on my account.
Exasperated one night at G.H.Q., I had blurted out that to me 1918
seemed the last chance, and we would take Damascus, anyhow,
whatever happened at Deraa or Ramleh; since it was better to have
taken it and lost it, than never to have taken it at all.</p>

<p>Feisal smiled wisely at Dawnay's homily, and replied that he
would try this autumn for Damascus though the heavens fell, and, if
the British were not able to carry their share of the attack, he
would save his own people by making separate peace with Turkey.</p>

<p>He had been long in touch with elements in Turkey, Jemal Pasha
opening the correspondence. By instinct, when sober, Jemal was
Islamic, and to him the revolt of Mecca was a judgement. He was
ready to do almost anything to compose such a breach in the faith.
His letters were, for this reason, illuminating. Feisal sent them
to Mecca and Egypt, hoping that they would read into them what we
did: but the points were taken literally, and we received
injunction to reply that the sword was now our judge. This was
magnificent; but in war so rich a diathetical opportunity could not
be missed.</p>

<p>True, that accommodation with Jemal was not possible. He had
lopped the tall heads of Syria, and we should deny our friends'
blood if we admitted him to our peace: but by indicating this
subtly in our reply we might widen the national-clerical rift in
Turkey.</p>

<p>Our particular targets were the anti-German section of the
General Staff, under Mustapha Kemal, who were too keen on the
Turkishness' of their mission to deny the right of autonomy to the
Arabic provinces of the Ottoman Empire. Accordingly, Feisal sent
back tendencious answers; and the correspondence continued
brilliantly. The Turkish soldiers began to complain of the
pietists, who put relics before strategy. The Nationalists wrote
that Feisal was only putting into premature and disastrous activity
their own convictions upon the just, inevitable self-determination
of Turkey.</p>

<p>Knowledge of the ferment affected Jemal's determination. At
first we were offered autonomy for Hejaz. Then Syria was admitted
to the benefit: then Mesopotamia. Feisal seemed still not content;
so Jemal's deputy (while his master was in Constantinople) boldly
added a Crown to the offered share of Hussein of Mecca. Lastly,
they told us they saw logic in the claim of the prophet's family to
the spiritual leadership of Islam!</p>

<p>The comic side of the letters must not obscure their real help
in dividing the Turkish Staff. Old-fashioned Moslems thought the
Sherif an unpardonable sinner. Modernists thought him a sincere but
impatient Nationalist misled by British promises. They had a desire
to correct him rather by argument than by military defeat.</p>

<p>Their strongest card was the Sykes-Picot agreement, an old-style
division of Turkey between England, France, and Russia, made public
by the Soviets. Jemal read the more spiteful paragraphs at a
banquet in Beyrout. For a while the disclosure hurt us; justly, for
we and the French had thought to plaster over a split in policy by
a formula vague enough for each to interpret in his divergent
way.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I had early betrayed the treaty's existence to
Feisal, and had convinced him that his escape was to help the
British so much that after peace they would not be able, for shame,
to shoot him down in its fulfilment: while, if the Arabs did as I
intended, there would be no one-sided talk of shooting. I begged
him to trust not in our promises, like his father, but in his own
strong performance.</p>

<p>Conveniently, at this juncture the British Cabinet, in joyous
style, gave with the left hand also. They promised to the Arabs, or
rather to an unauthorized committee of seven Gothamites in Cairo,
that the Arabs should keep, for their own, the territory they
conquered from Turkey in the war. The glad news circulated over
Syria.</p>

<p>To help the downcast Turks, and to show us that it could give as
many promises as there were parties, the British finally countered
document A to the Sherif, B to their Allies, C to the Arab
Committee, by document D to Lord Rothschild, a new power, whose
race was promised something equivocal in Palestine. Old Nuri
Shaalam, wrinkling his wise nose, returned to me with his file of
documents, asking in puzzlement which of them all he might believe.
As before, I glibly repeated, The last in date', and the Emir's
sense of the honour of his word made him see the humour. Ever after
he did his best for our joint cause, only warning me, when he
failed in a promise, that it had been superseded by a later
intention.</p>

<p>However, Jemal went on hoping, he being an obstinate and
ruffianly man. After Allenby's defeat at Salt, he sent down to us
the Emir Mohammed Said, brother of the egregious Abd el Kadir.
Mohammed Said, a low-browed degenerate with a bad mouth, was as
devious as his brother, but less brave. He was very modest as he
stood before Feisal and offered him Jemal's peace.</p>

<p>Feisal told him that he was come at an opportune moment. He
could offer Jemal the loyal behaviour of the Arab Army, if Turkey
evacuated Amman, and handed over its province to Arab keeping. The
seely Algerian, thinking he had scored a huge success, rushed back
to Damascus: where Jemal nearly hanged him for his pains.</p>

<p>Mustafa Kemal, alarmed, begged Feisal not to play into Jemal's
hands, promising that when the Arabs were installed in their
capital, the disaffected in Turkey would rally to them, and use
their territory as a base from which to attack Enver and his German
allies in Anatolia. Mustafa hoped that the adhesion of all Turkish
forces east of the Taurus would enable <i>him</i> to march direct
on Constantinople.</p>

<p>Events at the end made abortive these complicated negotiations,
which were not disclosed to Egypt or to Mecca, because of the
disappointing issue of our first confidence. I feared that the
British might be shaken at Feisal's thus entertaining separate
relations. Yet in fairness to the fighting Arabs, we could not
close all avenues of accommodation with Turkey. If the European war
failed, it was their only way out: and I had always the lurking
fear that Great Britain might forestall Feisal and conclude its own
separate peace, not with the Nationalist, but with the Conservative
Turks.</p>

<p>The British Government had gone very far in this direction,
without informing her smallest ally. Our information of the precise
steps, and of the proposals (which would have been fatal to so many
of the Arabs in arms on our side), came, not officially, to me, but
privately. It was only one of the twenty times in which friends
helped me more than did our Government: whose action and silence
were at once an example, a spur and a licence to me to do the
like.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CII</h3>

<p>After the peace-talk we could set again to clean work. Joyce and
myself decided upon another of our joint car excursions, this time
to Azrak, to break trail so far towards Deraa. Therefore we ran out
to Jefer to meet the victorious Camel Corps, who came gliding, in
splendid trim and formal appearance, across the shining flat just
before sunset, officers and men delighted at their Mudowwara
success, and their freedom from orders and restraint in the desert.
Buxton said they were fit to go anywhere.</p>

<p>They would rest two nights and draw four days' rations from
their store, duly set out near Auda's tent by Young's care.
Accordingly, on the morrow, early, Joyce and I got into our tender,
with the resourceful Rolls to drive us, and ran easily into Wadi
Bair, at whose wells lay Alwain, Auda's kinsman, a smooth-cheeked,
oppressed silent man; hiding, to possess himself in peace far from
Auda.</p>

<p>We stopped only the few minutes to arrange with him the safety
of Buxton's men; and then drove out, with a young and very wild
Sherari to help us find our way. His camel-training would not equip
him to road-pick for a five-ton armoured car: but his knowing the
track might serve other cars coming up by themselves later.</p>

<p>The plateau of Erha was good going, its flint openings
interspersed with beds of hard mud; and we devoured the fast miles
into the shallow heads of Wadi Jinz, well grown with pasture.</p>

<p>There, numbers of grazing camels were being driven anxiously
together by their ragged herdsmen of the Abu Tayi, who, riding
bareheaded, rifles in hand, were singing a war-chant. When they
heard our roaring exhausts they rushed towards us, with urgent
shouts of mounted men seen lurking in the low grounds ahead. We put
the cars in the direction and after a little flushed five
camel-riders, who made off northwards at their best. We ran them
down in ten minutes. They couched their camels gracefully and came
to meet us as friends&mdash;the only role left them, since naked
men could not quarrel with swifter men in armour. They were Jazi
Howeitat, undoubted robbers, but now all kindness, crying loudly at
the pleasure of meeting me here suddenly. I was a little short, and
ordered them back to their tents at once. They went off,
crestfallen, westwards.</p>

<p>We followed Um Kharug's east bank, finding the way firm, but
slow, for there were gutters of tributaries to cross; and we had to
lay brushwood fascines where the old beds of the flood-water were
soft or full of sand. Towards the end of the day the valleys grew
thick with tufted grass, grazing for our prospective caravans.</p>

<p>In the morning the northern air and fresh wind of this desert
were so cool to us that we made a hot breakfast before we cranked
up the cars and purred over the meeting of Um Kharug and Dhirwa,
over the broad basin of Dhirwa itself, and past its imperceptible
water-parting into the Jesha. These were shallow systems running
into Sirhan, by Amman, which I meant to visit; for if evil came to
us at Azrak, our next refuge should be Amman, if accessible to
cars. Such battalions of 'ifs' skirmished about every new plan
continually.</p>

<p>The night's rest had freshened Rolls and Sanderson, and they
drove splendidly over the saffron ridge of the little Jesha into
the great valley. In the afternoon we saw the chalk banks, and
turned down their ashy slopes, into the Sirhan, just by the
water-holes. This made our retreat always safe, for no enemy would
be mobile enough to close both Azrak and Amman at once to us.</p>

<p>So we refilled our radiators with the horrible water of the pool
in which Farraj and Daud had played, and drew westward over the
open ridges, until far enough from the wells to acquit raiding
parties from the need to stumble on us in the dark. There Joyce and
I sat down and watched a sunset, which grew from grey to pink, and
to red; and then to a crimson so intolerably deep that we held our
breath in trepidation for some stroke of flame or thunder to break
its dizzy stillness. The men, meanwhile, cut open tinned meats,
boiled tea, and laid them out with biscuits on a blanket for our
supper table.</p>

<p>Afterwards there were more blankets, in which we slept
lusciously.</p>

<p>Next day we ran quickly across the delta of Ghadaf till we were
out on the immense mud-flat which stretched for seven miles,
southward and eastward, from the marshes by the old castle of
Azrak.</p>

<p>To-day the mirage blotted its limits for us with blurs of steely
blue, which were the tamarisk bounds raised high in the air and
smoothed by heat-vapour. I wanted the Mejaber springs, down whose
tree-grown bed we might creep unperceived: so Rolls made his car
leap forward in a palpitant rush across the great width. The earth
fell away in front of us, and a plume like a dust-devil waved along
our track behind.</p>

<p>At the end the brakes sang protestingly as we slowed into a
young plantation of tamarisk, tall on heaps of wind-collected sand.
We twisted through them on the hard, intervening soil, till
tamarisk ceased, and damp sand, speckled with close thorn-bushes,
took its place. The cars stopped behind the hummock of Ain el
Assad, under cover of this high-lipped cup of reeds, between whose
vivid stems the transparent water dripped like jewels.</p>

<p>We went gently up the knoll of graves over the great pools, and
saw that the watering places were empty. A mirage hung over the
open spaces: but here, where the ground was bushed, no heatwaves
could collect, and the strong sunlight showed us the valley as
crystal clear as its running waters, and deserted except by wild
birds, and these herds of gazelles, which, alarmed by the popple of
our closed exhausts, were grouping timidly in preparation for
flight.</p>

<p>Rolls drew his tender past the Roman fish-pond; we skirted the
western lava-field, along the now hard, grass-grown swamp, to the
blue walls of the silent fort, with its silken-sounding palms,
behind whose stillness lay perhaps more fear than peace. I felt
guilty at introducing the throbbing car, and its trim crew of
khaki-clad northerners, into the remoteness of this most hidden
legendary place: but my anticipation went astray, for it was the
men who looked real and the background which became scene-painting.
Their newness and certainty (the Definiteness of British troops in
uniform) did Azrak greater honour than plain loneliness.</p>

<p>We stopped only a moment. Joyce and I climbed the western tower,
and agreed upon the manifold advantages of Azrak as a working base;
though, to my sorrow, there was no grazing here, so that we could
not linger in it for the interval of our first and second raids.
Then we crossed to the northern lobe of the mud-flat, a fit
landing-ground for the aeroplanes which Siddons was adding to our
flying column. Amongst other qualities was its visibility. Our
machines flying two hundred miles to this, their new base, could
not fail to see its electrum shield reflecting the sunlight.</p>

<p>We went back to Ain el Assad, where the armoured car was, and
led it at a faster pace out to the open flint desert once again. It
was mid-afternoon, and very hot, especially in the glowing metal of
the steel-turreted car; but the broiling drivers kept at it, and
before sunset we were on the dividing ridge between the Jesha
valleys, to find a shorter and easier way than our coming.</p>

<p>Night caught us not far south of Ammari, and we camped on the
top of the country, with a breeze, very precious after the
blistering day, coming down to us scent-laden from the flowering
slopes of Jebel Druse. It made us glad of the men's hot tea, and of
the blankets with which we had softly padded the angles of the
box-body.</p>

<p>The trip was one delight to me, since I had no responsibility
but the road. Also there was the spice of the reflections of the
Sherari boy, reflections naturally confided to me, since I alone
wore his sort of clothes, and spoke his dialect. He, poor outcast,
had never before been treated as a considerate thing, and was
astonished at the manners of the English. Not once had he been
struck or even threatened.</p>

<p>He said that each soldier carried himself apart like a family,
and that he felt something of defence in their tight, insufficient
clothes and laborious appearance. He was fluttering in skirts,
head-cloth and cloak. They had only shirts and shorts, puttees and
boots, and the breeze could take no hold on them. Indeed, they had
worn these things so long day and night in heat and sweat, busied
about the dusty oily cars, that the cloth had set to their bodies,
like bark to a tree.</p>

<p>Then they were all clean-shaven, and all dressed alike; and his
eye, which most often distinguished man from man by clothes, here
was baffled by an outward uniformity. To know them apart he must
learn their individual, as though naked, shapes. Their food took no
cooking, their drink was hot, they hardly spoke to one another; but
then a word sent them into fits of incomprehensible crackling
laughter, unworthy and inhuman. His belief was that they were my
slaves, and that there was little rest or satisfaction in their
lives, though to a Sherari it would have been luxury so to travel
like the wind, sitting down; and a privilege to eat meat, tinned
meat, daily.</p>

<p>In the morning we hurried along our ridge, to reach Bair in the
afternoon. Unfortunately there were tyre-troubles. The armoured car
was too heavy for the flints, and always she sank in a little,
making heavy going on third speed. This heated up the covers. We
endured a vexatious series of bursts, of stoppings to jack up and
change wheel or tyre. The day was hot and we were hurried, so that
the repeated levering and pumping wore thin our tempers. At noon we
reached the great spinal ridge to Ras Muheiwir. I promised the
sulky drivers it would be splendid going.</p>

<p>And it was. We all took new heart, even the tyres stood better,
while we rushed along the winding ridge, swinging in long curves
from east to west and back again, looking now to the left over the
shallow valleys trending towards Sirhan, now to the right as far as
the Hejaz Railway. Gleaming specks in the haze of distance were its
white stations lit by the pouring sun.</p>

<p>In late afternoon we reached the end of the ridge, dipped into
the hollow and roared at forty miles an hour up the breast of Hadi.
Darkness was near as we cut across the furrows of Ausaji to Bair
wells, where the valley was alive with fires; Buxton, Marshall and
the Camel Corps were pitching camp, after two easy marches from El
Jefer.</p>

<p>There was heartburning among them, for Bair had still only two
wells, and both were beset. At one the Howeitat and Beni Sakhr were
drawing for six hundred of their camels, thirsty from the pastures
a day's journey to the south-east, and at the other was a mob of a
thousand Druses and Syrian refugees, Damascus merchants and
Armenians, on their way to Akaba. These unhandy travellers
cluttered up our access to the water with their noisy
struggles.</p>

<p>We sat down with Buxton in a council of war. Young had duly sent
to Bair fourteen days' rations for man and beast. Of this there
remained eight days for the men, ten for the animals. The
camel-drivers of the supply column, driven forward only by Young's
strong will, had left Jefer half-mutinous with fear of the desert.
They had lost, stolen or sold the rest of Buxton's stores upon
their way.</p>

<p>I suspected the complaining Armenians, but nothing could be
recovered from them, and we had to adjust the plan to its new
conditions. Buxton purged his column of every inessential, while I
cut down the two armoured cars to one, and changed the route.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CIII</h3>

<p>Lazily and mildly I helped the Camel Corps in their long
watering at the forty-foot wells, and enjoyed the kindness of
Buxton and his three hundred fellows. The valley seemed alive with
them; and the Howeitat, who had never imagined there were so many
English in the world, could not have their fill of staring. I was
proud of my kind, for their dapper possession and the orderly
busy-ness of their self-appointed labour. Beside them the Arabs
looked strangers in Arabia; also Buxton's talk was a joy, as he was
understanding, well read and bold; though mostly he was engaged in
preparing for the long forced march.</p>

<p>Accordingly I spent hours apart by myself, taking stock of where
I stood, mentally, on this my thirtieth birthday. It came to me
queerly how, four years ago, I had meant to be a general and
knighted, when thirty. Such temporal dignities (if I survived the
next four weeks) were now in my grasp&mdash;only that my sense of
the falsity of the Arab position had cured me of crude ambition:
while it left me my craving for good repute among men.</p>

<p>This craving made me profoundly suspect my truthfulness to
myself. Only too good an actor could so impress his favourable
opinion. Here were the Arabs believing me, Allenby and Clayton
trusting me, my bodyguard dying for me: and I began to wonder if
all established reputations were founded, like mine, on fraud.</p>

<p>The praise-wages of my acting had now to be accepted. Any
protestation of the truth from me was called modesty, self
depreciation; and charming&mdash;for men were always fond to
believe a romantic tale. It irritated me, this silly confusion of
shyness, which was conduct, with modesty, which was a point of
view. I was not modest, but ashamed of my awkwardness, of my
physical envelope, and of my solitary unlikeness which made me no
companion, but an acquaintance, complete, angular, uncomfortable,
as a crystal.</p>

<p>With men I had a sense always of being out of depth. This led to
elaboration&mdash;the vice of amateurs tentative in their arts. As
my war was overthought, because I was not a soldier, so my activity
was overwrought, because I was not a man of action. They were
intensely conscious efforts, with my detached self always eyeing
the performance from the wings in criticism.</p>

<p>To be added to this attitude were the cross-strains of hunger,
fatigue, heat or cold, and the beastliness of living among the
Arabs. These made for abnormality. Instead of facts and figures, my
notebooks were full of states of mind, the reveries and
self-questioning induced or educed by our situations, expressed in
abstract words to the dotted rhythm of the camels' marching.</p>

<p>On this birthday in Bair, to satisfy my sense of sincerity, I
began to dissect my beliefs and motives, groping about in my own
pitchy darkness. This self-distrusting shyness held a mask, often a
mask of indifference or flippancy, before my face, and puzzled me.
My thoughts clawed, wondering, at this apparent peace, knowing that
it was only a mask; because, despite my trying never to dwell on
what was interesting, there were moments too strong for control
when my appetite burst out and frightened me.</p>

<p>I was very conscious of the bundled powers and entities within
me; it was their character which hid. There was my craving to be
liked&mdash;so strong and nervous that never could I open myself
friendly to another. The terror of failure in an effort so
important made me shrink from trying; besides, there was the
standard; for intimacy seemed shameful unless the other could make
the perfect reply, in the same language, after the same method, for
the same reasons.</p>

<p>There was a craving to be famous; and a horror of being known to
like being known. Contempt for my passion for distinction made me
refuse every offered honour. I cherished my independence almost as
did a Beduin, but my impotence of vision showed me my shape best in
painted pictures, and the oblique overheard remarks of others best
taught me my created impression. The eagerness to overhear and
oversee myself was my assault upon my own inviolate citadel.</p>

<p>The lower creation I avoided, as a reflection upon our failure
to attain real intellectuality. If they forced themselves on me I
hated them. To put my hand on a living thing was defilement; and it
made me tremble if they touched me or took too quick an interest in
me. This was an atomic repulsion, like the intact course of a
snowflake. The opposite would have been my choice if my head had
not been tyrannous. I had a longing for the absolutism of women and
animals, and lamented myself most when I saw a soldier with a girl,
or a man fondling a dog, because my wish was to be as superficial,
as perfected; and my jailer held me back.</p>

<p>Always feelings and illusion were at war within me, reason
strong enough to win, but not strong enough to annihilate the
vanquished, or refrain from liking them better; and perhaps the
truest knowledge of love might be to love what self despised. Yet I
could only wish to: could see happiness in the supremacy of the
material, and could not surrender to it: could try to put my mind
to sleep that suggestion might blow through me freely; and remained
bitterly awake.</p>

<p>I liked the things underneath me and took my pleasures and
adventures downward. There seemed a certainty in degradation, a
final safety. Man could rise to any height, but there was an animal
level beneath which he could not fall. It was a satisfaction on
which to rest. The force of things, years and an artificial
dignity, denied it me more and more; but there endured the
after-taste of liberty from one youthful submerged fortnight in
Port Said, coaling steamers by day with other outcasts of three
continents and curling up by night to sleep on the breakwater by De
Lesseps, where the sea surged past.</p>

<p>True there lurked always that Will uneasily waiting to burst
out. My brain was sudden and silent as a wild cat, my senses like
mud clogging its feet, and my self (conscious always of itself and
its shyness) telling the beast it was bad form to spring and vulgar
to feed upon the kill. So meshed in nerves and hesitation, it could
not be a thing to be afraid of; yet it was a real beast, and this
book its mangy skin, dried, stuffed and set up squarely for men to
stare at.</p>

<p>I quickly outgrew ideas. So I distrusted experts, who were often
intelligences confined within high walls, knowing indeed every
paving-stone of their prison courts: while I might know from what
quarry the stones were hewn and what wages the mason earned. I
gainsaid them out of carelessness, for I had found materials always
apt to serve a purpose, and Will a sure guide to some one of the
many roads leading from purpose to achievement. There was no
flesh.</p>

<p>Many things I had picked up, dallied with, regarded, and laid
down; for the conviction of doing was not in me. Fiction seemed
more solid than activity. Self-seeking ambitions visited me, but
not to stay, since my critical self would make me fastidiously
reject their fruits. Always I grew to dominate those things into
which I had drifted, but in none of them did I voluntarily engage.
Indeed, I saw myself a danger to ordinary men, with such capacity
yawing rudderless at their disposal.</p>

<p>I followed and did not institute; indeed, had no desire even to
follow. It was only weakness which delayed me from mind-suicide,
some slow task to choke at length this furnace in my brain. I had
developed ideas of other men, and helped them, but had never
created a thing of my own, since I could not approve creation. When
other men created, I would serve and patch to make it as good as
might be; for, if it were sinful to create, it must be sin and
shame added to have created one-eyed or halt.</p>

<p>Always in working I had tried to serve, for the scrutiny of
leading was too prominent. Subjection to order achieved economy of
thought, the painful, and was a cold-storage for character and
Will, leading painlessly to the oblivion of activity. It was a part
of my failure never to have found a chief to use me. All of them,
through incapacity or timidity or liking, allowed me too free a
hand; as if they could not see that voluntary slavery was the deep
pride of a morbid spirit, and vicarious pain its gladdest
decoration. Instead of this, they gave me licence, which I abused
in insipid indulgence. Every orchard fit to rob must have a
guardian, dogs, a high wall, barbed wire. Out upon joyless
impunity!</p>

<p>Feisal was a brave, weak, ignorant spirit, trying to do work for
which only a genius, a prophet or a great criminal, was fitted. I
served him out of pity, a motive which degraded us both. Allenby
came nearest to my longings for a master, but I had to avoid him,
not daring to bow down for fear lest he show feet of clay with that
friendly word which must shatter my allegiance. Yet, what an idol
the man was to us, prismatic with the unmixed self-standing quality
of greatness, instinct and compact with it.</p>

<p>There were qualities like courage which could not stand alone,
but must be mixed with a good or bad medium to appear. Greatness in
Allenby showed itself other, in category: self-sufficient, a facet
of character, not of intellect. It made superfluous in him ordinary
qualities; intelligence, imagination, acuteness, industry, looked
silly beside him. He was not to be judged by our standards, any
more than the sharpness of bow of a liner was to be judged by the
sharpness of razors. He dispensed with them by his inner power.</p>

<p>The hearing other people praised made me despair jealously of
myself, for I took it at its face value; whereas, had they spoken
ten times as well of me, I would have discounted it to nothing. I
was a standing court martial on myself, inevitably, because to me
the inner springs of action were bare with the knowledge of
exploited chance. The creditable must have been thought out
beforehand, foreseen, prepared, worked for. The self, knowing the
detriment, was forced into depreciation by others' uncritical
praise. It was a revenge of my trained historical faculty upon the
evidence of public judgement, the lowest common denominator to
those who knew, but from which there was no appeal because the
world was wide.</p>

<p>When a thing was in my reach, I no longer wanted it; my delight
lay in the desire. Everything which my mind could consistently wish
for was attainable, as with all the ambitions of all sane men, and
when a desire gained head, I used to strive until I had just to
open my hand and take it. Then I would turn away, content that it
had been within my strength. I sought only to assure myself, and
cared not a jot to make the others know it.</p>

<p>There was a special attraction in beginnings, which drove me
into everlasting endeavour to free my personality from accretions
and project it on a fresh medium, that my curiosity to see its
naked shadow might be fed. The invisible self appeared to be
reflected clearest in the still water of another man's yet
incurious mind. Considered judgements, which had in them of the
past and the future, were worthless compared with the revealing
first sight, the instinctive opening or closing of a man as he met
the stranger.</p>

<p>Much of my doing was from this egoistic curiosity. When in fresh
company, I would embark on little wanton problems of conduct,
observing the impact of this or that approach on my hearers,
treating fellow-men as so many targets for intellectual ingenuity:
until I could hardly tell my own self where the leg-pulling began
or ended. This pettiness helped to make me uncomfortable with other
men, lest my whim drive me suddenly to collect them as trophies of
marksmanship; also they were interested in so much which my
self-consciousness rejected. They talked of food and illness, games
and pleasures, with me, who felt that to recognize our possession
of bodies was degradation enough, without enlarging upon their
failings and attributes. I would feel shame for myself at seeing
them wallow in the physical which could be only a glorification of
man's cross. Indeed, the truth was I did not like the 'myself I
could see and hear.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CIV</h3>

<p>I had reached this useful stage when there was a disturbance
from the Toweiha tents. Shouting men ran towards inc. I pulled
myself together to appease a fight between the Arabs and the Camel
Corps, but instead it was an appeal for help against a Shammar raid
two hours since, away by the Snainirat. Eighty camels had been
driven off. Not to seem wholly ungracious, I put on our spare
camels the four or five of my men whose friends or relatives had
suffered, and sent them off.</p>

<p>Buxton and his men started in the mid-afternoon while I delayed
till evening, seeing my men load our six thousand pounds of
gun-cotton on the thirty Egyptian pack-camels. My disgusted
bodyguard were for this ride to lead or drive the explosives'
train.</p>

<p>We had judged that Buxton would sleep just short of the Hadi, so
we rode thither: but saw no camp-fire, nor was the track trodden.
We looked over the crest of the ridge, into a bitter north wind
coming off Hermon into our flustered faces. The slopes beyond were
black and silent, and to us town-dwellers, accustomed to the reek
of smoke, or sweat, or the ferment of soil freshly dug, there was
something searching, disquieting, almost dangerous, in the steely
desert wind. So we turned back a few paces, and bid under the lip
of the ridge to sleep comfortably in its cloistered air.</p>

<p>In the morning we looked out across fifty miles of blank
country, and wondered at this missing our companions: but Daher
shouted suddenly from the Hadi side, seeing their column winding up
from the south-east. They had early lost the track and camped till
dawn. My men jested with humour against Sheikh Slaeh, their guide,
as one who could lose his road between the Thlaithukhwat and Bair:
just like one might say between the Marble Arch and Oxford
Circus.</p>

<p>However, it was a perfect morning, with the sun hot on our
backs, and the wind fresh in our faces. The Camel Corps strode
splendidly past the frosted tips of the three peaks into the green
depths of Dhirwa. They looked different from the stiff, respectful
companies which had reached Akaba, for Buxton's supple brain and
friendly observation had taken in the experience of irregular
fighting, and revised their training rules for the new needs.</p>

<p>He had changed their column formation, breaking its formal
subdivision of two hard companies: he had changed the order of
march, so that, instead of their old immaculate lines, they came
clotted, in groups which split up or drew together without delay
upon each variation of road or ground surface. He had reduced the
loads and rehung them, thereby lengthening the camels' pace and
daily mileage. He had cut into their infantry system of clockwork
halts every so often (to let the camels stale!) and grooming was
less honoured. In the old days, they had prinked their animals,
cosseting them like Pekinese, and each halt had been lightened by a
noisy flapping massage of the beasts' stripped humps with the
saddle-blanket; whereas now the spare time was spent in
grazing.</p>

<p>Consequently, our Imperial Camel Corps had become rapid,
elastic, enduring, silent; except when they mounted by numbers, for
then the three hundred he-camels would roar in concert, giving out
a wave of sound audible miles across the night. Each march saw them
more workmanlike, more at home on the animals, tougher, leaner,
faster. They behaved like boys on holiday, and the easy mixing of
officers and men made their atmosphere delightful.</p>

<p>My camels were brought up to walk in Arab fashion, that
bent-kneed gait with much swinging of the fetlock, the stride a
little longer and a little quicker than the normal. Buxton's camels
strolled along at their native pace, unaffected by the men on their
backs, who were kept from direct contact with them by iron-shod
boots and by their wood and steel Manchester-made saddles.</p>

<p>Consequently, though I started each stage alongside Buxton in
the van, I forged steadily in front with my five attendants;
especially when I rode my Baha, the immensely tall, large-boned,
upstanding beast, who got her name from the bleat-voice forced on
her by a bullet through the chin. She was very finely bred, but
bad-tempered, half a wild camel, and had never patience for an
ordinary walk. Instead, with high nose and wind-stirred hair, she
would jig along in an uneasy dance, hateful to my Ageyl for it
strained their tender loins, but to me not unamusing.</p>

<p>In this fashion we would gain three miles on the British, look
for a plot of grass or juicy thorns, he in the warm freshness of
air, and let our beasts graze while we were overtaken; and a
beautiful sight the Camel Corps would be as it came up.</p>

<p>Through the mirage of heat which flickered over the shining
flint-stones of the ridge we would see, at first, only the knotted
brown mass of the column, swaying in the haze. As it grew nearer
the masses used to divide into little groups, which swung; parting
and breaking into one another. At last, when close to us, we would
distinguish the individual riders, like great water-birds
breast-deep in the silver mirage, with Buxton's athletic,
splendidly-mounted figure leading his sunburnt, laughing, khaki
men.</p>

<p>It was odd to see how diversely they rode. Some sat naturally,
despite the clumsy saddle; some pushed out their hinder-parts, and
leaned forward like Arab villagers; others lolled in the saddle as
if they were Australians riding horses. My men, judging by the
look, were inclined to scoff. I told them how from that three
hundred I would pick forty fellows who would out-ride, out-fight
and out-suffer any forty men in Feisal's army.</p>

<p>At noon, by Ras Muheiwer, we halted an hour or two, for though
the heat to-day was less than in Egypt in August, Buxton did not
wish to drive his men through it without a break. The camels were
loosed out, while we lay and lunched and tried to sleep, defying
the multitude of flies which had marched with us from Bair in
colonies on our sweaty backs. Meanwhile, my bodyguard passed
through, grumbling at their indignity of baggage driving, making
believe never to have been so shamed before, and praying profanely
that the world would not hear of my tyranny to them.</p>

<p>Their sorrow was doubled since the baggage animals were Somali
camels, whose greatest speed was about three miles an hour.
Buxton's force marched nearly four, myself more than five, so that
the marches were for the Zaagi and his forty thieves a torment of
slowness, modified only by baulking camels, or displaced loads.</p>

<p>We abused their clumsiness, caning them drovers and coolies,
offering to buy their goods when they came to market; till perforce
they laughed at their plight. After the first day they kept up with
us by lengthening the march into the night (only a little, for
these ophthalmia-stricken brutes were blind in the dark) and by
stealing from the breakfast and midday halts. They brought their
caravan through without losing one of all their charges; a fine
performance for such gilded gentlemen; only possible because under
their gilt they were the best camel-masters for hire in Arabia.</p>

<p>That night we slept in Ghadaf. The armoured car overtook us as
we halted, its delighted Sherari guide grinning in triumph on the
turret lid. An hour or two later the Zaagi arrived, reporting all
up and well. He begged that Buxton should not kill, directly in the
road, such camels as broke down on the march; for his men made each
successive carcase excuse for a feast and a delay.</p>

<p>Abdulla was troubled to understand why the British shot their
abandoned beasts. I pointed out how we Arabs shot one another if
badly wounded in battle; but Abdulla retorted it was to save us
from being so tortured that we might do ourselves shame. He
believed there was hardly a man alive who would not choose a
gradual death of weakness in the desert, rather than a sudden
cutting off; indeed, in his judgement, the slowest death was the
most merciful of all, since absence of hope would prevent the
bitterness of a losing fight, and leave the man's nature
untrammelled to compose itself and him into the mercy of God. Our
English argument, that it was kinder to kill quickly anything
except a man, he would not take seriously.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CV</h3>

<p>Our morrow was like the day before, a steady grind of forty
miles. Next day was the last before the bridge-effort. I took half
of my men from the baggage train, and threw them forward on our
line of march, to crown each hill-top. This was well done, but did
not profit us, for in mid-morning, with Muaggar, our ambush, in
full sight, we were marching strongly and hopefully when a Turkish
aeroplane came from the south, flew the length of our column, and
went down, before us, into Amman.</p>

<p>We plodded heavily into Muaggar by noon, and hid in the
substructures of the Roman temple-platform. Our watchers took post
on the crest, looking out over the harvested plains to the Hejaz
Railway. Over these hill-slopes, as we stared through our glasses,
the grey stones seemed to line out like flocks of grazing
sheep.</p>

<p>We sent my peasants into the villages below us, to get news, and
warn the people to keep within doors. They returned to say that
chance was fighting against us. Round the winnowed corn upon the
threshing floors stood Turkish soldiers, for the tax-gatherers were
measuring the heaps under guard of sections of mounted infantry.
Three such troops, forty men, lay for this night in the three
villages nearest the great bridge&mdash;villages through whose
precincts we must necessarily go and come.</p>

<p>We held a hurried council. The aeroplane had or had not seen us.
It would cause, at worst, the strengthening of the bridge-guard,
but I had little fear of its effect. The Turks would believe we
were the advance-guard of a third raid on Amman, and were more
likely to concentrate than to detach troops. Buxton's men were
great fighters, he had laid admirable plans. Success was
certain.</p>

<p>The doubt was about the bridge's cost, or rather as to its value
in British life, having regard to Bartholomew's prohibition of
casualties.</p>

<p>The presence of these mule-riders meant that our retreat would
not be unencumbered. The camel corps were to dismount nearly a mile
from the bridge (their noisy camels!) and advance on foot. The
noise of their assault, not to speak of the firing of three tons of
gun-cotton against the bridge-piers, would wake up the district.
The Turkish patrols in the villages might stumble on our
camel-park&mdash;a disaster for us&mdash;or, at least, would hamper
us in the broken ground, as we retired.</p>

<p>Buxton's men could not scatter like a swarm of birds, after the
bridge explosion, to find their own way back to the Muaggar. In any
night-fighting some would be cut off and lost. We should have to
wait for them, possibly losing more in the business. The whole cost
might be fifty men, and I put the worth of the bridge at less than
five. Its destruction was so to frighten and disturb the Turks,
that they would leave us alone till August the thirtieth when our
long column set out for Azrak. To-day was the twentieth. The danger
had seemed pressing in July, but was now nearly over.</p>

<p>Buxton agreed. We decided to cry off, and move back at once. At
the moment more Turkish machines got up from Amman and quartered
the rough hills northward from Muaggar, looking for us.</p>

<p>The men groaned in disappointment when they heard the change.
They had set pride on this long raid, and were burning to tell
incredulous Egypt that their programme had been literally
fulfilled.</p>

<p>To gain what we could, I sent Saleh and the other chiefs down to
spruce their people with tall rumours of our numbers, and our
coming as the reconnaissance of Feisal's army, to carry Amman by
assault in the new moon. This was the story the Turks feared to
learn: the operation they imagined: the stroke they dreaded. They
pushed cavalry cautiously into Muaggar, and found confirmation of
the wild tales of the villagers, for the hill-top was littered with
empty meat tins, and the valley slopes cut up by the deep tracks of
enormous cars. Very many tracks there were! This alarm checked
them, and, at a bloodless price for us, kept them hovering a week.
The destruction of the bridge would have gained us a fortnight.</p>

<p>We waited till dusk was thick, and then rode off for Azrak,
fifty miles away. We pretended that the raid was become a tour, and
talked of Roman remains and of Ghassanide hunting-places. The Camel
Corps had a practice, almost a habit, of night-journeys, so that
their pace was as by day, and units never strayed nor lost touch.
There was a brilliant moon and we marched till it was pale in the
morning, passing the lone palace of Kharaneh about midnight, too
careless to turn aside and see its strangeness. Part-blame for this
lay on the moon, whose whiteness made our minds as frozen and
shadowless as itself, so that we sat still in our saddles, just
sitting still.</p>

<p>At first I feared lest we encounter Arab raiders, who might have
attacked the Camel Corps in ignorance; so I put forward with my men
some half-mile before the column. As we slipped on, gradually we
became aware of night-birds, flying up from under our feet in
numbers, black and large. They increased, till it seemed as though
the earth was carpeted in birds, so thickly did they start up, but
in dead silence, and dizzily, wheeling about us in circles, like
feathers in a soundless whirl of wind. The weaving curves of their
mad flight spun into my brain. Their number and quietness terrified
my men, who unslung their rifles, and lashed bullet after bullet
into the flutter. After two miles the night became empty again; and
at last we <i>lay</i> down and slept in the fragrant wormwood, till
the sun roused us out.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, tired, we came to Kusair el Amra, the little
hunting lodge of Harith, the Shepherd King, a patron of poets; it
stood beautifully against its background of bosky rustling trees.
Buxton put headquarters in the cool dusk of its hall, and we lay
there puzzling out the worn frescoes of the wall, with more
laughter than moral profit. Of the men, some sheltered themselves
in other rooms, most, with the camels, stretched themselves beneath
the trees, for a slumberous afternoon and evening. The aeroplanes
had not found us&mdash;could not find us here. To-morrow there was
Azrak, and fresh water to replace this stuff of Bair which, with
the passing days, was getting too tasty for our liking.</p>

<p>Also Azrak was a famous place, queen of these oases, more
beautiful than Amruh, with its verdure and running springs. I had
promised everyone a bathe; the Englishmen, not washed since Akaba,
were longing towards it. Meanwhile, Amruh was wonderful. They asked
me with astonishment who were these Kings of Ghassan with the
unfamiliar halls and pictures. I could tell them vague tales of
their poetry, and cruel wars: but it seemed so distant and
tinselled an age.</p>

<p>Next day we walked gently to Azrak. When we were over the last
ridge of lava-pebbles and saw the ring of the Mejabar graves, that
most beautifully put of cemeteries, I trotted forward with my men,
to be sure against accident in the place, and to feel again its
remoteness before the others came. These soldiers seemed so secure
that I dreaded lest Azrak lose its rareness and be drawn back to
the tide of life which had left it a thousand years ago.</p>

<p>However, both fears were silly. Azrak was empty of Arabs,
beautiful as ever, and even more beautiful a little later when its
shining pools were brilliant with the white bodies of our men
swimming, and the slow drift of the wind through its reeds was
pointed by their gay shouts and splashing echoed off the water. We
made a great pit, and buried our tons of gun-cotton, for the Deraa
expedition in September; and then roamed about collecting the
scarlet sweet-water-berry of the Saa bushes. 'Sherari grapes' my
followers, indulgent to our caprice, called them.</p>

<p>We rested there two days, the refreshment of the pools being so
great. Buxton rode with me to the fort, to examine the altar of
Diocletian and Maximian, meaning to add a word in favour of King
George the Fifth; but our stay was poisoned by the grey flies, and
then ruined by a tragic accident. An Arab, shooting fish in the
fort pool, dropped his rifle, which exploded and killed instantly
Lieutenant Rowan, of the Scottish Horse. We buried him in the
little Mejaber graveyard, whose spotless quiet had long been my
envy.</p>

<p>On the third day we marched past Ammari, across Jesha to near
the Thlaithukhwat, the old country whose almost imperceptible
variations I had come to know. By the Hadi we felt at home, and
made a night-march, the men's strident yells of 'Are we well fed?
No'. 'Do we see life? Yes', thundering up the long slopes after me.
When they tired of telling the truth I could hear the rattle of
their accoutrements hitched over the wooden saddles&mdash;eleven or
fifteen hitchings they had, each time they loaded up, in place of
the Arab's all-embracing saddle-bag thrown on in one movement.</p>

<p>I was so bound up in their dark body and tail behind me, that I,
too, lost my way between the Hadi and Bair. However, till dawn we
steered by the stars (the men's next meal was in Bair, for
yesterday their iron ration was exhausted), and day broke on us in
a wooded valley which was certainly Wadi Bair; but for my life I
could not tell if we were above or below the wells. I confessed my
fault to Buxton and Marshall and we tettered for a while, till, by
chance, Sagr ibn Shaalan, one of our old allies of the distant days
of Wejh, rode down the track, and put us on the road. An hour later
the Camel Corps had new rations and their old tents by the wells,
and found that Salama, the provident Egyptian doctor, calculating
their return to-day, had already filled the drinking cisterns with
enough water to slake the half of their thirsty beasts.</p>

<p>I determined to go into Aba el Lissan with the armoured cars,
for Buxton was now on proved ground among friends, and could do
without my help. So we drove fast down the scarp to the Jefer flat,
and skipped across it at sixty miles an hour, ourselves the leading
car. We threw up such a dust-cloud that we lost our sister, and
when we reached the south edge of the flat she was nowhere visible.
Probably tyre trouble, so we sat down to wait, gazing back into the
dappled waves of mirage which streamed over the ground. Their dark
vapour, below the pale sky (which got more and more blue as it went
higher) shifted a dozen times in the hour, giving us a false alarm
of our coming friends; but at last, through the greyness, came
spinning a black spot wagging a long trail of sun-shining dust.</p>

<p>This was Greenhill tearing after, at speed through the
shrivelling air, which eddied about his burning metal turret,
making it so hot that its naked steel seared the bare arms and
knees of the crew whenever the huge car lurched in the soft
heat-powdered ground, whose carpeted dust lay waiting for the low
autumn wind to sweep it across the open in a blinding choking
storm.</p>

<p>Our car stood tyre-deep, and, while we waited, the men slopped
petrol on a hillock of dust and boiled tea for us&mdash;Army tea,
as full of leaves as flood water, and yellow with tinned milk, but
good for parched throats. While we drank the others drew alongside,
and reported two bursts of Beldam tubes in the heat of their swoop
at a mile a minute across the scorching plain. We gave them of our
boiled tea, and laughing they knocked the dust off their faces with
oily hands. They looked aged, with its greyness in their bleached
eyebrows and eyelashes and in the pores of their faces, except
where the sweat had washed dark-edged furrows through to the red
skin.</p>

<p>They drank hurriedly (for the sun was falling, and we had yet
fifty miles to go), throwing out the last dregs on the ground,
where the drops ran apart like quicksilver upon the dusty surface
till they were clotted and sank in speckled shot-holes over its
drifted grey-ness. Then we drove through the ruined railway to Aba
el Lissan, where Joyce, Dawnay and Young reported all going
marvellously. In fact, preparations were complete, and they were
breaking up, Joyce for Cairo to see a dentist, Dawnay for G.H.Q.,
to tell Allenby we were prosperous and obedient.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CVI</h3>

<p>Joyce's ship had come up from Jidda, with the Meccan mail.
Feisal opened his Kibla (King Hussein's Gazette), to find staring
at him a Royal Proclamation, saying that fools were calling Jaafar
Pasha the General Officer Commanding the Arab Northern Army,
whereas there was no such rank, indeed no rank higher than captain
in the Arab Army, wherein Sheikh Jaafar, like another, was doing
his duty!</p>

<p>This had been published by King Hussein (after reading that
Allenby had decorated Jaafar) without warning Feisal; to spite the
northern town-Arabs, the Syrian and Mesopotamian officers, whom the
King at once despised for their laxity and feared for their
accomplishments. He knew that they were fighting, not to give him
dominion, but to set free their own countries for their own
governing, and the lust for power had grown uncontrollable in the
old man.</p>

<p>Jaafar came in and proffered his resignation to Feisal. There
followed him our divisional officers and their staffs, with the
regimental and battalion commanders. I begged them to pay no heed
to the humours of an old man of seventy, out of the world in Mecca,
whose greatness they themselves had made; and Feisal refused to
accept their resignations, pointing out that the commissions (since
his father had not approved their service) were issued by himself,
and he alone was discredited by the proclamation.</p>

<p>On this assumption he telegraphed to Mecca, and received a
return telegram which called him traitor and outlaw. He replied
laying down his command of the Akaba front. Hussein appointed Zeid
to succeed him. Zeid promptly refused. Hussein's cipher messages
became corrupt with rage, and the military life of Aba el Lissan
came to a sudden stop. Dawnay, from Akaba, before the ship sailed,
rang me up, and asked dolefully if all hope were over. I answered
that things hung on chance, but perhaps we should get through.</p>

<p>Three courses lay before us. The first, to get pressure put on
King Hussein to withdraw his statement. The second, to carry on,
ignoring it. The third, to set up Feisal in formal independence of
his father. There were advocates of each course, amongst the
English, as amongst the Arabs. We wired to Allenby asking him to
smooth out the incident. Hussein was obstinate and crafty, and it
might take weeks to force him out of his obstacles to an apology.
Normally, we could have afforded these weeks; but to-day we were in
the unhappy position that after three days, if at all, our
expedition to Deraa must start. We must find some means of carrying
on the war, while Egypt sought for a solution.</p>

<p>My first duty was to send express to Nuri Shaalan that I could
not meet him at the gathering of his tribes in Kaf, but would be in
Azrak from the first day of the new moon, at his service. This was
a sad expedient, for Nuri might take suspicion of my change and
fail at the tryst; and without the Rualla half our efficiency and
importance at Deraa on September the sixteenth would disappear.
However, we had to risk this smaller loss, since without Feisal and
the regulars and Pisani's guns there would be no expedition, and
for the sake of reforming their tempers I must wait in Aba el
Lissan.</p>

<p>My second duty was to start off the caravans for Azrak&mdash;the
baggage, the food, the petrol, the ammunition. Young prepared
these, rising, as ever, to any occasion not of his own seeking. He
was his own first obstacle, but would have no man hinder
<i>him</i>. Never could I forget the radiant face of Nuri Said,
after a joint conference, encountering a group of Arab officers
with the cheerful words, 'Never mind, you fellows; he talks to the
English just as he does to us!' Now he saw that each echelon
started&mdash;not, indeed, to time but only a day late&mdash;under
its appointed officers, according to programme. It had been our
principle to issue orders to the Arabs only through their own
chiefs, so they had no precedent either for obedience or for
disobedience: and off they went like lambs.</p>

<p>My third duty was to face a mutiny of the troops. They had heard
false rumours about the crisis. Particularly, the gunners
misunderstood, and one afternoon fell out with their officers, and
rushed off to turn the guns on their tents. However, Rasim, the
artillery commandant, had forestalled them by collecting the
breech-blocks into a pyramid inside his tent. I took advantage of
this comic moment to meet the men. They were tense at first, but
eventually out of curiosity they fell to talking with me, who to
them had been only an eccentric name, as a half-Beduin
Englishman.</p>

<p>I told them the coffee-cup storm which was raging among the high
heads, and they laughed merrily. Their faces were turned towards
Damascus, not Mecca, and they cared for nothing outside their army.
Their fear was that Feisal had deserted, since for days he had not
been out. I promised to bring him down instantly. When he, with
Zeid, looking as usual, drove through the lines in the Vauxhall,
which Bols had had painted specially green for him, their eyes
convinced them of their error.</p>

<p>My fourth duty was to start off the troops for Azrak on the
right day. To effect this, their confidence in the confidence of
the officers had to be restored. Stirling's tact was called upon.
Nuri Said was ambitious, as any soldier would have been, to make
much of the opportunity before him, and readily agreed to move as
far as Azrak, pending Hussein's apology. If this was unsatisfactory
they could return, or throw off allegiance; if it was adequate, as
I assured him it would be, the interim and unmerited services of
the Northern Army should bring a blush to the old man's cheek.</p>

<p>The ranks responded to bluffer arguments. We made plain that
such gross questions as food and pay depended entirely on the
maintenance of organization. They yielded, and the separate
columns, of mounted infantry, of machine-gunners, of Egyptian
sappers, of Ghurkas, of Pisani's gunners, moved off in their
courses, according to the routine of Stirling and Young, only two
days late.</p>

<p>The last obligation was to restore Feisal's supremacy. To
attempt anything serious between Deraa and Damascus without him
would be vain. We could put in the attack on Deraa, which was what
Allenby expected from us; but the capture of Damascus&mdash;which
was what I expected from the Arabs, the reason why I had joined
with them in the field, taken ten thousand pains, and spent my wit
and strength&mdash;that depended on Feisal's being present with us
in the fighting line, undistracted by military duties, but ready to
take over and exploit the political value of what our bodies
conquered for him. Eventually he offered to come up under my
orders.</p>

<p>As for the apology from Mecca, Allenby and Wilson were doing
their best, engrossing the cables. If they failed, my course would
be to promise Feisal the direct support of the British Government,
and drive him into Damascus as sovereign prince. It was possible:
but I wanted to avoid it except as a last necessity. The Arabs
hitherto in their revolt had made clean history, and I did not wish
our adventure to come to the pitiable state of scission before the
common victory and its peace.</p>

<p>King Hussein behaved truly to type, protesting fluently, with
endless circumlocution, showing no understanding of the grave
effect of his incursion into Northern Army affairs. To clear his
mind we sent him plain statements, which drew abusive but involved
returns. His telegrams came through Egypt and by wireless to our
operators in Akaba, and were sent up to me by car, for delivery to
Feisal. The Arabic ciphers were simple, and I had undesirable
passages mutilated by rearranging their figures into nonsense,
before handing them in code to Feisal. By this easy expedient the
temper of his entourage was not needlessly complicated.</p>

<p>The play went on for several days, Mecca never repeating a
message notified corrupt, but telegraphing in its place a fresh
version toned down at each re-editing from the previous harshness.
Finally, there came a long message, the first half a lame apology
and withdrawal of the mischievous proclamation, the second half a
repetition of the offence in a new form. I suppressed the tail, and
took the head marked Very urgent' to Feisal's tent, where he sat in
the full circle of his staff officers.</p>

<p>His secretary worked out the despatch, and handed the decipher
to Feisal. My hints had roused expectation, and all eyes were on
him as he read it. He was astonished, and gazed wonderingly at me,
for the meek words were unlike his father's querulous obstinacy.
Then he pulled himself together, read the apology aloud, and at the
end said thrillingly, The telegraph has saved all our honour'.</p>

<p>A chorus of delight burst out, during which he bent aside to
whisper in my ear, 'I mean the honour of nearly all of us'. It was
done so delightfully that I laughed, and said demurely, 'I cannot
understand what you mean'. He replied, 'I offered to serve for this
last march under your orders: why was that not enough?' 'Because it
would not go with your honour.' He murmured, 'You prefer mine
always before your own', and then sprang energetically to his feet,
saying, 'Now, Sirs, praise God and work'.</p>

<p>In three hours we had settled time-tables, and arranged for our
successors here in Aba el Lissan, with their spheres and duties. I
took my leave. Joyce had just returned to us from Egypt, and Feisal
promised that he would come, with him and Marshall, to Azrak to
join me on the twelfth at latest. All the camp was happy as I got
into a Rolls tender and set off northward, hoping yet to rally the
Rualla under Nuri Shaalan in time for our attack on Deraa.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CVII</h3>

<p>It was an inexpressible pleasure to have left the mists behind.
We caught at each other with thankfulness as we drove along,
Winterton, Nasir and myself. Lord Winterton was our last-found
recruit; an experienced officer from Buxton's Camel Corps. Sherif
Nasir, who had been the spear-point of the Arab Army since the
first days of Medina, had been chosen by us for the field-work on
this last occasion also. He deserved the honour of Damascus, for
his had been the honours of Medina, of Wejh, of Akaba, and of
Tafileh; and of many barren days beside.</p>

<p>A painstaking little Ford hung on in the dust, behind, as our
splendid car drank up the familiar miles. Once I had been proud of
riding from Azrak to Akaba in three days; but now we drove it in
two, and slept well of nights after this mournful comfort of being
borne at ease in Rolls-Royces, like the great ones of war.</p>

<p>We noted again how easy their lives were; the soft body and its
unexhausted sinews helping the brain to concentrate upon an
armchair work: whereas our brains and bodies lay down only for the
stupor of an hour's sleep, in the flush of dawn and the flush of
sunset, the two seasons of the day unwholesome for riding. Many a
day we had been twenty-two out of the twenty-four hours in the
saddle, each taking it in turn to lead through the darkness while
the others let their heads nod forward over the pommel in
nescience.</p>

<p>Not that it was more than a thin nescience: for even in the
deepest of such sleep the foot went on pressing the camel's
shoulder to keep it at the cross-country pace, and the rider awoke
if the balance were lost ever so little at a false stride or turn.
Then we had had rain, snow or sun beating upon us; little food,
little water, and no security against either Turks or Arabs. Yet
those forced months with the tribes had let me plan in a surety
which seemed lunatic rashness to new comers, but actually was an
exact knowledge of my materials.</p>

<p>Now the desert was not normal: indeed, it was shamefully
popular. We were never out of sight of men; of tenuous camel
columns of troops and tribesmen and baggage moving slowly northward
over the interminable Jefer flat. Past this activity (of good omen
for our punctual concentration at Azrak) we roared, my excellent
driver, Green, once achieving sixty-seven miles an hour. The
half-stifled Nasir who sat in the box-body could only wave his hand
across a furlong to each friend we overtook.</p>

<p>At Bair we heard from the alarmed Beni Sakhr that the Turks, on
the preceding day, had launched suddenly westward from Hesa into
Tafileh. Mifleh thought I was mad, or most untimely merry, when I
laughed outright at the news which four days sooner would have held
up the Azrak expedition: but, now we were started, the enemy might
take Aba el Lissan, Guweira, Akaba itself&mdash;and welcome! Our
formidable talk of advance by Amman had pulled their leg nearly out
of socket, and the innocents were out to counter our feint. Each
man they sent south was a man, or rather ten men, lost.</p>

<p>In Azrak we found a few servants of Nuri Shaalan, and the
Crossley car with a flying officer, an airman, some spares, and a
canvas hangar for the two machines protecting our concentration. We
spent our first night on their aerodrome and suffered for it A
reckless armoured-plated camel-fly, biting like a hornet, occupied
our exposed parts till sunset. Then came a blessed relief as the
itch grew milder in the evening cool&mdash;but the wind changed and
hot showers of blinding salty dust swept us for three hours. We lay
down and drew covers over our heads, but could not sleep. Each
half-hour we had to throw off the sand which threatened to bury us.
At midnight the wind ceased. We issued from our sweaty nests and
restfully prepared to sleep&mdash;when, singing, a cloud of
mosquitoes rolled over us: them we fought till dawn.</p>

<p>Consequently, at dawn we changed camp to the height of the
Mejaber ridge, a mile west of the water and a hundred feet above
the marshes, open to all winds that blew. We rested a while, then
put up the hangar, and afterwards went off to bathe in the silver
water. We undressed beside the sparkling pools whose pearl-white
sides and floor reflected the sky with a moony radiance.
Delicious!' I yelled as I splashed in and swain about. But why do
you keep on bobbing under water?' asked Winterton a moment later.
Then a camel-fly bit him behind, and he understood, and leapt in
after me. We swam about, desperately keeping our heads wet, to
dissuade the grey swarms: but they were too bold with hunger to be
afraid of water, and after five minutes we struggled out, and
frantically into our clothes, the blood running from twenty of
their dagger-bites.</p>

<p>Nasir stood and laughed at us: and later we journeyed together
to the fort, to rest midday there. Ali ibn el Hussein's old corner
tower, this only roof in the desert, was cool and peaceful. The
wind stirred the palm-fronds outside to a frosty rustling:
neglected palms, too northerly for their red date-crop to be good;
but the stems were thick with low branches, and threw a pleasant
shade. Under them, on his carpet, sat Nasir in the quietness. The
grey smoke of his thrown-away cigarette undulated out on the warm
air, flickering and fading through the sunspots which shone between
the leaves. 'I am happy', said he. We were all happy.</p>

<p>In the afternoon an armoured car came up, completing our
necessary defence, though the risk of enemy was minute. Three
tribes covered the country between us and the railway. There were
only forty horsemen in Deraa, none in Amman: also, as yet the Turks
had no news of us. One of their aeroplanes flew over on the morning
of the ninth, made a perfunctory circle, and went off, probably
without seeing us. Our camp, on its airy summit, gave us splendid
observation of the Deraa and Amman roads. By day we twelve English,
with Nasir and his slave, lazed, roaming, bathing at sunset,
sight-seeing, thinking; and slept comfortably at night: or rather I
did: enjoying the precious interval between the conquered friends
of Aba el Lissan and the enemy of next month.</p>

<p>The preciousness would seem to have been partly in myself, for
on this march to Damascus (and such it was already in our
imagination) my normal balance had changed. I could feel the taut
power of Arab excitement behind me. The climax of the preaching of
years had come, and a united country was straining towards its
historic capital. In confidence that this weapon, tempered by
myself, was enough for the utmost of my purpose, I seemed to forget
the English companions who stood outside my idea in the shadow of
ordinary war. I failed to make them partners of my certainty.</p>

<p>Long after, I heard that Winterton rose each dawn and examined
the horizon, lest my carelessness subject us to surprise: and at
Umtaiye and Sheikh Saad the British for days thought we were a
forlorn hope. Actually I knew (and surely said?) that we were as
safe as anyone in the world at war. Because of the pride they had,
I never saw their doubt of my plans.</p>

<p>These plans were a feint against Amman and a real cutting of the
Deraa railways: further than this we hardly went, for it was ever
my habit, while studying alternatives, to keep the stages in
solution.</p>

<p>The public often gave credit to Generals because it had seen
only the orders and the result: even Foch said (before he commanded
troops) that Generals won battles: but no General ever truly
thought so. The Syrian campaign of September 1918 was perhaps the
most scientifically perfect in English history, one in which force
did least and brain most. All the world, and especially those who
served them, gave the credit of the victory to Allenby and
Bartholomew: but those two would never see it in our light, knowing
how their inchoate ideas were discovered in application, and how
their men, often not knowing, wrought them.</p>

<p>By our establishment at Azrak the first part of our plan, the
feint, was accomplished. We had sent our 'horsemen of St. George',
gold sovereigns, by the thousand to the Beni Shakr, purchasing all
the barley on their threshing floors: begging them not to mention
it, but we would require it for our animals and for our British
allies, in a fortnight. Dhiab of Tafileh&mdash;that jerky,
incomplete hobbledehoy&mdash;gossiped the news instantly through to
Kerak.</p>

<p>In addition, Feisal warned the Zebn to Bair, for service; and
Hornby, now (perhaps a little prematurely) wearing Arab clothes,
was active in preparations for a great assault on Madeba. His plan
was to move about the nineteenth, when he heard that Allenby was
started; his hope being to tie on to Jericho, so that if we failed
by Deraa our force could return and reinforce his movement: which
would then be, not a feint, but the old second string to our bow.
However, the Turks knocked this rather crooked by their advance to
Tafileh, and Hornby had to defend Shobek against them.</p>

<p>For our second part, the Deraa business, we had to plan an
attack proper. As preliminary we determined to cut the line near
Amman, thus preventing Amman's reinforcement of Deraa, and
maintaining its conviction that our feint against it was real. It
seemed to me that (with Egyptians to do the actual destruction)
this preliminary could be undertaken by the Ghurkas, whose
detachment would not distract our main body from the main
purpose.</p>

<p>This main purpose was to cut the railways in the Hauran and keep
them cut for at least a week; and there seemed to be three ways of
doing it. The first was to march north of Deraa to the Damascus
railway, as on my ride with Tallal in the winter, cut it; and then
cross to the Yarmuk railway. The second was to march south of Deraa
to the Yarmuk, as with Ali ibn el Hussein in November, 1917. The
third was to rush straight at Deraa town.</p>

<p>The third scheme could be undertaken only if the Air Force would
promise so heavy a daylight bombing of Deraa station that the
effect would be tantamount to artillery bombardment, enabling us to
risk an assault against it with our few men. Salmond hoped to do
this; but it depended on how many heavy machines he received or
assembled in time. Dawnay would fly over to us here with his last
word on September the eleventh. Till then we would hold the schemes
equal in our judgement.</p>

<p>Of our supports, my bodyguard were the first to arrive, prancing
up Wadi Sirhan on September the ninth: happy, fatter than their fat
camels, rested, and amused after their month of feasting with the
Rualla. They reported Nuri nearly ready, and determined to join us.
The contagion of the new tribe's first vigour had quickened in them
a life and spirit which made us jolly.</p>

<p>On the tenth the two aeroplanes came through from Akaba. Murphy
and Junor, the pilots, settled down to the horse-flies which
gambolled in the air about their juiciness. On the eleventh, the
other armoured cars and Joyce drove in, with Stirling, but without
Feisal. Marshall had remained to squire him up next day; and things
were always safe to go well where Marshall, the capable soul,
directed them with a cultivated humour, which was not so much
riotous as persistent. Young, Peake, Scott-Higgins and the baggage
arrived. Azrak became many-peopled and its lakes were again
resonant with voices and the plunge of brown and lean, brown and
strong, copper-coloured, or white bodies into the transparent
water.</p>

<p>On the eleventh the aeroplane from Palestine arrived.
Unfortunately, Dawnay was again ill, and the staff officer who took
his place (being raw) had suffered severely from the roughness of
the air; and had left behind the notes he was to bring us. His
rather concrete assurance, that regard upon his world of the
finished Englishman, gave way before these shocks, and the final
shock of our naked carelessness out there in the desert, without
pickets or watching posts, signallers, sentries or telephones, or
any apparent reserves, defence-line, refuges and bases.</p>

<p>So he forgot his most important news, how on September the sixth
Allenby, with a new inspiration, had said to Bartholomew, 'Why
bother about Messudieh? Let the cavalry go straight to Afuleh, and
Nazareth': and so the whole plan had been changed, and an enormous
indefinite advance substituted for the fixed objective. We got no
notion of this; but by cross-questioning the pilot, whom Salmond
had informed, we got a clear statement of the resources in bombing
machines. They fell short of our minimum for Deraa; so we asked for
just a hamper-bombing of it while we went round it by the north, to
make sure of destroying the Damascus line.</p>

<p>The next day Feisal arrived with, behind him, the army of
troops, Nuri Said the spick and span, Jemil the gunner, Pisani's
coster-like Algerians, and the other items of our 'three men and a
boy' effort. The grey flies had now two thousand camels to fatten
upon, and in their weariness gave up Junor and his half-drained
mechanics.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Nuri Shaalan appeared, with Trad and Khalid,
Paris, Durzi, and the Khaffaji. Auda abu Tayi arrived, with
Mohammed el Dheilan; also Fahad and Adhub, the Zebn leaders, with
ibn Bani, the chief of the Serahin, and ibn Genj of the Serdiyeh.
Majid ibn Sultan, of the Adwan near Salt, rode across to learn the
truth of our attack on Amman. Later in the evening there was a
rattle of rifle fire in the north, and Talal el Hareidhin, my old
companion, came ruffling at the gallop, with forty or fifty mounted
peasants behind him. His sanguine face beamed with joy at our
long-hoped-for arrival. Druses and town-Syrians, Isawiyeh and
Hawarneh swelled the company. Even the barley for our return if the
venture failed (a possibility we seldom entertained) began to
arrive in a steady file of loads. Everyone was stout and in health.
Except myself. The crowd had destroyed my pleasure in Azrak, and I
went off down the valley to our remote Ain el Essad and lay there
all day in my old lair among the tamarisk, where the wind in the
dusty green branches played with such sounds as it made in English
trees. It told me I was tired to death of these Arabs; petty
incarnate Semites who attained heights and depths beyond our reach,
though not beyond our sight. They realized our absolute in their
unrestrained capacity for good and evil; and for two years I had
profitably shammed to be their companion!</p>

<p>To-day it came to me with finality that my patience as regards
the false position I had been led into was finished. A week, two
weeks, three, and I would insist upon relief. My nerve had broken;
and I would be lucky if the ruin of it could be hidden so long.</p>

<p>Joyce meanwhile shouldered the responsibility which my defection
endangered. By his orders Peake, with the Egyptian Camel Corps, now
a sapper party, Scott-Higgins, with his fighting Ghurkas, and two
armoured cars as insurance, went off to cut the railway by
Ifdein.</p>

<p>The scheme was for Scott-Higgins to rush a blockhouse after dark
with his nimble Indians&mdash;nimble on foot that was to say, for
they were like sacks, on camels. Peake was then to demolish until
dawn. The cars would cover their retreat eastward in the morning,
over the plain, upon which we, the main body, would be marching
north from Azrak for Umtaiye, a great pit of rain-water fifteen
miles below Deraa, and our advanced base. We gave them Rualla
guides and saw them off, hopefully, for this important
preliminary.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CVIII</h3>

<p>Just at dawn our column marched. Of them one thousand were the
Aba el Lissan contingent: three hundred were Nuri Shaalan's nomad
horse. He had also two thousand Rualla camel-riders: these we asked
him to keep in Wadi Sirhan. It seemed not wise, before the supreme
day, to launch so many disturbing Beduin among the villages of
Hauran. The horsemen were sheikhs, or sheikhs' servants, men of
substance, under control.</p>

<p>Affairs with Nuri and Feisal held me the whole day in Azrak: but
Joyce had left me a tender, the Blue Mist, by which on the
following morning I overtook the army, and found them breakfasting
among the grass-filled roughness of the Giaan el Khunna. The
camels, joying to be out of the barren circle of Azrak, were
packing their stomachs hastily with this best of food.</p>

<p>Joyce had bad news. Peake had rejoined, reporting failure to
reach the line, because of trouble with Arab encampments in the
neighbourhood of his proposed demolition. We had set store on
breaking the Amman railway, and the check was an offence. I left
the car, took a load of gun-cotton, and mounted my camel, to push
in advance of the force. The others made a detour to avoid harsh
tongues of lava which ran down westwards towards the railway; but
we, Ageyl and others of the well-mounted, cut straight across by a
thieves' path to the open plain about the ruined Um el Jemal.</p>

<p>I was thinking hard about the Amman demolition, puzzled as to
what expedient would be quickest and best; and the puzzle of these
ruins added to my care. There seemed evidence of bluntness of mind
in these Roman frontier cities, Um el Jemal, Um el Surab, Um-taiye.
Such incongruous buildings, in what was then and now a desert
cockpit, accused their builders of insensitiveness; almost of a
vulgar assertion of man's right (Roman right) to live unchanged in
all his estate. Italianate buildings&mdash;only to be paid for by
taxing more docile provinces&mdash;on these fringes of the world
disclosed a prosaic blindness to the transience of politics. A
house which so survived the purpose of its builder was a pride too
trivial to confer honour upon the mind responsible for its
conception.</p>

<p>Um el Jemal seemed aggressive and impudent, and the railway
beyond it so tiresomely intact, that they blinded me to an
air-battle between Murphy in our Bristol Fighter and an enemy
two-seater. The Bristol was badly shot about before the Turk went
down in flames. Our army were delighted spectators, but Murphy,
finding the damage too great for his few materials at Azrak, went
for repair to Palestine in the morning. So our tiny Air Force was
reduced to the B.E.12, a type so out of date that it was impossible
for fighting, and little use for reconnaissance. This we discovered
on the day: meanwhile we were as glad as the army at our man's
win.</p>

<p>Umtaiye was reached, just before sunset. The troops were five or
six miles behind, so as soon as our beasts had had a drink we
struck off to the railway, four miles downhill to the westward,
thinking to do a snatch-demolition. The dusk let us get close
without alarm, and, to our joy, we found that the going was
possible for armoured cars: while just before us were two good
bridges.</p>

<p>These points decided me to return in the morning, with cars and
more gun-cotton, to abolish the larger, four-arched bridge. Its
destruction would give the Turks some days' hard mending, and set
us free of Amman all the time of our first Deraa raid; thus the
purpose of Peake's frustrated demolition would be filled. It was a
happy discovery, and we rode back, quartering the ground while the
darkness gathered, to pick the best car road.</p>

<p>As we climbed the last ridge, a high unbroken watershed which
hid Umtaiye completely from the railway and its possible watchmen,
the fresh north-east wind blew into our faces the warm smell and
dust of ten thousand feet; and from the crest the ruins appeared so
startlingly unlike themselves three hours before that we pulled up
to gasp. The hollow ground was festively spangled with a galaxy of
little evening fires, fresh-lighted, still twinkling with the flame
reflections in their smoke. About them men were making bread or
coffee, while others drove their noisy camels to and from the
water.</p>

<p>I rode to the dark camp, the British one, and sat there with
Joyce and Winterton and Young, telling them of what we must do
first thing in the morning. Beside us lay and smoked the British
soldiers, quietly risking themselves on this expedition, because we
ordered it. It was a thing typical, as instinct with our national
character as that babbling laughing turmoil over there was Arab. In
their crises the one race drew in, the other spread.</p>

<p>In the morning, while the army breakfasted, and thawed the
dawn-chill from its muscles in the sun, we explained to the Arab
leaders in council the fitness of the line for a car-raid; and it
was determined that two armoured cars should run down to the bridge
and attack it, while the main body continued their march to Tell
Arar on the Damascus Railway, four miles north of Deraa. They would
take post there, possessing the line, at dawn to-morrow, September
the seventeenth; and we with the cars would have finished this
bridge and rejoined them before that.</p>

<p>About two in the afternoon, as we drove towards the railway, we
had the great sight of a swarm of our bombing planes droning
steadily up towards Deraa on their first raid. The place had
hitherto been carefully reserved from air attack; so the damage
among the unaccustomed, unprotected, unarmed garrison was heavy.
The morale of the men suffered as much as the railway traffic: and
till our onslaught from the north forced them to see us, all their
efforts went into digging bomb-proof shelters.</p>

<p>We lurched across plots of grass, between bars and fields of
rough stone, in our two tenders and two armoured cars; but arrived
all well behind a last ridge, just this side of our target. On the
rise south of the bridge stood a stone blockhouse.</p>

<p>We settled to leave the tenders here, under cover. I transferred
myself, with one hundred and fifty pounds of gun-cotton, fused and
ready, to one armoured car; intending to drive passively down the
valley towards the bridge, till its arches, sheltering us from the
fire of the post, enabled me to lay and light the demolition
charges. Meanwhile the other, the active fighting car, would engage
the blockhouse at short range to cover my operation.</p>

<p>The two cars set out simultaneously. When they saw us the
astonished garrison of seven or eight Turks got out of their
trenches, and, rifles in hand, advanced upon us in open order:
moved either by panic, by misunderstanding, or by an inhuman
unmixed courage.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the second car came into action against them:
while four other Turks appeared beside the bridge and shot at us.
Our machine-gunners ranged, and fired a short burst. One man fell,
another was hit: the rest ran a little way, thought better of it,
and returned, making friendly signs. We took their rifles, and sent
them up valley to the tenders, whose drivers were watching us
keenly from their ridge. The blockhouse surrendered at the same
moment. We were very content to have taken the bridge, and its
section of track, in five minutes without loss.</p>

<p>Joyce rushed down in his tender with more gun-cotton, and
hastily we set about the bridge, a pleasant little work, eighty
feet long and fifteen feet high, honoured with a shining slab of
white marble, bearing the name and titles of Sultan Abd el Hamid.
In the drainage holes of the spandrils six small charges were
inserted zigzag, and with their explosion all the arches were
scientifically shattered; the demolition being a fine example of
that finest sort which left the skeleton of its bridge intact
indeed, but tottering, so that the repairing enemy had a first
labour to destroy the wreck, before they could attempt to
rebuild.</p>

<p>When we had finished, enemy patrols were near enough to give us
fair excuse for quitting. The few prisoners, whom we valued for
Intelligence reasons, were given place on our loads; and we bumped
off. Unfortunately we bumped too carelessly in our satisfaction,
and at the first watercourse there was a crash beneath my tender.
One side of its box-body tipped downward till the weight came on
the tyre at the back wheel, and we stuck.</p>

<p>The front bracket of the near back spring had crystallized
through by the chassis, in a sheer break which nothing but a
workshop could mend. We gazed in despair, for we were only three
hundred yards from the railway, and stood to lose the car, when the
enemy came along in ten minutes. A Rolls in the desert was above
rubies; and though we had been driving in these for eighteen
months, not upon the polished roads of their makers' intention, but
across country of the vilest, at speed, day or night, carrying a
ton of goods and four or five men up, yet this was our first
structural accident in the team of nine.</p>

<p>Rolls, the driver, our strongest and most resourceful man, the
ready mechanic, whose skill and advice largely kept our cars in
running order, was nearly in tears over the mishap. The knot of us,
officers and men, English, Arabs and Turks, crowded round him and
watched his face anxiously. As he realized that he, a private,
commanded in this emergency, even the stubble on his jaw seemed to
harden in sullen determination. At last he said there was just one
chance. We might jack up the fallen end of the spring, and wedge
it, by baulks upon the running board, in nearly its old position.
With the help of ropes the thin angle-irons of the running boards
might carry the additional weight.</p>

<p>We had on each car a length of scantling to place between the
double tyres if ever the car stuck in sand or mud. Three blocks of
this would make the needful height. We had no saw, but drove
bullets through it cross-wise till we could snap it off. The Turks
heard us firing, and halted cautiously. Joyce heard us and ran back
to help. Into his car we piled our load, jacked up the spring and
the chassis, lashed in the wooden baulks, let her down on them
(they bore splendidly), cranked up, and drove off. Rolls eased her
to walking speed at every stone and ditch, while we, prisoners and
all, ran beside with cries of encouragement, clearing the
track.</p>

<p>In camp we stitched the blocks with captured telegraph wire, and
bound them together and to the chassis, and the spring to the
chassis; till it looked as strong as possible, and we put back the
load. So enduring was the running board that we did the ordinary
work with the car for the next three weeks, and took her so into
Damascus at the end. Great was Rolls, and great was Royce! They
were worth hundreds of men to us in these deserts.</p>

<p>This darning the car delayed us for hours, and at its end we
slept in Umtaiye, confident that, by starting before dawn, we
should not be much late in meeting Nuri Said on the Damascus line
to-morrow: and we could tell him that, for a week, the Amman line
was sealed, by loss of a main bridge. This was the side of quickest
reinforcement for Deraa, and its death made our rear safe. Even we
had helped poor Zeid, behind there in Aba el Lissan: for the Turks
massed in Tafileh would hold up that attack till their
communications were again open. Our last campaign was beginning
auspiciously.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CIX</h3>

<p>Duly, before dawn, we drove upon the track of Stirling's cars,
eager to be with them before their fight. Unfortunately the going
was not helpful. At first we had a bad descent, and then difficult
flats of jagged dolerite, across which we crawled painfully. Later
we ran over ploughed slopes. The soil was heavy for the cars, for
with summer drought this red earth cracked a yard deep and two or
three inches wide. The five-ton armoured cars were reduced to first
speed, and nearly stuck.</p>

<p>We overtook the Arab Army about eight in the morning, on the
crest of the slope to the railway, as it was deploying to attack
the little bridge-guarding redoubt between us and the mound of Tell
Arar whose head overlooked the country-side to Deraa.</p>

<p>Rualla horsemen, led by Trad, dashed down the long slope and
over the liquorice-grown bed of the watercourse to the line. Young
bounced after them in his Ford. From the ridge we thought the
railway taken without a shot, but while we gazed, suddenly from the
neglected Turkish post came a vicious spitting fire, and our
braves, who had been standing in splendid attitudes on the coveted
line (wondering privately what on earth to do next)
disappeared.</p>

<p>Nuri Said moved down Pisani's guns and fired a few shots. Then
the Rualla and troops rushed the redoubt easily, with only one
killed. So the southern ten miles of the Damascus line was freely
ours by nine in the morning. It was the only railway to Palestine
and Hejaz and I could hardly realize our fortune; hardly believe
that our word to Allenby was fulfilled so simply and so soon.</p>

<p>The Arabs streamed down from the ridge in rivers of men, and
swarmed upon the round head of Tell Arar, to look over their plain,
whose rimmed flatness the early sun speciously relieved, by yet
throwing more shadow than light. Our soldiers could see Deraa,
Mezerib and Ghazale, the three key-stations, with their naked
eyes.</p>

<p>I was seeing further than this: northward to Damascus, the
Turkish base, their only link with Constantinople and Germany, now
cut off: southward to Amman and Maan and Medina, all cut off:
westward to Liman von Sandars isolated in Nazareth: to Nablus: to
the Jordan Valley. To-day was September the seventeenth, the
promised day, forty-eight hours before Allenby would throw forward
his full power. In forty-eight hours the Turks might decide to
change their dispositions to meet our new danger; but they could
not change them before Allenby struck. Bartholomew had said, Tell
me if he will be in his Auja line the day before we start, and I
will tell you if we will win'. Well, he was; so we would win. The
question was by how much.</p>

<p>I wanted the whole line destroyed in a moment: but things seemed
to have stopped. The army had done its share: Nuri Said was posting
machine-guns about the Arar mound to keep back any sortie from
Deraa: but why was there no demolition going on? I rushed down, to
find Peake's Egyptians making breakfast. It was like Drake's game
of bowls, and I fell dumb with admiration.</p>

<p>However, in an hour they were mustered for their rhythmic
demolition by numbers; and already the French gunners, who also
carried gun-cotton, had descended with intention upon the near
bridge. They were not very good, but at the second try did it some
hurt.</p>

<p>From the head of Tell Arar, before the mirage had begun to
dance, we examined Deraa carefully through my strong glass, wanting
to see what the Turks had in store for us this day. The first
discovery was disturbing. Their aerodrome was alive with gangs
pulling machine after machine into the open. I could count eight or
nine lined up. Otherwise things were as we expected. Some few
infantry were doubling out into the defence-position, and their
guns were being fired towards us: but we were four miles off.
Locomotives were getting up steam: but the trains were unarmoured.
Behind us, towards Damascus, the country lay still as a map. From
Mezerib on our right, there was no movement. We held the
initiative.</p>

<p>Our hope was to fire six hundred charges, tulip-fashion, putting
out of commission six kilometres of rail. Tulips had been invented
by Peake and myself for this occasion. Thirty ounces of gun-cotton
were planted beneath the centre of the central sleeper of each
ten-metre section of the track. The sleepers were steel, and their
box-shape left an air-chamber which the gas expansion filled, to
blow the middle of the sleeper upward. If the charge was properly
laid, the metal did not snap, but humped itself, bud-like, two feet
in the air. The lift of it pulled the rails three inches up: the
drag of it pulled them six inches together; and, as the chairs
gripped the bottom flanges, warped them inward seriously. The
triple distortion put them beyond repair. Three or five sleepers
would be likewise ruined, and a trench driven across the earthwork:
all this with one charge, fired by a fuse, so short that the first,
blowing off while the third was being lighted, cast its debris
safely overhead.</p>

<p>Six hundred such charges would take the Turks a fair week to
mend. This would be a generous reading of Allenby's 'three men and
a boy with pistols'. I turned to go back to the troops, and at that
moment two things happened. Peake fired his first charge, like a
poplar-tree of black smoke, with a low following report; and the
first Turkish machine got up and came for us. Nuri Said and I
fitted admirably under an outcrop of rock, fissured into deep
natural trenches, on the hill's southern face. There we waited
coolly for the bomb: but it was only a reconnaissance machine, a
Pfalz, which studied us, and returned to Deraa with its news.</p>

<p>Bad news it must have been, for three two-seaters, and four
scouts and an old yellow-bellied Albatros got up in quick
succession, and circled over us, dropping bombs, or diving at us
with machine-gun fire. Nuri put his Hotchkiss gunners in the rock
cracks, and rattled back at them. Pisani cocked up his four
mountain guns, and let fly some optimistic shrapnel. This disturbed
the enemy, who circled off, and came back much higher. Their aim
became uncertain.</p>

<p>We scattered out the troops and camels, while the irregulars
scattered themselves. To open into the thinnest target was our only
hope of safety, as the plain had not overhead cover for a rabbit;
and our hearts misgave us when we saw what thousands of men we had,
dotted out below. It was strange to stand on the hill-top looking
at these two rolling square miles, liberally spread with men and
animals, and bursting out irregularly with lazy silent bulbs of
smoke where bombs dropped (seemingly quite apart from their
thunder) or with sprays of dust where machine-gun groups lashed
down.</p>

<p>Things looked and sounded hot, but the Egyptians went on working
as methodically as they had eaten. Four parties dug in tulips,
while Peake and one of his officers lit each series as it was laid.
The two slabs of gun-cotton in a tulip-charge were not enough to
make a showy explosion, and the aeroplanes seemed not to see what
was going on: at least they did not wash them particularly with
bombs; and as the demolition proceeded, the party drew gradually
out of the danger-area into the quiet landscape to the north. We
traced their progress by the degradation of the telegraph. In
virgin parts its poles stood trimly, drilled by the taut wire: but
behind Peake they leaned and tottered anyhow, or fell.</p>

<p>Nuri Said, Joyce and myself met in council, and pondered how to
get at the Yarmuk section of the Palestine line to top off our
cutting of the Damascus and Hejaz Railways. In view of the reported
opposition there we must take nearly all our men, which seemed
hardly wise under such constant air observation. For one thing, the
bombs might hurt us badly on the march across the open plain; and,
for another, Peake's demolition party would be at the mercy of
Deraa if the Turks plucked up the courage to sally. For the moment
they were fearful: but time might make them brave.</p>

<p>While we hesitated, things were marvellously solved. Junor, the
pilot of the B.E. 12 machine, now alone at Azrak, had heard from
the disabled Murphy of the enemy machines about Deraa, and in his
own mind decided to take the Bristol Fighter's place, and carry out
the air programme. So when things were at their thickest with us he
suddenly sailed into the circus.</p>

<p>We watched with mixed feelings, for his hopelessly old-fashioned
machine made him cold meat for any one of the enemy scouts or
two-seaters: but at first he astonished them, as he rattled in with
his two guns. They scattered for a careful look at this unexpected
opponent. He flew westward across the line, and they went after in
pursuit, with that amiable weakness of aircraft for a hostile
machine, however important the ground target.</p>

<p>We were left in perfect peace. Nuri caught at the lull to
collect three hundred and fifty regulars, with two of Pisani's
guns; and hurried them over the saddle behind Tell Arar, on the
first stage of their march to Mezerib. If the aeroplanes gave us a
half-hour's law, they would probably notice neither the lessened
numbers by the mound, nor the scattered groups making along every
slope and hollow across the stubble westward. This cultivated land
had a quilt-work appearance from the air: also the ground was tall
with maize stalks, and thistles grew saddle-high about it in great
fields.</p>

<p>We sent the peasantry after the soldiers, and half an hour later
I was calling up my bodyguard that we might get to Mezerib before
the others, when again we heard the drone of engines; and, to our
astonishment, Junor reappeared, still alive, though attended on
three sides by enemy machines, spitting bullets. He was twisting
and slipping splendidly, firing back. Their very numbers hindered
them but of course the affair could have only one ending.</p>

<p>In the faint hope that he might get down intact we rushed
towards the railway where was a strip of ground, not too
boulder-strewn. Everyone helped to clear it at speed, while Junor
was being driven lower. He threw us a message to say his petrol was
finished. We worked feverishly for five minutes, and then put out a
landing-signal. He dived at it, but as he did so the wind flawed
and blew across at a sharp angle. The cleared strip was too little
in any case. He took ground beautifully, but the wind puffed across
once more. His under-carriage went, and the plane turned over in
the rough.</p>

<p>We rushed up to rescue, but Junor was out, with no more hurt
than a cut on the chin. He took off his Lewis gun, and the Vickers,
and the drums of tracer ammunition for them. We threw everything
into Young's Ford, and fled, as one of the Turkish two-seaters
dived viciously and dropped a bomb by the wreck.</p>

<p>Junor five minutes later was asking for another job. Joyce gave
him a Ford for himself, and he ran boldly down the line till near
Deraa, and blew a gap in the rails there, before the Turks saw him.
They found such zeal excessive, and opened on him with their guns:
but he rattled away again in his Ford, unhurt for the third
time.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CX</h3>

<p>My bodyguard waited in two long lines on the hill-side. Joyce
was staying at Tell Arar as covering force, with a hundred of Nuri
Said's men, the Rualla, the Ghurkas and the cars; while we slipped
across to break the Palestine Railway. My party would look like
Beduins, so I determined to move openly to Mezerib by the quickest
course, for we were very late.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we drew enemy attention. An aeroplane crawled over
us, dropping bombs: one, two, three, misses: the fourth into our
midst. Two of my men went down. Their camels, in bleeding masses,
struggled on the ground. The men had not a scratch, and leaped up
behind two of their friends. Another machine floated past us, its
engine cut off. Two more bombs, and a shock which spun my camel
round, and knocked me half out of the saddle with a burning
numbness in my right elbow. I felt I was hard hit, and began to cry
for the pity of it: to be put out just when another day's control
would have meant a vast success. The blood was running down my arm:
perhaps if I did not look at it I might carry on as if I were
unhurt.</p>

<p>My camel swung to a spatter of machine-gun bullets. I clutched
at the pommel, and found my damaged arm there and efficient. I had
judged it blown off. My left hand threw the cloak aside and
explored for the wound&mdash;to feel only a very hot little
splinter of metal, too light to do real harm after driving through
the massed folds of my cloak. The trifle showed how much my nerve
was on edge. Curiously enough it was the first time I had been hit
from the air.</p>

<p>We opened out and rode greatly, knowing the ground by heart;
checking only to tell the young peasants we met that the work was
now at Mezerib. The field-paths were full of these fellows, pouring
out afoot from every village to help us. They were very willing:
but our eyes had rested so long on the brown leanness of desert men
that these gay village lads with their flushed faces, clustering
hair, and plump pale arms and legs seemed like girls. They had
kilted up their gowns above the knee for fast work: and the more
active raced beside us through the fields, chaffing back my
veterans.</p>

<p>As we reached Mezerib, Durzi ibn Dughmi met us, with news that
Nuri Said's soldiers were only two miles back. We watered our
camels, and drank deeply ourselves, for it had been a long, hot
day, and was not ended. Then from behind the old fort we looked
over the lake, and saw movement in the French railway station.</p>

<p>Some of the white-legged fellows told us that the Turks held it
in force. However the approaches were too tempting. Abdulla led our
charge, for my days of adventure were ended, with the sluggard
excuse that my skin must be kept for a justifying emergency.
Otherwise I wanted to enter Damascus. This job was too easy.
Abdulla found grain: also flour; and some little booty of weapons,
horses, ornaments. These excited my hangers-on. New adherents came
running across the grass, like flies to honey. Tallal arrived at
his constant gallop. We passed the stream, and walked together up
the far bank knee-deep in weeds till we saw the Turkish station
three hundred yards in front. We might capture this before
attacking the great bridge below Tell el Shehab. Tallal advanced
carelessly. Turks showed themselves to right and left. 'It's all
right,' said he, 'I know the stationmaster': but when we were two
hundred yards away, twenty rifles fired a shocking volley at us. We
dropped unhurt into the weeds (nearly all of them thistles), and
crawled gingerly back, Tallal swearing.</p>

<p>My men heard him, or the shots, and came streaming up from the
river: but we returned them, fearing a machine-gun in the station
buildings. Nuri Said was due. He arrived with Nasir, and we
considered the business. Nuri pointed out that delay at Mezerib
might lose us the bridge, a greater objective. I agreed, but
thought this bird in hand might suffice, since Peake's main line
demolition would stand for a week, and the week's end bring a new
situation.</p>

<p>So Pisani unfolded his willing guns and smashed in a few rounds
of point-blank high explosive. Under their cover, with our twenty
machine-guns making a roof overhead, Nuri walked forward, gloved
and sworded, to receive the surrender of the forty soldiers left
alive.</p>

<p>Upon this most rich station hundreds of Haurani peasants hurled
themselves in frenzy, plundering. Men, women and children fought
like dogs over every object. Doors and windows, door-frames and
window-frames, even steps of the stairs, were carried off. One
hopeful blew in the safe and found postage stamps inside. Others
smashed open the long range of waggons in the siding, to find all
manner of goods. Tons were carried off. Yet more were strewn in
wreckage on the ground.</p>

<p>Young and I cut the telegraph, here an important network of
trunk and local lines, indeed the Palestine army's main link with
their homeland. It was pleasant to imagine Linan von Sandars' fresh
curse, in Nazareth, as each severed wire tanged back from the
clippers. We did them slowly, with ceremony, to draw out the
indignation. The Turks' hopeless lack of initiative made their army
a 'directed' one, so that by destroying the telegraphs we went far
towards turning them into a leaderless mob. After the telegraph we
blew in the points, and planted tulips: not very many, but enough
to annoy. While we worked a light engine came down the line from
Deraa on patrol. The bang and dust-clouds of our tulips perturbed
it. It withdrew discreetly. Later an aeroplane visited us.</p>

<p>Among the captured rolling stock, on platform trucks, were two
lorries crammed with delicacies for some German canteen. The Arabs,
distrusting tins and bottles, had spoiled nearly everything: but we
got some soups and meat, and later Nuri Said gave us bottled
asparagus. He had found an Arab prizing open the case and had cried
'pigs' bones' at him in horror when the contents came to light. The
peasant spat and dropped it, and Nuri quickly stuffed all he could
into his saddle-bags.</p>

<p>The lorries had huge petrol tanks. Beyond them were some trucks
of firewood. We set the whole afire at sunset, when the plundering
was finished, and the troops and tribesmen had fallen back to the
soft grass by the outlet from the lake.</p>

<p>The splendid blaze spreading along the line of waggons
illuminated our evening meal. The wood burned with a solid glare,
and the fiery tongues and bursts of the petrol went towering up,
higher than the watertanks. We let the men make bread and sup and
rest, before a night-attempt on the Shehab bridge, which lay three
miles to the westward. We had meant to attack at dark, but the wish
for food stopped us, and then we had swarms of visitors, for our
beacon-light advertised us over half Hauran.</p>

<p>Visitors were our eyes, and had to be welcomed. My business was
to see every one with news, and let him talk himself out to me,
afterwards arranging and combining the truth of these points into a
complete picture in my mind. Complete, because it gave me certainty
of judgement: but it was not conscious nor logical, for my
informants were so many that they informed me to distraction, and
my single mind bent under all its claims.</p>

<p>Men came pouring down from the north on horse, on camel, and on
foot, hundreds and hundreds of them in a terrible grandeur of
enthusiasm, thinking this was the final occupation of the country,
and that Nasir would seal his victory by taking Deraa in the night
Even the magistrates of Deraa came to open us their town. By
acceding we should hold the water supply of the railway station,
which must inevitably yield: yet later, if the ruin of the Turkish
army came but slowly, we might be forced out again, and lose the
plainsmen between Deraa and Damascus, in whose hands our final
victory lay. A nice calculation, if hardly a fresh one, but on the
whole the arguments were still against taking Deraa. Again we had
to put off our friends with excuses within their comprehension.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CXI</h3>

<p>Slow work; and when at last we were ready a new visitor
appeared, the boy-chief of Tell el Shehab. His village was the key
to the bridge. He described the position; the large guard; how it
was placed. Obviously the problem was harder than we had believed,
if his tale was true. We doubted it, for his just-dead father had
been hostile, and the son sounded too suddenly devoted to our
cause. However, he finished by suggesting that he return after an
hour with the officer commanding the garrison, a friend of his. We
sent him off to bring his Turk, telling our waiting men to lie down
for another brief rest.</p>

<p>Soon the boy was back with a captain, an Armenian, anxious to
harm his government in any way he could. Also he was very nervous.
We had hard work to assure him of our enlightenment. His
subalterns, he said, were loyal Turks, and some of the
non-commissioned officers. He proposed we move close to the
village, and lie there secretly, while three or four of our
lustiest men hid in his room. He would call his subordinates one by
one to see him; and, as each entered, our ambush might pinion
him.</p>

<p>This sounded in the proper descent from books of adventure, and
we agreed enthusiastically. It was nine at night. At eleven
precisely we would line up round the village and wait for the
Sheikh to show our strong men to the Commandant's house. The two
conspirators departed, content, while we woke up our army, asleep
with the sleep of exhaustion beside their loaded camels. It was
pitchy dark.</p>

<p>My bodyguard prepared bridge-cutting charges of gelatine. I
filled my pockets with detonators. Nasir sent men to each section
of the Camel Corps to tell them of the coming adventure, that they
might work themselves up to the height of it: and to ensure their
mounting quietly, without the disaster of a roaring camel. They
played up. In a long double line our force crept down a winding
path, beside an irrigation ditch, on the crest of the dividing
ridge. If there was treachery before us, this bare road would be a
deathtrap, without issue to right or left, narrow, tortuous, and
slippery with the ditch-water. So Nasir and I went first with our
men, their trained ears attentive to every sound, their eyes
keeping constant guard. In front of us was the waterfall, whose
burdening roar had given its character to that unforgettable night
with Ali ibn el Hussein when we had attempted this bridge from the
other wall of the ravine. Only to-night we were nearer, so that the
noise flooded up oppressively and filled our ears.</p>

<p>We crept very slowly and carefully now, soundless on our bare
feet, while behind us the heavier soldiery snaked along, holding
their breath. They also were soundless, for camels moved always
stilly at night, and we had packed the equipment not to tap, the
saddles not to creak. Their quietness made the dark darker, and
deepened the menace of those whispering valleys either side. Waves
of dank air from the river met us, chilly in our faces; and then
Rahail came down swiftly from the left and caught my arm, pointing
to a slow column of white smoke rising from the valley.</p>

<p>We ran to the edge of the descent, and peered over: but the
depth was grey with mist risen off the water, and we saw only
dimness and this pale vapour spiring from the level fog bank.
Somewhere down there was the railway, and we stopped the march,
afraid lest this be the suspected trap. Three of us went foot by
foot down the slippery hillside till we could hear voices. Then
suddenly the smoke broke and shifted, with the panting of an opened
throttle, and afterwards the squealing of brakes as an engine came
again to a standstill. There must be a long train waiting beneath;
reassured, we marched again to the very spur below the village.</p>

<p>We extended in line across its neck, and waited five minutes,
ten minutes. They passed slowly. The murk night before moonrise was
hushing in its solidity, and would have compelled patience on our
restless fellows, without the added warnings of the dogs, and the
intermittent ringing challenge of sentries about the bridge. At
length we let the men slip quietly from their camels to the ground,
and sat wondering at the delay, and the Turks' watchfulness, and
the meaning of that silent train standing below us in the valley.
Our woollen cloaks got stiff and heavy with the mist, and we
shivered.</p>

<p>After a long while a lighter speck came through the dark. It was
the boy sheikh, holding his brown cloak open to show us his white
shirt like a flag. He whispered that his plan had failed. A train
(this one in the ravine) had just arrived with a German colonel and
the German and Turk reserves from Afuleh, sent up by Liman von
Sandars, to rescue panic-stricken Deraa.</p>

<p>They had put the little Armenian under arrest for being absent
from his post. There were machine-guns galore, and sentries
patrolling the approaches with ceaseless energy. In fact, there was
a strong picket on the path, not a hundred yards from where we sat:
the oddity of our joint state made me laugh, though quietly.</p>

<p>Nuri Said offered to take the place by main force. We had bombs
enough, and pistol flares; numbers and preparedness would be on our
side. It was a fair chance: but I was at the game of reckoning the
value of the objective in terms of life, and as usual finding it
too dear. Of course, most things done in war were too dear, and we
should have followed good example by going in and going through
with it. But I was secretly and disclaimedly proud of the planning
of our campaigns: so I told Nuri that I voted against it. We had
today twice cut the Damascus-Palestine railway; and the bringing
here of the Afuleh garrison was a third benefit to Allenby. Our
bond had been most heavily honoured.</p>

<p>Nuri, after a moment's thought agreed. We said good-night to the
lad who had honestly tried to do so much for us. We passed down the
lines, whispering to each man to lead back in silence. Then we sat
in a group with our rifles (mine Enver's gold-inscribed
Lee-En-field trophy from the Dardanelles, given by him to Feisal
years ago) waiting till our men should be beyond the danger
zone.</p>

<p>Oddly enough this was the hardest moment of the night. Now the
work was over we could scarcely resist the temptation to rouse the
spoil-sport Germans out. It would have been so easy to have cracked
off a Very light into their bivouac; and the solemn men would have
turned out in ludicrous hurry, and shot hard into the bare, misty
hill-side silent at their feet. The identical notion came
independently to Nasir, Nuri Said, and myself. We blurted it out
together, and each promptly felt ashamed that the others had been
as childish. By mutual cautions we managed to keep our
respectability. At Mezerib, after midnight, we felt that something
must be done to avenge the forfeited bridge. So two parties of my
fellows, with guides of Tallal's men, went beyond Shehab, and cut
the line twice behind it on deserted gradients. Their echoing
explosions gave the German detachment a bad night. Flares were lit
and the neighbourhood searched for some brewing attack.</p>

<p>We were glad to give them as tiresome a night as ours, for then
they too would be languid in the morning. Our friends were still
coming in every minute, to lass our hands and swear eternal fealty.
Their wiry ponies threaded our misted camp, between the hundreds of
sleeping men, and the uneasy camels whose great jaws were munching
all night at the windy grass swallowed in the day hours.</p>

<p>Before dawn Pisani's other guns and the rest of Nuri Said's
troops arrived from Tell Arar. We had written to Joyce that on the
morrow we would return southward, by Nisib, to complete the circle
of Deraa. I suggested that he move straight back to Umtaiye and
there wait for us: for it, with its abundant water, splendid
pasture, and equi-distance from Deraa and Jebel Druse and the
Rualla Desert, seemed an ideal place in which we might rally and
wait news of Allenby's fortune. By holding Umtaiye we as good as
cut off the Turkish fourth army of beyond Jordan (our special bird)
from Damascus: and were in place quickly to renew our main-line
demolitions, whenever the enemy had nearly set them right.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CXII</h3>

<p>Reluctantly we pulled ourselves together for another day of
effort, called up the army, and moved in a huge straggle through
Mezerib station. Our fires had burned out, and the place stood
dishevelled. Young and myself leisurely laid tulips, while the
troops melted into broken ground towards Remthe, to be out of sight
of both Deraa and Shehab. Turkish aeroplanes were humming overhead,
looking for us, so we sent our peasants back through Mezerib for
their villages. Consequently, the airmen reported that we were very
numerous, possibly eight or nine thousand strong, and that our
centrifugal movements seemed to be directed towards every direction
at once.</p>

<p>To increase their wonderment, the French gunners' long-fused
charge blew up the water-tower at Mezerib, loudly, hours after we
had passed. The Germans were marching out of Shehab for Deraa, at
the moment, and the inexplicable shock sent these humourless ones
back there on guard till late afternoon.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we were far away, plodding steadily towards Nisib,
whose hill-top we reached about four in the afternoon. We gave the
mounted infantry a short rest, while we moved our gunners and
machine-guns to the crest of the first ridge, from which the ground
fell away hollowly to the railway station.</p>

<p>We posted the guns there in shelter, and asked them to open
deliberately upon the station buildings at two thousand yards.
Pisani's sections worked in emulation so that, before long, ragged
holes appeared in the roofs and sheds. At the same time we pushed
our machine-gunners forward on the left, to fire long bursts
against the trenches, which returned a hot obstinate fire. However
our troops had natural shelter and the advantage of the afternoon
sun behind their backs. So we suffered no hurt. Nor did the enemy.
Of course, all this was just a game, and the capture of the station
not in our plan. Our real objective was the great bridge north of
the village. The ridge below our feet curved out in a long horn to
this work, serving as one bank of the valley which it was built to
span. The village stood on the other bank. The Turks held the
bridge by means of a small redoubt, and maintained touch with it by
riflemen posted in the village under cover of its walls.</p>

<p>We turned two of Pisani's guns and six machine-guns on the small
but deeply-dug bridge-post, hoping to force its defenders out. Five
machine-guns directed their fire on the village. In fifteen minutes
its elders were out with us, very much perturbed. Nuri put, as the
condition of cease-fire, their instant ejectment of the Turks from
the houses. They promised. So station and bridge were divided.</p>

<p>We redoubled against these. The firing from the four wings
became violent, thanks to our twenty-five machine-guns, the Turks
also being plentifully supplied. At last we put all four of
Pisani's guns against the redoubt; and, after a few salvoes,
thought we saw its guard slipping from their battered trenches
through the bridge into cover of the railway embankment.</p>

<p>This embankment was twenty feet high. If the bridge-guard chose
to defend their bridge through its arches, they would be in a
costly position. However, we reckoned that the attraction of their
fellows in the station would draw them away. I told off the half of
my bodyguard, carrying explosives, to move along the machine-gun
crest till within a stone's throw of the redoubt.</p>

<p>It was a noble evening, yellow, mild and indescribably peaceful;
a foil to our incessant cannonade. The declining light shone down
the angle of the ridges, its soft rays modelling them and their
least contour in a delicate complexity of planes. Then the sun sank
another second, and the surface became shadow, out of which for a
moment there rose, starkly, the innumerable flints strewing it;
each western (reflecting) facet tipped like a black diamond with
flame.</p>

<p>A very unfit afternoon for dying, seemed to think my men: for
the first time their nerves failed, and they refused to quit their
shelter for the enemy's clattering bullets. They were tired, and
their camels so marched out they could only walk: also they knew
that one bullet in the blasting gelatine would send them
sky-high.</p>

<p>A try to stir them by jest failed; at last I cast them off;
choosing only Hemeid, the young and timid one amongst them, to come
up with me on the hill-top. He shook like a man in a sick dream,
but followed quietly. We rode down the ridge to its furthest edge,
to have a close look at the bridge.</p>

<p>Nuri Said was there, sucking his briar pipe, and cheering the
gunners, who were keeping a barrage over the darkening roads
between the bridge, the village and the station. Nuri, being happy,
propounded to me plans of attack and alternative assaults against
this station, which we did not wish to assault. We argued theory
for ten minutes on the skyline, with Hemeid wincing in his saddle
as bullets, some of which were overs, spat past us, or ricochets
hummed like slow, angry bees beside our ears. The few proper hits
splashed loudly into the flints, kicking up a chalk-dust which hung
transparently for a moment in the reflected light.</p>

<p>Nuri agreed to cover my movements to the bridge as well as he
could. Then I turned Hemeid back with my camel, to tell the rest
that I would hurt them worse than bullets if they did not follow
him across the danger-zone to meet me: for I meant to walk round
till I could be sure the bridge-post was empty.</p>

<p>While they hesitated, there came up Abdulla, the imperturbable,
improvident, adventurous, who feared nothing; and the Zaagi. They,
mad with fury that I had been let down, dashed at the shrinkers,
who pounded over the shoulder with only six bullet-scratches. The
redoubt was indeed abandoned: so we dismounted, and signalled Nuri
to cease fire. In the silence we crept discreetly through the
bridge-arches, and found them also evacuated.</p>

<p>Hurriedly we piled gun-cotton against the piers, which were
about five feet thick and twenty-five feet high; a good bridge, my
seventy-ninth, and strategically most critical, since we were going
to live opposite it at Umtaiye until Allenby came forward and
relieved us. So I had determined to leave not a stone of it in
place.</p>

<p>Nuri meanwhile was hurrying the infantry, gunners and
machine-gunners down in the thickening light, towards the line,
with orders to get a mile beyond into the desert, form up into
column and wait.</p>

<p>Yet the passing of so many camels over the track must take
tediously long. We sat and chafed under the bridge, matches in
hand, to light at once (despite the troops) if there was an alarm.
Fortunately everything went well, and after an hour Nuri gave me my
signal. Half a minute later (my preference for six-inch fuses!)
just as I tumbled into the Turkish redoubt, the eight hundred
pounds of stuff exploded in one burst, and the black air became
sibilant with flying stones. The explosion was numbing from my
twenty yards, and must have been heard half-way to Damascus.</p>

<p>Nuri, in great distress, sought me out. He had given the 'all
clear' signal before learning that one company of mounted infantry
was missing. Fortunately my guards were aching for redeeming
service. Talal el Hareidhin took them with him up the hills, while
Nuri and I stood by the yawning pit which had been the bridge, and
flashed an electric torch, to give them a fixed point for their
return.</p>

<p>Mahmud came back in half an hour triumphantly leading the lost
unit. We fired shots to recall the other searchers, and then rode
two or three miles into the open towards Umtaiye. The going became
very broken, over moraines of slipping dolerite: so we gladly
called a halt, and lay down in our ranks for an earned sleep.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CXIII</h3>

<p>However, it seemed that Nasir and I were to lose the habit of
sleeping. Our noise at Nisib had proclaimed us as widely as the
flames of Mezerib. Hardly were we still when visitors came
streaming in from three sides to discuss the latest events. It was
being rumoured that we were raiding, and not occupying; that later
we would run away, as had the British from Salt, leaving our local
friends to pay the bills.</p>

<p>The night, for hour after hour, was broken by these new-comers
challenging round our bivouacs, crying their way to us like lost
souls; and, peasant-fashion, slobbering over our hands with
protestations that we were their highest lords and they our deepest
servants. Perhaps the reception of them fell short of our usual
standard; but, in revenge, they were applying the torture of
keeping us awake, uneasily awake. We had been at strain for three
days and nights; thinking, ordering and executing; and now, on our
road to rest, it was bitter to play away this fourth night also, at
the old lack-lustre, dubious game of making friends.</p>

<p>And their shaken morale impressed us worse and worse, till Nasir
drew me aside and whispered that clearly there existed a focus of
discontent in some centre near. I loosed out my peasant bodyguards
to mix with the villagers and find the truth; and from their
reports it seemed that the cause of distrust lay in the first
settlement, at Taiyibe, which had been shaken by the return of
Joyce's armoured cars yesterday, by some chance incidents, and by a
just fear that they were the spot most exposed in our retreat.</p>

<p>I called Aziz, and we rode straight to Taiyibe, over rough
stretches of lava, trackless, and piled across with walls of broken
stone. In the head-man's hut sat the conclave which infected our
visitors. They were debating whom to send to implore mercy from the
Turks; when we walked in unannounced. Our single coming abashed
them, in its assumption of supreme security. We talked irrelevantly
an hour, of crops and farmyard prices, and drank some coffee: then
rose to go. Behind us the babble broke out again; but now their
inconstant spirits had veered to what seemed our stronger wind, and
they sent no word to the enemy; though next day they were bombed
and shelled for such stubborn complicity with us.</p>

<p>We got back before dawn, and stretched out to sleep: when there
came a loud boom from the railway, and a shell shattered beyond our
sleeping host. The Turks had sent down an armoured train mounting a
field-gun. By myself I would have chanced its aim, for my sleep had
been just long enough to make me rage for more: but the army had
slept six hours and was moving.</p>

<p>We hurried across the horrible going. An aeroplane came over,
and circled round to help the gunners. Shells began to keep
accurate pace with our line of march. We doubled our speed, and
broke into a ragged procession of very open order. The directing
aeroplane faltered suddenly, swerved aside towards the line, and
seemed to land. The gun put in one more lucky shot, which killed
two camels; but for the rest it lost accuracy, and after about
fifty shots we drew out of range. It began to punish Taiyibe.</p>

<p>Joyce, at Umtaiye, had been roused by the shooting, and came out
to welcome us. Behind his tall figure the ruins were crested by a
motley band, samples from every village and tribe in the Hauran,
come to do homage and offer at least lip-service. To Nasir's tired
disgust I left these to him, while I went off with Joyce and
Winterton, telling them of the landed aeroplane, and suggesting
that an armoured car beat it up at home. Just then two more enemy
machines appeared and landed in about the same place.</p>

<p>However breakfast, our first for some while, was getting ready.
So we sat down and Joyce related how the men of Taiyibe had fired
at him as he passed by, presumably to show their opinion of
strangers who stirred up a hornet's nest of Turks, and then hopped
it.</p>

<p>Breakfast ended. We called for a volunteer car to investigate
the enemy aerodrome. Everybody came forward with a silent goodwill
and readiness which caught me by the throat. Finally Joyce chose
two cars&mdash;one for Junor and one for me&mdash;and we drove for
five miles to the valley in whose mouth the planes had seemed to
land.</p>

<p>We silenced the cars and crept down its course. When about two
thousand yards from the railway, it bent round into a flat meadow,
by whose further side stood three machines. This was magnificent,
and we leaped forward, to meet a deep ditch with straight banks of
cracking earth, quite impassable.</p>

<p>We raced frantically along it, by a diagonal route, till we were
within twelve hundred yards. As we stopped two of the aeroplanes
started. We opened fire, searching the range by dust spurts, but
already they had run their distance and were off, swaying and
clattering up across the sky over our heads.</p>

<p>The third engine was sulky. Its pilot and observer savagely
pulled the propeller round, while we ranged nearer. Finally they
leaped into the railway ditch as we put bullet after bullet into
the fuselage till it danced under the rain. We fired fifteen
hundred bullets at our target (they burned it in the afternoon) and
then turned home.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the two escaped machines had had time to go to
Deraa, and return, feeling spiteful. One was not clever and dropped
his four bombs from a height, missing us widely. The other swooped
low, placing one bomb each time with the utmost care. We crept on
defencelessly, slowly, among the stones, feeling like sardines in a
doomed tin, as the bombs fell closer. One sent a shower of small
stuff through the driving slit of the car, but only cut our
knuckles. One tore off a front tyre and nearly lurched the car
over.</p>

<p>Of all danger give me the solitary sort. However we reached
Umtaiye well and reported success to Joyce. We had proved to the
Turks that that aerodrome was not fit for use; and Deraa lay
equally open to car attack. Later I lay in the shadow of a car and
slept; all the Arabs in the desert, and the Turkish aeroplanes
which came and bombed us, having no effect upon my peace. In the
clash of events men became feverishly tireless: but to-day we had
finished our first round, fortunately; and it was necessary that I
rest, to clear my mind about our next moves. As usual when I lay
down I dropped asleep, and slept till afternoon.</p>

<p>Strategically, our business was to hold on to Umtaiye, which
gave us command at will of Deraa's three railways. If we held it
another week we should strangle the Turkish armies, however little
Allenby did. Yet tactically Umtaiye was a dangerous place. An
inferior force composed exclusively of regulars, without a guerilla
screen, could not safely hold it: yet to that we should shortly be
reduced, if our air helplessness continued patent.</p>

<p>The Turks had at least nine machines. We were camped twelve
miles from their aerodrome, in the open desert, about the only
possible water-supply, with great herds of camels and many horses
necessarily grazing round us. The Turks' beginning of bombing had
been enough to disquiet the irregulars who were our eyes and ears.
Soon they would break up and go home, and our usefulness be ended:
Taiyibe, too, that first village which covered us from
Deraa&mdash;it lay defenceless and quivering under repeated attack.
If we were to remain in Umtaiye, Taiyibe must be content with
us.</p>

<p>Clearly our first duty was to get air reinforcement from
Allenby, who had arranged to send a news machine to Azrak on the
day after to-morrow. I judged it would be profitable for me to go
across and talk with him. I could be back on the twenty-second.
Umtaiye would hold out so long, for we might always fox the
aeroplanes a while by moving to Um el Surab, the next Roman
village.</p>

<p>Whether at Umtaiye or Um el Surab, to be safe we must keep the
initiative. The Deraa side was temporarily closed by the suspicion
of the peasants: there remained the Hejaz line. The bridge at
Kilometre 149 was nearly mended. We must smash it again, and smash
another to the south, to deny the repair trains access to it. An
effort by Winterton yesterday showed that the first was a matter
for troops and guns. The second was objective for a raid. I went
across to see if my bodyguard could do it with me on our way to
Azrak.</p>

<p>Something was wrong. They were red-eyed, hesitant, trembling: at
last I understood that while I was away in the morning the Zaagi,
Abdulla and their other chiefs had gone mercilessly through the
tally of those who flinched at Nisib. It was their right, for since
Tafileh I had left its discipline to the company itself; but the
effect for the moment was to make them useless for my purpose. Such
punishment was preceded by fear: but the memory of its infliction
provoked wilder lawlessness among the stronger victims, and a
likelihood of crimes of violence among the witnesses. They would
have been dangerous to me, to themselves, or to the enemy, as whim
and opportunity provided, had we gone that night into action.</p>

<p>So, instead, I suggested to Joyce that the Egyptians and Ghurkas
return to Akaba; proposing further that he lend me an armoured car
to go down with them to the railway, their first stage, and do what
could be done. We went up to Nasir and Nuri Said, and told them I
would be back on the twenty-second with fighting machines, to
deliver us from air-scouts and bombing. Meanwhile we would salve
Taiyibe with money for the Turkish damage, and Joyce would make
landing-grounds, here and at Um el Surab, against my return with
our air reinforcements.</p>

<p>The demolition of that night was a fantastic muddle. We moved at
sunset to an open valley, three easy miles from the railway.
Trouble might threaten from Mafrak station. My armoured car, with
Junor attendant in his Ford, would guard that side against hostile
advance. The Egyptians would move direct to the line, and fire
their charges.</p>

<p>My guiding fell through. We wandered for three hours in a maze
of valleys, not able to find the railway, nor the Egyptians, nor
our starting-point. At last we saw a light and drove for it, to
find ourselves in front of Mafrak. We turned back to get into
place, and heard the clank of an engine running northward out of
the station. We chased its intermittent flame, hoping to catch it
between us and the broken bridge: but before we overtook it there
came flashes and explosions far up, as Peake fired his thirty
charges.</p>

<p>Some mounted men galloped headlong past us, southward. We fired
at them, and then the patrolling train returned, backing at its
best speed from Peake's danger. We ran alongside, and opened on the
tracks with our Vickers, while Junor sent a green shower of tracer
bullets from his Lewis across the dark. Above our shooting and the
noise of the engine we heard the Turks howling with terror of this
luminous attack. They fired back raggedly, but as they did so the
big car suddenly sneezed and stood still. A bullet had pierced the
unarmoured end of the petrol tank, the only unarmoured spot of all
our team of cars. It took us an hour to plug the leak.</p>

<p>Then we drove along the silent line to the twisted rails and
gaping culverts, but could not find our friends. So we drew a mile
back, and there at last I had my sleep out, three perfect hours of
it before the dawn. I awoke fresh, and recognized our place.
Probably it was only the fifth sleepless night which had made my
wits woolly. We pushed forward, passing the Egyptians with the
Ghurkas, and reached Azrak in the early afternoon. There were
Feisal and Nuri Shaalan, eager to hear our news. We explained
particularly; and then I went over to Marshall, in the temporary
hospital. He had all our badly-wounded in his quiet care: but they
were fewer than he had expected, so he was able to spare me a
stretcher for my bed.</p>

<p>At dawn Joyce unexpectedly arrived. He had made up his mind that
in this lull it was his duty to go down to Aba el Lissan to help
Zeid and Jaafar before Maan, and to press forward Hornby among the
Beni Sakhr. Then the plane from Palestine arrived, and we heard the
amazing first chronicle of Allenby's victory. He had smashed and
burst through and driven the Turks inconceivably. The face of our
war was changed, and we gave hurried word of it to Feisal, with
counsels of the general revolt to take profit of the situation. An
hour later I was safely in Palestine.</p>

<p>From Ramleh the Air Force gave me a car up to Headquarters; and
there I found the great man unmoved, except for the light in his
eye as Bols bustled in every fifteen minutes, with news of some
wider success. Allenby had been so sure, before he started, that to
him the result was almost boredom: but no general, however
scientific, could see his intricate plan carried out over an
enormous field in every particular with complete success, and not
know an inward gladness: especially when he felt it (as he must
have felt it) a reward of the breadth and judgement which made him
conceive such unorthodox movements; and break up the proper book of
his administrative services to suit them; and support them by every
moral and material asset, military or political, within his
grasp.</p>

<p>He sketched to me his next intentions. Historic Palestine was
his, and the broken Turks, in the hills, expected a slackening of
the pursuit. Not at all! Bartholomew and Evans were prepared to
provision three more thrusts: one across Jordan to Amman, to be
done by Chaytor's New Zealanders; one across Jordan to Deraa, to be
done by Barrow and his Indians; one across Jordan to Kuneitra, to
be done by Chauvel's Australians. Chaytor would rest at Amman;
Barrow and Chauvel on attaining the first objectives would converge
on Damascus. We were to assist the three: and I was not to carry
out my saucy threat to take Damascus, till we were all
together.</p>

<p>I explained our prospects, and how everything was being wrecked
by air-impotence. He pressed a bell and in a few minutes Salmond
and Borton were conferring with us. Their machines had taken an
indispensable part in Allenby's scheme (the perfection of this man
who could use infantry and cavalry, artillery and Air Force, Navy
and armoured cars, deceptions and irregulars, each in its best
fashion!): and had fulfilled it. There were no more Turks in the
sky&mdash;except on our side, as I hurriedly interpolated. So much
the better, said Salmond; they would send two Bristol fighters over
to Umtaiye to sit with us while we needed them. Had we spares?
Petrol? Not a drop? How was it to be got there? Only by air? An
air-contained fighting unit? Unheard of!</p>

<p>However, Salmond and Borton were men avid of novelty. They
worked out loads for D.H.g and Handley-Page, while Allenby sat by,
listening and smiling, sure it would be done. The co-operation of
the air with his unfolding scheme had been so ready and elastic,
the liaison so complete and informed and quick. It was the R.A.F.,
which had converted the Turkish retreat into rout, which had
abolished their telephone and telegraph connections, had blocked
their lorry columns, scattered their infantry units.</p>

<p>The Air chiefs turned on me and asked if our landing-grounds
were good enough for a Handley-Page with full load. I had seen the
big machine once in its shed, but unhesitatingly said 'Yes' though
they had better send an expert over with me in the Bristols
to-morrow and make sure. He might be back by noon, and the Handley
come at three o'clock. Salmond got up: That's all right, Sir, we'll
do the necessary.' I went out and breakfasted.</p>

<p>Allenby's headquarter was a perfect place: a cool, airy,
whitewashed house, proofed against flies, and made musical by the
moving of the wind in the trees outside. I felt immoral, enjoying
white table-cloths, and coffee, and soldier servants, while our
people at Umtaiye lay like lizards among the stones, eating
unleavened bread, and waiting for the next plane to bomb them. I
felt restless as the dusty sunlight which splashed a diaper over
the paths, through chinks in the leaves; because, after a long
spell of the restrained desert, flowers and grass seemed to fidget,
and the everywhere-burgeoning green of tilth became vulgar, in its
fecundity.</p>

<p>However, Clayton and Deedes and Dawnay were friendliness itself,
and also the Air Force staff; while the good cheer and conscious
strength of the Commander-in-Chief was a bath of comfort to a weary
person after long strained days. Bartholomew moved maps about,
explaining what they would do. I added to his knowledge of the
enemy, for I was his best served intelligence officer: and in
return his perspective showed me the victory sure, whatever
happened to our strained little stop-block over there. Yet it
seemed to me that in the Arab hands lay an option, whether to let
this victory be just one more victory, or, by risking themselves
once more, to make it final. Not that, so stated, it was a real
option: but, when body and spirit were as wearily sick as mine,
they almost instinctively sought a plausible avoidance of the way
of danger.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CXIV</h3>

<p>Before dawn, on the Australian aerodrome, stood two Bristols and
a D.H.g. In one was Ross Smith, my old pilot, who had been picked
out to fly the new Handley-Page, the single machine of its class in
Egypt, the apple of Salmond's eye. His lending it to fly over the
enemy line on so low an errand as baggage carrying, was a measure
of the goodwill toward us.</p>

<p>We reached Umtaiye in an hour, and saw that the army had gone:
so I waved ourselves back to Urn el Surab; and there they were, the
defensive group of cars, and Arabs hiding from our suspect noise
here, there and everywhere; the cute camels dispersed singly over
the plain, filling themselves with the wonderful grazing. Young,
when he saw our markings, put a landing-signal and smoke bombs on
the turf which his care and Nuri Said's had swept clear of
stones.</p>

<p>Ross Smith anxiously paced the length and breadth of the
prepared space, and studied its imperfections: but rejoined us,
where the drivers were making breakfast, with a clear face. The
ground was O.K. for the Handley-Page. Young told us of repeated
bombings yesterday and the day before, which had killed some
regulars and some of Pisani's gunners and tired the life out of
everyone, so that they moved in the night to Um el Surab. The idiot
Turks were still bombing Umtaiye though men went to it only in the
neutral noons and nights to draw water.</p>

<p>Also I heard of Winterton's last blowing up of the railway: an
amusing night, in which he had met an unknown soldier and explained
to him in broken Arabic how well they were getting on. The soldier
had thanked God for His mercies, and disappeared in the dark;
whence a moment later, machine-gun fire opened from left and right!
Nevertheless, Winterton had fired all his charges, and withdrawn in
good order without loss. Nasir came to us, and reported this man
hurt, and that killed, this clan getting ready, those already
joined, but others gone home&mdash;all the gossip of the country.
The three shining aeroplanes had much restored the Arabs, who
lauded the British, and their own bravery and endurance, while I
told them the scarce-credible epic of Allenby's
success&mdash;Nablus taken, Afuleh taken, Beisan and Semakh and
Haifa. My hearers' minds drew after me like flames. Tallal took
fire, boasting; while the Rualla shouted for instant march upon
Damascus. Even my bodyguard, still bearing witness of the Zaagi's
severity in their muddy eyes and constrained faces, cheered up and
began to preen a little before the crowd, with a dawn of happiness.
A shiver of self-assertion and confidence ran across the camp. I
determined to bring up Feisal and Nuri Shaalan for the final
effort.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it was breakfast time with a smell of sausage in the
air. We sat round, very ready: but the watcher on the broken tower
yelled 'Aeroplane up', seeing one coming over from Deraa. Our
Australians, scrambling wildly to their yet-hot machines, started
them in a moment. Ross Smith, with his observer, leaped into one,
and climbed like a cat up the sky. After him went Peters, while the
third pilot stood beside the D.H.g and looked hard at me.</p>

<p>I seemed not to understand him. Lewis guns, scarfe mountings,
sights, rings which turned, vanes, knobs which rose and fell on
swinging parallel bars; to shoot, one aimed with this side of the
ring or with that, according to the varied speed and direction of
oneself and the enemy. I had been told the theory, could repeat
some of it: but it was in my head, and rules of action were only
snares of action till they had run out of the empty head into the
hands, by use. No: I was not going up to air-fight, no matter what
caste I lost with the pilot. He was an Australian, of a race
delighting in additional risks, not an Arab to whose gallery I must
play.</p>

<p>He was too respectful to speak: only he looked reproach at me
while we watched the battle in the air. There were one enemy
two-seater and three scouts. Ross Smith fastened on the big one,
and, after five minutes of sharp machine-gun rattle, the German
dived suddenly towards the railway line. As it flashed behind the
low ridge, there broke out a pennon of smoke, and from its falling
place a soft, dark cloud. An 'Ah!' came from the Arabs about us.
Five minutes later Ross Smith was back, and jumped gaily out of his
machine, swearing that the Arab front was the place.</p>

<p>Our sausages were still hot; we ate them, and drank tea (our
last English stores, broached for the visitors), but were hardly at
the grapes from Jebel Druse when again the watchman tossed up his
cloak and screamed, 'A plane!' This time Peters won the race, Ross
Smith second, with Traill, disconsolate, in reserve: but the shy
enemy turned back so soon that Peters did not catch them till near
Arar: there he drove down his quarry, fighting. Later, when the
wave of war rolled thither, we found the hopeless crash, and two
charred German bodies.</p>

<p>Ross Smith wished he might stay for ever on this Arab front with
an enemy every half-hour; and deeply envied Peters his coming days.
However, he must go back for the Handley-Page with petrol, food and
spares. The third plane was for Azrak, to get the observer marooned
there yesterday; and I went in it so far, to see Feisal.</p>

<p>Time became spacious to those who flew: we were in Azrak thirty
hours after leaving it. Ghurkas and Egyptians I turned back to
rejoin the army, for new demolitions in the north. Then, with
Feisal and Nuri Shaalan, I packed into the green Vauxhall, and off
we went for Um el Surab to see the Handley-Page alight.</p>

<p>We ran at speed over the smooth flint or mud-flat, letting the
strong car throb itself fully: but luck was hostile. A dispute was
reported us, and we had to turn aside to a local Serahin camp.
However, we made profit of our loss, by ordering their fighting men
to Umtaiye: and we had them send word of victory across the
railway, that the roads through the Ajlun hills might be closed to
the broken Turkish armies, trying to escape into safety.</p>

<p>Then our car flashed northward again. Twenty miles short of Um
el Surab we perceived a single Bedawi, running southward all in a
flutter, his grey hair and grey beard flying in the wind, and his
shirt (tucked up in his belly-cord) puffing out behind him. He
altered course to pass near us, and, raising his bony arms, yelled,
The biggest aeroplane in the world', before he flapped on into the
south, to spread his great news among the tents.</p>

<p>At Um el Surab the Handley stood majestic on the grass, with
Bristols and 9.A&mdash;like fledglings beneath its spread of wings.
Round it admired the Arabs, saying, 'Indeed and at last they have
sent us <i>the</i> aeroplane, of which these things were foals'.
Before night rumour of Feisal's resource went over Jebel Druse and
the hollow of Hauran, telling people that the balance was weighted
on our side.</p>

<p>Borton himself had come over in the machine, to concert help. We
talked with him while our men drew from her bomb-racks and fuselage
a ton of petrol; oil and spare parts for Bristol Fighters; tea and
sugar and rations for our men; letters, Reuter telegrams and
medicines for us. Then the great machine rose into the early dusk,
for Ramleh, with an agreed programme of night-bombing against Deraa
and Mafrak, to complete that ruin of the railway traffic which our
gun-cotton had begun.</p>

<p>We, for our share, would keep up the gun-cotton pressure.
Allenby had assigned us the Turkish Fourth Army, to harass and
contain till Chaytor forced them out of Amman; and afterwards to
cut up, on their retreat. This retreat was only an affair of days,
and it was as certain as things could be in war that we should
raise the plains between us and Damascus next week. So Feisal
decided to add to our column Nuri Shaalan's Rualla camel men from
Azrak. It would increase us to about four thousand strong, more
than three-fourths irregular; but reliably so, for Nuri, the hard,
silent, cynical old man, held the tribe between his fingers like a
tool.</p>

<p>He was that rarity in the desert, a man without sense of
argument. He would or would not, and there was no more to it. When
others finished talking, he would announce his will in a few flat
phrases, and wait calmly for obedience; which came, for he was
feared. He was old and wise, which meant tired and disappointed: so
old that it was my abiding wonder he should link himself to our
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I rested next day in Nasir's tent, among his peasant visitors;
sorting out the too-abundant news furnished by their quick wit and
goodwill. During my rest-day, Nuri Said, with Pisani and two guns,
Stirling, Winterton, Young, their armoured cars, and a considerable
force, went openly to the railway, cleared it by approved military
means, destroyed a kilometre of rail, and burnt <i>the</i>
tentative wooden structure with which the Turks were mending the
bridge blown up by Joyce and myself before our first attack on
Deraa. Nuri Shaalan, in black broadcloth cloak, personally led his
Rualla horsemen, galloping with the best of them. Under his eye the
tribe showed a valour which drew praise even from Nuri Said.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CXV</h3>

<p>Nun's operation of to-day was the Turks' final blow, after which
they gave up trying to restore the line between Amman and Deraa. We
did not know this, but still had its bogy set over us, and were
urgent to put out of action a yet longer stretch. Accordingly, next
dawn, Winterton, Jemil and I went out on cars to examine the line
south of Mafrak station. We were received with machine-gun fire of
a vigour, direction and intensity beyond any of our experience.
Later we captured the experts and found they were a German
machine-gun unit. For the moment we drew out, puzzled, and went
further to a tempting bridge. My plan was to run under it in the
car till the vault enabled us to lay the charge against the pier in
shelter. So I transferred myself to an armoured car, put sixty
pounds of gun-cotton on the back-board, and told the driver to push
in under the arch.</p>

<p>Winterton and Jemil came behind in the supporting car. 'It's
very hot,' groaned Jemil. 'It's going to be still hotter where
we're going,' replied Winterton, as we drew in slowly over
indifferent ground with aimless shells falling about. We were
picking our way forward, about fifty yards from the bank, with
enough machine-gun bullets for a week's fighting rattling off our
armour, when someone from behind the line bowled a hand grenade at
us.</p>

<p>This new condition made impossible my plan of getting under the
bridge. For one thing, a hit on the back of the car would have set
off our gun-cotton and blown us to blazes; for another, the car was
helpless against a lobbed grenade. So we drew off, perplexed to
understand this defence lavished on a bit of railway, and much
interested, indeed amused, at worthy opposition after so long ease.
In our imaginations, Check was a short, compact, furious man,
darting glances every way from beneath tangled eyebrows, for an end
to his troubles; beside him Victory seemed a lanky, white-skinned,
rather languid woman. We must try again after dark. At Um el Surab
we found that Nasir wished to fix camp once more at Umtaiye. It was
a first stage of our journey to Damascus, so his wish delighted me,
and we moved; winning thereby good excuse for doing nothing this
night to the line. Instead, we sat and told stories of experience
and waited for midnight, when the Handley-Page was to bomb Mafrak
station. It came, and hundred-pound bomb after hundred-pound bomb
crashed into the packed sidings till they caught fire, and the
Turks' shooting stopped.</p>

<p>We slept, having given prize of the night to a tale of Enver
Pasha, after the Turks re-took Sharkeui. He went to see it, in a
penny steamer, with Prince Jemil and a gorgeous staff. The Bulgars,
when they came, had massacred the Turks; as they retired the Bulgar
peasants went too. So the Turks found hardly any one to kill. A
greybeard was led on board for the Commander-in-Chief to bait. At
last Enver tired of this. He signed to two of his bravo aides, and
throwing open the furnace door, said, Tush him in'. The old man
screamed, but the officers were stronger and the door was
slammed-to on his jerking body. 'We turned, feeling sick, to go
away, but Enver, his head on one side, listening, halted us. So we
listened, till there came a crash within the furnace. He smiled and
nodded, saying, 'Their heads always pop, like that.'</p>

<p>All night, and next day, the fire among the trucks burned
greater and greater. It was proof of the breakdown of the Turks,
which the Arabs had been rumouring since yesterday. They said the
Fourth Army was streaming up from Amman in a loose mob. The Beni
Hassan, who were cutting off stragglers and weak detachments,
compared them to gipsies on the march.</p>

<p>We held a council. Our work against the Fourth Army was
finished. Such remnants as avoided out of the hands of the Arabs
would reach Deraa as unarmed stragglers. Our new endeavour should
be to force the quick evacuation of Deraa, in order to prevent the
Turks there reforming the fugitives into a rearguard. So I proposed
that we march north, past Tell Arar, and over the railway at dawn
to-morrow, into Sheikh Saad village. It lay in familiar country
with abundant water, perfect observation, and a secure retreat west
or north, or even south-west, if we were directly attacked. It cut
off Deraa from Damascus; and Mezerib also.</p>

<p>Tallal seconded me with fervour. Nuri Shaalan gave his nod:
Nasir and Nuri Said. So we prepared to strike camp. The armoured
cars could not come with us. They had better stay in Azrak, till
Deraa fell and we wanted them to help us into Damascus. The Bristol
Fighters, likewise, had done their work, clearing the air of
Turkish aeroplanes. They might return to Palestine with news of our
move to Sheikh Saad.</p>

<p>Off they circled. We, watching their line of flight, noticed a
great cloud of dust added to the slow smoke from ruined Mafrak. One
machine turned back and dropped a scribble that a large body of
hostile cavalry were heading out from the railway towards us.</p>

<p>This was unwelcome news, for we were not in trim for a fight.
The cars had gone, the aeroplanes had gone, one company of the
mounted infantry had marched, Pisani's mules were packed and drawn
up in column. I went off to Nuri Said, standing with Nasir on an
ash heap at the head of the hill, and we wavered whether to run or
stand. At last it seemed wiser to run, since Sheikh Saad was a more
profitable stop-block. So we hurried the regulars away.</p>

<p>Yet things could hardly be left like that. Accordingly Nuri
Shaalan and Tallal led the Rualla horse and the Hauran horse back
to delay the pursuit. They had an unexpected ally, for our cars, on
their way to Azrak, had seen the enemy. After all, the Turks were
not cavalry coming to attack us, but deluded elements seeking a
shorter way home. We took some hundreds of thirsty prisoners and
much transport; causing such panic that the main rout in the plain
cut the traces of their limbers and rode off on the bare horses.
The infection of terror spread down the line, and troops miles from
any Arab interference threw away all they had, even to their
rifles, and made a mad rush towards supposed safety in Deraa.</p>

<p>However, this interruption delayed us; for we could hardly march
a khaki-clad body of regular camel corps across Hauran at night
without enough local cavalry to go bail to the suspicious villagers
that we were not Turks. So late in the afternoon we halted for
Tallal and Nasir and Nuri Shaalan to catch up.</p>

<p>This halt gave some people time to review the proceedings, and
new questions arose as to the wisdom of crossing the railway again,
to put ourselves in the dangerous position of Sheikh Saad, astride
the retreat of the main Turkish forces. Finally, near midnight,
Sabin appeared where I lay awake in the midst of the army on my
carpet. He suggested that we had done enough. Allenby had appointed
us watchmen of the Fourth Army. We had just seen its disordered
flight. Our duty was completed; and we might honourably fall back
to Bosra, twenty miles out of the way to the east, where the Druses
were collecting under Nesib el Bekri to help us. We might wait with
them for the British to take Deraa, and for our reward, in the
victorious close of the campaign.</p>

<p>This attitude passed me by, since, if we withdrew to Jebel
Druse, we ended our active service before the game was won, leaving
the last brunt on Allenby. I was very jealous for the Arab honour,
in whose service I would go forward at all costs. They had joined
the war to win freedom, and the recovery of their old capital by
force of their own arms was the sign they would best
understand.</p>

<p>'Duty', like people who praised it, was a poor thing. Evidently,
by thrusting behind Deraa into Sheikh Saad we put more pressure on
the Turks than any British unit was in place to put. It would
forbid the Turks fighting again this side of Damascus; for which
gain our few lives would be cheap payment. Damascus meant the end
of this war in the East, and, I believed, the end of the general
war, too; because the Central Powers being inter-dependent, the
breaking of their weakest link&mdash;Turkey&mdash;would swing the
whole cluster loose. Therefore, for every sensible reason,
strategical, tactical, political, even moral, we were going on.</p>

<p>Sabin's stubborn resistant mind was not to be convinced. He
returned with Pisani and Winterton, and began to debate; speaking
slowly because Nuri Said was lying on the next rug only half
asleep, and he wanted to include him in the conference.</p>

<p>Accordingly he stressed the military aspect: our fulfilled
purpose and the danger of the Hejaz Railway. This delay made us too
late to cross to-night. To-morrow it would be madness to attempt
the operation. The line would be guarded from end to end by tens of
thousands of Turks pouring out of Deraa. If they let us over we
would only be in still greater danger. Joyce, he said, had
appointed him military adviser to the expedition; and it was his
duty to point out, reluctantly, that as a regular officer he knew
his business.</p>

<p>Had I been a regular officer I might have found Sabin's
upsetting the others irregular. As it was I endured his complaints,
patiently sighing whenever I thought it would irritate the
protestant. At the end wanderingly I said I wanted to sleep, since
we would have to be up early to cross the line, and it was my
intention to go in front with my bodyguard among the Beduin,
wherever they were, for it was odd that Nuri Shaalan and Tallal had
not overtaken us. Anyway, I was going to sleep now.</p>

<p>Pisani, whose long military life had been all as subordinate,
said with correctness that he took his orders and would follow. I
liked him for that, and tried to soothe his honest doubts by
reminding him that we had worked for eighteen months together
without his ever finding cause to call me rash. He replied with a
French laugh that he thought it all very rash, but was a
soldier.</p>

<p>Winterton's instinct joined him to the weaker and more sporting
side in any choice but fox-hunting. Nuri Said had lain silently
through our talk, pretending to be asleep; but, when Sabin went
away, he rolled over whispering, Is it true?' I replied that I saw
no unusual risk in crossing the line in mid-afternoon, and with
care we should avoid traps at Sheikh Saad. He lay back
satisfied.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CXVI</h3>

<p>Nasir, Nuri Shaalan and Talal had overshot us in the dark. Our
joined forces marched, with a heady breeze in the teeth, northward
across the ploughlands' fat, happy villages. Over the harvested
fields, whose straw had been rather plucked than reaped, grew
thistles, tall as a child, but now yellow and dried and dead. The
wind snapped them off at the hollow root, and pitch-polled their
branchy tops along the level ground, thistle blowing against
thistle and interlocking spines, till in huge balls they careered
like run-away haycocks across the fallow.</p>

<p>Arab women, out with their donkeys to fetch water, ran to us,
crying that an aeroplane had landed a while since, near by. It bore
the round rings of the Sherifian camel brand upon its body. Peake
rode across, to find two Australians whose Bristol had been hit in
the radiator, over Deraa. They were glad, though astonished, to
meet friends. After the leak had been plugged, we levied water from
the women, to fill them up, and they flew home safely.</p>

<p>Men rode up every minute and joined us, while from each village
the adventurous young ran out afoot to enter our ranks. As we moved
on, so closely knit in the golden sunlight, we were able, in rare
chance, to see ourselves as a whole: quickly we became a character,
an organism, in whose pride each of us was uplifted. We cracked
bawdy jokes to set off the encompassing beauty.</p>

<p>At noon we entered water-melon fields. The army ran upon them,
while we spied out the line, which lay desertedly quivering in the
sunlight ahead. As we watched a train passed down. Only last night
had the railway been mended: and this was the third train. We moved
without opposition upon the line in a horde two miles across, and
began hastily to blow up things, anyone who had explosive using it
as he fancied. Our hundreds of novices were full of zeal and the
demolitions, albeit uninstructed, were wide.</p>

<p>Clearly our return had surprised the dazed enemy: we must extend
and improve this chance. So we went to Nuri Shaalan, Auda, and
Talal, and asked what local effort each would undertake. Talal, the
energetic, would attack Ezraa, the big grain depot to the north:
Auda was for Khirbet el Ghazala, the corresponding station
south-ward: Nuri would sweep his men down the main road, towards
Deraa, on chance of Turkish parties.</p>

<p>These were three good ideas. The chiefs went to put them into
being, while we, pulling our column to its shape again, pursued our
road past the ruined colony of Sheikh Miskin, very gaunt in the
moonlight. Its obstacle of water ditches muddled our thousands, so
that we halted on the stubble plain beyond, for dawn. Some made
fires against the penetrating mist of this clay Hauran: others
slept as they were on the dew-slimy ground. Lost men went about
calling their friends, in that sharp, full-throated wail of the
Arab villager. The moon had set, and the world was black and very
cold.</p>

<p>I roused my bodyguard, who rode so briskly that we entered
Sheikh Saad with the dawn. As we passed between the rocks into the
field behind the trees, the earth sprang to life again with the new
sun. The morning airs flashed the olive-yards to silver, and men
from a great goat-hair tent on the right called us to guest with
them. We asked whose camp it was. 'Ibn Smeir's' they replied. This
threatened complications. Rashid was an enemy of Nuri Shaalan's,
unreconciled, chance-met. At once we sent a warning to Nasir.
Fortunately Ibn Smeir was absent. So his family would be our
temporary guests, and Nuri, as host, must observe the rules.</p>

<p>It was a relief, for already in our ranks we had hundreds of
deadly enemies, their feuds barely suspended by Feisal's peace. The
strain of keeping them in play, and employing their hot-heads in
separate spheres, balancing opportunity and service that our
direction might be esteemed as above jealousy&mdash;all that was
evil enough. Conduct of the war in France would have been harder if
each division, almost each brigade, of our army had hated every
other with a deadly hatred and fought when they met suddenly.
However, we had kept them quiet for two years, and it would be only
a few days now.</p>

<p>The parties of the night returned, full of spoil. Ezraa had been
feebly held by Abd el Kader, the Algerian, with his retainers, some
volunteers and troops. When Talal came the volunteers joined him,
the troops fled, and the retainers were so few that Abd el Kader
had to abandon the place without fighting. Our men were too heavy
with their great booty to catch him.</p>

<p>Auda came, boasting. He had taken el Ghazale by storm, capturing
a derelict train, guns and two hundred men, of whom some were
Germans. Nuri Shaalan reported four hundred prisoners with mules
and machine-guns. The rank and file of Turks had been farmed out to
remote villages, to earn their keep.</p>

<p>An English aeroplane flew round and round, wondering if we were
the Arab force. Young spread out ground signals, and to him they
dropped a message that Bulgaria had surrendered to the Allies. We
had not known there was an offensive in the Balkans, so the news
came orphaned, and as it were insignificant to us. Undoubtedly the
end, not only of the great war, but of our war, was near. A sharp
effort, and our trial would be over and everyone loosed back to his
affairs, forgetting the madness: since for most of us it was the
first war, and we looked to its end as rest and peace.</p>

<p>The army had arrived. The groves became thronged as each
detachment picked out the best vacant place and unsaddled, whether
beside fig-trees, or under palms, or olives, from which the birds
burst out in frightened clouds, with a multitudinous crying. Our
men took their animals to the stream meandering through green
bushes and flowers and cultivated fruits, things strange to us
during the years of our wandering in the flinty desert.</p>

<p>The people of Sheikh Saad came shyly to look at Feisal's army,
which had been a whispered legendary thing, and was now in their
village, led by renowned or formidable names&mdash;Talal, Nasir,
Nuri, Suda. We stared back, in secret envy of their peasant
life.</p>

<p>While the men stretched the saddle-stiffness of riding from thin
legs, we went up, five or six of us, above the ruins, whence across
the southern plain we should see the measure of security in store
for us. To our astonishment we perceived, just over the walls, a
thin company of regulars in uniform&mdash;Turks, Austrians,
Germans&mdash;with eight machine guns on pack-animals. They were
toiling up from Galilee towards Damascus after their defeat by
Allenby; hopeless, but care-free, marching at ease, thinking
themselves fifty miles from any war.</p>

<p>We did not give an alarm, to spare our tired troops pains: just
Durzi ibn Dughmi, with the Khaffaji and others of the family,
mounted quietly and fell on them from a narrow lane. The officers
showed fight and were instantly killed. The men threw down their
arms, and in five minutes had been searched and robbed and were
being shepherded in file along the water-paths between the gardens
to an open pound which seemed fit for our prison. Sheikh Saad was
paying soon and well.</p>

<p>Away to the east appeared three or four black knots of people,
moving northward. We loosed the Howeitat on them, and after an hour
they returned in laughter, each man leading a mule or pack-horse;
poor, tired, galled brutes, showing all too clearly the straits of
the beaten army. The riders had been unarmed soldiers fleeing from
the British. The Howeitat disdained to make such prisoners. We gave
them to the boys and girls of the villages for servants,' sneered
Zaal, with his thin-lipped smile.</p>

<p>News came to us from the west that small companies of Turks were
retiring into the local villages from Chauvel's attacks. We sent
against them armed parties of Nairn, a peasant tribe which had
joined us last night at Sheikh Miskin, as appointed by Nasir, to do
what they could. The mass rising we had so long prepared was now in
flood, rising higher as each success armed more rebels. In two
days' time we might have sixty thousand armed men in movement.</p>

<p>We snapped up further trifles on the Damascus road; and then saw
heavy smoke above the hill which hid Deraa. A man cantered in, to
inform Tallal that the Germans had set fire to aeroplanes and
storehouses, and stood ready to evacuate the town. A British plane
dropped word that Barrow's troops were near Remtha, and that two
Turkish columns, one of four thousand, one of two thousand, were
retiring towards us from Deraa and Mezerib respectively.</p>

<p>It seemed to me that these six thousand men were all that
remained of the Fourth Army, from Deraa, and of the Seventh Army,
which had been disputing Barrow's advance. With their destruction
would end our purpose here. Yet, till we knew, we must retain
Sheikh Saad. So the larger column, the four thousand, we would let
pass, only fastening to them Khalid and his Rualla, with some
northern peasantry, to harry their flanks and rear.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CXVII</h3>

<p>The nearer two thousand seemed more our size. We would meet them
with half our regulars, and two of Pisani's guns. Tallal was
anxious, for their indicated route would bring them through Tafas,
his own village. He determined us to make speed there and seize the
ridge south of it. Unfortunately speed was only a relative term
with men so tired. I rode with my troop to Tafas, hoping to occupy
a shadow position beyond it and fight a retiring action till the
rest came up. Half-way on the road, there met us mounted Arabs,
herding a drove of stripped prisoners towards Sheikh Saad. They
were driving them mercilessly, the bruises of their urging blue
across the ivory backs; but I left them to it, for these were Turks
of the police battalion of Deraa, beneath whose iniquities the
peasant-faces of the neighbourhood had run with tears and blood,
innumerable times.</p>

<p>The Arabs told us that the Turkish column&mdash;Jemal Pasha's
lancer regiment&mdash;was already entering Tafas. When we got
within sight, we found they had taken the village (from which
sounded an occasional shot) and were halted about it. Small pyres
of smoke were going up from between the houses. On the rising
ground to this side, knee-deep in the thistles, stood a remnant of
old men, women and children, telling terrible stories of what had
happened when the Turks rushed in an hour before.</p>

<p>We lay on watch, and saw the enemy force march away from their
assembly-ground behind the houses. They headed in good order
towards Miskin, the lancers in front and rear, composite formations
of infantry disposed in column with machine-gun support as flank
guards, guns and a mass of transport in the centre. We opened fire
on the head of their line when it showed itself beyond the houses.
They turned two field-guns upon us, for reply. The shrapnel was as
usual over-fused, and passed safely above our heads.</p>

<p>Nuri came with Pisani. Before their ranks rode Auda abu Tayi,
expectant, and Tallal, nearly frantic with the tales his people
poured out of the sufferings of the village. The last Turks were
now quitting it. We slipped down behind them to end Tallal's
suspense, while our infantry took position and fired strongly with
the Hotchkiss; Pisani advanced his half battery among them; so that
the French high explosive threw the rearguard into confusion.</p>

<p>The village lay stilly under its slow wreaths of white smoke, as
we rode near, on our guard. Some grey heaps seemed to hide in the
long grass, embracing the ground in the close way of corpses. We
looked away from these, knowing they were dead; but from one a
little figure tottered off, as if to escape us. It was a child,
three or four years old, whose dirty smock was stained red over one
shoulder and side, with blood from a large half-fibrous wound,
perhaps a lance thrust, just where neck and body joined.</p>

<p>The child ran a few steps, then stood and cried to us in a tone
of astonishing strength (all else being very silent), 'Don't hit
me, Baba'. Abd el Aziz, choking out something&mdash;this was his
village, and she might be of his family&mdash;flung himself off his
camel, and stumbled, kneeling, in the grass beside the child. His
suddenness frightened her, for she threw up her arms and tried to
scream; but, instead, dropped in a little heap, while the blood
rushed out again over her clothes; then, I think, she died.</p>

<p>We rode past the other bodies of men and women and four more
dead babies, looking very soiled in the daylight, towards the
village; whose loneliness we now knew meant death and horror. By
the outskirts were low mud walls, sheepfolds, and on one something
red and white. I looked close and saw the body of a woman folded
across it, bottom upwards, nailed there by a saw bayonet whose haft
stuck hideously into the air from between her naked legs. She had
been pregnant, and about her lay others, perhaps twenty in all,
variously killed, but set out in accord with an obscene taste.</p>

<p>The Zaagi burst into wild peals of laughter, the more desolate
for the warm sunshine and clear air of this upland afternoon. I
said, 'The best of you brings me the most Turkish dead', and we
turned after the fading enemy, on our way shooting down those who
had fallen out by the roadside and came imploring our pity. One
wounded Turk, half naked, not able to stand, sat and wept to us.
Abdulla turned away his camel's head, but the Zaagi, with curses,
crossed his track and whipped three bullets from his automatic
through the man's bare chest. The blood came out with his heart
beats, throb, throb, throb, slower and slower.</p>

<p>Tallal had seen what we had seen. He gave one moan like a hurt
animal; then rode to the upper ground and sat there a while on his
mare, shivering and looking fixedly after the Turks. I moved near
to speak to him, but Auda caught my rein and stayed me. Very slowly
Tallal drew his head-cloth about his face; and then he seemed
suddenly to take hold of himself, for he dashed his stirrups into
the mare's flanks and galloped headlong, bending low and swaying in
the saddle, right at the main body of the enemy.</p>

<p>It was a long ride down a gentle slope and across a hollow. We
sat there like stone while he rushed forward, the drumming of his
hoofs unnaturally loud in our ears, for we had stopped shooting,
and the Turks had stopped. Both armies waited for him; and he
rocked on in the hushed evening till only a few lengths from the
enemy. Then he sat up in the saddle and cried his war-cry, Tallal,
Tallal', twice in a tremendous shout. Instantly their rifles and
machine-guns crashed out, and he and his mare, riddled through and
through with bullets, fell dead among the lance points.</p>

<p>Auda looked very cold and grim. 'God give him mercy; we will
take his price.' He shook his rein and moved slowly after the
enemy. We called up the peasants, now drunk with fear and blood,
and sent them from this side and that against the retreating
column. The old lion of battle waked in Auda's heart, and made him
again our natural, inevitable leader. By a skilful turn he drove
the Turks into bad ground and split their formation into three
parts.</p>

<p>The third part, the smallest, was mostly made up of German and
Austrian machine-gunners grouped round three motor-cars, and a
handful of mounted officers or troopers. They fought magnificently
and repulsed us time and again despite our hardiness. The Arabs
were fighting like devils, the sweat blurring their eyes, dust
parching their throats; while the flame of cruelty and revenge
which was burning in their bodies so twisted them, that their hands
could hardly shoot. By my order we took no prisoners, for the only
time in our war.</p>

<p>At last we left this stern section behind, and pursued the
faster two. They were in panic; and by sunset we had destroyed all
but the smallest pieces of them, gaining as and by what they lost.
Parties of peasants flowed in on our advance. At first there were
five or six to a weapon: then one would win a bayonet, another a
sword, a third a pistol. An hour later those who had been on foot
would be on donkeys. Afterwards every man had a rifle, and a
captured horse. By nightfall the horses were laden, and the rich
plain was scattered over with dead men and animals. In a madness
born of the horror of Tafas we killed and killed, even blowing in
the heads of the fallen and of the animals; as though their death
and running blood could slake our agony.</p>

<p>Just one group of Arabs, who had not heard our news, took
prisoner the last two hundred men of the central section. Their
respite was short. I had gone up to learn why it was, not unwilling
that this remnant be let live as witnesses of Tallal's price; but a
man on the ground behind them screamed something to the Arabs, who
with pale faces led me across to see. It was one of us&mdash;his
thigh shattered. The blood had rushed out over the red soil, and
left him dying; but even so he had not been spared. In the fashion
of to-day's battle he had been further tormented by bayonets
hammered through his shoulder and other leg into the ground,
pinning him out like a collected insect.</p>

<p>He was fully conscious. When we said, Tlassan, who did it?' he
drooped his eyes towards the prisoners, huddling together so
hopelessly broken. They said nothing in the moments before we
opened fire. At last their heap ceased moving; and Hassan was dead;
and we mounted again and rode home slowly (home was my carpet three
or four hours from us at Sheikh Saad) in the gloom, which felt so
chill now that the sun had gone down.</p>

<p>However, what with wounds and aches and weariness I could not
rest from thinking of Tallal, the splendid leader, the fine
horseman, the courteous and strong companion of the road; and after
a while I had my other camel brought, and with one of my bodyguard
rode out into the night to join our men hunting the greater Deraa
column.</p>

<p>It was very dark, with a wind beating in great gusts from the
south and east; and only by the noise of shots it tossed across to
us and by occasional gun flashes, did we at length come to the
fighting. Every field and valley had its Turks stumbling blindly
northward. Our men were clinging on. The fall of night had made
them bolder, and they were now closing with the enemy. Each
village, as the fight rolled to it, took up the work; and the
black, icy wind was wild with rifle-fire, shoutings, volleys from
the Turks, and the rush of gallops, as small parties of either side
crashed frantically together.</p>

<p>The enemy had tried to halt and camp at sunset, but Khalid had
shaken them again into movement. Some marched, some stayed. Many
dropped asleep in their tracks with fatigue. They had lost order
and coherence, and were drifting through the blast in lorn packets,
ready to shoot and run at every contact with us or with each other;
and the Arabs were as scattered, and nearly as uncertain.</p>

<p>Exceptions were the German detachments; and here, for the first
time, I grew proud of the enemy who had killed my brothers. They
were two thousand miles from home, without hope and without guides,
in conditions mad enough to break the bravest nerves. Yet their
sections held together, in firm rank, sheering through the wrack of
Turk and Arab like armoured ships, high-faced and silent. When
attacked they halted, took position, fired to order. There was no
haste, no crying, no hesitation. They were glorious.</p>

<p>At last I found Khalid, and asked him to call off the Rualla and
leave this rout to time and the peasantry. Heavier work, perhaps,
lay to the southward. At dusk a rumour had passed across our plain
that Deraa was empty, and Trad, Khalid's brother, with a good half
of the Anazeh, had ridden off to see. I feared a reverse for him,
since there must still be Turks in the place, and more struggling
towards it up the railway and through the Irbid Hills. Indeed,
unless Barrow, last reported to us as delayed in Remthe, had lost
contact with his enemy, there must be a fighting rearguard yet to
follow.</p>

<p>I wanted Khalid to support his brother. After an hour or two of
shouting his message down the wind, hundreds of horsemen and camel
men had rallied to him. On his way to Deraa he charged through and
over several detachments of Turks in the star-blink, and arrived to
find Trad in secure possession. He had won through in the later
twilight, taking the station at a gallop, jumping trenches and
blotting out the scanty Turkish elements which still tried to
resist.</p>

<p>With local help the Rualla plundered the camp, especially
finding booty in the fiercely burning storehouses whose flaming
roofs imperilled their lives; but this was one of the nights in
which mankind went crazy, when death seemed impossible, however
many died to the right and left, and when others' lives became toys
to break and throw away.</p>

<p>Sheikh Saad passed a troubled evening of alarms and shots and
shouts, with threatenings from the peasantry to murder the
prisoners as added price of Tallal and his village. The active
sheikhs were out hunting the Turks, and their absence with their
retainers deprived the Arab camp of its experienced chiefs and of
its eyes and ears. Sleeping clan-jealousies had awaked in the blood
thirst of the afternoon of killing, and Nasir and Nuri Said, Young
and Winterton had to strain every nerve in keeping peace.</p>

<p>I got in after midnight and found Trad's messengers just arrived
from Deraa. Nasir left to join him. I had wished to sleep, for this
was my fourth night of riding; but my mind would not let me feel
how tired my body was, so about two in the morning I mounted a
third camel and splashed out towards Deraa, down the Tafas track
again, to windward of the dark village.</p>

<p>Nuri Said and his staff were riding the same road in advance of
their mounted infantry, and our parties hurried together till the
half-light came. Then my impatience and the cold would not let me
travel horsepace any longer. I gave liberty to my camel&mdash;the
grand, rebellious Baha&mdash;and she stretched herself out against
the field, racing my wearied followers for mile upon mile with
piston-strides like an engine, so that I entered Deraa quite alone
in the full dawn.</p>

<p>Nasir was at the Mayor's house, arranging a military governor,
and police; and for an inquisition of the place; I supplemented his
ideas, putting guards over the pumps and engine sheds and what
remained of tool shops or stores. Then in an hour of talk I built
up publicly a programme of what the situation would demand of them,
if they were not to lose hold. Poor Nasir stared in
bewilderment.</p>

<p>I inquired about General Barrow. A man just ridden in from the
west told us he had been fired on by the English, as they deployed
to attack the town. To prevent such an accident the Zaagi and I
rode up the Buweib, on whose crest was visible a strong post of
Indian machine-gunners. They trained their weapons on us, proud of
such splendidly dressed prizes. However, an officer showed himself,
with some British troopers, and to them I explained myself. They
were indeed in the midst of an enveloping movement against Deraa,
and, while we watched, their aeroplanes bombed the luckless Nuri
Said as he rode into the railway station. This was his penalty for
losing the race from Sheikh Saad: but, to stop it, I hurried down
to where General Barrow was inspecting outposts in a car.</p>

<p>I told him we had spent the night in the town, and the shooting
he heard was joy-firing. He was short with me; but I had little
pity for him, because he had delayed a day and night watering at
the poor wells of Remthe, though his map showed the lake and river
of Mezerib in front, on the road by which the enemy were escaping.
However his orders were Deraa, and to Deraa he would go.</p>

<p>He told me to ride beside him: but his horses hated my camel, so
the General Staff bucked along the ditch, while I soberly paced the
crown of the road. He said he must post sentries in the village to
keep the populace in order. I explained gently that the Arabs had
installed their military governor. At the wells he said his sappers
must inspect the pumps. I replied welcoming their assistance. We
had lit the furnaces and hoped to begin watering his horses in an
hour. He snorted that we seemed to be at home; he would take charge
only of the railway station. I pointed to the engine moving out
towards Mezerib (where our little Sheikh had prevented the Turks
from blowing up the Tell el Shehab bridge, now become Arab
property) and asked that his sentries be instructed not to
interfere with our proper working of the line.</p>

<p>He had had no orders as to the status of the Arabs. Clayton did
us this service, thinking we should deserve what we could assert:
so Barrow, who had come in thinking of them as a conquered people,
though dazed at my calm assumption that he was my guest, had no
option but to follow the lead of such assurance. My head was
working full speed in these minutes, on our joint behalf, to
prevent the fatal first steps by which the unimaginative British,
with the best will in the world, usually deprived the acquiescent
native of the discipline of responsibility, and created a situation
which called for years of agitation and successive reforms and
riotings to mend.</p>

<p>I had studied Barrow and was ready for him. Years before, he had
published his confession of faith in Fear as the common people's
main incentive to action in war and peace. Now I found fear a mean,
overrated motive; no deterrent, and, though a stimulant, a
poisonous stimulant, whose every injection served to consume more
of the system to which it was applied. I could have no alliance
with his pedant belief of scaring men into heaven: better that
Barrow and I part at once. My instinct with the inevitable was to
provoke it. Therefore, I was very spiny and high.</p>

<p>Barrow surrendered himself by asking me to find him forage and
foodstuffs. Indeed, soon we got on well. In the square I showed him
Nasir's little silk pennon, propped on the balcony of the charred
Government office, with a yawning sentry underneath. Barrow drew
himself up and saluted sharply, while a thrill of pleasure at the
General's compliment ran round Arab officers and men.</p>

<p>In return we strove to keep self-assertion within the bounds of
political necessity. On all Arabs we impressed that these Indian
troops were guests, and must be permitted, nay helped, to do
anything they wished. The doctrine took us into unexpected places.
Every chicken disappeared from the village, and three sowars
carried off Nasir's pennon, having coveted the silver knobs and
spike of its dainty staff. This pointed a contrast between the
English General who saluted and the Indian trooper who stole: a
contrast welcome to the Arab race&mdash;hesitation towards the
Indians.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, everywhere we were taking men and guns. Our prisoners
could be counted in thousands. Some we handed over to the British,
who counted them again: most we boarded-out in the villages. Azrak
heard the full news of victory. Feisal drove in a day later, our
string of armoured cars following his Vauxhall. He installed
himself in the station. I called with my record of stewardship: as
the tale ended the room shook with a gentle earthquake.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CXVIII</h3>

<p>Barrow, now watered and fed, was due to leave for his meeting
with Chauvel near Damascus, that they might enter the city
together. He asked us to take the right flank, which suited me, for
there, along the Hejaz line, was Nasir, hanging on to the main
Turkish retreat, reducing its numbers by continuous attack day and
night. I had still much to do, and therefore waited in Deraa
another night, savouring its quiet after the troops had gone; for
the station stood at the limit of the open country, and the Indians
round it had angered me by their out-of-placeness. The essence of
the desert was the lonely moving individual, the son of the road,
apart from the world as in a grave. These troops, in flocks like
slow sheep, looked not worthy of the privilege of space.</p>

<p>My mind felt in the Indian rank and file something puny and
confined; an air of thinking themselves mean; almost a careful,
esteemed subservience, unlike the abrupt wholesomeness of Beduin.
The manner of the British officers toward their men struck horror
into my bodyguard, who had never seen personal inequality
before.</p>

<p>I had felt man's iniquity here: and so hated Deraa that I lay
each night with my men upon the old aerodrome. By the charred
hangars my guards, fickle-surfaced as the sea, squabbled after
their wont; and there to-night for the last time Abdulla brought me
cooked rice in the silver bowl. After supping, I tried in the
blankness to think forward: but my mind was a blank, my dreams
puffed out like candles by the strong wind of success. In front was
our too-tangible goal: but behind lay the effort of two years, its
misery forgotten or glorified. Names rang through my head, each in
imagination a superlative: Rum the magnificent, brilliant Petra,
Azrak the remote, Batra the very clean. Yet the men had changed.
Death had taken the gentle ones; and the new stridency, of those
who were left, hurt me.</p>

<p>Sleep would not come, so before the light, I woke Stirling and
my drivers, and we four climbed into the Blue Mist, our Bolls
tender, and set out for Damascus, along the dirt road which was
first rutted, and then blocked by the transport columns and
rearguard of Barrow's division. We cut across country to the French
railway, whose old ballast gave us a clear, if rugged, road; then
we put on speed.</p>

<p>At noon we saw Barrow's pennon at a stream, where he was
watering his horses. My bodyguard were near by, so I took my camel
and rode over to him. Like other confirmed horsemen, he had been a
little contemptuous of the camel; and had suggested, in Deraa, that
we might hardly keep up with his cavalry, which was going to
Damascus in about three forced marches.</p>

<p>So when he saw me freshly riding up he was astonished, and asked
when we left Deraa. 'This morning.' His face fell. Where will you
stop to-night?' 'In Damascus,' said I gaily; and rode on, having
made another enemy. It a little smote me to play tricks, for he was
generous towards my wishes: but the stakes were high, beyond his
sight, and I cared nothing what he thought of me so that we
won.</p>

<p>I returned to Stirling, and drove on. At each village we left
notes for the British advance guards, telling them where we were,
and how far beyond us the enemy. It irked Stirling and myself to
see the caution of Barrow's advance; scouts scouting empty valleys,
sections crowning every deserted hill, a screen drawn forward so
carefully over friendly country. It marked the difference between
our certain movements and the tentative processes of normal
war.</p>

<p>There could be no crisis till Kiswe, where we were to meet
Chauvel, and where the Hejaz line approached our road. Upon the
railway were Nasir, Nuri Shaalan and Auda, with the tribes; still
harrying that column of four thousand (but in truth nearer seven)
marked by our aeroplane near Sheikh Saad three busy days ago. They
had fought ceaselessly throughout this time of our ease.</p>

<p>As we drove up we heard firing, and saw shrapnel behind a ridge
to our right, where the railway was. Soon appeared the head of a
Turkish column of about two thousand men, in ragged groups, halting
now and then to fire their mountain guns. We ran on to overtake
their pursuers, our great Rolls very blue on the open road. Some
Arab horsemen from behind the Turks galloped towards us, bucketing
unhandily across the irrigation ditches. We recognized Nasir on his
liver-coloured stallion, the splendid animal yet spirited after its
hundred miles of a running fight: also old Nuri Shaalan and about
thirty of their servants. They told us these few were all that
remained of the seven thousand Turks. The Rualla were hanging
desperately on to both flanks, while Auda abu Tayi had ridden
behind Jebel Mania to gather the Wuld Ali, his friends, and lie in
wait there for this column, which they hoped to drive over the hill
into his ambush. Did our appearance mean help at last?</p>

<p>I told them the British, in force, were just behind. If they
could delay the enemy only an hour...Nasir looked ahead and saw a
walled and wooded farmstead barring the level. He called to Nuri
Shaalan, and they hastened thither to check the Turks.</p>

<p>We drove back three miles to the leading Indians, and told their
ancient, surly Colonel what a gift the Arabs brought. He seemed not
pleased to upset the beautiful order of his march, but at last
opened out a squadron and sent them slowly across the plain towards
the Turks, who turned the little guns their way. One or two shells
burst nearly among the files, and then to our horror (for Nasir had
put himself in jeopardy, expecting courageous help) the Colonel
ordered a retirement, and fell back quickly to the road. Stirling
and myself, hopping mad, dashed down and begged him not to be
afraid of mountain guns, no heavier than Very pistols: but neither
to kindness nor to wrath did the old man budge an inch. We raced a
third time back along the road in search of higher authority.</p>

<p>A red-tipped Aide told us that over there was General Gregory.
We blessed him, Stirling's professional pride nearly in tears at
the mismanagement. We pulled our friend aboard and found his
General, to whom we lent our car that the brigade major might take
hot orders to the cavalry. A galloper hurtled back for the horse
artillery, which opened fire just as the last of the light fled up
the hill to its summit and took refuge in the clouds. Middlesex
Yeomanry appeared and were pushed in among the Arabs, to charge the
Turkish rear; and, as the night fell, we saw the break-up of the
enemy, who abandoned their guns, their transport and all their
stuff and went streaming up the col towards the two peaks of Mania,
escaping into what they thought was empty land beyond.</p>

<p>However, in the empty land was Auda; and in that night of his
last battle the old man killed and killed, plundered and captured,
till dawn showed him the end. There passed the Fourth Army, our
stumbling-block for two years.</p>

<p>Gregory's happy vigour heartened us to face Nasir. We drove to
Kiswe, where we had agreed to meet him before midnight. After us
came the press of Indian troops. We sought a retired spot; but
already there were men by the thousand everywhere.</p>

<p>The movement and cross-currents of so many crowded minds drove
me about, restlessly, like themselves. In the night my colour was
unseen. I could walk as I pleased, an unconsidered Arab: and this
finding myself among, but cut off from, my own kin made me
strangely alone. Our armoured-car men were persons to me, from
their fewness and our long companionship; and also in their selves,
for these months unshieldedly open to the flaming sun and bullying
wind had worn and refined them into individuals. In such a mob of
unaccustomed soldiery, British, Australian and Indian, they went as
strange and timid as myself; distinguished also by grime, for with
weeks of wearing their clothes had been moulded to them by sweat
and use and had become rather integuments than wrappings.</p>

<p>But these others were really soldiers, a novelty after two
years' irregularity. And it came upon me freshly how the secret of
uniform was to make a crowd solid, dignified, impersonal: to give
it the singleness and tautness of an upstanding man. This death's
livery which walled its bearers from ordinary life, was sign that
they had sold their wills and bodies to the State: and contracted
themselves into a service not the less abject for that its
beginning was voluntary. Some of them had obeyed the instinct of
lawlessness: some were hungry: others thirsted for glamour, for the
supposed colour of a military life: but, of them all, those only
received satisfaction who had sought to degrade themselves, for to
the peace-eye they were below humanity. Only women with a lech were
allured by those witnessing clothes; the soldiers' pay, not
sustenance like a labourer's, but pocket-money, seemed most
profitably spent when it let them drink sometimes and forget.</p>

<p>Convicts had violence put upon them. Slaves might be free, if
they could, in intention. But the soldier assigned his owner the
twenty-four hours' use of his body; and sole conduct of his mind
and passions. A convict had licence to hate the rule which confined
him, and all humanity outside, if he were greedy in hate: but the
sulking soldier was a bad soldier; indeed, no soldier. His
affections must be hired pieces on the chess-board of the king.</p>

<p>The strange power of war which made us all as a duty so demean
ourselves! These Australians, shouldering me in unceremonious
horseplay, had put off half civilization with their civil clothes.
They were dominant to-night, too sure of themselves to be careful:
and yet:&mdash; as they lazily swaggered those quick bodies, all
curves with never a straight line, but with old and disillusioned
eyes: and yet:&mdash;I felt them thin-tempered, hollow,
instinctive; always going to do great things; with the disquieting
suppleness of blades half-drawn from the scabbard. Disquieting: not
dreadful.</p>

<p>The English fellows were not instinctive, nor negligent like the
Australians, but held themselves, with a slow-eyed, almost sheepish
care. They were prim in dress, and quiet; going shyly in pairs. The
Australians stood in groups and walked singly: the British clung
two and two, in a celibate friendliness which expressed the level
of the ranks: the commonness of their Army clothes. 'Holding
together' they called it: a war-time yearning to keep within four
ears such thoughts as were deep enough to hurt.</p>

<p>About the soldiers hung the Arabs: gravely-gazing men from
another sphere. My crooked duty had banished me among them for two
years. To-night I was nearer to them than to the troops, and I
resented it, as shameful. The intruding contrast mixed with longing
for home, to sharpen my faculties and make fertile my distaste,
till not merely did I see the unlikeness of race, and hear the
unlikeness of language, but I learned to pick between their smells:
the heavy, standing, curdled sourness of dried sweat in cotton,
over the Arab crowds; and the feral smell of English soldiers: that
hot pissy aura of thronged men in woollen clothes: a tart pungency,
breath-catching, ammoniacal: a fervent fermenting
naphtha-smell.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CXIX</h3>

<p>Our war was ended. Even though we slept that night in Kiswe, for
the Arabs told us the roads were dangerous, and we had no wish to
die stupidly in the dark at the gate of Damascus. The sporting
Australians saw the campaign as a point-to-point, with Damascus the
post; but in reality we were all under Allenby, now, and the
victory had been the logical fruit solely of his genius, and
Bartholomew's pains.</p>

<p>Their tactical scheme properly put the Australians north and
west of Damascus, across its railways, before the southern column
might enter it: and we, the Arab leaders, had waited for the slower
British partly because Allenby never questioned our fulfilling what
was ordered. Power lay in his calm assumption that he would receive
as perfect obedience as he gave trust.</p>

<p>He hoped we would be present at the entry, partly because he
knew how much more than a mere trophy Damascus was to the Arabs:
partly for prudential reasons. Feisal's movement made the enemy
country friendly to the Allies as they advanced, enabling convoys
to go up without escort, towns to be administered without garrison.
In their envelopment of Damascus the Australians might be forced,
despite orders, to enter the town. If anyone resisted them it would
spoil the future. One night was given us to make the Damascenes
receive the British Army as their allies.</p>

<p>This was a revolution in behaviour, if not in opinion; but
Feisal's Damascus committee had for months been prepared to take
over the reins when the Turks crashed. We had only to get in touch
with them, to tell them the movements of the Allies, and what was
required. So as dusk deepened Nasir sent the Rualla horse into the
town, to find Ali Riza, the chairman of our committee, or Shukri el
Ayubi, his assistant, telling them that relief would be available
on the morrow, if they constructed a government at once. As a
matter of fact it had been done at four o'clock in the afternoon,
before we took action. Ali Riza was absent, put in command at the
last moment by the Turks of the retreat of their army from Galilee
before Chauvel: but Shukri found unexpected support from the
Algerian brothers, Mohammed Said and Abd el Kader. With the help of
then-retainers the Arab flag was on the Town Hall before sunset as
the last echelons of Germans and Turks defiled past. They say the
hindmost general saluted it, ironically.</p>

<p>I dissuaded Nasir from going in. This would be a night of
confusion, and it would better serve his dignity if he entered
serenely at dawn. He and Nuri Shaalan intercepted the second body
of Rualla camel men, who had started out with me from Deraa this
morning; and sent them all forward into Damascus, to support the
Rualla sheikhs. So by midnight, when we went to rest, we had four
thousand of our armed men in the town.</p>

<p>I wanted to sleep, for my work was coming on the morrow; but I
could not. Damascus was the climax of our two years' uncertainty,
and my mind was distracted by tags of all the ideas which had been
used or rejected in that time. Also Kiswe was stifling with the
exhalations of too many trees, too many plants, too many human
beings: a microcosm of the crowded world in front of us.</p>

<p>As the Germans left Damascus they fired the dumps and ammunition
stores, so that every few minutes we were jangled by explosions,
whose first shock set the sky white with flame. At each such roar
the earth seemed to shake; we would lift our eyes to the north and
see the pale sky prick out suddenly in sheaves of yellow points, as
the shells, thrown to terrific heights from each bursting magazine,
in their turn burst like clustered rockets. I turned to Stirling
and muttered 'Damascus is burning', sick to think of the great town
in ashes as the price of freedom.</p>

<p>When dawn came we drove to the head of the ridge, which stood
over the oasis of the city, afraid to look north for the ruins we
expected: but, instead of ruins, the silent gardens stood blurred
green with river mist, in whose setting shimmered the city,
beautiful as ever, like a pearl in the morning sun. The uproar of
the night had shrunk to a stiff tall column of smoke, which rose in
sullen blackness from the store-yard by Kadem, terminus of the
Hejaz line.</p>

<p>We drove down the straight banked road through the watered
fields, in which the peasants were just beginning their day's work.
A galloping horseman checked at our head-cloths in the car, with a
merry salutation, holding out a bunch of yellow grapes. 'Good
news&mdash;Damascus salutes you.' He came from Shukri.</p>

<p>Nasir was just beyond us: to him we carried the tidings, that he
might have the honourable entry, a privilege of his fifty battles.
With Nuri Shaalan beside him, he asked a final gallop from his
horse, and vanished down the long road in a cloud of dust, which
hung reluctantly in the air between the water splashes. To give him
a fair start, Stirling and I found a little stream, cool in the
depths of a steep channel. By it we stopped, to wash and shave.</p>

<p>Some Indian troopers peered at us and our car and its ragged
driver's army shorts and tunic. I was in pure Arab dress; Stirling,
but for his head-covering, was all British staff officer. Their
N.C.O., an obtuse and bad-tempered person, thought he had taken
prisoners. When delivered from his arrest we judged we might go
after Nasir.</p>

<p>Quite quietly we drove up the long street to the Government
buildings on the bank of the Barada. The way was packed with
people, lined solid on the side-walks, in the road, at the windows
and on the balconies or house-tops. Many were crying, a few cheered
faintly, some bolder ones cried our names: but mostly they looked
and looked, joy shining in their eyes. A movement like a long sigh
from gate to heart of the city, marked our course.</p>

<p>At the Town Hall things were different. Its steps and stairs
were packed with a swaying mob: yelling, embracing, dancing,
singing. They crushed a way for us to the antechamber, where were
the gleaming Nasir, and Nuri Shaalan, seated. On either side of
them stood Abd el Kader, my old enemy, and Mohammed Said, his
brother. I was dumb with amazement. Mohammed Said leaped forward
and shouted that they, grandsons of Abd el Kader, the Emir, with
Shukri el Ayubi, of Saladin's house, had formed the government and
proclaimed Hussein 'King of the Arabs' yesterday, into the ears of
the humbled Turks and Germans.</p>

<p>While he ranted I turned to Shukri, who was no statesman, but a
beloved man, almost a martyr in the people's eyes, because of what
he had suffered from Jemal. He told me how the Algerians, alone of
all Damascus, had stood by the Turks till they saw them running.
Then, with their Algerians, they had burst in upon Feisal's
committee where it sat in secret, and brutally assumed control.</p>

<p>They were fanatics, whose ideas were theological, not logical;
and I turned to Nasir, meaning through him to check their impudence
now from the start; but there came a diversion. The screaming press
about us parted as though a ram drove through, men going down to
right and left among ruined chairs and tables, while the terrific
roaring of a familiar voice triumphed, and stilled them dead.</p>

<p>In the cleared space were Auda abu Tayi and Sultan el Atrash,
chief of the Druses, tearing one another. Their followers bounded
forward, while I jumped in to drive them apart; crashing upon
Mohammed el Dheilan, filled with the same purpose. Together we
broke them, and forced Auda back a pace, while Hussein el Atrash
hustled the lighter Sultan into the crowd, and away to a side
room.</p>

<p>Auda was too blind with rage to be fairly conscious. We got him
into the great state-hall of the building; an immense, pompous,
gilded room, quiet as the grave, since all doors but ours were
locked. We pushed him into a chair and held him, while in his fits
he foamed and shouted till his voice cracked, his body twitching
and jerking, arms lunging wildly at any weapon within reach, his
face swollen with blood, bareheaded, the long hair streaming over
his eyes.</p>

<p>The old man had been hit first, by Sultan, and his ungovernable
spirit, drunk with a life-time's wine of self-will, raved to wash
out the insult in Druse blood. Zaal came in, with the Hubsi; and
the four or five of us united to restrain him: but it was half an
hour before he calmed enough to hear us speaking, and another
half-hour before we had his promise to leave his satisfaction, for
three days, in the hands of Mohammed and myself. I went out and had
Sultan el Atrash taken secretly from the town with all speed; and
then looked round for Nasir and Abd el Kader, to set in order their
Government.</p>

<p>They were gone. The Algerians had persuaded Nasir to their house
for refreshment. It was a good hap, for there were more pressing
public things. We must prove the old days over, a native government
in power: for this Shukri would be my best instrument, as acting
Governor. So in the Blue Mist, we set off to show ourselves, his
enlargement in authority itself a banner of revolution for the
citizens.</p>

<p>When we came in there had been some miles of people greeting us,
now there were thousands for every hundred then. Every man, woman
and child in this city of a quarter-million souls seemed in the
streets, waiting only the spark of our appearance to ignite their
spirits. Damascus went mad with joy. The men tossed up their
tar-bushes to cheer, the women tore off their veils. Householders
threw flowers, hangings, carpets, into the road before us: their
wives leaned, screaming with laughter, through the lattices and
splashed us with bath-dippers of scent.</p>

<p>Poor dervishes made themselves our running footmen in front and
behind, howling and cutting themselves with frenzy; and over the
local cries and the shrilling of women came the measured roar of
men's voices chanting, 'Feisal, Nasir, Shukri, Urens', in waves
which began here, rolled along the squares, through the market down
long streets to East gate, round the wall, back up the Meidan; and
grew to a wall of shouts around us by the citadel.</p>

<p>They told me Chauvel was coming; our cars met in the southern
outskirts. I described the excitement in the city, and how our new
government could not guarantee administrative services before the
following day, when I would wait on him, to discuss his needs and
mine. Meanwhile I made myself responsible for public order: only
begging him to keep his men outside, because to-night would see
such carnival as the town had not held for six hundred years, and
its hospitality might pervert their discipline.</p>

<p>Chauvel unwillingly followed my lead, his hesitations ruled by
my certainty. Like Barrow, he had no instructions what to do with
the captured city; and as we had taken possession, knowing our
road, with clear purpose, prepared processes, and assets in hand,
he had no choice but to let us carry on. His chief of staff who did
his technical work, Godwin, a soldier, was delighted to shelve the
responsibility of civil government. His advocacy confirmed my
assumption.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was confirmed in Chauvel's next words, which asked
liberty for himself to drive round the town. I gave it so gladly
that he asked if it would be convenient for him to make formal
entry with his troops on the morrow. I said certainly, and we
thought a little of the route. There flashed into my head the
pleasure of our men at Deraa when Barrow saluted their
flag&mdash;and I quoted it as an example good to follow before the
Town Hall when he marched past. It was a casual thought of mine,
but he saw significance in it: and a grave difficulty if he saluted
any flag except the British. I wanted to make faces at his folly:
but instead, in kindness I kept him company, seeing equal
difficulty in his passing the Arab flag deliberately not noticed.
We stumbled round this problem, while the joyful, unknowing crowd
cheered us. As a compromise I suggested we leave out the Town Hall,
and invent another route, passing, let us say, by the Post Office.
I meant this for farce, since my patience had broken down; but he
took it seriously, as a helpful idea; and in return would concede a
point for my sake and the Arabs. In place of an 'entry' he would
make a 'march through': it meant that instead of going in the
middle he would go at the head, or instead of the head, the middle.
I forgot, or did not well hear, which: for I should not have cared
if he had crawled under or flown over his troops, or split himself
to march both sides.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CXX</h3>

<p>While we discussed ceremonial antics a world of work waited,
inside and outside, for each of us. It was bitter, playing down to
such a part: also the won game of grab left a bad taste in my
mouth, spoiling my entry much as I spoiled Chauvel's. The airy
birds of promise so freely sent to the Arabs in England's day of
need were homing now, to her confusion. However, the course I
mapped for us was proving correct. Another twelve hours, and we
should be safe, with the Arabs in so strong a place that their hand
might hold through the long wrangle and appetite of politics about
to break out about our luscious spoil.</p>

<p>We sneaked back to the Town Hall, to grapple with Abd el Kader:
but he had not returned. I sent for him, and for his brother, and
for Nasir: and got a curt reply that they were sleeping. So should
I have been: but instead four or five of us were eating a
snatch-meal in the gaudy salon, sitting on gold chairs, which
writhed, about a gold table whose legs also writhed obscenely.</p>

<p>I explained pointedly to the messenger what I meant. He
disappeared, and in a few minutes a cousin of the Algerians came
up, very agitated, and said they were on their way. This was an
open lie, but I replied that it was well, since in half an hour I
should have fetched British troops and looked carefully for them.
He ran off in haste; and Nuri Shaalan asked quietly what I meant to
do.</p>

<p>I said I would depose Abd el Kader and Mohammed Said, and
appoint Shukri in their place till Feisal came; and I did it in
this gentle fashion because I was loath to hurt Nasir's feelings,
and had no strength of my own if men resisted. He asked if the
English would not come. I replied Certainly; but the sorrow was
that afterwards they might not go. He thought a moment, and said,
'You shall have the Rualla if you do all your will, and quickly'.
Without waiting, the old man went out to muster me his tribe. The
Algerians came to the tryst with their bodyguards, and with murder
in their eyes: but, on the way, saw Nuri Shaalan's massed lowering
tribesmen; Nuri Said, with his regulars in the square; and within,
my reckless guardsmen lounging in the ante-chamber. They saw
clearly that the game was up: yet it was a stormy meeting.</p>

<p>In my capacity as deputy for Feisal I pronounced their civil
government of Damascus abolished, and named Shukri Pasha Ayubi as
acting Military Governor. Nuri Said was to be Commandant of troops;
Azmi, Adjutant General; Jemil, Chief of Public Security. Mohammed
Said, in a bitter reply, denounced me as a Christian and an
Englishman, and called on Nasir to assert himself.</p>

<p>Poor Nasir, far out of his depth, could only sit and look
miserable at this falling out of friends. Abd el Kader leaped up
and cursed me virulently, puffing himself to a white heat of
passion. His motives seemed dogmatic, irrational: so I took no
heed. This maddened him yet more: suddenly he leaped forward with
drawn dagger.</p>

<p><b>Entering Damascus</b>
</p>
</center>

<p>Like a flash Auda was on him, the old man bristling with the
chained-up fury of the morning, and longing for a fight. It would
have been heaven, for him, to have shredded someone there and then
with his great fingers. Abd el Kader was daunted; and Nuri Shaalan
closed the debate by saying to the carpet (so enormous and violent
a carpet it was) that the Rualla were mine, and no questions asked.
The Algerians rose and swept in high dudgeon from the hall. I was
persuaded they should be seized and shot; but could not make myself
fear their power of mischief, nor set the Arabs an example of
precautionary murder as part of politics.</p>

<p>We passed to work. Our aim was an Arab Government, with
foundations large and native enough to employ the enthusiasm and
self-sacrifice of the rebellion, translated into terms of peace. We
had to save some of the old prophetic personality upon a
substructure to carry that ninety per cent of the population who
had been too solid to rebel, and on whose solidity the new State
must rest.</p>

<p>Rebels, especially successful rebels, were of necessity bad
subjects and worse governors. Feisal's sorry duty would be to rid
himself of his war-friends, and replace them by those elements
which had been most useful to the Turkish Government. Nasir was too
little a political philosopher to feel this. Nuri Said knew, and
Nuri Shaalan.</p>

<p>Quickly they collected the nucleus of a staff, and plunged ahead
as a team. History told us the steps were humdrum: appointments,
offices, and departmental routine. First the police. A commandant
and assistants were chosen: districts allotted: provisional wages,
indents, uniform, responsibilities. The machine began to function.
Then came a complaint of water-supply. The conduit was foul with
dead men and animals. An inspectorate, with its labour corps,
solved this. Emergency regulations were drafted.</p>

<p>The day was drawing in, the world was in the streets: riotous.
We chose an engineer to superintend the power-house, charging him
at all pains to illuminate the town that night. The resumption of
street lighting would be our most signal proof of peace. It was
done, and to its shining quietness much of the order of the first
evening of victory belonged: though our new police were zealous,
and the grave sheikhs of the many quarters helped their patrol.</p>

<p>Then sanitation. The streets were full of the debris of the
broken army, derelict carts and cars, baggage, material, corpses.
Typhus, dysentery and pellagra were rife among the Turks, and
sufferers had died in every shadow along the line of march. Nuri
prepared scavenger gangs to make a first clearing of the pestilent
roads and open places, and rationed out his doctors among the
hospitals, with promises of drugs and food next day, if any could
be found.</p>

<p>Next a fire-brigade. The local engines had been smashed by the
Germans, and the Army storehouses still burned, endangering the
town. Mechanics were cried for; and trained men, pressed into
service, sent down to circumscribe the flames. Then the prisons.
Warders and inmates had vanished from them together. Shukri made a
virtue of that, by amnesties, civil, political, military. The
citizens must be disarmed&mdash;or at least dissuaded from carrying
rifles. A proclamation was the treatment, followed up by
good-humoured banter merging into police activity. This would
effect our end without malice in three or four days.</p>

<p>Relief work. The destitute had been half-starved for days. A
distribution of the damaged food from the Army storehouses was
arranged. After that food must be provided for the general. The
city might be starving in two days: there were no stocks in
Damascus. To get temporary supplies from the near villages was
easy, if we restored confidence, safe-guarded the roads, and
replaced the transport animals, which the Turks had carried off, by
others from the pool of captures. The British would not share out.
We parted with our own animals: our Army transport.</p>

<p>The routine feeding of the place needed the railway. Pointsmen,
drivers, firemen, shopmen, traffic staff had to be found and
reengaged immediately. Then the telegraphs: the junior staff were
available: directors must be found, and linesmen sent out to put
the system in repair. The post could wait a day or two: but
quarters for ourselves and the British were urgent: and so were the
resumption of trade, the opening of shops, and their corollary
needs of markets and acceptable currency.</p>

<p>The currency was horrible. The Australians had looted millions
in Turkish notes, the only stuff in use, and had reduced it to no
value by throwing it about. One trooper gave a five hundred pound
note to a lad who held his horse three minutes. Young tried his
prentice-hand at bolstering it with the last remnant of our Akaba
gold: but new prices had to be fixed, which involved the printing
press; and hardly was that settled when a newspaper was demanded.
Also, as heirs of the Turkish Government, the Arabs must maintain
its records of fisc and property: with the register of souls.
Whereas the old staffs were taking jubilant holiday.</p>

<p>Requisitions plagued us while we were yet half-hungry. Chauvel
had no forage and he had forty thousand horses to feed. If forage
was not brought him he would go seek it and the new-lit freedom
puff out like a match. Syria's status hung on his satisfaction; and
we should find little mercy in his judgements.</p>

<p>Taken all in all, this was a busy evening. We reached an
apparent end by sweeping delegation of office (too often, in our
haste, to hands unworthy), and by drastic cutting down of
efficiency. Stirling the suave, Young the capable, and Kirkbride
the summary backed to their best the open-minded power of the Arab
officers.</p>

<p>Our aim was a facade rather than a fitted building. It was run
up so furiously well that when I left Damascus on October the
fourth the Syrians had their <i>de facto</i> Government, which
endured for two years, without foreign advice, in an occupied
country wasted by war, and against the will of important elements
among the Allies.</p>

<p>Later I was sitting alone in my room, working and thinking out
as firm a way as the turbulent memories of the day allowed, when
the Muedhdhins began to send their call of last prayer through the
moist night over the illuminations of the feasting city. One, with
a ringing voice of special sweetness, cried into my window from a
near mosque. I found myself involuntarily distinguishing his words:
'God alone is great: I testify there are no gods, but God: and
Mohammed his Prophet. Come to prayer: come to security. God alone
is great: there is no god&mdash;but God.'</p>

<p>At the close he dropped his voice two tones, almost to speaking
level, and softly added: 'And He is very good to us this day, O
people of Damascus.' The clamour hushed, as everyone seemed to obey
the call to prayer on this their first night of perfect freedom.
While my fancy, in the overwhelming pause, showed me my loneliness
and lack of reason in their movement: since only for me, of all the
hearers, was the event sorrowful and the phrase meaningless.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CXXI</h3>

<p>Quiveringly a citizen woke me, with word that Abd el Kadir was
making rebellion. I sent over to Nuri Said, glad the Algerian fool
was digging his own pit. He had called his men, told them these
Sherifs were only English creatures, and conjured them to strike a
blow for religion and the Caliph while there was yet time. They,
simple retainers with an ingrained habit of obedience, took his
word for it, and set out to make war on us.</p>

<p>The Druses, for whose tardy services I had this night sharply
refused reward, listened to him. They were sectaries, caring
nothing for Islam or Caliph or Turk, or Abd el Kadir: but an
anti-Christian rising meant plunder, and perhaps Maronites to kill.
So they ran to arms, and began to burst open shops.</p>

<p>We held our hands till day, for our numbers were not so great
that we could throw away our advantage in weapons, and fight in the
dark which made a fool and a man equal. But when dawn hinted itself
we moved men to the upper suburb, and drove the rioters towards the
river districts of the town's centre, where the streets crossed
bridges, and were easy to control.</p>

<p>Then we saw how small the trouble was. Nuri Said had covered the
parades with machine-gun sections, who, in one long rattle of fire,
barraged them across to blank walls. Past these our sweeping
parties urged the dissident. The appalling noise made the Druses
drop their booty and flee down side alleys. Mohammed Said, not so
brave as his brother, was taken in his house, and gaoled in the
Town Hall. Again I itched to shoot him, but waited till we had the
other.</p>

<p>However, Abd el Kader broke back into the country. At noon it
was all over. When things began I had called up Chauvel, who at
once offered his troops. I thanked him, and asked that a second
company of horse be drafted to the Turkish barracks (the nearest
post) to stand by against call: but the fighting was too petty for
that call.</p>

<p>Its best consequence was among the pressmen in an hotel whose
wall was the stop-block of one barrage. They had not dipped their
pens in much blood during this campaign, which had run faster than
their cars; but here was a godsend at their bedroom windows, and
they wrote and telegraphed till Allenby, away in Ramleh, took
fright, sending me a Press despatch which recalled two Balkan wars
and five Armenian massacres, but never carnage like to-day's: the
streets paved with corpses, the gutters running blood, and the
swollen Barada spouting crimson through all the fountains in the
city! My reply was a death-roll, naming the five victims, and the
hurts of the ten wounded. Of the casualties three fell to
Kirkbride's ruthless revolver.</p>

<p>The Druses were expelled from the city, and lost horses and
rifles at the hands of the citizens of Damascus, whom we had formed
for the emergency into civic guards. These gave the town a warlike
look, patrolling till afternoon, when things grew quiet again, and
street traffic normal; with sweetmeats, iced drinks, flowers, and
little Hejaz flags being hawked round by their pedlars as
before.</p>

<p>We returned to the organization of the public services. An
amusing event for me, personally, was an official call from the
Spanish Consul, a polished English-speaking individual, who
introduced himself as Charge d'Affaires for seventeen nationalities
(including all combatants except the Turks) and was in vain search
of the constituted legal authority of the town.</p>

<p>At lunch an Australian doctor implored me, for the sake of
humanity, to take notice of the Turkish hospital. I ran over in my
mind our three hospitals, the military, the civil, the missionary,
and told him they were cared for as well as our means allowed. The
Arabs could not invent drugs, nor could Chauvel give them to us. He
enlarged further; describing an enormous range of filthy buildings
without a single medical officer or orderly, packed with dead and
dying; mainly dysentery cases, but at least some typhoid; and, it
was only to be hoped, no typhus or cholera.</p>

<p>In his descriptions I recognized the Turkish barracks, occupied
by two Australian companies of town reserve. Were there sentries at
the gates? Yes, he said, that was the place, but: it was full of
Turkish sick. I walked across and parleyed with the guard, who
distrusted my single appearance on foot. They had orders to keep
out all natives lest they massacre the patients&mdash;a
misapprehension of the Arab fashion of making war. At last my
English speech got me past the little lodge whose garden was filled
with two hundred wretched prisoners in exhaustion and despair.</p>

<p>Through the great door of the barrack I called, up the dusty
echoing corridors. No one answered. The huge, deserted,
sun-trapping court was squalid with rubbish. The guard told me that
thousands of prisoners from here had yesterday gone to a camp
beyond the town. Since then no one had come in or out. I walked
over to the far thoroughfare, on whose left was a shuttered lobby,
black after the blazing sunlight of the plastered court.</p>

<p>I stepped in, to meet a sickening stench: and, as my eyes grew
open, a sickening sight. The stone floor was covered with dead
bodies side by side, some in full uniform, some in underclothing,
some stark naked. There might be thirty there, and they crept with
rats, who had gnawed wet red galleries into them. A few were
corpses nearly fresh, perhaps only a day or two old: others must
have been there for long. Of some the flesh, going putrid, was
yellow and blue and black. Many were already swollen twice or
thrice life-width, their fat heads laughing with black mouth across
jaws harsh with stubble. Of others the softer parts were fallen in.
A few had burst open, and were liquescent with decay.</p>

<p>Beyond was the vista of a great room, from which I thought there
came a groan. I trod over to it, across the soft mat of bodies,
whose clothing, yellow with dung, crackled dryly under me. Inside
the ward the air was raw and still, and the dressed battalion of
filled beds so quiet that I thought these too were dead, each man
rigid on his stinking pallet, from which liquid muck had dripped
down to stiffen on the cemented floor.</p>

<p>I picked forward a little between their lines, holding my white
skirts about me, not to dip my bare feet in their puddled running:
when suddenly I heard a sigh and turned abruptly to meet the open
beady eyes of an outstretched man, while '<i>aman, aman</i>' (pity,
pity, pardon) rustled from the twisted lips. There was a brown
waver as several tried to lift their hands, and a thin fluttering
like withered leaves, as they vainly fell back again upon their
beds.</p>

<p>No one of them had strength to speak, but there was something
which made me laugh at their whispering in unison, as if by
command. No doubt occasion had been given them to rehearse their
appeal all the last two days, each time a curious trooper had
peered into their halls and gone away.</p>

<p>I ran through the arch into the garden, across which Australians
were picketed in lines, and asked them for a working-party. They
refused. Tools? They had none. Doctors? Busy. Kirkbride came; the
Turkish doctors, we heard, were upstairs. We broke open a door to
find seven men in night-gowns sitting on unmade beds in a great
room, boiling toffee. We convinced them quickly that it would be
wise to sort out living and dead, and prepare me, in half an hour,
a tally of their numbers. Kirkbride's heavy frame and boots fitted
him to oversee this work: while I saw Ali Baza Pasha, and asked him
to detail us one of the four Arab army doctors.</p>

<p>When he came we pressed the fifty fittest prisoners in tie lodge
as labour party. We bought biscuits and fed them: then armed them
with Turkish tools and set them in the backyard to dig a common
grave. The Australian officers protested it was an unfit place, the
smell arising from which might drive them from their garden. My
jerky reply was that I hoped to God it would.</p>

<p>It was cruelty to work men so tired and ill as our miserable
Turks, but haste gave us no choice. By the kicks and blows of their
victor-serving non-commissioned officers they were at last got
obedient. We began operations on a six-foot hole to one side of the
garden. This hole we tried to deepen, but beneath was a cement
floor; so I said it would do if they enlarged the edges. Near by
was much quicklime, which would cover the bodies effectually.</p>

<p>The doctors told us of fifty-six dead, two hundred dying, seven
hundred not dangerously ill. We formed a stretcher party to carry
down the corpses, of which some were lifted easily, others had to
be scraped up piecemeal with shovels. The bearers were hardly
strong enough to stand at their work: indeed, before the end, we
had added the bodies of two to the heap of dead men in the pit.</p>

<p>The trench was small for them, but so fluid was the mass that
each newcomer, when tipped in, fell softly, just jellying out the
edges of the pile a little with his weight. Before the work
finished it was midnight, and I dismissed myself to bed, exhausted,
since I had not slept three hours since we left Deraa four days
ago. Kirkbride (a boy in years, doing two men's work these days)
stayed to finish the burying, and scatter earth and lime over the
grave.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="0100111h-images/0100111h-23.jpg">
</p>
</center>

<p>At the hotel waited a bunch of urgent matters: some death
sentences, a new justiciary, a famine in barley for the morrow if
the train did not work. Also a complaint from Chauvel that some of
the Arab troops had been slack about saluting <i>Australian</i>
officers!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER CXXII</h3>

<p>By morning, after the sudden fashion of troubles, they were
ended and our ship sailing under a clear sky. The armoured cars
came in, and the pleasure of our men's sedate faces heartened me.
Pisani arrived, and made me laugh, so bewildered was the good
soldier by the political hubbub. He gripped his military duty as a
rudder to steer him through. Damascus was normal, the shops open,
street merchants trading, the electric tramcars restored, grain and
vegetables and fruits coming in well.</p>

<p>The streets were being watered to lay the terrible dust of three
war-years' lorry traffic. The crowds were slow and happy, and
numbers of British troops were wandering in the town, unarmed. The
telegraph was restored with Palestine, and with Beyrout, which the
Arabs had occupied in the night. As long ago as Wejh I had warned
them, when they took Damascus to leave Lebanon for sop to the
French and take Tripoli instead; since as a port it outweighed
Beyrout, and England would have played the honest broker for it on
their behalf in the Peace Settlement. So I was grieved by their
mistake, yet glad they felt grown-up enough to reject me.</p>

<p>Even the hospital was better. I had urged Chauvel to take it
over, but he would not. At the time I thought he meant to
overstrain us, to justify his taking away our government of the
town. However, since, I have come to feel that the trouble between
us was a delusion of the ragged nerves which were jangling me to
distraction these days. Certainly Chauvel won the last round, and
made me feel mean, for when he heard that I was leaving he drove
round with Godwin and thanked me outright for my help in his
difficulties. Still, the hospital was improving of itself. Fifty
prisoners had cleaned the courtyard, burning the lousy rubbish. A
second gang had dug another great grave-pit in the garden, and were
zealously filling it as opportunity offered. Others had gone
through the wards, washing every patient, putting them into cleaner
shirts, and reversing their mattresses to have a tolerably decent
side up. We had found food suitable for all but critical cases, and
each ward had some Turkish-spoken orderly within hearing, if a sick
man called. One room we had cleared, brushed out and disinfected,
meaning to transfer into it the less ill cases, and do their room
in turn.</p>

<p>At this rate three days would have seen things very fit, and I
was proudly contemplating other benefits when a medical major
strode up and asked me shortly if I spoke English. With a brow of
disgust for my skirts and sandals he said, 'You're in charge?
Modestly I smirked that in a way I was, and then he burst out,
'Scandalous, disgraceful, outrageous, ought to be shot...' At this
onslaught I cackled out like a chicken, with the wild laughter of
strain; it did feel extraordinarily funny to be so cursed just as I
had been pluming myself on having bettered the apparently
hopeless.</p>

<p>The major had not entered the charnel house of yesterday, nor
smelt it, nor seen us burying those bodies of ultimate degradation,
whose memory had started me up in bed, sweating and trembling, a
few hours since. He glared at me, muttering 'Bloody brute'. I
hooted out again, and he smacked me over the face and stalked off,
leaving me more ashamed than angry, for in my heart I felt he was
right, and that anyone who pushed through to success a rebellion of
the weak against their masters must come out of it so stained in
estimation that afterward nothing in the world would make him feel
clean. However, it was nearly over.</p>

<p>When I got back to the hotel crowds were besetting it, and at
the door stood a grey Rolls-Royce, which I knew for Allenby's. I
ran in and found him there with Clayton and Cornwallis and other
noble people. In ten words he gave his approval to my having
impertinently imposed Arab Governments, here and at Deraa, upon the
chaos of victory. He confirmed the appointment of Ali Riza Rikabi
as his Military Governor, under the orders of Feisal, his Army
Commander, and regulated the Arab sphere and Chauvel's.</p>

<p>He agreed to take over my hospital and the working of the
railway. In ten minutes all the maddening difficulties had slipped
away. Mistily I realized that the harsh days of my solitary
battling had passed. The lone hand had won against the world's
odds, and I might let my limbs relax in this dreamlike confidence
and decision and kindness which were Allenby.</p>

<p>Then we were told that Feisal's special train had just arrived
from Deraa. A message was hurriedly sent him by Young's mouth, and
we waited till he came, upon a tide of cheering which beat up
against our windows. It was fitting the two chiefs should meet for
the first time in the heart of their victory; with myself still
acting as the interpreter between them.</p>

<p>Allenby gave me a telegram from the Foreign Office, recognizing
to the Arabs the status of belligerents; and told me to translate
it to the Emir: but none of us knew what it meant in English, let
alone in Arabic: and Feisal, smiling through the tears which the
welcome of his people had forced from him, put it aside to thank
the Commander-in-Chief for the trust which had made him and his
movement. They were a strange contrast: Feisal, large-eyed,
colourless and worn, like a fine dagger; Allenby, gigantic and red
and merry, fit representative of the Power which had thrown a
girdle of humour and strong dealing round the world.</p>

<p>When Feisal had gone, I made to Allenby the last (and also I
think the first) request I ever made him for myself&mdash;leave to
go away. For a while he would not have it; but I reasoned,
reminding him of his year-old promise, and pointing out how much
easier the New Law would be if my spur were absent from the people.
In the end he agreed; and then at once I knew how much I was
sorry.</p>

<h2><a name="epilogue" id="epilogue"></a>EPILOGUE</h2>

<blockquote><i>Damascus had not seemed a sheath for my sword, when
I landed in Arabia: but its capture disclosed the exhaustion of my
main springs of action. the strongest motive throughout had been a
personal one, not mentioned here, but present to me, I think, every
hour of these two years. Active pains and joys might fling up, like
towers, among my days: but, refluent as air, this hidden urge
re-formed, to be the persisting element of life, till near the end.
It was dead, before we reached damascus.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Next in force had been a pugnacious wish to win the war: yoked
to the conviction that without Arab help England could not pay the
price of winning its Turkish sector. When Damascus fell, the
eastern war&mdash;probably the whole war&mdash;drew to an
end.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Then I was moved by curiosity. 'super flumina babylonis', read
as a boy, had left me longing to feel myself the node of a national
movement. We took Damascus, and I feared. more than three arbitrary
days would have quickened in me a root of authority.</i><br>
<br>
<i>There remained historical ambition, insubstantial as a motive by
itself. I had dreamed, at the city school in Oxford, of hustling
into form, while I lived, the new Asia which time was inexorably
bringing upon us. Mecca was to lead to Damascus; Damascus to
Anatolia, and afterwards to Bagdad; and then there was Yemen.
Fantasies, these will seem, to such as are able to call my
beginning an ordinary effort.</i>
