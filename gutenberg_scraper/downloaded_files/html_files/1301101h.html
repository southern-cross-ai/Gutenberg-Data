  <h2><a id="intro"
     name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p class="first">APART from numerous novels, most of which are accessible
  on-line at Project Gutenberg Australia and Roy Glashan's Library, Fred M.
  White published some 300 short stories. Many of these were written in the
  form of series about the same character or group of characters. PGA/RGL has
  already published e-book editions of those series currently available in
  digital form.</p>

  <p>The present 17-volume edition of e-books is the first attempt to offer the
  reader a more-or-less comprehensive collection of Fred M. White's other short
  stories. These were harvested from a wide range of Internet resources and
  have already been published individually at Project Gutenberg Australia, in
  many cases with digitally-enhanced illustrations from the original medium of
  publication.</p>

  <p>From the bibliographic information preceding each story, the reader will
  notice that many of them were extracted from newspapers published in
  Australia and New Zealand. Credit for preparing e-texts of these and numerous
  other stories included in this collection goes to Lyn and Maurie Mulcahy, who
  contributed them to PGA in the course of a long and on-going
  collaboration.</p>

  <p>The stories included in the present collection are presented
  chronologically according to the publication date of the medium from which
  they were extracted. Since the stories from Australia and New Zealand
  presumably made their first appearance in British or American periodicals,
  the order in which they are given here does not correspond to the actual
  order of first publication.</p>

  <p>This collection contains some 170 stories, but a lot more of Fred M.
  White's short fiction was still unobtainable at the time of compilation
  (March 2013). Information about the "missing stories" is given in a
  bibliographic note at the end of this volume. Perhaps they can be included in
  supplemental volumes at a later date.</p>

  <p>Good reading!</p>

  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1">1.&mdash;AND THIS IS FAME!</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Sunday Times</i>, Perth, Australia, 18 Oct
  1931</h3><br>

  <p class="first">WHEN Tommy Allnatt, the famous comedian, arrived at the
  studio of the equally famous painter, Alonzo Paradine, there was no sign of
  the lunch to which Tommy had been invited; in fact, there was no sign of
  anybody, not even a servant to answer the bell. Therefore, Tommy was
  pardonably annoyed.</p>

  <p>None the less because the front door gave to a turn of the lock and Tommy
  found himself free to enter the studio proper. Just like Paradine to forget
  all about the lunch and give his domestic staff a holiday for the day.</p>

  <p>Left to himself. London's leading low comedian&mdash;and the greatest
  practical joker since J. L. Toole&mdash;prowled about the studio where the
  immortal Paradine painted his pictures and entertained the salt of the
  earth.</p>

  <p>But Tommy was not concerned with Paradine's greatness at the moment. He
  was torn between wolfish hunger and humorous irritability. None the less so
  because this was not the first time Paradine had played the same trick on his
  friends. Time he had a lesson. Time to teach him that his absentmindedness
  was not a paying game. Perhaps an epoch-making practical joke&mdash;</p>

  <p>The idea shaped as Tommy sat eating caviare and biscuits looted from a
  Tudor buffet and washed down with a whisky and soda imbibed from a priceless
  goblet of Venetian glass. As the inner man swung to equilibrium the grin on
  Tommy's face broadened. The great idea was burgeoning like a flower.</p>

  <p>"It would serve him right," he muttered. "Hang me if I don't do it!"</p>

  <p>From a huge wardrobe in ebony and ivory inlay Tommy produced certain
  sartorial properties such as artists keep for their models. A wig and a beard
  and a pair of spectacles; a suit of rags, complete with rusty boots; and in
  these Tommy proceeded to array himself. An impromptu make-up completed the
  picture of honest poverty under a cloud of financial depression. Hastily
  gathering together half-a-dozen or so of canvasses from a corner of the
  studio, Tommy crept into the street until he reached the spot he had in mind,
  and there on a stretch of pavement in view of Chelsea's best and brightest,
  sat down to do business with all and sundry in search of masterpieces at
  jumble sale prices. Not that he would sell a single one, and thus, cover the
  great Paradine with confusion and ridicule.</p>

  <p>For some time he had the cold, hard world to himself. In a harsh,
  commercial age, art seemed to be a drug on the market. Then presently there
  shuffled into sight a snuffy man whose beady eyes lighted on the array of
  pictures displayed on the pavement. The little man checked and for some
  moments stood contemplating the show with his head on one side, like a thrush
  gloating over a particularly fat snail.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" he piped. "Your own work? What?"</p>

  <p>"And for sale, sir," Tommy said meekly.</p>

  <p>"Very sad, very sad!" the little man declared. "Clever, very clever.
  Distinct touches of originality. The later French school. You have studied in
  Paris?"</p>

  <p>"Never had a lesson in my life," Tommy said, truthfully.</p>

  <p>"Amazing!" the little man cried. "Amazing! you haven't stolen those
  sketches by any chance?"</p>

  <p>Tommy contrived a sad, disarming smile. The little man hopped around
  excitedly.</p>

  <p>"I apologise!" he wheezed. "I am in a humble way a collector. But my means
  are limited, very limited. If you care to take fifteen shillings each for
  those&mdash;What, what?"</p>

  <p>Tommy shuffled uneasily. The great joke was not developing according to
  plan. His scheme had been to sit there the best part of the afternoon
  peddling choice Paradines and being able to boast afterwards that he never
  secured an offer for one. It was imperative that he should hedge.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he said, grandly, "I may be poor, but I have my pride. And the
  laborer is worthy of his hire. A fiver a head all round and call it a
  deal."</p>

  <p>If Tommy was under the impression that this appreciation of stock would
  choke off the snuffy old gentleman he was speedily disillusioned. He merely
  smiled a crafty smile.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he wheezed, "before you took up your stand here did it occur
  to you that a hawker's license was requisite&mdash;indeed, imperative?"</p>

  <p>"Is that a fact, old bean?" Tommy asked, forgetting himself in face of
  this startling riposte. "Mean to say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quite," the little man chuckled. "Show me your license, or the policeman
  on point duty yonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All right," Tommy said recklessly. "Take the bally lot at your own price.
  A quid a piece. Come!"</p>

  <p>The snuffy little man produced a roll of notes and counted out six of them
  into Tommy's shrinking palm. A few moments later the purchaser was rolling
  away in a taxi and Tommy was after him in another. There was a little delay
  in getting away, for the driver of the second cab shied openly at Tommy's
  rags until the sight of a Treasury note calmed his fears.</p>

  <p>"I'm fly, gov'nor," he grinned. "Not the first time as I've 'ad a copper
  in disguise in my keb."</p>

  <p>Exactly seventeen minutes later the first cab pulled up in front of a
  palatial mansion in Park-street, where the little man alighted, and let
  himself in with a latchkey.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm done!" Tommy groaned dismally.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">It was well into the marrow of the afternoon when Tommy,
  divested of his rags, crept into the smoking room of his club and ordered a
  whisky and soda. He was grateful to find the room comparatively deserted,
  save for a group of three discussing art in the big bay window. The big boom
  of Lucius Farmiloe laying down the law came mistily to Tommy's ears. The
  great editor of 'Thought' holding his audience in thrall like the Ancient
  Mariner. It was a way that majestic art critic had.</p>

  <p>"These amateur collectors are all alike," he said. "A man like Grimstein
  thinks he knows everything, because he possesses the money-making instinct.
  Oh, I grant you his collection of modern art is a fine one, but when those
  chaps come to rely on their own judgment&mdash;well, there!"</p>

  <p>"Go on&mdash;we'll buy it," a listener said wearily.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this," Farmiloe went on, "Grimstein 'phoned me about
  three o'clock to give him a call as he had just got hold of a lot of early
  Paradines. Bought 'em from a marine store dealer or something like that. All
  rot, because there are no early Paradines knocking about. I ought to
  know."</p>

  <p>"Course," Gregory of the 'Daily Messenger' agreed. "Paradine was invented
  and patented by you. Did you go?"</p>

  <p>"What do you think? I knew what I was going to find, my boy. Forgeries.
  Still, if Grimstein was anxious to pay my fee as a professional expert, I was
  agreeable. So round to Park-street I went without delay."</p>

  <p>Tommy Allnatt started. The words 'Park-street' struck on his ears like a
  bomb. Beyond a doubt Farmiloe was speaking of the snuffy little man who had
  brought the great joke tumbling in ruins about the comedian's head.</p>

  <p>"Well, go on," Gregory said. "The plot intrigues me."</p>

  <p>"So I went," Farmiloe resumed. "There were six of those things altogether
  and it didn't take me long to tell my man just what my opinion of the rubbish
  was."</p>

  <p>"Then they weren't Paradines at all?"</p>

  <p>"Naw," Farmiloe snarled in deep contempt. "Not altogether bad stuff and
  not devoid of feeling, but palpable forgeries. The old chap was mad with me
  because I refused to be bullied, and we paraded on terms of armed neutrality.
  Just as if Paradine ever painted a picture I couldn't trace, you chaps."</p>

  <p>All of which was pleasant hearing for the unhappy Tommy. He sat there
  apparently absorbed in a paper whilst he was drinking in every word that the
  eminent critic was saying. The great Joke had not only fizzled out, but the
  aftermath promised to make Tommy a figure of fun for many a day to come. And
  suppose that Grimstein chose to appeal to Caesar himself, represented in this
  case by Paradine? If he did, what then? The whole story would trickle into
  the popular press&mdash;just the kind of thing the master of pungent
  paragraphs, one Hannibal Barr, would love to handle in one of his social
  columns.</p>

  <p>And then, as fate would have it. Barr himself appeared just in time to
  gather what Farmiloe was saying.</p>

  <p>"Let's have that all over again," he demanded.</p>

  <p>Tommy smothered a groan. Unless some miracle happened, he could see
  himself the victim of every little street boy in London. But what could he
  do? Go to Paradine and make a clean breast of it and invoke his aid. But then
  he had always regarded Paradine as little better than a child in arms in
  worldly matters, which in point of fact, he was. Or perhaps Farmiloe himself
  would help. But he didn't want to go to that superior person with his
  patronising pomposity if there was any other way out. And he didn't want to
  be laughed at&mdash;it is the one thing your practical Joker all over the
  world most dreads.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the paragraphist was gleaning what promised to be a rich harvest
  of copy from Farmiloe's story. Tommy could almost see the pungent narrative
  in print.</p>

  <p>"Mean to say the stuff was all junk?" Barr asked when at length Farmiloe
  had finished. "Impudent forgeries?"</p>

  <p>"Looks like it," Farmiloe said. "Lots of that sort of thing going on.
  Traps to catch flats like Grimstein."</p>

  <p>"But I thought he was a connoisseur, Farmiloe."</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, they an are. Or think so. But when they start out buying
  on their own without consulting experts like myself they usually come a
  cropper as Grimstein did today. He was infernally cocksure, but I think I
  shook him up a bit. If he gives out to the world that he has bought a lot of
  early Paradines on his own judgment and exhibits them, as he threatened to
  do, he is asking for it, my boy. Fancy trying to bluff me into agreeing that
  that junk is Paradine's work!"</p>

  <p>Hannibal Barr's dry chuckle irritated Tommy to the verge of manslaughter.
  Here was a rich field for the paragraphist and one on which Tommy Allnatt
  would figure as leading character. Nothing else would be discussed in the
  club for months.</p>

  <p>"Funny chap, Paradine," Barr remarked. "Thorpe of 'The Bacon,' was chasing
  him yesterday and ran him to earth in some poisonous eating house in Soho
  where he was entertaining a tramp in filthy rags. Picturesque,
  murderous-looking bloke, Thorpe said. Picked up in the gutter by Paradine who
  was mad to paint him on his native heath, so to speak. 'Pears that the chap
  lives in some sort of wood in Surrey and subsists on roots and mushrooms. So
  nothing would do but that Paradine must rush off at once and sketch the
  unsavory hermit outside his cave. Last thing Thorpe saw was the two setting
  out for the wilds."</p>

  <p>"The deuce!" Farmiloe exclaimed. "I happen to know that Paradine had an
  appointment this very morning with no less a personage than the King of
  Asturia."</p>

  <p>"In other words, a royal command, what?"</p>

  <p>"You've said it. It's like this. About a week ago Paradine was down at
  Hurlingham watching the polo and made a sketch of the King in action. One of
  Paradine's best, I'm told, though I have not seen it as yet. The King
  happened to hear about it and asked to see the drawing. He was so pleased
  that he asked Paradine to finish it in pastel for another royal potentate as
  a birthday present and the great man was going to the studio this morning for
  a final look at the work."</p>

  <p>"And Paradine clean forgot it," Barr grinned. "Make a topping story out of
  that, what?"</p>

  <p>"You'd make a story out of your grandmother's coffin." said Farmiloe
  nastily. "Surely you'd never have the cheek&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Fraid not," Barr sighed. "It doesn't pay to bring royalty into tabloid
  journalism&mdash;editors shy at it. And, anyway, King Pedro is a topping good
  sportsman. But I'd like to have seen him this morning being received by the
  kitchen maid with the information that Paradine was off indefinitely in
  company with a lousy tramp. Bet His Majesty was amused."</p>

  <p>A hollow groan rumbled in Tommy's throat. It had come to him with stunning
  force that a picture he had sold to the snuffy old gentleman was one showing
  a handsome, manly figure in polo kit, A gentle dew bespangled Tommy's
  brow.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">It was a good half-hour later before Tommy contrived to get
  Farmiloe into a quiet corner with a view to enlisting the powerful aid of the
  distinguished critic in saving the stricken field. But would the arbiter of
  art do it?</p>

  <p>On the whole Tommy thought that he would. The greatest practical joker of
  his time was rarely at a loss to escape the dire consequences of a miscarried
  jape, and now that things were at their blackest. Tommy began to see his
  way.</p>

  <p>"Well, of all the infernal cheek!" Farmiloe cried when at length the tale
  was told. "What the deuce&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Just a rag," Tommy went on hastily. "Besides, I was a bit biffed at being
  done out of my lunch. So I decided to give Paradine a lesson. My idea was to
  sit on the pavement trying to sell genuine Paradines at break up prices, if
  you get me. But never expectin' to sell one. See the joke? Set the clubs
  laughin' like blazes for months, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Rotten bad taste," Farmiloe sniffed. "I must decline to interfere. If it
  hadn't been for the King of Asturia, perhaps I might... You are not seriously
  suggesting that I should go to Grimstein and bully those drawings out of
  him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, something like that," Tommy grinned.</p>

  <p>The maker of reputations shook his head vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Forget it," he snapped. "With a name like mine, my dear Allnatt, with the
  great British public depending&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'm not the British public," Tommy smiled, "but a poor devil of a
  comedian in a deuced tight place. And doesn't it strike you, pompous ass,
  that you are as deep in the soup as I am. If not, then let me enlighten
  you."</p>

  <p>"Is this a threat?" Farmiloe demanded.</p>

  <p>"Something like it, old bird. You are a great man in your own line and
  thousands of would-be-intellectuals sit at your feet and eat the literary
  oysters peddled monthly by your Review. From your edict one may judge that
  Paradine has the half nelson on John, and Orpen on the mat for the count.
  And, yet with all your wonderful flair and intuition for genius, you scoffed
  at a set of genuine Paradines when Grimstein showed them to you."</p>

  <p>"What precisely do you mean?" Farmiloe stammered.</p>

  <p>"Well, haven't I proved it? You, who can feel a Paradine in the dark
  actually handled a batch of his work in Grimstein's Park-street house and
  laughed them to scorn. Lord, if I wasn't a kind-hearted bloke, I could bust
  your wonderful critical reputation sky high in 24 hours."</p>

  <p>Farmiloe winced, he saw the red light plainly now.</p>

  <p>"What sort of a critic do you call yourself?" Tommy went on pushing his
  advantage home. "Granted, you made Paradine, but only to spite Inigo Chrome.
  One of the finest bits of logrolling ever put across the public. And with all
  your intimate knowledge of the great man's work, you fail to recognise it
  when it is actually shoved under your nose. What will your disciples say when
  they discover that fact?"</p>

  <p>Tommy was feeling on firm ground now. He was the brilliant general who
  sees defeat turned to victory.</p>

  <p>"But surely," Farmiloe stammered, "you wouldn't&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, wouldn't I," Tommy cried viciously. "I don't propose to be laughed
  out of London if I can help it. If that is to be my fate then you will share
  it, old scout."</p>

  <p>Farmiloe was beginning to see the point of the argument. Tommy lost no
  time in ramming it home.</p>

  <p>"You laughed in old Grimstein's face. You insulted his judgment and
  touched his pocket. Then you came here to boast about it. Before Hannibal
  Barr, mind. London's premier paragraph gossip. If only he realises the real
  truth! My boy, you will never hear the last of it unless you manage to bluff
  Grimstein and get hold of those pictures before Paradine gets back to his
  studio. Make Grimstein realise that he has been had by some practical joker
  who laid a plant to catch him. Say that you have been making exhaustive
  inquiries, and, by a lucky chance, hit on the authors of the jape. Say you
  forced the truth out of the rascals and managed to get the money paid for the
  sketches back. If you fail to do that, then we are both up to our necks in
  it. And here's the notes Grimstein gave me this morning."</p>

  <p>"You think it would work?" the unhappy Farmiloe gulped.</p>

  <p>"Of course," Tommy said. "You have been a bluffer all your life, and it
  will come easy. Pose as the saviour of Grimstein's reputation as a judge of
  paintings. Condole with him, kiss him if you like. But, for heaven's sake,
  get those pictures back. And get them back now."</p>

  <p>Farmiloe was moved at last.</p>

  <p>"You little blighter," he snarled, speaking, for once, like an ordinary
  human being. "You little blighter, this stunt of yours has landed me in a
  nice mess. Not that I am entirely blameless in the matter."</p>

  <p>"Blameless!" Tommy laughed. "Hoist with your own petard, as Bill
  Shakespeare says. Now get on with it."</p>

  <p>"At once," Farmiloe said, quite meekly. "Stay here till I get back. Hi,
  waiter, call me up a taxi."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">An hour later Farmiloe was back in the club with a bulky
  parcel under his arm, and, without a word, dragged Tommy into his waiting
  taxi and thence to Paradine's studio. And that was how a great scandal was
  averted, and Tommy Allnatt's face saved.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2">2.&mdash;THE FOIL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A BITTER twist of Gunfort's lips and an almost murderous
  expression on his thin, saturnine features marked the intensity of his dark
  mood as he read the letter which he held in his hand. Otherwise, he was a
  handsome man carrying his profession in every line of him, and that
  profession the stage. A fine figure, slender, but athletic, and that of one
  who has cared for himself well and looking nothing like his close on fifty
  years.</p>

  <p>The letter he was reading was short and to the point.</p>

  <p class="quote">"<i>Dear Gunfort</i> (it ran), <i>Barton tells me that you
  are at a loose end for a month or so and has given me your address. We are at
  Barchester for a fortnight's run in Shakespeare, and Melville is laid up in
  hospital here pending an operation. Can you see your way to take his place?
  Our leading line is 'Romeo and Juliet.' Will you come and play 'Tybalt' for
  me&mdash;Forrest as 'Mercutio.' Wire me on receipt.&mdash;Yours,</i></p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Barry Openshaw.</i>"</p>

  <p>Again the twisted bitterness on Gunfort's lips and the sinister smile on
  his face. Then a long sigh as if some conflict had come to a successful end.
  Gunfort rose, and crossing the room took from a locked desk another letter
  the writing on which seemed to have faded with the passage of years.</p>

  <p class="quote">"<i>My dearest George</i> (Gunfort read). <i>By the time you
  get this I shall be beyond all pain and suffering. I am writing this in St.
  Agatha's Hospital in Melbourne, where I am well cared for and
  happy&mdash;that is so far as one in my condition can be happy. It has been a
  hard struggle since the man who promised before God to love and cherish me
  left me penniless and starving all these miles from home. Nobody will ever
  know how I have suffered and I struggled to starvation point until a good
  Samaritan sent me here to die. Perhaps I was wrong to keep all this from you,
  but a sort of pride sustained me. But so it was, and to this day the man who
  so wronged his wife is still in ignorance of the fact that I have a brother
  who is also on the stage and playing under the name of 'Gunfort.' My one
  prayer is that you will never meet.</i>"</p>

  <p>There was much more in the letter, but Gunfort read no further&mdash;he
  knew every word of it by heart. He locked the sheet up again and went out to
  send a wire confirming to Barchester. The grim twisted smile was still on his
  lips.</p>

  <p>Barchester prided itself on being more or less of a cultivated centre and
  especially on its appreciation of the finer points of the drama. They had a
  saying that what Barchester thought to-day on matters theatrical England
  thought to-morrow. Therefore, a longish visit from the Barry Openshaw
  Repertory Company in Shakespeare was an event in the social calendar.</p>

  <p>As an old hand in legitimate drama, Gunfort was pretty well known to the
  rest of the company. Not that he appeared on the stage too often because he
  was a man with private means and thus in a position to choose his own parts.
  Despite his talents and that picturesque appearance, he was not popular,
  being prone to nurse grievances and quick in quarrel.</p>

  <p>All the same, he seemed almost to go out of his way to show attention to
  George Forrest, who played what the profession calls 'opposite' to him, more
  especially in the favorite 'Romeo and Juliet,' where Forrest's 'Mercutio' was
  greatly admired.</p>

  <p>"Rather strange that we have never played together before," Forrest
  remarked during one rehearsal of the great love tragedy.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," Gunfort replied. "You see I have never been out of the
  country in the course of my work, whereas you seem to have played all over
  the world."</p>

  <p>"That's true," Forrest admitted. "Europe and Africa, also America and
  Australia. Fine country, that."</p>

  <p>"So I believe," Gunfort said. "I seem to have some sort of hazy
  recollection that you married out there. An actress who went out with some
  English company and stayed there."</p>

  <p>Forrest shrugged his shoulders, indifferently.</p>

  <p>"True enough," he declared. "Pretty little girl but could not act for
  nuts. Finally went off on her own, and from that day to this I have never set
  eyes on her."</p>

  <p>"Then you don't know whether she is alive or dead?"</p>

  <p>"Quite so, Gunfort. But that's years ago, dear boy. Only hope she doesn't
  bob up serenely one of these days."</p>

  <p>Gunfort's thoughts reverted to a certain yellow and faded letter which
  reposed in a locked drawer at his lodgings. But the friendly smile on his
  face did not relax as he turned the subject aside and began to talk of other
  things.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">It was towards the end of the tour and Barchester was
  looking forward to the second performance of 'Romeo and Juliet' which was to
  take place on the Saturday night. The house was packed from floor to roof
  when the curtain went up and the play began. A famous young actress had been
  imported for the occasion and Barchester had risen in its might to welcome
  her. And so for a time the play proceeded in almost breathless silence whilst
  those on-stage waited for their calls. In the wings, Forrest, looking
  wonderfully fine in the dashing attire of 'Mercutio,' was passing the time
  with Gunfort as 'Tybalt' previous to the duel scene and exchanging what
  appeared to be amusing confidences with him.</p>

  <p>"This ought to go big to-night," Forrest was saying in the hearing of a
  group of scene-shifters. "I never saw an audience more keyed up. A little
  more fire, I think, Gunfort, old man. A few more minutes of 'business,'
  what."</p>

  <p>Gunfort was playing with his rapier and apparently looking to the button
  on the point. It was as if he was making sure that everything was on the safe
  side.</p>

  <p>"Righto," he said, casually. "I never much liked these real business
  rapiers. There'll be a nasty accident with them one of these days, and so I
  told Openshaw this afternoon. But he wouldn't hear a word of it. When the old
  man gets worried over one of the big shows, it's better to give him a wide
  berth."</p>

  <p>"Worrying about me or yourself?" Forrest smiled.</p>

  <p>"Both," Gunfort smiled. "But not really. Goodness knows what put the
  matter in my head."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later the two were on the stage together with 'Romeo' and
  the rest of the followers and the scene began. In the theatre the proverbial
  pin might have been heard to drop as 'Tybalt' flashed out his rapier and the
  duel began. It was acting&mdash;acting of the highest type. A fight to the
  death with a breathless audience hanging on every thrust and parry. Then a
  small object seemed to rise from the stage and go flying into the wings. And
  the fight went on.</p>

  <p>A slight stumble by 'Tybalt' and a quick recovery; and then a vicious
  thrust under 'Mercutio's' guard and the rapiers were knocked up as directed
  just as the blade was withdrawn and 'Mercutio' fell to the ground.</p>

  <p>But not to utter what was in effect his dying speech, for he lay there
  whilst 'Tybalt' gazed in a sort of dazed horror at the point of his rapier.
  Almost in a flash the wild roar of applause was hushed as the house sensed
  that something was wrong. For 'Mercutio' lay there as if dead to the world. A
  thin stream began to trickle across the stage.</p>

  <p>"My God, he's killed!" A voice broke the silence.</p>

  <p>Shrieks and groans broke out all over the house. Then someone more
  long-sighted than usual noted the sinister fact that the button on 'Tybalt's'
  foil was missing and proclaimed the discovery in a voice harsh with emotion.
  Openshaw came dashing on to the stage and gave a signal that brought the
  curtain down with a rush. A babble of voices behind it and more wild bursts
  amongst the audience. After a pause that seemed to last for ages there was a
  whisper for a doctor, and immediately three men rose in the stalls and were
  dragged over the footlights.</p>

  <p>Behind the curtain a small group of actors and stage hands gathered about
  the still form of the man lying there as silent as the grave. There had been
  no motion since he fell.</p>

  <p>The first medical man bent over the body as if to listen for any sign of
  life. He shook his head gravely.</p>

  <p>"Dead, poor fellow," he whispered. "Pierced to the heart, if I am not
  mistaken. What do you say, Clift?"</p>

  <p>He turned to his colleague, and the other stooped only to give the same
  verdict. Then the gaudy trappings were torn away and the bare chest
  exposed.</p>

  <p>"Beyond a doubt," came the decision. "The heart has been pricked&mdash;not
  deeply, but enough. Just as the real 'Mercutio' would have said a few seconds
  later. How did it happen?"</p>

  <p>For the first time all eyes were turned to Gunfort. He stood there like
  one in a nightmare dream, a look of frozen horror on his face. His eyes
  fascinated seemed to be glued on the red point of his rapier. Three times
  Openshaw spoke to him ere any reply came. And then almost a whisper.</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," he gasped. "I seemed to slip. Fell forward. Then the
  button must have been broken off."</p>

  <p>"It was," a stage hand interrupted. "I seen it myself. There it is. Flew,
  it did, like a bird. Yonder."</p>

  <p>Gunfort seemed to be fighting for breath.</p>

  <p>"I tried to make it safe," he muttered. "I thought it was safe. That was
  just before my entrance."</p>

  <p>"That's right," the same stage hand went on. "I see Mr. Gunfort adoing of
  it. Making safe, thinks I."</p>

  <p>"Lamentable, most lamentable," the manager, Openshaw, almost wailed. "But
  clearly an accident. A fortunate thing that the poor chap had nobody
  depending on him."</p>

  <p>"Or on me," Gunfort said. "Not that I matter much at the moment. When you
  are friendly with a man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His voice broke and he turned away like a man who is suddenly stricken
  with an overwhelming grief. It was Openshaw who first of all seemed to
  realise that there were things to be done.</p>

  <p>"There will be an inquest, of course," he said. "Now I must go and dismiss
  the audience."</p>

  <p>The theatre was cleared at length though what the real tragedy was would
  be learnt later. A most unfortunate accident, Openshaw explained. But one
  that prevented the performance from proceeding. And so on and so on.</p>

  <p>There was nothing more to be done but to convey the body to the mortuary
  and notify the police. And then the stricken body of players wended their way
  home.</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">Naturally enough, the tragedy created a wide sensation in
  the town, and when the district coroner opened the inquest proceedings in the
  Town Hall the rush to find seats was sufficient to fill the building. No
  relation of the dead man came forward to identify him, as it was generally
  believed that he was colonial born and had no status in England. Indeed,
  Openshaw had a sort of impression that Forrest was merely a stage name. As
  everybody knew, there was nothing uncommon about this, and, for the purpose
  of the inquest it mattered little.</p>

  <p>The first witness called was the stage hand who had noticed the flying of
  the button off the rapier which Gunfort had used.</p>

  <p>"No, sir; I didn't think much of it at the time," he said, in answer to
  the question. "They both seemed to be clever with the weapons, and the fight
  was merely a stage one."</p>

  <p>"I find in my notes that there was some suggestion of a slip on the part
  of Mr. Gunfort," the coroner said. "Did you happen to notice anything of the
  sort?"</p>

  <p>"I did that, sir," the witness replied. "And it's my opinion that but for
  a stumble the accident would never have happened. It were a most realistic
  fight, and I were watching it closely, never having seen anything to touch it
  before. Just thrilling, it were. Then Mr. Gunfort he seemed to slip, and it
  looked as if he would have fallen. But he recovered himself, and, as he did
  so, lurched forward, and the point of his blade caught Mr. Forrest full in
  chest."</p>

  <p>"That was shortly after the button flew off?"</p>

  <p>"That's right, sir. Then Mr. Forrest, he falls forward and drops on the
  stage all of a heap like. That's all I know."</p>

  <p>"Is there anybody connected with the theatre who can give me any
  information as to whether it was possible some person or persons to handle
  those two foils? They appear to me to be formidable weapons with the buttons
  off."</p>

  <p>One, Speechly, the baggage man, entered the witness box.</p>

  <p>"It was part of my business, sir, to see to all that sort of thing," he
  testifled. "I always made it a point to see that such things were kept under
  lock and key. I have seen more than one nasty accident happen in my trade
  when actors begin to lark about with such things."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," the coroner assented. "And in the present case you followed
  your usual custom, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"That I did, sir," the witness went on. "The rapiers were in my possession
  until the dresser of the two gentlemen came to me for them."</p>

  <p>"But during rehearsals, perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Walking sticks, or light canes, sir. No occasion for anything more
  dangerous than that."</p>

  <p>Gunfort came into the witness stand presently, and a deep hush held the
  listeners spellbound. His face was white and drawn, and he had about him the
  air of one who felt his position keenly. Just a pallid picture of remorse and
  suffering. He spoke clearly and quietly though his voice shook as he
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"I am greatly to blame," he began, "though I did my best to guard against
  any accident. I was particularly careful at the last moment to see that the
  button on the point of the foil was secure. Moreover, I am more or less an
  expert with the rapier. In addition, some days ago I suggested to my manager
  that dummy weapons might be used."</p>

  <p>"Quite true," Openshaw interrupted. "You see, sir, I am a confirmed
  realist with regard to stage effects, and I much preferred the use of real
  weapons."</p>

  <p>"If I had not stumbled," Gunfort continued, "I feel quite sure that the
  tragedy would never have happened. You see, I could not recover my poise in
  time, and, had I fallen, the whole thrilling illusion of the duel would have
  been lost. I lurched forward to regain my balance, at the same time making a
  thrust and, as the button on my foil was off, my weapon struck the deceased
  heavily on the left breast. If I could do anything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The witness stopped and buried his face in his hands. A wave of emotion
  swept the room. Above it came the voice of the coroner addressing the
  jury.</p>

  <p>"A most distressing accident, gentlemen," he concluded, "and one that
  could not be avoided. It seems to me that some at least of our sympathy may
  go out to the last witness in his distress. I suggest a verdict of 'Death by
  misadventure.'"</p>

  <p>"And that," said the foreman of the jury a few minutes later in a formal
  voice, "is the verdict of us all."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">Gunfort slowly and dejectedly made his way from the court to
  his lodgings. He was quite alone. Once under cover he took out the faded
  letter and burnt it to the last cinder. The thin, bitter smile was on his
  lips once more.</p>

  <p>"Death by misadventure," he murmured. "Yes, the misadventure of meeting
  me. Little sister, you are avenged at last. That is a story that will die
  with me."</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3">3.&mdash;THE PLATINUM CHAIN</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Sunday Times</i>, Perth, Australia, 6 Aug
  1933</h3><br>

  <p class="first">MALCOLM ANDERSON had worked out the whole thing
  deliberately. Just as he worked out those weird short stories of his in the
  seclusion of his cottage in the fens where he lived with his aged mother who
  had never quite understood the peculiar bent of her son's genius. For genius
  it undoubtedly was.</p>

  <p>A man of moods, without friends, and living inside himself to the
  exclusion of the outside world, though compelled by force of circumstances to
  work for his living in urban surroundings. That is, before a distant relative
  had left him enough in the way of an income to enable him to retire from the
  strenuous life and free to live where he chose. And that had been a lonely
  house in the fens some three miles from Luckmere. And there he would have
  been content to pass the rest of his life had it not been for the fact that
  George Leverson was blackmailing him.</p>

  <p>Leverson had been his only friend&mdash;if the word 'friend' is
  applicable&mdash;in London. The one person in the world who knew of his
  solitary slip from the straight path.</p>

  <p>And now Leverson was holding him to ransom. Very carefully and cunningly
  in the shape of borrowed money without a single hint at a threat, nothing
  that could be used in evidence in a court of justice. But blackmail all the
  same, and getting more weighty with every letter asking for a loan until
  Anderson was beginning to feel the weight of financial pressure.</p>

  <p>Physically Anderson was a fine figure of a man, one who lived a hard,
  frugal life by choice and one who took a deal of outdoor exercise. Whereas
  Leverson was a typical town product with a natural bent towards
  dissipation.</p>

  <p>Leverson must be got rid of, and that speedily if Anderson was not to be
  bled to death slowly&mdash;in plain English, murdered. Nor was the project
  particularly hazardous. Anderson lived with his mother in that lonely house
  on the fens with no outside help save an elderly woman who came in daily for
  a few hours. What more easy, then than to write a note to Leverson asking
  down for a night, having previously arranged that his mother should not be
  present, since she had relations in the next county, friends whom she
  frequently visited.</p>

  <p>So the stage was set in conditions that were quite normal and the friendly
  note to Leverson was written. Would he come down by a late train one evening
  and walk the three miles from the station to the house in the fens? It was
  quite a friendly note for, so far, there was no sign that Anderson in any way
  resented the constant appeals to his purse.</p>

  <p>And so Leverson, being in sore need of cash, as usual, came in reply to
  the invitation. But he never reached the lonely house in the fens for the
  simple reason that Anderson stole out of his abode under cover of the
  darkness and met his victim half-way and murdered him.</p>

  <p>A smashing blow with a cudgel, and then the unconscious body was dragged
  from the deserted highway and plunged into a deep boghole, selected
  beforehand for the purpose, and the crime was hidden for ever. But not before
  Leverson had put up some sort of a fight and had grappled with his assassin.
  Half an hour later Anderson was back in his house, satisfied that his coming
  and going had been entirely unobserved, and that the menace which had been so
  long hanging over him was removed.</p>

  <p>But there was one thing the troubled him greatly. In the brief struggle he
  had lost a dozen links or more in a platinum chain to which his old verge
  watch was attached. There was one end holding on to the watch and the other
  secured to a silver sovereign purse, but the middle of the chain was
  gone.</p>

  <p>What had become of it? Was it lying on the road for some curious person to
  pick up or was it still in Leverson's grasp at the bottom of the boghole? A
  clue, perhaps a vital clue pointing directly to the scaffold. And, if it fell
  into the hands of the police...</p>

  <p>Of course inquiries would be made by Leverson's relations, though he had
  no wife to raise the alarm. Even if the letter asking him down to the house
  in the fens was still intact, it would be an easy matter to say that Leverson
  had not turned up although he, Anderson, had expected him. Nor was there a
  single soul in the world who had the remotest idea that the two men were
  anything but the best of friends.</p>

  <p>But the missing links in the watch chain worried Anderson terribly. A
  number of people knew about it; his mother to begin with, and the other
  clerks in the office where he had worked in London before that small fortune
  came his way. There was Carter, the cashier, for instance, who had under
  estimated its value, only to be told that it was platinum, and therefore
  worth far more than a gold chain would have been&mdash;and others.</p>

  <p>Anderson sat brooding over his loss long after he got home, sitting before
  the dead fire in the grate, thankful that he was alone in the house. Company
  then would have been unbearable. It would be futile to set out in search of
  those missing links, and, perhaps, a danger if he did so. He cursed his
  perfervid imagination and dragged himself unwillingly to bed.</p>

  <p>But not to sleep. He tossed wearily from side to side until the dawn broke
  and the haunting ghosts fled before the sunshine. He knew that his moody
  taciturnity spelt nothing to the village woman who came presently to see to
  his creature comforts, for she had seen him in no other temperament. And so
  the day passed and the next with a thankfulness of sorts that his mother was
  still away. She would have sensed the subtle change.</p>

  <p>He craved for company and yet dreaded the chance. And so three dreadful
  days followed with no human voice other than those that came over his
  wireless. It was only the voice he wanted for aught else jangled on his
  nerves in discord. And then, on the third night, a sort of call from the
  grave.</p>

  <p>"We are asked by the police to broadcast the following: 'Missing from his
  home since Wednesday last. George Leverson, of 16 Martindale - terrace, Amber
  - street, Bloombsbury...'"</p>

  <p>Anderson switched off, hurriedly. So the hunt was afoot. Listen further,
  he had not dared. Yet from the start he had felt that police investigation
  must follow the crime. Once more that vivid imagination began to work though
  he strove to stifle it. What if suspicion fell on him? What if Leverson's
  body were found with that letter of invitation on him?</p>

  <p>And what if the police kept silence on the point whilst they made
  inquiries elsewhere? Clever men, those detectives, and quick in
  deduction.</p>

  <p>It would not take them long to find out that Leverson's moral character
  would not stand investigation. Suppose they obtained an order from the
  Secretary of State to examine Leverson's bank transactions? If that were
  done, then there would be found a score of instances when Leverson paid in
  drafts with Anderson's name as drawer upon them.</p>

  <p>What a fool he had been not to have thought of that before. Those
  transactions would fairly reek with blackmail. How was he going to explain
  all that away? He might have to do that even if the body of the murdered man
  was not found. Leverson was a bit of a boaster in his cups, which were many
  and he might have told a score of people that he was going to see
  Anderson.</p>

  <p>And so the self-torturing went on. He could see himself in the dock, and
  then in the witness-box facing a deadly cross-examination at the hands of
  Crown counsel. Perhaps the fiercest ordeal sinful man is ever called on to
  face.</p>

  <p>He saw more than that&mdash;he saw himself standing on a scaffold with the
  prison chaplain intoning the burial service and his spineless self swinging
  grotesquely at the end of a rope. Once they hanged murderers in
  chains&mdash;perhaps it might be a fragment of chain that would hang him.</p>

  <p>It was not until the fifth night that Anderson slept. And then only to
  dream the tragedy all over again. He was back once more on the lonely high
  road leading from Luckmere to the house in the fens seeking the lost portion
  of the platinum chain. He was hunting to the verge of the bog pool in which
  he had placed the body. It was fairly dry underfoot now though on the night
  of the crime there had been some heavy rain. And it seemed to Anderson,
  looking down, that the dead man's face was turned up to him with accusation
  in the sightless eyes.</p>

  <p>Then next day it rained fairly hard so that Anderson, wandering far and
  wide for distraction and physical exhaustion, so that he might sleep again,
  arrived home at length with boots and clothing more or less saturated though
  he was too distrait to notice it. And once more that awful dream again. There
  seemed no way of getting rid of it.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile nothing further so far as regarded the missing man. No doubt the
  police were active enough in their search, but not in the direction of
  Luckmere. Perhaps, after all, Leverson had destroyed the letter&mdash;there
  was no particular object in keeping it. If it had been found surely some sort
  of inquiry would have reached Luckmere by this time.</p>

  <p>Then, once again that dreadful dream, this time more poignant than ever,
  and much more vivid. An overwhelming desire to revert once more to the scene
  of the tragedy, as if he had risen in the dead of night and tramped the
  deserted road as far as the boghole. Horribly conscious he was of his body,
  too, and of a certain weariness impossible to shake off.</p>

  <p>Here he was by the edge of the pool at last looking down at the clear
  imprint of his boots, a double track leading to the pool and back again. No
  mistaking the impression of those rubber soles with the maker's pattern so
  clearly marked on them. And, so far no sign of disturbance in the water. And
  then a change. Voices in the distance followed by the tramp of feet and then
  four men unmistakably officers of the law despite the fact that they were in
  mufti. One of them carried a coil of rope with a stout triangular hook at the
  end of it.</p>

  <p>These strangers advanced to the edge of the pool and paused whilst one of
  them pointed down to those damning footprints.</p>

  <p>"Been here twice," he said. "Perhaps oftener before the rain came. Before
  the rain came."</p>

  <p>"Stupid thing to do," the man with the drag muttered. "Almost like signing
  a confession, sir."</p>

  <p>The man who had spoken first, nodded. He was evidently in authority over
  the other three, an inspector perhaps.</p>

  <p>"Something like that, Symonds," he said. "But many murderers are taken
  that way. It's the mad streak that infests their blood. And they do say that
  this man Anderson is given to self-torture. Writes stories of the most
  gruesome kind. I have read one or two of them in magazines. Sort of Edgar Poe
  stuff. It was quite a brain-wave that sent you searching for Leverson here,
  Cox."</p>

  <p>"Seemed natural, sir," the man addressed as Cox replied. "Especially after
  you had examined those two banking accounts. Blackmail, I said to myself, and
  blackmail it was. Then there was the letter found at Leverson's lodgings. And
  the discovery that Anderson was alone in his house on the night he had
  invited Leverson down here. Thinks I, Leverson was met on his way from
  Luckmere station by Anderson and murdered. If I was right, then he was killed
  somewhere here and the body hidden. And no better place with all these deep
  bogholes about. But I did not expect to discover the marks of Anderson's
  rubber-soled boots crying out to be investigated. We'll have the body in half
  an hour, sir, with any luck."</p>

  <p>All this was passing in Anderson's dream. It seemed to him that he was
  crouched behind a fringe of tall grass and rushes listening to every word
  that was passing. Through the green screen he saw all that was going on. And
  in the same dream he knew that his worst fears were realised. It would be
  only a few hours before the prison gates would close on him. But as to those
  telltale footprints. How on earth had they got there? But for them, that
  peat-pool might never have been searched. They were definite enough to point
  a damning finger at the author of the crime. And they were his footprints
  made by the rubber-soled shoes he always wore. By what black magic had they
  got there?</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, in his land of dreams, Anderson watched the dread work going
  on. He saw the drag lowered into the pool and presently a tightening of the
  rope.</p>

  <p>"Got something here, sir," one of the men said. "Gently does it. Easy, a
  bit to the right. That's better."</p>

  <p>Something rose to the surface&mdash;a mass of matter much as if a carcase
  in a bag had been raised to the light of those flashlights. Something half
  hidden in a mass of waterweed. And out of it projecting something in the
  shape of an arm. An arm with a hand attached to it. And a hand, moreover,
  that had an object firmly in its grip.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;what's this?" the leader of the group demanded.</p>

  <p>"Looks like a bit of watch-chain, sir," the man called Symonds replied,
  "Gunmetal I should say."</p>

  <p>The man in command took the links from his officer and wiped them dry.
  Then held them close to one of the flash-lamps.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort!" he said. "These broken links are platinum. I have a
  similar chain myself."</p>

  <p>"So has Anderson," Symonds cried. "Don't you remember, sir, that we got
  that information from the office where he once worked? The other clerks used
  to chaff him about it."</p>

  <p>The chief smiled on his subordinate before proceeding to examine the
  sinister bundle which had been brought to the surface by means of the drag.
  The clinging weeds were carefully swept away, and a white sodden face
  revealed. All part of the dream that held Anderson in a grip like a vice.</p>

  <p>Subconsciously he was struggling with all his strength to shake it off. He
  wanted to wake up and know that this horror was bred of conscience and the
  haunting knowledge of his crime. It seemed to him that he slowly rose from
  his hiding-place and advanced in the direction of the officers. Then they saw
  him and gazed at him in amazement. He stepped to the side of the corpse and
  looked down at the dead face.</p>

  <p>A great cry broke from him&mdash;a cry that rang out into the stillness of
  the night like that of some tortured animal, loud as a trumpet call. The
  binding spell was broken and the reality of life came back to Anderson
  sweating at every pore.</p>

  <p>"Anderson himself," Symonds cried. "Our man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;Anderson beyond the shadow of doubt," the officer in charge
  assented, "and walking in his sleep!"</p><br>

     name="story4">4.&mdash;THE BARRISTER AT BAY</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Central Queensland Herald</i>, Rockhampton,
  Australia, 23 May 1935</h3><br>

  <p class="first">MRS. WESTBROOKE, with a few well-chosen words of apology,
  dropped into her chair at the dining-room table and unfolded her napkin. It
  was the usual Wednesday night dinner-party for which Sir John and Lady
  Cardwell were noted, and the usual brilliant knot of men and women had
  gathered there. Mrs. Westbrooke had been late, but she certainly did not
  convey the impression that she had, within the last hour, returned to London
  from the Continent, after a long and trying journey. She was serene and calm
  as usual, perfectly dressed, and beautiful in her stately way. She did not
  look anything like her thirty-five years, and those who knew her wondered
  what her secret was. Hers had been a stormy life, and it was only recently
  that she had found her way into a harbour of peace and serenity. Now she was
  rich, and had all the world before her.</p>

  <p>She glanced casually round the table, with its flowers and ferns and
  shaded lights, the last person in the world whom anyone might associate with
  care or strife or tragedy. Despite her serenity, she was here looking for
  someone, and presently she found him.</p>

  <p>He was on the other side of the table, discussing some passing topic with
  his dinner partner. Edgar Remington was a man who would have attracted
  attention anywhere, not so much from his good looks or striking personality
  as by his peculiar and forceful magnetism. As a matter of fact, he was plain
  in feature, coarse cut, and rugged&mdash;the bulldog type; deep of voice and
  tenacious of purpose. The men at the Bar, who ought to know, prophesied that
  Remington would go a long way. He was quite a modern product&mdash;extension
  schools' scholarship, university and Bar prizeman, son of a Noncomformist
  minister, with a strong leaning towards politics. His chance had come now,
  and he was going to make the best of it. He knew perfectly well that if he
  succeeded in getting a verdict of acquittal for Julius Maxwell on the morrow
  the rest of the way along the path would be easy. Everybody was talking about
  the case; it was one of those criminal romances that gripped the popular
  imagination in the club and cottage alike. It was even being discussed
  fitfully round Lady Cardwell's dinner-table.</p>

  <p>At first everything had pointed to a verdict of guilty. Nobody doubted
  that Maxwell had deliberately murdered the man who had been his greatest
  benefactor, and whose money he had expected to inherit. The prisoner had been
  a bad lot from the first. He had been expelled from school, he had left
  Oxford under a heavy cloud, and a few years later he had been forced to
  resign the membership of his clubs. There was more than one of Lady
  Cardwell's guests who had know Mrs. Maxwell, the pretty, pathetic little
  woman whose heart had been broken by her rascally husband's cruelty. She was
  supposed to have died abroad somewhere, leaving a daughter behind her, but on
  this latter point nobody seemed to be quite sure. Certainly no
  self-respecting girl would be likely to come forward and own Julius Maxwell
  as her father. One quidnunc declared that Maxwell's daughter had come into
  money and changed her name. At any rate, the only person in the world that
  Julius Maxwell could turn to at the finish was his Uncle John&mdash;the man
  who had been found murdered in the library three months before, in
  circumstances that pointed to the guilt of his scapegrace nephew.</p>

  <p>The dead man had been found in his house in Portman Square when the
  servants had come down one morning early in October. The old man had been
  murdered, without a doubt, but no clue had been left behind, and nothing
  apparently was missing until it was discovered, a few days later, that the
  murdered man had withdrawn from his bank five hundred pounds in notes on the
  eve of the crime, and of these there was no trace whatever. For three months
  the police had searched for them in vain, but up to now not one of them had
  been put in circulation.</p>

  <p>Still, gradually and surely, the authorities worked up a strong case
  against the accused. For three days now the counsel for the Crown had been
  unfolding his story, and when he finally sat down there was not a single
  person in the court who would have given sixpence for the life of the
  prisoner.</p>

  <p>Then had come Remington's chance. For two days he fought for the life of
  his client as if it had been his own. He was the most-talked of man in
  England now, and he knew it. He stood there quiet and calm, with the air of
  one who felt himself to be a victor, and unfolded a marvellous and ingenious
  defence. Apparently he was going to rely entirely upon an alibi&mdash;a
  dangerous thing in any but the most skilful hands. And yet, so well had he
  worked it that, when the court rose at five o'clock that afternoon, the
  betting on the verdict was even.</p>

  <p>It was not that a single listener to that battle of wits entertained the
  slightest doubt as to the guilt of the prisoner. Everybody knew that he was
  guilty. He carried it in his face and his furtive eye and nervous twitching
  of his hands. And yet Remington had established the doubt, and as he sat
  there placidly eating his dinner he knew that, with the coming out of the
  evening papers, tomorrow he would be famous.</p>

  <p>The dinner dragged its slow length along, the coffee and liqueur stage
  reached at length, and the cigarettes were handed round.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Westbrooke changed her chair, and, with a skilful move, found herself
  seated next to Remington. The two were acquainted of course, but they were
  not in the feast intimate.</p>

  <p>Remington welcomed Mrs. Westbrooke with a proper shade of deference, for
  he was not insensible to her popularity and influence; but he would willingly
  have changed the conversation.</p>

  <p>"Really," he said, "I think we've discussed my client long enough.
  Besides, it is hardly the sort of topic for a dinner where ladies are
  present. What do you say, Mrs. Westbrooke?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I am interested enough," Mary Westbrooke said. "But I am not so
  much interested in your client as yourself."</p>

  <p>"That is very nice and flattering."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so. Now, I don't understand the aspect of the legal mind in
  the least. I am going to be frightfully rude, Mr Remington. I am going to
  exercise the privilege of my sex and ask an impertinent question. Do you
  honestly believe that your client is innocent?"</p>

  <p>Remington shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Has that anything to do with the case?" he asked. "I am merely an
  instrument&mdash;what the criminal classes call a 'mouthpiece.' A certain
  solicitor comes to me with a brief to defend Maxwell, and I undertake the
  defence."</p>

  <p>"Do you think that Maxwell is innocent?"</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," Remington said patiently, "it is not for me to say. I want
  you to understand that the man is my client. He has assured me and his
  solicitor that he is the victim of circumstances, and, after discussing all
  the points, we decided to set up a certain line of defence."</p>

  <p>"And a very brilliant line of defence, too," Mrs Westbrooke smiled. "That
  is what everybody says. I understand that the prisoner is likely to be
  acquitted tomorrow. But you have not yet answered my question. Do you think
  Maxwell is guilty?"</p>

  <p>Remington protested politely. Really, this sort of thing was not fair. He
  was doing no more than his duty; he was acting entirely according to
  precedent laid down in the long and glorious traditions of the English Bar.
  He could not discuss his client's guilt or innocence with anyone. Could not
  Mrs. Westbrooke see that it was not a personal matter?</p>

  <p>"It would be awkward for you," she said, "if by some chance the missing
  bank-notes suddenly appeared. If one of them could be traced to your client,
  what would you have to say then?"</p>

  <p>Remington shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"There would be an end to the case as far as I am concerned," he said. "Of
  course, you mean if the fact were brought to my personal knowledge. Then I
  should be robbed of my triumph, and you would say it served me right. I am
  trying to see your point of view, Mrs. Westbrooke. According to you, none of
  us are sportsmen. If you had your way, no noted criminal would ever be
  represented in the courts. Once a man was taken to be guilty, then every
  barrister would turn his back upon him. Now, that is not my view at all. If I
  were briefed to defend a murderer, I would do my best for him, even if his
  victim were my own brother. It is entirely a matter of the point of view. In
  your eyes I am no sportsman, and in my eyes you are arguing from an entirely
  false perspective. You won't mind my saying that you speak as if you had a
  personal bias against Maxwell."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Westbrooke's eyes flashed ominously.</p>

  <p>"I have," she said. "Maxwell's unhappy wife was one of my dearest friends.
  I will make you a present of that."</p>

  <p>Remington looked just a little relieved. He was not displeased that the
  argument should take on a personal aspect. Anybody listening&mdash;and most
  of the guests were&mdash;would attribute Mrs. Westbrooke's anger entirely to
  her loyalty towards her dead friend. Remington smiled in a tolerant way.</p>

  <p>"I thought you didn't mean quite all that you said," he remarked. "Of
  course, I am not going to defend my client as a model of virtue. I would not
  be seen in the street with him, for instance. But at the same time I am not
  admitting that he was responsible for the death of his uncle. We don't want
  to go into details."</p>

  <p>"Julius Maxwell is an abandoned scoundrel," Mrs. Westbrooke said. "He
  started life with a great advantage. He had money, and when he had dissipated
  that he married a fortune. He spent every penny of his wife's money, and
  ill-treated her into the bargain. He behaved so badly that his only daughter
  left him, and was so ashamed of her father's record that she changed her
  name. She got her own living as a typist and shorthand clerk in the city. She
  thought she was safe; but, unfortunately, she also had a large amount left
  her. That man found it out, and followed her everywhere. For eighteen months
  he made the poor girl's life a burden. From her he had all her income; she
  could not touch her principal because she was not of age. She lived in the
  meanest lodgings on the Continent, and frequently was short of food. I found
  her not long ago playing a violin in a Viennese restaurant. She told me her
  story, and I managed to get her away to a place where her father could not
  find her. For the last three or four months Julius Maxwell has been living on
  his wits. I have seen him once or twice. And I firmly believe that he called
  upon his uncle on the night of the crime and murdered him for the sake of
  that money."</p>

  <p>"Which has not been traced to him," Remington suggested.</p>

  <p>"No; but I am sure it will be," Mrs. Westbrooke went on. "Of course, you
  will say assumption is not evidence."</p>

  <p>"Julius Maxwell was forbidden his uncle's house, remember," Remington
  smiled. "He never called there; indeed, we have the evidence of the servants
  to prove that."</p>

  <p>"I suggest that he had a latch key," Mrs. Westbrooke said. "He used to
  live with his uncle at one time. He waited till late at night, and let
  himself in with the old latch key, having no doubt discovered that the butler
  had leave of absence till the small hours to attend a servants' dance. We
  know, therefore, that the front door was only on the latch, which you will
  admit is a point in favour of my argument. I don't say that Julius Maxwell
  intended to kill his uncle, but I am sure that he did it, probably tempted by
  the sight of those notes. And I am quite sure that you will agree with
  me."</p>

  <p>Remington protested vigorously. All the same, he was not altogether at
  ease in his mind. To begin with, there was a good deal in what Mrs.
  Westbrooke had said. Why should a man use his talents and mental qualities to
  achieve the liberty of another man whom he knew to be a danger to society?
  And yet every ambitious member of the Bar was only too anxious for the
  opportunity. He had worked out an ingenious defence for Maxwell, and
  everybody was talking about it. If he could get the man off, then his
  reputation and fortune were made. He would be able to go to Grace Eversfield,
  and declare his love for her without anybody being able to say that his
  affections were inspired by her money.</p>

  <p>But deep down in his heart he knew that his client was guilty. He could
  see it in the shifty eye and the quivering lip, could hear it in the hoarse
  voice and the throaty question. He knew that he was about to release on
  society a scoundrel who ought to have been destroyed like a mad dog years
  ago. It was all very well to advance his sophistries and quote his list of
  precepts to Mrs. Westbrooke, but he winced under her flashing eye and the
  cold contempt of her tongue.</p>

  <p>She turned from him presently as if the argument was finished, and for the
  rest of the evening seemed to avoid him. It was only when her car was
  announced that she approached him again, with an offer of a lift.</p>

  <p>"I hope you don't think I have been too horrible to you?" she said. "But
  it is a point upon which I feel very strongly, and I should have said just as
  much even if I had not known Julius Maxwell and that poor girl of his. May I
  give you a lift in my car? I think you go my way; and, besides, there is
  something I want to say to you."</p>

  <p>"I am quite at your disposal," Remington said.</p>

  <p>A little later, and he found himself seated in the cosy drawing-room of
  Mrs. Westbrooke's luxurious flat. She pressed him into a chair, and with her
  own dainty hands waited upon him. She gave him cigarettes, she poured out his
  whisky and soda and placed it on a little table at his elbow. Remington might
  have been some invalid waited upon by a loving nurse. It was all very
  flattering and pleasant, but there was a sympathy and a shade of pity in Mrs.
  Westbrooke's eyes that made him feel a little anxious and uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>"You are too good to me," he murmured. "What have I done that you should
  be so kind to a mere barrister?"</p>

  <p>"We are just coming to that," Mrs. Westbrooke said. "My dear boy, I am
  going to give you a shock. I have watched you a great many years; I am always
  interested in the career of brilliant young men, even if they happen to be
  barristers, which is a profession that I hate. You have done exceedingly
  well, and I always admired the way in which you kept up your friendship with
  Grace Eversfield, even though she remained in an office and you were
  beginning to make a mark at the Bar. I think there was some sort of an
  understanding between you even before Grace came in to her money and went
  abroad."</p>

  <p>"That's true enough," Remington said simply. "I never cared for anybody
  but Grace. I could not marry her because marriage is a terrible handicap to a
  young man just starting life. Grace knew that, of course. We understood one
  another perfectly, though no word of love had ever passed between us. I dare
  say you will think that this sounds very sordid and calculating, but it is
  nothing of the sort. Then Grace came into her money, and I&mdash;well, I
  persuaded her to have six months' holiday on the Continent. You can call it
  pride, if you like. I wanted her to see something of the world, to see other
  men, to mix with good people. And then, if she was still of the same
  mind&mdash;Oh, you know what I mean. I played the game, though I am only a
  barrister who is defending a rascal for the sake of fame and money. And if I
  get him off I am a made man. Then, Mrs. Westbrooke, I shall go straight to
  Grace&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Remington's voice trailed off in a whisper. Mrs. Westbrooke was regarding
  him with infinite pity in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I do understand," she said. "I understand far better than you imagine.
  Did Grace Eversfield ever tell you the story of her life? Did she ever speak
  of her parents?"</p>

  <p>"Only that she was unhappy at home. I know that she lost her mother years
  ago, and that her father is a mauvais sujet. She has not seen him for a long
  time. And she was anxious that he should not know of her good fortune.
  What&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Remington broke off suddenly. He could see swift illumination in Mrs.
  Westbrooke's sorrowful eyes.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" he cried. "You don't mean to say&mdash;you don't mean to say
  that Grace is the daughter of that abandoned scoundrel on whom all my hopes
  are based?"</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet and paced up and down the floor agitatedly. The thing
  was impossible, incredible. Yet he could see no denial in Mrs. Westbrooke's
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I knew it would be a great shock to you," she said. "But it is true, all
  the same. That is why I brought you here tonight. I had to tell you. A part
  of the pitiful story you already know. Grace's mother was my greatest friend.
  Many a time have I sheltered her here when her husband's violence had driven
  her into the street. There was nothing of that horrible story that I did not
  know. When the poor woman died I helped Grace to get her situation. I
  encouraged her to hide her identity, and advised her to betray it to no one
  unless she was compelled to do so. I did not see that anyone should know,
  except, perhaps, the man that she was going to marry. I should not tell you
  this now if you had not been so candid. And, besides, there are urgent
  reasons why you should be informed. At any rate, you are defending Grace's
  father, and, if you succeed, then the poor child will never rest till he has
  the last penny she possesses. And everybody, sooner or later, must know the
  sordid story. I suppose what I have said makes no difference?"</p>

  <p>"How can it?" Remington groaned. "Don't you see that my whole professional
  career is at stake? I must go on. I cannot recognise a personal side of this
  business. It is very terrible, of course; but you see how helpless I am. I
  must assume that my client is innocent until he is proved to be guilty. The
  defence I have prepared&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is in your opinion impregnable," Mrs. Westbrooke interrupted.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how anything could shake it. So long as those notes cannot be
  traced, Maxwell is safe."</p>

  <p>"And if the notes could be traced? If even one of them could be shown to
  have been in Maxwell's possession?"</p>

  <p>"Then the whole thing collapses like a house of cards. But for goodness
  sake don't tell me that it is in your power? It would be as good as ruin! I
  should have to tell my client's solicitor, and withdraw from the case; that
  is, unless Maxwell would plead guilty. Why, if I dared to go on, knowing the
  ghastly truth, I should be driven from the Bar in disgrace. Please tell me
  nothing. If you want to appear as a witness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ah! there spoke the special pleader," Mrs. Westbrooke cried. "But I am
  going to speak, though your future career at the Bar depended upon my
  silence. I am only concerned with the happiness of that dear child&mdash;yes,
  and your happiness, too. She must not be dragged into this business; the
  scandal must not be made public. No, I cannot permit you to pass. I knew that
  I was going to meet you tonight, and I made up my mind to bring you
  here&mdash;because I wanted to show you this."</p>

  <p>As Mrs. Westbrooke spoke she took an oblong piece of paper from the desk
  and handed it to Remington.</p>

  <p>"This is a five-pound note," she said. "Will you please look at the
  number. If you do, you will see that it is one of the notes which the police
  are seeking for in connexion with the Maxwell murder case."</p>

  <p>"That is quite right," Remington murmured. "I know the numbers of the
  missing notes by heart."</p>

  <p>"Will you kindly turn it over?" Mrs. Westbrooke went on. "On the back of
  it you will see Julius Maxwell's signature and the date. Now, I dare say you
  will wonder how this came into my possession. On the night of the crime I was
  passing through London on my way to Paris, only staying here one evening. I
  did not return from a dance till two o'clock to the morning, when I found
  Julius Maxwell awaiting me. He was wild and excited, and anything but
  sober.</p>

  <p>"He told me that he had been arrested shortly after midnight in some low
  gambling-den, and that some equally low associates had gone bail for him. He
  had given a false name to the police, and was quite sure he would get off
  before the magistrate with a fine. There was some pressing reason why no one
  should know that he was in London. He tried to borrow money from me, but I
  refused to lend him a penny. He went away, and then returned a few moments
  later with the note you have in your hand. Knowing my man, and feeling sure
  he had stolen the note, I made him endorse it. No doubt he paid his fine and
  got away without recognition. The next morning I left for Paris; and I never
  heard a word of the tragedy till I got back here yesterday. And now, what are
  you going to do about it? I have placed in your hands enough evidence to hang
  Maxwell twice over. I am only doing my duty. I might have come into court and
  given my evidence without saying a word to you. But Grace is a second
  daughter to me, and I want, if possible, to preserve her from the terrible
  scandal. It seems to me that the rest is entirely in your discretion."</p>

  <p>Remington sat there for a few moments with his head in his hands. Here was
  a situation entirely without precedent; here was his ambition in ruins at his
  feet.</p>

  <p>"I shall thank you later on," he said. "Meanwhile, may I use your
  telephone? Thanks very much..."</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Gregory?... Yes, I want to see you at once. Maxwell will
  have to plead guilty... Yes, I'll come round at once."</p><br>

     name="story5">5.&mdash;ADVENTURE</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Townsville Daily Bulletin</i>, Australia, 9 Nov
  1935</h3><br>

  <p class="first">SHE stood in the dock, barely conscious of her environment,
  clinging to the rail in front of her as if it were some sort of Rock of Ages
  cleft between her and the sea of troubles that overwhelmed her.</p>

  <p>A thief&mdash;that was what they said&mdash;a thief. Shoplifter? A mean
  pilferer of unguarded trifles! Not that a compact gold manicure set was by
  any means a trifle.</p>

  <p>She had come up from Shepperton for an afternoon's shopping. She, a young
  married woman with money in her purse, and in a social position which should
  have rendered her impervious to temptation. The mistress of a delightful
  home, with a mate occupying a sound position in the City. Holding her head
  high as she entered the mammoth store of Bronsons, intent upon the purchase
  of some expensive trifle&mdash;a wedding present for a friend who had been
  her bridesmaid less than a year ago. Happy and wholly care free.</p>

  <p>What followed was like some evil dream. A long glass counter strewn with
  tempting objects in silver and gold, half a dozen women hanging over them in
  patent admiration&mdash;women, like herself, adumbrating prosperity. Then,
  like the flashing change of a kaleidoscope, a different and more terrible
  picture. A sudden stir, a commotion, the arm of a policeman grabbing a vanity
  bag (hers), and producing therefrom, like some grim conjuror, a gold manicure
  set which only a few moments before had been lying on the crystal surface of
  the table.</p>

  <p>The kaleidoscope flashed once more on a prison cell, with a widely
  protesting woman passionately proclaiming her innocence. A long, distracting
  night in the cell, and now another and no less trying ordeal in the shabby
  police court whilst a trim, self-assured young woman from Bronsons was giving
  her evidence.</p>

  <p>"No, your Worship," she said in answer to a question from the bench, "I
  did not actually see the theft committed. But my suspicions were aroused.
  Being one of the firm's lady detectives, it is my duty to keep a sharp
  look-out on certain counters. But I did see a hand move, and immediately I
  noticed that a certain article was no longer on the counter. I also saw a
  woman's open bag on the counter, and came to the conclusion that the missing
  article was inside it. I stopped the accused as she was leaving the shop
  without making a purchase and told her she would be detained. When the
  policeman came to examine the bag, the manicure set was discovered inside.
  Whereupon, acting on instructions, I gave accused into custody."</p>

  <p>Very terse and to the point, but none the less damning for all that.
  Hopelessly, Elsie Squire lifted her eyes and glanced round the court. She met
  the glance of a man sitting behind the solicitors' table and forced a smile.
  She could see no condemnation in her husband's eyes, only a world of sympathy
  and suffering. It was good to know that one man in the world believed in her
  innocence, though all the rest of creation was against her. But here was the
  policeman giving his evidence.</p>

  <p>"When called in," he said, "I found the prisoner detained in the office.
  In her bag I found the article which is the subject of the charge, and
  produce it in evidence."</p>

  <p>"Is the prisoner represented?" the magistrate asked.</p>

  <p>A little man in glasses bobbed up from his seat.</p>

  <p>"She is, your Worship," he said. "I represent her. I hope to have an
  answer to the charge, however black appearances are against her. I ask for a
  remand for a week, bail being fixed as your Worship desires."</p>

  <p>"Very well," the Bench decided. "The prisoner in 50 with a further surety
  in 100. Next case."</p>

  <p>Outside in the sunshine a large saloon car was waiting. Into it Evan
  Squire handed his wife tenderly.</p>

  <p>"You poor darling," he whispered passionately. "God, how much you must
  have suffered!"</p>

  <p>"Then you don't believe, Evan?"</p>

  <p>"That you would even dream of such a thing? Of course not. There is some
  diabolical trick of fate here. But, darling, how came your bag to be open on
  the counter?"</p>

  <p>"I was taking out my handkerchief," Elsie explained. "Do you think it
  possible that, in replacing it, I swept the gold set into my bag? It was
  quite a bijou set."</p>

  <p>It was possible, Squire admitted to himself. But all the theory in the
  world was so much beating of the wind.</p>

  <p>"Are we going&mdash;home?" Elsie asked.</p>

  <p>Impossible to face that, she was telling herself. Yet sooner or later such
  would have to be done, The home she loved so well! All those artistic
  treasures. The rose garden in the sun, the velvet tennis lawn. Never again
  could she see life from the same perspective. And the neighbors? The tennis
  club, the golf and badminton? She would have to resign, all these social
  amenities.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I can't go back, Evan," she said piteously.</p>

  <p>"Not until this ordeal is over, darling," Evan reassured her. "I have
  arranged all that. Last night and early this morning. I packed everything you
  need, all of which is in the luggage carrier behind us. We are on our way to
  Brighton now, where we shall stay until you... And I am taking a week off
  from the office. Garden has got a theory&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Garden? Who is he, Evan?"</p>

  <p>"The little lawyer man who has your case in hand," Evan explained. "The
  thieves lawyer they call him. He knows the underworld better than anyone in
  London. Enormous practice in police courts. Recommended to me. And he's got a
  theory. He wouldn't say more than that. Cheer up, dear heart."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">MONTAGU GARDEN, attorney at law, sat in his office
  interviewing a client. A youngish-looking woman in the early thirties with a
  personality all her own. Attractive undoubtedly, and dressed with that subtle
  mixture of simplicity and smartness one associates with one to the manner
  born. A cigarette was in her scarlet mouth, her legs crossed with easy
  abandon.</p>

  <p>"In trouble again, Lil?" Garden asked with easy familiarity.</p>

  <p>"You said it, Monty," the woman, known as Liverpool Lil in certain
  circles, replied. "Returning to my flat just now I smelt police. And there
  were the blighters. Search warrant probably. They didn't pipe me so I got out
  whilst the going was good."</p>

  <p>"Expecting to be arrested any moment?"</p>

  <p>"And here I am."</p>

  <p>"You can put your shirt on that, Monty. And there's lots of stuff in the
  flat lifted from half the leading stores in the West End. Oh, I'm for it all
  right."</p>

  <p>"Now how many times have I warned you... ."</p>

  <p>"Oh? cut it out. Monty, I knew I was spotted last week in Savages, only
  the lady tec was not dead sure, funking a possible action for damages. You
  know the game."</p>

  <p>Mr. Garden nodded. He most certainly knew the game.</p>

  <p>"So they dropped the Yard a hint, and the Yard, knowing your record, has
  been shadowing you."</p>

  <p>"The boy guessed right the very first time. I'll be for it any old time
  now, so the rest is up to you, Monty. Guilty, my Lord, and all that. Six
  months' hard, I expect&mdash;what?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Garden shook his head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget that this will be the third time of asking, so to speak," he
  said. "When they trace all that stuff in your flat there will be a dozen
  charges to meet. Of course we can plead guilty to the lot before they get
  their oar in and fight for summary jurisdiction. If his Worship is in one of
  his melting moods, we might get off lightly. By the way, is there anything of
  Bronsons in that little&mdash;er&mdash;collection of yours? Have you been a
  'customer' there?"</p>

  <p>"Only casually, Monty. The day before yesterday I did drop in there, and a
  jolly narrow squeak I had. When you have been at the game as long as I have,
  you learn to spot the lady tecs, by instinct, and keep your eyes skinned
  accordingly. I guess I gave that young woman something to think about."</p>

  <p>Mr. Garden helped himself to a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Something original, eh?" he asked. "If you don't mind I should like to
  hear that story."</p>

  <p>Liverpool Lil proceeded to tell it. There was a queer light in the eyes of
  the little attorney, though his fascinating client was unaware of that. When,
  at length, she had finished, he turned to her with a smile on his lips.</p>

  <p>"How often have I told you&mdash;all your gang for the matter of
  that&mdash;how important it is to tell me everything? You are keeping
  something back. Something you are ashamed of, I am sure. Now, listen to me
  carefully. In the circumstances, I can't save you, because this will be the
  third time you have stood in the dock. But I might be able to get you away
  with six month in the second division if you will tell me
  everything&mdash;mind, everything, just as it happened when you dropped in at
  Bronson's the day before yesterday."</p>

  <p>"You are a devil," the fascinating Lil exclaimed. "You spotted it at once,
  did you?"</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, that's what I am here for. Half you people get into trouble
  and suffer because you won't even tell your own solicitor the whole truth
  about anything. Now, to begin with, how did you know that the police had a
  search warrant?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, as to that," Lil said lightly. "I have friends in the force."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose you have, only we need not go into that side of the
  question now. What you have to do is to play the penitent. When you leave
  here, go straight to Scotland Yard and make a clean breast of it. I suppose I
  can take it that in your flat is more than one article that Savage's people
  can identify? In other words, you have not disposed of the whole of the loot
  you picked up during your visit to that establishment. Careless, careless,
  just like the rest of them. Are you never going to learn the necessity of
  getting rid of the stuff at once?"</p>

  <p>"Guilty, my lord," Liverpool Lil laughed. "There were one or two things
  that I couldn't bear to part with. Well, there they are in my flat, or
  rather, there they were when I got the office about the search warrant. All
  that splosh is in the hands of Scotland Yard by this time, you bet."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Garden grunted. "You can see it now, can't you? And you can see why
  I have got a bit of a task before me. And you can see why, when you get to
  Scotland Yard, you must disguise nothing. Why, the thing that you are ashamed
  to tell me is the very thing that is going to get you out of trouble. At
  least, I hope it will have its effect when we come before the Bench. You are
  a bit of an actress, aren't you, Lil? Play the penitent and shed tears
  without any special effort?"</p>

  <p>"I can do all that," Lil boasted.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's what I want. Now we are getting on. You have to go to Scotland
  Yard with tears in your eyes, not dancing. Quite the humble transgressor
  seeking grace. But take care not to let whoever examines you know that you
  were put wise as to the raid on your flat. What you told me just now is going
  to help us both. Can't you see that?"</p>

  <p>"Since you put it in that way, I can, but I should never have thought of
  it myself."</p>

  <p>"Of course you wouldn't. If you and your kind always thought of those
  little things, It would be a poor look out for lawyers like myself. Now be
  off. Don't stand about here any longer. I am not in the least anxious to have
  my office visited by detectives. You are not supposed to have seen me at all,
  so far. You've got to assume that I know nothing until I am called in on your
  behalf and visit you in your cell. And, if I were you, I shouldn't take much
  trouble to avoid arrest."</p><br>

  <p style="text-align:center">* * * * *</p>

  <p class="first">FOR some time after his engaging client had left. Garden sat
  at his desk busy writing. Then he called up one or two people on the
  telephone and, locking his roll-topped desk, informed his confidential clerk
  that he was going off on business for the day, and would not be back before
  the following morning.</p>

  <p>Half an hour later, he was on his way to Brighton. In the seclusion of a
  private hotel there, Evan Squire and his wife were passing the days dreading
  the hour when Elsie would once more stand in the dock with a certainty of
  shame and disgrace before her. So far, they had heard no more of the defence
  at which Garden had hinted, and were miserably speaking of it when the
  attorney himself walked into the room. There was a quiet smile on his face,
  at the sight of which Elsie's heart began to beat a little faster. Evan
  jumped on his feet.</p>

  <p>"Any news?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"News in plenty," Garden said. "For all I say it myself as shouldn't, it
  was one of the best day's work you ever did, Mr. Squire, when you decided to
  place your wife's case in my hands. I think I can say, without boasting, that
  practically all the swell mob in London have passed through my hands at one
  time or another. And a certain young woman of fascinating appearance and most
  beautifully dressed happens to be one of them. I assure you, Mr. Squire, if
  you met her in the street, or in a private house, you would be sure that she
  was to the manner born. As a matter of fact, she first saw the light in a
  Liverpool slub, though, to-day, you couldn't pick a flaw in her
  equipment."</p>

  <p>"What's all this to do with us?" Evan asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, the young woman in question is a client of mine, as I told you,
  and, at the present moment, is probably enjoying the hospitality of Scotland
  Yard. When you came to me, Mr. Squire, and told me the story of the gold
  manicure set, my mind at once jumped to a certain conclusion. Not a
  coincidence, because I know the underworld so well, and I know their ways so
  intimately that in 99 cases out of 100 I could put my finger upon the real
  delinquent without much trouble. That happens in the present instance. I have
  to be careful what I say, because the woman in the case is a client of mine
  as well as your wife, who, of course, is quite innocent."</p>

  <p>"If we could only prove it," Evan sighed.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I came down here to do. Now, this Liverpool expert,
  knowing that she is for it, and having had her flat searched for valuables
  lifted from various big stores, has by this time, told the authorities
  everything. I wonder if you can cast your mind back a little, Mrs. Squire.
  When you were standing by the jewellery counter at Bronsons, were there other
  women about you? Did you notice, for instance, one in an expensive sable coat
  who stood very close to you?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, so I did," Elsie said. "A very distinguished looking
  woman&mdash;quite the aristocrat, in fact."</p>

  <p>"Otherwise&mdash;well, you can guess. I mean, somebody who hailed from
  Liverpool. It was she who was the cause of all the mischief. Being very
  nearly caught by one of Bronson's lady detectives, she slipped the manicure
  set out of the palm of her hand into your bag. It was her one chance of
  getting away in safety. I got that out of her, because, indirectly, it is
  going to lead to a lighter sentence for her than she would have had
  otherwise. The conscience-stricken girl who read all about your case in the
  paper and has come forward, regardless of consequence to herself, because she
  could not bear to see another suffer for the crime she had committed herself.
  That you will hear from her own lips when your case comes up for hearing on
  the adjournment. Only never even think of this again."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what a relief," Elsie sighed. "But do I really have to go to that
  dreadful court again?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course you do," Garden smiled. "I can arrange for Liverpool Lil's
  case to be taken just in front of yours. Then, the woman in the dock,
  with&mdash;ah&mdash;tears running down her face, will vindicate you
  completely. My dear lady, you will be news! Every daily paper in London will
  have a column about it. And, because my client has behaved so magnanimously.
  I am hoping that the magistrate will put her on probation, although she has
  been before him more than once. But the great point, Mrs. Squire, is that you
  will be entirely vindicated, and not even the most evil-minded person will be
  able to throw a stone at you. I think, in the circumstances, you won't mind
  facing a police court again. Instead of a criminal, everybody will be making
  a heroine of you."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to be a heroine," Elsie wept happily. "All I want is to have
  this dreadful stain removed from my character, so that I can go home once
  more and face my friends, without any feeling of shame. I cannot quite
  understand how you managed it, Mr. Garden, but that does not make to feel any
  the less grateful. Oh, what it is to feel free once again!"</p><br>

     name="story6">6.&mdash;THE DOLL'S HOUSE</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Central Queensland Herald</i>, Rockhampton,
  Australia, 30 Jan 1936</h3><br>

  <p class="first">IT was a very fine establishment indeed, and, when he had
  time to think, John Harness was very proud of it. And when he asked his wife
  what she meant by calling it a doll's house, she merely smiled, and told him
  that he would not understand, though she had hopes that he might find
  illumination some day.</p>

  <p>Three years ago, and the house at Stanhope Gate had not been thought of.
  Three years ago Jack Harness and his wife lived in the country, and the city
  and its ways was a sealed book to him. Then somebody came along with a
  wonderful formula in the shape of a new dye, and Harness was invited to put a
  thousand pounds into it, and incidentally make a huge fortune wthout
  interference with his present employment, which in his case generally meant
  shooting partridges or playing golf. Within a year Harness was passing most
  of his time in the City, where his money was now involved. He had known the
  rack of anxious days and sleepless nights; he had stood more than once on the
  verge of ruin. And so gradually his fortunes had gone one step back and two
  forward till now he was spoken of as one of the coming men, and the doll's
  house in Stanhope Gate was the envy of all Kitty's friends.</p>

  <p>"What a pity you let the old place," Kitty said more than once. "I should
  just love to go back to it again. Sometimes I wish you would come to me and
  tell me that you had lost everything, and that there was just about enough to
  keep up the old Grange."</p>

  <p>"What a funny girl you are," Harness said irritably. "There are thousands
  of women who would only be too glad to change places with you. And yet you
  laugh and call this a doll's house. Why?"</p>

  <p>He lay back in his chair wearily, for he had had a long and trying day,
  and the shadow of the coming trouble was haunting him.</p>

  <p>"Well, I will tell you," Kitty said. "It is so dreadfully cold and formal
  and artificial. It's all make believe, Jack, just like it used to be in the
  old nursery at home when I was giving a doll's tea-party. Now confess it, my
  dear old boy, don't you feel horribly lonely sometimes in this big house? Out
  of the men that come here can you reckon on one real friend?"</p>

  <p>Harness shrugged his shoulders irritably.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you are not happy here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is the pathetic part of it," Kitty cried. "You, the new man
  created in the City and grown up in three years have taken my other
  self&mdash;yourself&mdash;by the throat and strangled him. I was proud of
  your success once, I never realised that you were forging chains that grow
  stronger and heavier year by year. Before long you will not have the strength
  to break them. And not once since we came here have we been away
  together."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I could do with a holiday," Harness said thoughtfully. "But I can't
  see my way to it just yet. I've got over a hundred thousand pounds sunk in a
  new valve. Three months ago I expected to make a million out of it. I knocked
  old Carton's concern end-ways. He came to me and asked me to compromise, but
  I wouldn't listen to him except on my own terms. He is a grasping old money
  grubber and boasts that he hasn't a friend in the world."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry for him," Kitty said. "I wonder if in time to come people will
  ever speak of you as Harness the old money grubber?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't be ridiculous," Harness muttered. "There's no room for
  sentiment in the City. What was I saying? I stood out for good terms and
  Carton refused them. I wish to goodness I hadn't been quite so firm now. I
  met young Edgar Ellis a day or two ago, and he was full of his latest
  invention. When I asked him what it was he said it was an improved valve, and
  that he was thinking of showing it to Carton. I managed to get a look at the
  blue prints, and I saw quite enough to know that if Carton gets hold of that
  invention my valve will be a drug on the market. The old man will fight me to
  a standstill. Once he gets the whip hand of me, I am done, Kitty."</p>

  <p>Harness' voice dropped to a hoarse whisper, his face was pale now, and a
  little bead of moisture had gathered on his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Is it as bad as that?" Kitty asked. "But surely, my dear boy, your course
  is quite obvious. Edgar Ellis is a most delightful young man, so clever and
  straightforward. Now, if I were in your place, I should tell him exactly how
  things stand and offer to take him into partnership. Like most inventors, he
  is poor, and will jump at the chance."</p>

  <p>Harness smiled more or less pityingly.</p>

  <p>"My dear child, we don't do things like that in the City. If we did we
  should be bankrupt in a week. Of course, my game is to pretend that I saw
  nothing in it, and suggest that I might possibly find some way of using it if
  we came to terms. I asked Ellis to come round here this evening, and he may
  turn up at any moment now. No, I don't mean it to be exactly a business
  interview, so there's no reason why you shouldn't sit here while we talk.
  Then you'll get some idea of how things are done."</p>

  <p>Kitty made no reply. Her thoughts were far enough away, away in the heart
  of a pleasant country amongst green fields and shady woodlands, and in the
  background a low, rambling house, all white, with black cross beams and
  latticed windows peeping out from overhanging eaves. She could see the sunk
  rose garden with its grass paths and the battered old sundial athwart the
  cedar, where a work-table was laid out and a girl curiously like herself, was
  waiting for a man who bore an odd evasive likeness to that older man who was
  sitting opposite her in the doll's house. And everywhere was the air of good
  health and sweetness and content and the laughter that seems honour in small
  things and is content with the joy of today and the promise of tomorrow. Ah,
  well! this was all so different to the cold, artificiality of the doll's
  house, with the music of the birds and the bleating of the lambs in distant
  pastures was changed for the hoot of the horn and the sullen roar and rush of
  the traffic.</p>

  <p>To get back to it; oh, to get back to it! Surely there was some way. There
  was no lack of money in those days, for the simple reason that so little was
  sought for or required. All was peace, contentment, and happiness, and life
  was blithe and full as the carol of the blackbird in the early mornings. They
  might get back to this, perhaps, someday, but nothing less than a blessed
  catastrophe could bring it about. A little time now and the tenants of the
  Grange would be on their way to India again, so that it would be possible to
  return there and find every stick and stone as Kitty had tearfully left it.
  From the bottom of her heart she was hoping that the proposed combination
  between greedy old age and sanguine youth would come about. "How great a fool
  a clever man can be sometimes," she said. "When you trusted your fellows you
  were happy. And they never played you false. And now you are utterly
  miserable because you can trust nobody. You tell me you stand on the verge of
  ruin. And even then you are afraid to tell Edgar Ellis the truth, because you
  are obsessed with the idea that he will take advantage of you. Now I should
  go to him and tell him the truth. I should offer him fair and liberal terms
  in the assurance that he will accept them eagerly. Oh, you laugh at me, but I
  am only speaking for your sake. If you came to me tomorrow and told me that
  you were insolvent, I should be glad. All I ask is enough saved from the
  wreck to enble us to go back to the Grange and knit up the threads of the old
  life once more. But that I fear will never be."</p>

  <p>The library door opened at that moment and a young man came in. He looked
  eagerly from one to the other and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well, you two," he said cheerfully. "I always envy you when I come here.
  You always look so happy and comfortable&mdash;as if there was no such thing
  as the City and its worries."</p>

  <p>Harness smiled in spite of himself. He was wondering what Ellis would say
  if he only knew the truth and if he could understand why the colour had
  flamed into Kitty's cheeks. For this young man held the fortunes of the
  doll's house in his hands, and if diplomacy failed, then the whole structure
  must collapse like a house of cards. Leaning back in her chair, with
  half-closed eyes and a strange fluttering in her heart, Kitty watched the
  progress of the fray. Very cleverly and skilfully Harness led up to that
  which was foremost in his mind, and Kitty caught herself wondering if this
  was the man she had promised to love and obey.</p>

  <p>Kitty sat up presently, for down in the hall the telephone bell rang, and
  Harness with a gesture, intimated to his wife that she had better answer the
  call. A harsh voice asked if Mr. Ellis was there.</p>

  <p>"He is in the drawing-room," Kitty said. "Shall I fetch him?"</p>

  <p>"No occasion to do that," the harsh voice said. "A message will be quite
  sufficient. It is Mr. Carton speaking."</p>

  <p>The receiver trembled in Kitty's hand. It was with an effort that she kept
  her voice steady. She would give Mr. Ellis a message, of course, and if Mr.
  Carton would kindly give it her, she would do her best to convey it
  correctly.</p>

  <p>The harsh voice cut in without ceremony.</p>

  <p>"Much obliged, I am sure. Tell Mr. Ellis I have been away all day and have
  only just got back. Say I have gone into the contract and accept the terms. I
  have just posted the cheque to the engineers in Manchester, and if Mr. Ellis
  will call at my offices tomorrow, at ten o'clock, I shall be obliged."</p>

  <p>There was no more, not even a word of thanks or a good-night. And all the
  time that Nero had been fiddling there in the drawing-room, the doll's house
  had been fiercely ablaze. No doubt Carton had found out in some way where
  Edgar Ellis was, and had taken steps to strengthen his own position without a
  moment's delay. Was it too late to save the situation? Was there yet a last
  desperate chance of relieving the garrison? Would anything be gained by the
  suppression of that pregnant message?</p>

  <p>But Kitty was by no means sure that she wanted to hold the pass. What she
  needed more than anything else was her husband back again as she had known
  him three years ago. And in any case Ellis was certain to find out. If there
  had been any temptation, she put it from her and went back to the
  drawing-room. She repeated the message word for word; she seemed to know it
  by heart. She saw the light of triumph flash into Ellis's eyes, and then the
  shade of regret on his face as he turned to Harness.</p>

  <p>"This is a big triumph for me," he said. "I never really expected that
  Carton would accept my forms. When I saw him a day or two ago he seemed
  disposed to throw cold water on the whole thing. I suppose he heard I was
  here this evening and made up his mind to rush it through. Well, it's done
  now, and there's an end to it, but I would much rather that it had been you,
  Harness. To tell you the truth, I had been hoping for weeks that you would
  make me an offer. Your business and mine combined would have defied the
  world, especially as your position is so strong in the United States. But
  there are some men who like to work alone, and I feel that you are one of
  them."</p>

  <p>"Is it too late now?" Harness asked.</p>

  <p>"You are joking of course. I made Carton a definite offer which he has not
  only accepted, but has also backed it with a very large sum of money. We're
  going to be rivals now, but I hope we shall be none the less good friends for
  that."</p>

  <p>Ellis had gone at length, leaving husband and wife facing one another
  across the dead ashes of the grate. Harness sat there moodily looking into
  the future. He glanced up presently to see that his wife's eyes were filled
  with tears.</p>

  <p>"Well go on," he said bitterly; "I deserve all your reproaches. You are a
  better judge of Ellis than I am, and if I had followed your advice two hours
  ago Carton would have been standing in my place at this moment. I suppose you
  understand that he means to ruin me. Not that I am going to take it lying
  down. I'll put up as big a fight as possible, and I may come out with any
  luck with a few pounds to the good. But it won't be any more."</p>

  <p>"Why should I reproach you?" Kitty asked. "I know nothing of your City
  ways. But I do know that there are good and honest men in the world, though
  you have ceased to think so. And I'm not in the least frightened, Jack. It
  will cause me no regret or humiliation to leave this house. Oh, if you could
  only understand! And, please God, some day I hope you will."</p>

  <p>It is not to be supposed that the man in the doll's house turned his face
  to the wall or shrank from the fray. But the months that followed were drab
  and dreary ones, and night by night Harness came back with a shadow on his
  face that deepened day by day. There were strange stories and rumours in the
  City, and gradually those other women who had come eagerly at one time to
  help Kitty to play in the doll's house gradually relaxed their visits until
  they came no more. And there was one black and bitter night when Harness
  reeled home and collapsed in a chair, asking weakly for brandy, a thing he
  had never been known to touch before. There was no dinner that evening, and
  no longer was it possible to conceal from the curious eyes of the domestic
  staff the fact that disaster darkened the air.</p>

  <p>"It's all over, Kitty," Harness explained. "Those people have beaten me to
  a standstill. They are having a certain amount of trouble with the United
  States over their patent because there is something in my specification that
  blocks the way. I believe that I could have compromised over that, but Ellis
  has been in America for months now, and I can't get at him. I swallowed my
  pride sufficiently to call on Carton this morning, but they told me that he
  had been laid up for days. I was ready to make pretty well any terms, but my
  lawyers said that something must be done today. So I have made an assignment
  of everything except the old place in the country. And there will be just
  enough to pay everybody. For the next few months we shall have to live on the
  rent for the Manor House, and even that will only last till those people go
  back to India. Oh, Kitty, Kitty, what a fool I've been."</p>

  <p>He stretched out his hands to her and she laid her head upon his breast
  and comforted him. The thought of ruin troubled her not at all. The doll's
  house had crumbled in the dust, and before long all the pretty costly toys
  therein would go to other children of a larger growth who were eagerly making
  doll's houses of their own. But it mattered nothing to Kitty, for the City
  man was no more, and she had got her husband back at last.</p>

  <p>She shed no tear and no blush of shame rose to her cheek as strange men
  pushed their way into the house without ceremony, and proceeded to label the
  pictures and the china and tear the velvet-pile carpets from the floors. It
  mattered nothing to her that the servants left in a body, and that she had to
  get her own simple meals. After all, there was no shadow of disgrace, and
  nothing that the gossips in the city could point to. Then there came another
  day when the house in Stanhope Street knew them no more, and they found
  themselves in dingy lodgings in Bloomsbury. There was no more than a hideous
  little sitting-room looking out on a dreary street, and for the first time in
  her married life Kitty thanked heaven that she had no children. It was
  necessary to look carefully at every sixpence, for the man who had recently
  controlled a big business was thankful now to draw three pounds a week from a
  house in the City. And when you've been accustomed to every luxury, it is a
  terribly difficult matter to face the problem of existence on sixty shillings
  every seven days. But then the cloud had lifted from Harness' brow, the stoop
  had gone from his shoulders, and he had learned to laugh again as he had done
  in the days which apparently had gone for ever. There were small pleasures
  and enjoyments, now at the cost of some rigid economy, but enjoyed with a
  wholeheartedness and zest that Kitty had never known in the gilded hours in
  Stanhope Street.</p>

  <p>And so winter passed away and the spring came round, and down in the
  country the primroses and violets were blooming and the commons were ablaze
  with the golden glory of the gorse. The Manor House had been empty a few days
  now, and it was necessary that the place should be let without delay. Whether
  to let it furnished or sell all that beautiful old furniture was a problem
  discussed over many hours. Kitty would have preferred a little house of her
  own somewhere in the suburbs, but it was impossible to furnish without money,
  and so the important problem was left in abeyance for a moment and then
  something happened.</p>

  <p>"I heard a bit of news today," Harness said as he came home tired and
  weary, yet smiling, from the City. "Old Carton is dead. He died at Monte
  Carlo over a week ago. I only heard it this morning. His general manager told
  me. He said they had cabled to Edgar Ellis, and that he might be back at any
  moment. When he comes back I am going to see him, and perhaps he will give me
  a good post in his firm. He owes me something, after all, seeing that his
  valve was inspired by mine. Ellis was always a good fellow, and without
  building up any great hopes, I am sanguine&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The grimy maid of all work opened the sitting-room door and brought in a
  letter with an American postmark. It had been readdreased more than once, and
  Harness was interested to see that it was in the handwriting of the very man
  he was talking about. Kitty had noticed it, too, and together they read the
  letter.</p>

  <p class="letter">"My Dear Harness,&mdash;I shall be home almost as soon as
  you get this, but I feel that I must write to you at once. I have just heard
  of the death of Carton by cable, and what is more to the point, I have
  discovered that the old man never carried out the promise he made me months
  ago. When I got out here I found that your patent was in my way. You claim
  certain things in your specification, and until the matter is settled I can
  do nothing here, at least I can do nothing definite for years. I proposed to
  Carton that we should jointly buy you out with an offer equivalent to a one
  quarter holding in our company. He promised me that he would see to it, and I
  understand that he has done nothing of the kind. He always hated you, as you
  know, and I suppose that was his revenge.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Well, you have gone down unfortunately, but at the same
  time we cannot do without you if we are to reap anything like the volume of
  business which is open to us here. I renew the offer with the greatest
  possible pleasure. It means a very handsome income now and a large fortune in
  the future. With kind regards, and hoping to see you very soon, yours very
  sincerely,</p>

  <p class="letter">"EDGAR ELLIS."</p>

  <p>The letter fluttered to the ground. There was silence for a moment, then
  Harness caught his wife in his arms and kissed her long and tenderly on her
  quivering lips. There was a smile on his face and an eager gleam in his
  eye.</p>

  <p>"We'll go back to the old place, Kitty," he said. "We'll go back to the
  Manor House tomorrow, and never leave it again. Never mind about the big
  fortune in future so long as we can have the wholesome country and get the
  old friends we could trust and love round us once again. I have had my
  lesson, Kit; you were right and I was wrong. And I can see that it was a
  mistake for us to come to London at all. Honestly, I've been a happier man on
  an office stool than ever I was in Stanhope Street. And if you can ever find
  it in your heart to forgive me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Forgive you," Kitty laughed. "Haven't you given me that which I prize
  above everything&mdash;my husband back again?"</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7">7.&mdash;A SOUND IN THE NIGHT</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Central Queensland Herald</i>, Rockhampton,
  Australia, 18 Feb 1937</h3><br>

  <p class="first">THE man lay there dead and stiff and cold; he might have
  been beyond all surgery for hours. Ayres had some surgical knowledge, and he
  recognised at a glance that the dead man's neck was broken. His legs were
  curiously twisted as if he had met with some tremendous accident, possibly in
  connexion with a motor. He was well dressed, his clothes were smartly cut,
  and the overcoat collar was turned up. A grey cloth cap lay a little distance
  off, but obviously formed no usual part of the unfortunate man's dress. He
  might have been a professional man, a successful lawyer, perhaps, who found
  himself staying in that remote and lonely part; he might have borrowed the
  cap with the intention of replacing a more correct form of head-gear.</p>

  <p>Ayres could come to no other conclusion than that murder had been done. No
  man intent on suicide could have inflicted those terrible injuries on
  himself. And the theory that he had been killed by a passing car would not
  hold water. No car could have climbed up the slippery side of the moor, and,
  besides, the spot where Ayres had made the discovery was a kind of meadow
  surrounded by a stone wall. At one corner was a clump of larches, under which
  Ayres had been camping out for the last few days. He was absolutely alone
  there, nothing but a small bell tent, a supply of provisions and a spirit
  stove, together with his naturalist outfit. He had come to that lonely moor
  with the intention of securing a specimen of one of the rarer Hawk moths.</p>

  <p>It was past ten on the previous evening before he had finished his
  'sugaring' and other lures for the elusive stranger, and a little later he
  had put out his light and lay smoking in his tent with the flap thrown back.
  At that time there had not been a soul in the meadow besides himself. He had
  lain awake the whole of the night listening intently for the jar of the wings
  which would tell him that the rare feathered creature was in the trap. The
  brief night had spent itself, and the first saffron flush was creeping up
  from the east before Ayres rose and stretched himself, conscious that his had
  been a wasted vigil. He had not heard a sound except once or twice the lour
  churning of a nightjar. He was prepared to swear that he had not closed his
  eyes the whole of the night, and yet within fifty yards of where he had lain
  a brutal murder had been committed. He was not blind to his own position. He
  was a stranger here, and no doubt awkward questions would be asked. He knew
  the story that he would have to tell would sound a strange one, but it would
  have to be told and the sooner the better. It was broad daylight now, and a
  little way below Ayres could see a cowman driving his flock towards the
  milking acre.</p>

  <p>Ayres yelled again and again until he attracted attention. Presently the
  peasant came lumbering up.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter, gaffer?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That," Ayres said curtly, as he pointed to the dead body. "I have been
  camping out here in search of rare moths. At ten o'clock last night there was
  not a soul in the field but me. At daybreak I found this unfortunate
  gentleman lying dead. I wonder if by any chance you might happen to know
  him?"</p>

  <p>The cowman backed away, palpably frightened. It was with considerable
  difficulty that Ayres at length induced him to examine the dead man's
  face.</p>

  <p>"Never seen him before," he declared. "I knows everybody for miles around,
  and that poor chap, 'e never lived about here. And you mean to say, sir, as
  how you never heard nothing at all?"</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't," Ayres replied. "The whole thing's an absolute mystery to
  me. I cannot think how such a terrible crime could have been committed
  without my hearing something of the struggle. And yet there was not one sound
  except the churning of a nightjar."</p>

  <p>The cowman shook his red head obstinately.</p>

  <p>"That you didn't, sir," he exclaimed. "I've been a woodsman and a shepherd
  and a cowman for forty odd year, and there's nothing about anything that
  flies or creeps in these parts as you can teach me. And I tell you this, sir,
  no living soul ever heard a nightjar nearer than Felton, and that's fifteen
  miles away."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me," Ayres demanded, "that I don't know the note of a
  nightjar when I hear it? My good man, I have been a naturalist always. It is
  my living. I heard that nightjar as plainly as possible, and, what is more, I
  heard it three times at intervals. But all this is rather callous, my friend.
  What we've got to think of now is the poor fellow lying here and what to do
  with him. I am bound to stay here till the police come, and I must ask you to
  go and look for them. Is there anybody in the village who possesses a
  telephone!"</p>

  <p>"Squire, at the Grange, 'e have," the cowman explained.</p>

  <p>"Then go down to the Grange at once and explain to the squire exactly what
  has happened. Ask him to telephone to Ixyridge and tell the superintendent of
  the police there to come over here as soon as possible and bring a doctor
  with him."</p>

  <p>It was a long, dragging half-hour that followed before a figure on a stout
  moorland pony came slowly up the hillside and approached Ayres. The newcomer
  was evidently the squire of the parish. He introduced himself as Thornton,
  and inquired somewhat abruptly to know what all this trouble was about.
  Evidently he had gleaned something from the cowman, and it was equally
  evident that what he had gathered had not prejudiced him in Ayres'
  favour.</p>

  <p>"It seems almost incredible, sir," he said stiffly. "You are asking me to
  believe that this tragedy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not asking you to believe anything," Ayres said curtly. "Your views
  on the subject are nothing to me. I have no more to say. We must await the
  police."</p>

  <p>A full hour elapsed before the arrival of the superintendent, who was
  accompanied by a doctor. A brief examination confirmed the fact that the
  unfortunate man's neck was broken, and that both his legs were injured. There
  was nothing about him to lead to his identity.</p>

  <p>"I can't find anything," the doctor said at length. "There is nothing but
  this sheet of tracing paper, which would not help us much. As far as I can
  make out, it represents the skeleton of a bird and various sections of the
  same fowl."</p>

  <p>"I know," Ayres said. "It is that of a nightjar. Very strange."</p>

  <p>He took the thin paper in his hand and unfolded it. The sheet was
  practically covered with a series of drawings from a sketch of the bird in
  its natural state down to the skeleton and the bones of the wings. As a
  naturalist Ayres was profoundly interested. But there was another side to the
  matter which puzzled him: Why had his brother naturalist gone to all this
  trouble, and why were there so many drawings of the wings of this bird? It
  was very strange that nothing else but this should have been found on the
  dead man's body.</p>

  <p>"The mystery deepens," Thornton said. "It looks very much as if this
  unfortunate man was a rival of yours, Mr. Ayres. Do you suppose by any chance
  that he also was looking for the Striped Hawk?"</p>

  <p>"I neither like your question nor the way that you ask it," Ayres snapped.
  "Here is my card, by which you will see that I am Professor Ayres, of
  University College. Several of my friends knew that I was coming here
  and&mdash;well, it does not in the least matter. When we can find out who
  this poor fellow is it will be fine enough to draw deductions. We are neither
  of us detectives."</p>

  <p>It might have been assumed that it was an easy matter to discover the
  identity of the murdered man. The whole thing was a mystery which appealed to
  the popular imagination, and was largely mentioned in the Press. But nothing
  came out at the inquest, which was adjourned for a fortnight, and during that
  time there appeared to be no inquiry whatever for any missing individual. The
  cap found by the body had been identified by a Plymouth hosier as one he had
  sold two or three days before, to a casual customer, who had come into his
  shop just on closing time with a story of having lost his hat on a quay, and
  had expressed the desire to buy a cap as he was leaving hurriedly by a train.
  The shopkeeper viewed the dead body and identified the man as the person who
  had purchased the cap. This was the only piece of definite evidence, and
  there was, therefore, nothing for it but to adjourn the inquiry for a
  fortnight. At first there had been a certain amount of feeling antagonistic
  to Ayres. Local gossip quite openly attributed the crime to him, and the
  county police seemed to share the same opinion, but all this was considerably
  discounted by the appearance of Sir James Silver, the eminent entomologist,
  who came down to prove that he and several of his colleagues knew all about
  Ayres' moth hunting holiday, and listened scornfully to the suggestion that
  he had had a hand in the mysterious crime. Ayres was loth to leave the
  neighbourhood; he had no intention of running away, and, besides, he had not
  yet discovered the origin of his search.</p>

  <p>"You stay where you are," Sir James suggested. "These local police are
  past praying for. I had a great mind to remain in the village for a day or
  two and help you in your search. No, I am just a bit too old to sleep under
  canvas or I would accept your offer of a shake-down in the tent. Oh, yes, I
  will come up and lunch with you now if you like. I think I have made a
  discovery which is likely to interest you."</p>

  <p>The two scientists partook of a modest lunch, then Sir James sat down
  under the shadow of the larches and filled his pipe.</p>

  <p>"I know you have made a closer study of the hawks than I have," he said,
  "but I do not quite agree with you that this is the only spot in England
  where the Striped Hawk is to be found."</p>

  <p>"Produce one from somewhere else," Ayres smiled.</p>

  <p>"Am I to accept that as a challenge?" Sir James asked.</p>

  <p>"If you put it in that way, yes. But I am absolutely certain that you
  won't find the moth anywhere else."</p>

  <p>"Really I shall be obliged if you'll examine the contents of a little case
  which I have in my pocket; and here it is."</p>

  <p>As he spoke Sir James handed over to his companion a small deal box, such
  as collectors use for the safe carriage of specimens. Inside, neatly pinned
  to the strip of cork, was a gorgeous moth, the sight of which caused Ayres to
  give a gasp and a cry of surprise. He turned eagerly to Sir James.</p>

  <p>"The Striped Hawk beyond a doubt," he cried. "But this conveys nothing to
  me. For all I know to the contrary, this may be a cultivated specimen, or,
  perhaps, imported from Holland. It is rather a poor specimen too, and I
  should say, had been somewhere where there was a lot of grease about. At any
  rate, it was not taken in a net or with the aid of syrup."</p>

  <p>"It was not cultivated, neither was it imported from Holland. It was
  caught, if I may put it that way, by myself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But not here," Ayres interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Which is precisely my point, my dear fellow. Now, as you know, before I
  came on here, I was staying with Girton near Salisbury Plain. I was on the
  Plain a day or two ago, and there I found the Striped Hawk which you have at
  the present moment in your hand."</p>

  <p>"If any other man had told me that I would have refused to believe it,"
  Ayres cried. "Now, perhaps, you can tell me how a moth, short-flighted and
  practically indigenous to this locality, found itself so far away from its
  natural food. Why, on Salisbury Plain a hawk could derive no sustenance
  whatever. Somebody must have carried the creature there. But you have not
  told me yet how you caught it. If you were on the Plain at
  night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I didn't say I was on the Plain at night," Sir James said, dryly. "We
  were crossing the Plain when a monoplane appeared over our heads and came to
  the ground within half a mile of where we were standing. Naturally we hurried
  to the spot, curious to see what had happened and ready to render assistance
  if necessary. Nothing really had happened, the pilot of the monoplane had
  descended of his own accord and was merely out on an experimental flight.
  That plane was not a bit like any I have ever seen before. It was exactly
  like a bird. It had no propeller, motion being established by the vibration
  of the wings. As I was examining the plane I noticed a tiny object adhering
  to some part of the machinery, which was dripping with oil. When I came to
  examine the object closely I found that it was nothing more or less than a
  specimen of the Striped Hawk Moth, and you have that specimen in your hand at
  the present moment."</p>

  <p>Ayres sat silent for a little time.</p>

  <p>"Very, very singular," he said presently. "Of course, what you say
  disposes of the suggestion that the Striped Moth is to be found in ordinary
  circumstances on Salisbury Plains. This specimen must have come in contact
  with that strange aeroplane in the darkness. I should very much like to see
  the pilot of that aeroplane. Did you find out his name? Is he likely to be
  there for any time?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," Sir James said. "At any rate, he told us that he was
  conducting a series of experiments, and that there was no place like the
  Plain for his purpose. I didn't ask what his name was, but I dare
  say&mdash;here, where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"To send a telegram to Girton," said Ayres. "A telegram asking him if he
  can put us up for the next two or three days."</p>

  <p>Sir James knew Ayres well enough to be sure that there was something more
  than idle curiosity behind the suggestion. Two days later the scientists were
  quartered in Girton's house a few miles from Stonehenge. There was a good
  deal of flying going on as usual, but most of the attention of the visitors
  was concentrated upon the Angus August monoplane, which had caused quite a
  sensation. The owner and inventor, who called himself Angus August, had
  appeared apparently out of nowhere; indeed, he had not a mechanic of his
  own.</p>

  <p>The invention itself was a remarkable one, and seemed to indicate quite a
  departure in aerial navigation. In the main it had devolved from the ordinary
  methods, inasmuch as it was not propelled in the usual manner, but was worked
  with wings precisely as a bird flies. In a wind its behaviour was remarkable.
  It appeared to defy all the laws of gravity, and could move with dazzling
  rapidity at practically any angle.</p>

  <p>For the best part of two days Ayres watched these flights in silent
  admiration. He was waiting his opportunity for a quiet chat with Angus
  August.</p>

  <p>Ayres dispatched a telegram or two and half a dozen letters. The replies
  to these seemed to satisfy him. It was late on Saturday afternoon before he
  found the opportunity which he was seeking. He caught the airman alone on his
  way back to the roadside inn, where he was putting up for the moment. The man
  called Angus August looked just a trifle annoyed at the intrusion.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I must detain you for a moment or two," Ayres said. "Here is
  my card. I am an entomologist, as you may know, and most of my friends are
  scientists. Do take a cigarette. Shall we sit on the stile for a few
  minutes?"</p>

  <p>The airman signified an ungracious assent. His dark eyes regarded Ayres
  almost menacingly.</p>

  <p>"What do you want with me!" he demanded. His English was good but slightly
  guttural.</p>

  <p>"Merely a little information. I want you to tell me where you got your
  idea for that remarkable monoplane. I am interested, because two years ago a
  man named Miller applied to me for sectional drawings, if I may so phrase it,
  of the bird which is called the nightjar. This Miller had an idea for an
  aeroplane. The request was somewhat out of my line, so I turned Mr. Miller
  over to a fellow professor who is a well known ornithologist. I believe he
  supplied all the drawings; in fact, I know he did. By the way, have you ever
  heard of this Miller? Did you get your idea from him? I am not asking out of
  curiosity."</p>

  <p>For quite a long time no reply came from the famous airman. He appeared to
  be turning over some problem in his mind. He smiled as if he were about to
  give Ayres his confidence.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think you have got some sort of a claim," he said. "Now let
  me ask you a question. What do you know personally as to the man you are
  speaking of?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Ayres admitted frankly. "I have never seen the man in my life.
  But I have my own reasons for being deeply interested in his welfare. He was
  your partner&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You seem to be very sure of your ground."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to deny it!" Ayres asked. "If so, I will apologise for
  detaining you, and at once."</p>

  <p>"Oh, not so fast," August muttered. "As a matter of fact, Miller and
  myself worked out the scheme together; I don't mind admitting that his was
  the finer brain of the two, and that without him the monoplane would never
  have been the success that it is today. He had the brains and I the small
  necessary capital. In addition, he was the finest mechanic I have ever seen.
  We worked on the models for a long time in London, and as soon as we were
  satisfied that we were sure of success, we went off to a place called High
  Tor, which is Devonshire way. We found a deserted hut on the moor miles away
  from the nearest house, and this we provisioned. We managed to get all our
  materials up there without arousing curiosity, and there we worked for months
  at the machine. From the start everything went well, we had practically no
  disappointment, and at the end of nine months we were actually flying. As you
  know, the monoplane is practically silent, so it is quite easy for us to take
  quite long flights in the dusk without anybody being at all the wiser. If
  anybody did hear they would take it for a nightjar; indeed, for all practical
  purposes the machine is one. You see, Miller and myself&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, but where is Miller?" Ayres asked. "You can carry a passenger, but
  you came here quite alone."</p>

  <p>"I was coming to that," August explained. "I am on delicate ground now,
  but I know that you will respect my confidence. Miller got into trouble some
  time ago in Paris. Something to do with forgery, I believe. The night before
  we started he was in Plymouth, where he received an intimation that the
  police were after him. There was nothing else for it but for him to get out
  of the country without delay. I believe he reached New York in safety, en
  route for the West. I am afraid he will never be able to return to this
  country again, but, of course, it will be up to me to see that he gets his
  share of the fortune which we have in this monoplane of ours. I have told you
  this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That was very good of you," Ayres said dryly. "And now let me tell you a
  little story which I think you will find quite as interesting as the one
  which you have just related to me. Did you ever hear of a rare specimen of a
  moth called the Striped Hawk."</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything about moths."</p>

  <p>"No. Well, you are going to. Let me tell you that when my friend Sir James
  Silver saw your monoplane for the first time he found a Striped Hawk attached
  to some part of your machinery. Now, from my point of view, that is a most
  remarkable discovery. I knew for a cold scientific fact that the Striped Hawk
  could not possibly exist on Salisbury Plain. Again, the insect only flies
  after dusk, and therefore must have become attached to your machinery during
  your night flight from High Tor here."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't sound very interesting."</p>

  <p>"My dear sir, I am just coming to the interesting part. Look at this map.
  Here is High Tor and here is the Plain. Now just where my finger is lies some
  high ground where for some days I was camping out, hunting the Striped Hawk.
  On the night of your flight here I was on duty and did not close my eyes. I
  saw nothing and heard nothing beyond a loud noise which I took to be the note
  of a startled nightjar. But I was mistaken, for it was proved to me on the
  highest local authority that no nightjars had ever been seen within miles of
  the place. What I heard beyond a doubt was the churning of your monoplane's
  machinery. You must have passed just overhead; indeed, this is proved by the
  Striped Hawk which Sir James found attached to your machinery. Now do you
  begin to understand?"</p>

  <p>August's eyes were blazing.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said hoarsely. "Go on, curse you."</p>

  <p>"You know just what I found the next morning," Ayres proceeded. "You must
  have seen it in the papers. I discovered a man lying dead not more than fifty
  yards from my tent. Directly I knew about that moth and heard the peculiar
  noise your monoplane makes, I knew exactly what had happened. As you passed
  over my tent you threw your companion out."</p>

  <p>"Prove that it is Miller," August cried.</p>

  <p>"That can safely be left in the hands of the police," Ayres said. "Miller
  had no friends, and you gambled on the certainty of his not being identified.
  You were working in secret together and nobody, so far as you know, had seen
  you with the murdered man."</p>

  <p>"A fairy tale," August sneered. "Of course, I have read all about that
  business the papers. There was absolutely nothing on the body of the dead man
  likely to lead to his identification."</p>

  <p>"There was," Ayres said quietly. "Something you had overlooked. You were
  just a trifle careless. For obvious reasons the police made no mention of
  their discovery, but in the dead man's pocket they discovered the original
  drawings of the nightjar which I had procured for the unfortunate Miller
  through my friend. And now if you have any questions to ask
  me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>August had no questions to ask. He turned away with a snarl and a curse,
  something gleamed dully blue in the sunshine. There was a whip-like crack, a
  flash, and August lay white and silent on the grass with a bullet in his
  brain.</p><br>

  <h2><a id="story8"
     name="story8">8.&mdash;BRAYTON'S SECRET</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Central Queensland Herald</i>, Rockhampton,
  Australia, 14 May 1942</h3><br>

  <p class="first">LAWRENCE BRAYTON lay back in his chair luxuriously. This was
  the kind of thing that appealed to him&mdash;he liked the silken luxury of it
  all, the flowers, the shaded lights, the statues, the suggestion of aloofness
  all around him. There was no vulgar chatter or merry laughter in the
  dining-room of the Wellesley, no startling display of the 'human form divine'
  as interpreted by the last audacities from Paris&mdash;they did not encourage
  powdered shoulders at the Wellesley. It was all in the very best of taste,
  quite subdued, with lights shaded and just an occasional flash from a tiara
  or a coronet, in the purple, flower-laden lamplight. The coffee was
  excellent, the cigarette a dream, the liqueur a poem. Brayton was quite glad
  to be alone in the quiet enjoyment of the picture.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have been born a rich man," he muttered as he glanced across
  the tangle of purple orchids on the table. "Every poet should have money. I
  wonder if I am a poet really. Anyway, I am blest, or cursed, with the
  artistic temperament. All the same, I've got to work in the city for my
  living. A commission agent! If I could only have foreseen it in the old Eton
  days! Lord! to have money, and cut the city. To be able to say to Gertrude
  Mallison&mdash;Lawrence, my boy, you are a greater fool than I took you for.
  Still, I suppose I have something to be thankful for. I can put my bands on a
  thousand pounds, and I've had a good dinner at Harrison Syme's expense
  without having to put up with the company of that brilliant bounder
  himself."</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, Harrison Syme had been called away before the soup
  was finished. Somebody wanted to speak to him on the telephone. He had gone
  off in his insolent, swaggering way; he had come back looking white and
  uneasy, quite unlike the financier who was supposed to have made over a
  million of money in the past four years.</p>

  <p>"Beastly nuisance, but I've got to go, Brayton," he muttered. "Most
  important matter. I'll do my best to get back in an hour. You get on with
  your dinner; I've ordered it, and I shall have to pay for the same in any
  case. If I don't get back I'll ask you to call on me tomorrow. You may have
  made something of the cipher by that time."</p>

  <p>Brayton expressed himself quite correctly and conventionally. As a matter
  of fact, he was not disposed to quarrel with the turn of events.</p>

  <p>"Let it go at that," he said. "It looks to me like a variation of the
  Four-Ace Code. It's the code I've been using for years."</p>

  <p>Brayton smiled to himself. He was fond of mysteries and puzzles, and on
  more than one occasion had been of considerable assistance to Scotland Yard.
  But then, at the Yard, they knew what Syme was not aware of&mdash;that the
  Four Ace Code was Brayton's own invention. He had sold it some years ago for
  a trifle, not realising its value, and now the code was one of the most
  popular amongst business men. The key-card could be changed at pleasure. If
  the diamond ace was the key letter, then anybody familiar with the clue could
  decipher. But say a man distrusted his confidential clerk and elected to take
  hearts instead, the clerk in question was reduced to impotence. All the most
  precious secrets entrusted to the cable came by the Four-Ace Code.</p>

  <p>Syme gulped down a large glass of brandy and departed. Quite content to be
  alone, Brayton sat there puffing an other cigarette. On one side of him was
  an ambassador, at the table on his left a personage was dining. It was all
  very pleasant and very soothing to a well bred, ambitious young city man
  possessed of the artistic temperament. He longed to have the money to do this
  kind of thing regularly. And perhaps Gertrude&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>Well, why should he not think of her? He knew that she liked him, and she
  generally chose him as her partner at tennis and in the mixed foursomes at
  Ranelagh; she had told him once that his step suited her to perfection. But
  then she was so beastly rich and he was so beastly poor! She wasn't an
  ordinary type of girl either&mdash;she had something besides money and
  beauty.</p>

  <p>One night, up the river&mdash;yes, he had seen the glint in her eyes, the
  faint, unsteady smile. He had been very near speaking that night. To have her
  for his wife, to order out the motor and drop in here to a little dinner,
  they two together. And to sit opposite that exquisite face and watch the
  smile in those glorious eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am the biggest fool in England." Brayton told himself. "Well, what is
  it?"</p>

  <p>A telegraph-boy stood by his side, a pert little messenger absolutely at
  home there.</p>

  <p>"My Syme, sir?" he suggested. "Thank you, sir; good night, sir."</p>

  <p>The orange envelope was dropped carelessly on the table, and the boy had
  vanished. Evidently a telegram of importance, and one that Syme had expected,
  for the sender of the message had known exactly where to find Syme and where
  he could get him without delay. Very strange. It did not seem quite so
  strange when Brayton recalled the fact that Syme dined at the Wellesley most
  nights. Possibly Syme did not want the cable to go to his office.</p>

  <p>"Wonder if I'd better open it," Brayton said. "It may be very important.
  His own man has orders to open any telegram, I know. If it is important he'll
  pitch into me afterwards for not taking steps to get in touch with him. I
  think I will."</p>

  <p>The envelope was barely fastened down. There were only two words in it,
  and they were in cipher. In an idle way Brayton spelt them over. What did
  'jigshawspi lemonnutsnoseben' mean? Brayton stuck the envelope down again and
  called one of the waiters.</p>

  <p>"Here's a shilling for you," he said. "Try and get Mr Syme on the phone.
  Try his clubs. When you get him, tell him to hold the wire as I want to speak
  to him."</p>

  <p>The waiter departed on his errand. Brayton could see the queer jumble of
  words no longer, but he could have repeated them by heart all the same. He
  had the sort of memory necessary to the solution of cipher. And, in fact, two
  or three letters in the jumble were oddly familiar. He wondered where he had
  seen them before. Suddenly the answer flashed upon him.</p>

  <p>"By Jove," he muttered, "it's the Four-Ace Code. And the cipher ace is
  clubs. I don't want to pry into any man's secrets, but I'd like to see if I
  could work it out."</p>

  <p>He took a pencil from his pocket and jotted the sequence of letters down
  with absolute correctness on the back of the menu card. Then he proceeded to
  place the consonants in two parallel lines. Now that he had got the start,
  the rest was child's play. He wrote the answer to the sum in his neat
  handwriting, so that the words stood out like little letters of flame.</p>

  <p>"Agricola main reef forty ounces. Blind. Eighty years. Over a
  thousand."</p>

  <p>To the lay mind even now it looked cryptic to a degree. But not to a man
  who had spent five of the best years of his life in the city.</p>

  <p>"So Agricola is a really big thing," Brayton muttered.</p>

  <p>"The Agricola mine that everybody says is a swindle turns out to be a big
  thing in a main reef, showing forty ounces of gold to the ton.</p>

  <p>"Nobody knew but the man who sent this cable, and he has seen that the
  rest are absolutely 'Blind.' The life of the mine is eighty years, and the
  dividend should pan out at over a thousand per cent. Well, Syme is a greater
  rascal than I took him for. It was only today that I read that Agricola was
  going in for liquidation. Shares a drug in the market at two for
  three-halfpence. By Jove, if I can get into the market before Syme I shall
  be&mdash;&mdash;I've got a thousand pounds to play with. And shares to be had
  for nothing. Oh, Gertrude, Gertrude&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Brayton stretched out a shaky hand in the direction of the cablegram.</p>

  <p>"No, I won't," he said between his teeth. "I'll not suppress it. I'll play
  the game. Syme shall have his cable if I can possibly find him, but there is
  no occasion to tell him what I have discovered. He couldn't know that any
  form of the Four-Ace Code is like an open book to me. He'll probably go
  quietly to work some time tomorrow, but he'll be too late. By lunch time
  Agricola will be all mine."</p>

  <p>Brayton helped himself to another liqueur and lighted a cigarette with a
  perfectly steady hand. The whole thing was deliciously simple. He had only to
  divide his thousand pounds between two brokers, and give them instructions to
  buy Agricola so long as the money lasted. They could be had for practically
  nothing. By this time tomorrow Brayton would be rich. People would no doubt
  say a good many hard things about him, but it was all in the way of business.
  Let them do it. And Gertrude&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>The waiter was some time away. He came back presently with the information
  that he had got Mr. Syme on the phone at his club. Mr. Syme regretted that he
  was unable to return to the Wellesley that night, as he was detained on
  business of the utmost importance, and that he had just gone home.</p>

  <p>"You told him about the cable message?" Brayton asked.</p>

  <p>"He never gave me a chance, sir," the waiter exclaimed. "He was in a
  desperate hurry. He cut me off and hung up the receiver. I did all I could,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"I daresay it will be all right," Brayton responded. "I'll take the
  message myself on my way home. If a man is so foolish as to&mdash;&mdash;That
  will do, waiter, thank you."</p>

  <p>The waiter vanished, and Brayton leisurely donned his hat and coat. Things
  were going to be very different with him from this night on. By this time
  tomorrow&mdash;&mdash;He walked as far as his club, the one extravagance he
  indulged in, feeling on the best of terms with the world. It is not every
  night that a man strolls down Pall Mall with a secret in the back of his mind
  worth two hundred thousand pounds. And this was quite a moderate estimate,
  Brayton thought.</p>

  <p>It was not very late as yet and the club was full. Brayton dropped into
  his accustomed seat in the smoking room and blandly inquired if there was any
  news. Three or four men were discussing something eagerly by the fireplace.
  It seemed to Brayton that he caught Syme's name.</p>

  <p>"What's that you are saying, Doctor?" he asked. "What about Syme?"</p>

  <p>"Dead," Doctor Gladstone said crisply. "I've just come from Syme's room.
  I'm his man, you know. They fetched me from here by motor half-an-hour ago.
  Dead before I got there."</p>

  <p>A little odd feeling played up and down Brayton's spinal column.</p>

  <p>"A sudden trouble with the heart?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Suicide," Gladstone went on with pseudo-cynical indifference. "Shot
  himself through the head with a revolver. Walked in quite coolly and took off
  his hat. Called for a drink and took every drop of it. Then he handed the
  glass back to his man, took a revolver from his hip-pocket, and shot himself.
  Mad! Not a bit of it&mdash;man was as sane as you or I. Another financial
  bubble pricked. They say the Agricola smash finished him off."</p>

  <p>Brayton called for a drink himself; he felt that he needed it. The
  cablegram had come too late; perhaps things had gone too far for even the
  news from South America to save him. And Brayton was the one man in the
  world, with the exception of the sender of the message, who knew that
  Agricola was the best thing on the market at the present time.</p>

  <p>"It's a bad smash," another man said. "I met poor old Stannard this
  afternoon nearly out of his mind. He's been advising his clients to put money
  into Agricola. He began to tell me what one client of his, a
  girl&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Is that Stannard, of Lincoln's Inn, the lawyer?" Brayton asked. "Mr.
  Mallison used to be his partner. If it's the same man."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's the same man," the other said. "What, are you going already,
  Brayton?"</p>

  <p>Brayton muttered something to the effect that he had work to do. He wanted
  to be alone to think this matter over. The floating kaleidoscope of events
  bewildered him. An hour or two ago and he had sat humbly in the Wellesley
  envying Syme his money and position, and now Syme was dead and Lazarus had a
  fortune in his pocket.</p>

  <p>Not a soul in the world knew except the sender of the cablegram. There
  would be a great deal of poverty and distress, for the Agricola had been a
  strong tip with the public, who, a little while back, had rushed for
  everything that Syme fathered. Scores of these people would be ruined, but
  Brayton did not allow his mind to dwell on that point. People of that class
  always lost their money&mdash;if one fraudulent scheme didn't have it another
  would. Why couldn't they be content with a safe interest?</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, a lot of people would suffer. But people like old Stannard! It
  seemed incredible that he should have been caught. And that he should invest
  clients' money. Gertrude Mallison was a client of his; in fact, he was her
  trustee. Suppose he had lost all Gertrude's money. Suppose she had to turn
  out and get her own living. And suppose Brayton was rich, as he would be
  soon. Gertrude, Gertrude, those eyes of yours have made a fool of me," he
  murmured. "Your father was not the man to give his trustee much latitude in
  the way of investments. Still&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The papers were full of it next day. It was a tremendous smash. Scotland
  Yard had been after Syme; they had been looking for him the evening before
  with a warrant. He had played a desperate game at the finish, but fortune was
  against him. It was one of the inspectors of the Yard who told Brayton all
  this. Syme could not afford to wait for that cablegram from South America.
  Doubtless, he had lingered on till the last possible minute. The authorities
  had taken possession of Symes' papers, and already a hopeless state of
  affairs had been divulged. Everything had been disposed of&mdash;Syme did not
  appear to have a share worth keeping left. There was no occasion to hold on
  to the Agricola, seeing that in the ordinary course of events they could have
  been bought back for two for three halfpence. Special meetings of the various
  shareholders would be called at once, but the chance of saving anything out
  of the wreck was very remote.</p>

  <p>Brayton stood impassively. The game was absolutely in his own hands. There
  was no occasion for any hurry. He took his way leisurely into the city and
  commenced operations. He was a buyer for cash. His broker was frank to the
  verge of rudeness.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow, you will lose every penny," he said. "What on
  earth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind that," Brayton said. "What can you buy the shares for?"</p>

  <p>"Well, certainly for sixpence each. Perhaps less."</p>

  <p>"Then buy all you can for cash and the account. I'll give you a cheque for
  1,000 now. That should secure 40,000 of the ordinaries. Oh, I'm not saying
  there is anything in Agricolas, but Agricolas may counteract another thing
  that I shall get 5 per cent out of. It's a pure spec, on my part, but I've
  had a bit of luck lately, and I'm backing it."</p>

  <p>"Come into a fortune?" the broker asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't," Brayton said crisply. "But all that you can get for that
  amount. Good-bye."</p>

  <p>He strolled off quietly, and patiently awaited his game. He had parted
  with all his available capital, and in return he possessed forty thousand
  Agricola ordinary shares, with a possibility of as many more. Within ten days
  he would have to find a further thousand pounds or carry over. But the
  carrying-over would be easy enough, as Brayton very well knew. Within ten
  days those shares would be standing at a premium of at least five pounds, and
  he was pretty certain to make half a million of money. A couple of days
  drifted by, and Brayton was satisfied. There were no more Agricolas to be
  had. On Thursday morning they were asked for, on Thursday, at closing time,
  as much as eight shillings were bid. By midday on Friday the stock stood at
  par, and then the secret leaked out. Whence it came nobody seemed to know or
  care. Syme's co-directors, harassed out of their lives, cabled to the mine
  asking pertinent questions of their engineer. His little conspiracy had
  failed; Syme's tragic death had pricked the bubble, and it behoved the
  engineer to save his face. He was shocked to find that Syme had suppressed
  his code message, or perhaps Syme had not received it. At any rate, he begged
  to repeat his cable, and did so. The directors sighed with relief. At any
  rate, their holdings were intact; the Agricola was a good thing, and they
  prepared without delay to call the shareholders together and tell them so.
  The city rang with the story.</p>

  <p>On the day of the extraordinary general meeting Agricolas stood at 4 10s.
  Brayton turned into the Cannon Street Hotel with the easy mind and placid
  assurance of one who feels himself in the possession of half a million of
  money. There were shareholders there who were not shareholders at all. They
  had parted with their holdings and they came sadly curious to know how the
  swindle had been worked. Syme was dead and done with, but assuredly he had
  confederates who had engineered the swindle, and who was going to benefit by
  it. Possibly the chairman of directors would be able to tell them
  something.</p>

  <p>Brayton glanced curiously around him. He began to wish that he had stayed
  away. Some of those faces were by no means pleasant to look at. There was an
  old clergyman with frayed coat and a collar evidently trimmed at the edges, a
  half-blind working man led by a little girl. And there was a tall lady in
  deep black with two children by her side. And there was Mr. Stannard with a
  white, anxious face and a twitching of the lips that told its own tale. And
  last, there was Gertrude Mallison, grey lipped and forlorn, with an
  expression in her eyes that brought Brayton to her side.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I did not expect to see you here," he stammered. "I sincerely
  hope&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we are all in the same boat," Gertrude smiled wistfully. "Only, don't
  say anything to Mr. Stannard. He is heartbroken about it. Oh, yes, all my
  money. He says that he must have been mad. You see, my father gave him
  absolute discretion. And he meant to make me very
  rich&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>What was going on? Oh, yes, the chairman was speaking. But the chairman
  had very little to say. He and his colleagues had not sold for various
  reasons. They had lost nothing. But they were quite prepared to pool their
  shares for the benefit of the company generally. At the huge premium at which
  the shares stood today, something substantial would be done to mitigate the
  distress. There had been some dirty, underhand work, and certain people had
  benefited. Those people were strangers, and the chairman understood that one
  of them was in the room at the moment. Perhaps he would like to say a few
  words. If not, then there was very little to be said. Perhaps the Board of
  Trade&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>"You are alluding to me," Brayton said. "To be quite frank, I hold
  four-fifth of the shares. I bought them for very little on exclusive
  information. Your engineer betrayed you, and the exclusive information
  dispatched for Syme's benefit came unexpectedly into my hands. Why I kept the
  information to myself I need not say. I could not give it to Mr. Syme,
  because he had gone to his account elsewhere. Neither am I going to explain
  why I bought those shares. If I had not done so sooner or later, there would
  have been a rush on the part of the shrewd city speculator, and instead of
  one man to contend with you would have had a hundred. As a matter of sheer
  business my position is unassailable. You cannot touch me. But there is
  another way in which you can touch me and you have. I am touched by the
  appearance of certain people here. Their silence is more eloquent then words.
  If I like to leave the room with my hands in my pockets I can do so, and no
  process, legal or otherwise, can stop me. But I am not going to do it. And I
  am not going to have my motive questioned either. Call it a tardy repentance
  on my part, call it what you like, say that I did this to save you from the
  city sharks, say I did it because a lady shareholder is a great friend of
  mine, and I wanted above all things to stand well in her eyes. But I'm going
  to give all those shares back to the people who sold them to me, and the
  price is exactly what I gave for them. And&mdash;and that's all."</p>

  <p>The greatest fool in the City of London walked out into Cannon Street
  feeling at peace with all the world. A hand was laid on his shoulder. He
  turned round to meet Gertrude's eyes.</p>

  <p>"My cab is here," she said. "Please get in. I am going to take you as far
  as my flat. Did you suppose that I was going to let you run off in that
  fashion? Oh, I know something about business. My father was a business man,
  remember. We shall be quite alone there. Please get in."</p>

  <p>Brayton obeyed mechanically enough. Right away to Kensington, Gertrude
  kept her face averted from him. She said no word till the flat was reached.
  The tears were in her eyes still.</p>

  <p>"Sit down in that chair," she commanded. "And tell me everything.
  Everything, mind!"</p>

  <p>Brayton told the story. He omitted nothing. It seemed strange that he
  should be baring his soul to this girl in so free a fashion. He spoke of his
  hopes and fears, of the artistic temperament, of his loathing for the
  city.</p>

  <p>"And there it was, thrown at me, Miss Mallison," he said.
  "Especially&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gertrude," the girl said. "Call me Gertrude, please."</p>

  <p>"Well, Gertrude, darling. I could be rich. Why should I consider other
  people? I&mdash;I could ask the girl I love to marry me without any chance of
  being called a fortune-hunter."</p>

  <p>"Is&mdash;is the girl rich?" Gertrude whispered. "I mean was she rich this
  morning?"</p>

  <p>"Well, she wasn't," Brayton said. "But she is now, and I am poor, and
  there is an end of the matter. But, thank God, she knows my story now, and if
  she thinks none the worse of me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Worse of you, Lawrence! Worse of you! Oh, the boy is clearly mad. Why,
  you acted splendidly. You acted as few people would have done. You gave
  everything back to those poor people, you were going to give up the girl you
  loved so that&mdash;&mdash;What nonsense, what delicious, romantic nonsense!
  And what does it matter who has the money so long as it belongs to one of the
  two?"</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't know what you mean," Brayton stammered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you do, Lawrence. Look at me. Come here. Now put your arms round me
  like that&mdash;and kiss me. And I'll put my arms round you&mdash;like
  this&mdash;and I'll kiss you. Oh, my dearest boy, have not you seen for a
  long time that there was nobody but you? I thought that I should have to ask
  you. But now that you have given me back my fortune I must offer you
  something in return. Well, I do, dear! Let me hide my face on your breast and
  so save my blushes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't believe you're blushing a bit, Gertrude."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I'm not. I'm not a bit ashamed of myself. Lawrence, what can
  I do for you?"</p>

  <p>He bent down and kissed her long and passionately.</p>

  <p>"Take me to the Wellesley to dinner tonight," he said. "With you opposite
  me with that love-light in your glorious eyes, even the artistic temperament
  would have no more to ask for."</p><br>

     name="story9">9.&mdash;FREE LABOUR</a></h2>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Central Queensland Herald</i>, Rockhampton,
  Australia, 1 Apr 1943</h3><br>

  <p class="first">OVERTON crept a little nearer towards the neat little parcel
  in the clean table napkin, and sniffed as a hungry dog might have done. The
  muscles of his mouth quivered--he passed his tongue over his dry lips. In the
  language of his bygone youth--and, Heavens! how far away that seemed--he was
  up against it. Not for worlds would he have confessed the fact that no food
  had passed his lips for 20 hours. He was willing enough to work and strong
  enough withal. But the whole world seemed to be full up, perspiring dockers
  were passing in a constant stream, he could hear the roar of traffic as the
  laden lorries passed over the cobble stones in High Street. And yet in all
  this world of activity they told him that things were slack and that most of
  the casual hands there were working for a bare wage.</p>

  <p>Overton was realising bitterly enough that this thing was true. He had
  made a sixpence yesterday by holding horses, but so far as the docks were
  concerned nothing for the best part of a week. He was angrily conscious that
  the strength in which he prided himself was feeling the strain. But at any
  rate he was a better man than the thin reed over there sweating amongst the
  bales of wool. He was a clean-shaven, respectable-looking man and bore the
  unmistakeable stamp of better times. Overton studied him half curiously. He
  saw the little man stagger towards one of the bales and drop on it, shaking
  from head to foot like a leaf. His head and hands jerked as if invisible
  strings were pulling them.</p>

  <p>"Anything wrong?" Overton asked.</p>

  <p>"Malaria," the little man gasped. "It's a legacy I brought back with me
  from India. Catches me cruelly at times. When I get a bad dose I'm good for
  nothing for a week. And the devil of it is that cursed foreman's got an eye
  on me. Next time he comes round and finds I haven't shifted this little
  parcel I'll get fired. They've got no use for malaria here. Do you happen to
  be looking for a job yourself!"</p>

  <p>"Well, that's about it," Overton said briefly.</p>

  <p>"Well, turn in and shift this wool for me. If you get it done in
  half-an-hour I'm good for a shilling. If I get a stiff dose of quinine down
  me I may be better presently. On the other hand, I may be worse. Point is,
  are you game?"</p>

  <p>Overton turned to the work fiercely. He ripped off his coat and vest and
  rolled up his shirtsleeves. The shaky little man sitting there had a
  stammering word or two of praise for those magnificent muscles.</p>

  <p>"My word, you ought not to be put off a job," he said. "Done a deal of
  rowing in your time, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"I was in my college boat," Overton said absently. He reddened slightly as
  he spoke. "But that's another story."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," the little man said. "I was in my college boat, too,
  though you wouldn't think it to look at me."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet and staggered away. When he returned half-an-hour
  later the whole of the work was done and Overton was sitting on a capstan
  wiping his heated forehead.</p>

  <p>"Here's your money," the little man said. "Oh, you needn't hesitate to
  take it. I've got a bit put away. And I should have a bit more but for these
  cursed strikes. To blast with your leaders, I say. No, I've got no Federation
  ticket and I don't want one. And thousands more would tear up theirs if they
  only dared. And there's thousands, too, who regard Mat Herring as a god and
  just do anything he asks when he holds up his little finger. Look at him now
  talking to those lightermen. Not a day's work has he done for the last ten
  years. Just twig his fine clothes and his big watch chain and his cigar. And
  there's nothing to him except the gift of the gab and a certain infernal
  cheek that fairly hypnotised 'em. There are mothers and children down our way
  who would put a knife into him if they dared. We've had mine strikes in the
  last five years, and there's not a docker here who could tell you what they
  were about if you gave him a sovereign. Here, you haven't taken your shilling
  yet. It seems a pity that a workman like you should be doing nothing. You
  come along here tomorrow morning at the same time, and I'll see if I can't
  find a job for you."</p>

  <p>Overton walked over to the nearest public house and spent a few coppers of
  his precious shilling in a cheap, substantial meal. In reckless mood he
  treated himself to a glass of beer and a penny packet of cigarettes. The
  close and stuffy little bar was full of dockers more or less unemployed, the
  air reeked with the smell of sweating humanity. And Overton did not fail to
  notice the suggestion of unrest and discontent on the face of those about
  him. He could hear certain threats and grumbling; he caught from time to time
  the revered name of Mat Herring. There was a commotion in the bar presently,
  and the big agitator himself came in. He spoke loudly and stridently--his
  coarse red face bore a certain suggestion of strength and power. From
  Overton's point of view he was merely a repulsive bully using these deluded
  men as a means to an end. Overton itched with a desire to get his hands upon
  the man, and he would have quarrelled with him at the slightest opportunity.
  But discretion was certainly the better part of valour now. He had only a
  small handful of coppers between himself and starvation, and the docker who
  made an enemy of Mat Herring lived to regret it and that speedily.</p>

  <p>The agitator boomed on in his big voice, eloquent on imaginary grievances
  and leaving sullen discontent behind him wherever he went. There was some
  fresh trouble in the air, some childish controversy which might at any moment
  burst into a flame that would involve all the labour in the East.</p>

  <p>"You've got 'im in your own 'ands," Herring roared. "'Ere, wot are yer
  talking about? Ain't I speaking?"</p>

  <p>"There's a gal outside wot wants to speak ter yer, Mister 'Erring," one of
  the audience said ingratiatingly.</p>

  <p>"Daresay it's that niece o' mine," the great man said. "If she wants to
  see me, she can come inside."</p>

  <p>There entered a tall, slim figure of a girl clad in rusty black. Over her
  head and shoulders was a shawl of some fleecy material which did not serve to
  disguise the marvellous colour and texture of her hair or the sensitive
  beauty of her face. She was no better dressed than most women round there and
  yet she stood out from them a thing apart. Something like a bitter smile
  trembled on Overton's lips. He was wondering by what extraordinary freak of
  nature this girl could be Herring's niece. The man turned and brutally
  demanded what the girl was doing there.</p>

  <p>"It's the child," the girl stammered painfully. Overton noticed that her
  voice was as refined as her face. "She's worse. You must send for a
  doctor."</p>

  <p>"No doctors in my house," Herring declared. "Bloodsucking set of murderers
  I call 'em. And don't you come bothering me again like this when I'm in the
  middle of my work."</p>

  <p>He raised his am threateningly and Overton jumped to his feet. Just for a
  moment the joy and pride of the militant dockers was within an ace of
  receiving the thrashing which he had so richly deserved for years. But
  Overton checked himself in time. Commonsense told him that he would only make
  matters worse for the girl afterwards. He did not take his seat again, but
  followed the girl out into the street.</p>

  <p>"You'll excuse me," he said. "I have no right to speak to you, of course,
  but you are in trouble, and I fancy I can help you. I have no money, but I am
  not without influence, though it may sound amusing for me to say so."</p>

  <p>"You are very good," the girl said gratefully. "And it is a pleasure to
  speak to a gentleman again. And anybody can see you are that. In a way we are
  companions in misfortune. You see Mr. Herring married my sister. And she
  died. It is just as well that she did, and she left a little girl, whom I
  promised to look after. That is why I am down here instead of--but I need not
  go into that. Ada is a poor, weakly little thing. And she will never live to
  be grown up. And he doesn't care, he has no heart or feeling of affection for
  anything. All the money he makes he spends on himself. Can't you see how
  cruelly I am placed? And what he said just now about the doctor is all lies.
  He grudges the expense where his own flesh and blood is concerned."</p>

  <p>Who on earth was this girl, Overton wondered. And what was she doing here
  in this God-forsaken spot? And how on earth had that sister of hers come to
  give her heart to a cold-blooded brute like Herring? But he was destined to
  learn all these things in time. Providentially Herring was away for a day or
  two, stirring up strife and discontent at Bristol, and Overton's doctor
  friend was doing his best for the pale, white fragment of humanity which
  would never blossom into robust youth. It was only a question of time, and
  Helen Macgregor heard the verdict with tears in her eyes. After the clumsy
  methods of manhood Overton consoled her. He had been seeing a good deal of
  the girl lately, for the little man with the malaria had been as good as his
  word, and Overton was in regular employment now.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if I'm really sorry," Helen said. "It will be a blessed relief
  when the time comes, and then I can get away from here altogether."</p>

  <p>"You want to go all that badly?"</p>

  <p>"I am aching to turn my back upon it. It has been two years of penal
  servitude for me. I offered to take the child elsewhere, but my
  brother-in-law would not hear of it. If it were not for her I could go back
  tomorrow to the family I left. When my father died I became governess to some
  children in the most delightful household in the world. I was more one of the
  family than a governess. My father had been vicar of the parish. We might
  have all been happy if my sister had not met Mr. Herring. She was always
  strangely romantic, she took a vivid interest in social questions, and she
  made up her mind that Mathew Herring was a great man. Even to the very last
  she regarded him as a kind of Napoleon of labour. She was absolutely blind to
  his coarseness and selfishness. She never saw that he was a dissipated,
  vulgar, dishonest loafer, whose only qualities were impudence and brag, and
  she never realised that he would not have married her at all but for the fact
  that she had inherited a few hundred pounds from a distant relative. And he
  dragged her from the sweetness and refinement of a country home to this
  dreadful spot. He had never been accustomed to anything different--any
  slum-dwelling was good enough for him so long as he could spend his evenings
  in some low public-house over his beer and politics. He never even let me
  know when my sister was dying. I found her here, and she made me promise to
  look after the child. A sordid little story, is it not? But all I can do now
  is to wait for the inevitable end. Then I can go back again to the sunshine
  and the sweetness of the country. But before I go I should like--you won't
  think me vindictive?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know what you would like," Overton said. "And I like you all the
  better for that touch of humanity. It makes me feel that I am not altogether
  in contact with a saint. You would like to see Herring exposed and disgraced.
  You would like to see him made the laughing stock of these poor deluded fools
  whose proudest ambition it is to pay for his beer. Well, I will try and
  manege it for you if I can. It was very nearly being an accomplished fact the
  day I first saw you in that dirty little public-house. There's going to be
  trouble here. I feel quite sure that these men will be all out again within
  the fortnight. And, mind you, they don't want to come. If I could only get
  them to listen to me I'd break Herring in a week. And there's only one way to
  do it."</p>

  <p>Helen Macgregor's eyes gleamed. There was a deep flush on her face. She
  laid her hand on Overton's arm.</p>

  <p>"Oh, if you only could," she whispered. "My heart bleeds for the women and
  children. Mind you, these people have a case. I have lived with them long
  enough to see that. And they would win what they are entitled to if they
  could get rid of the bitter blight that parasites like Herring smother them
  with. And you could do it for them. They have come to like you. And,
  strangely enough, one of the reasons is because you are a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"Do I look like one?" Overton smiled.</p>

  <p>"Yes, you do," the girl said. "In spite of your docker's dress and the
  dirt on your hands and face, there is no mistaking it. I knew it the first
  time we ever met."</p>

  <p>"And you asked yourself no questions, Helen?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I did. I am full of curiosity. And I don't care if you've done
  something wrong. At any rate, you have not been used to the horrors of a
  place like this, and it is fine and noble of you to be getting your own
  living whilst, I daresay, your friends would be ready to help you. Perhaps
  you will tell me some day."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I will that. There's nothing against me. I could walk down Piccadilly
  with my face to the sunshine. Only I've been a fool. Heavens, what a
  fool!"</p>

  <p>He might have told her more, but the whistles began to hoot and bellow,
  and the grimy, dingy bees were stirring in the hive. They were very
  discontented bees just now, sullen and unwilling, and Overton scented the
  trouble from afar off. He marked Herring as he strolled about the docks with
  the air of a dissipated conqueror, he noted the angry gleam in the foremen's
  eyes and the clenching of their fists as Herring swaggered past them. But
  they were utterly powerless, and they knew it. Had the men any sort of
  feeling? Overton asked himself. This sort of thing had been going on for days
  now, and Herring's child lay dying. It was that same evening that Helen came
  to him, quiet and subdued, with the information that the little one's
  sufferings were over.</p>

  <p>"She died an hour ago," she explained, "and Matthew Herring grumbled
  because he would have to find the money for the funeral. Oh, he is a dreadful
  creature! Don't think it hard of me, but I can think of nothing but my
  release from this awful place.. .. Within a day--within an hour----"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know what you mean. But don't go alone. Let us go together. Will
  you call me presumptuous if I tell you that there is a dear old aunt of mine
  who writes to me regularly and who takes the warmest interest in my welfare.
  And I have taken the liberty of telling her all about you. I told her of your
  noble heroism and self-sacrifice. And when you've finished here she wants you
  to go and stay with her for a time."</p>

  <p>"I shall be very glad," Helen said simply. "With the exception of the
  people I used to be with, I have not a friend in the world. And they are
  abroad and will not be back for several weeks. I will wait and go with you,
  Geoffrey."</p>

  <p>The last word dropped quite unconsciously from the girl's lips, and
  Overton smiled.</p>

  <p>"Then let it be Saturday," he said. "When did you say the funeral was to
  be--Thursday afternoon? Oh, yes, I shall be quite ready for you by Saturday
  morning."</p>

  <p>Overton went back to his work with his head high in the air and a set
  determination on his lips. There was going to be trouble by Saturday, of that
  he felt certain. It was late on the Friday afternoon before the smoke gave
  way to the flame, it was one of those silly disputes between capital and
  labour, a touch of harshness on the one side and mistaken pride on the other.
  A sullen murmur ran through the dock and almost before anyone knew what had
  happened a thousand angry men were standing with their hands by their sides,
  and the foreman, almost beside himself with rage, was yelling hoarse commands
  lurid with profanity. Out of the welter of dogged, perspiring humanity came
  Herring, red of face, strident and overbearing.</p>

  <p>"Down tools, lads," he cried. "Outside every one of you. You've got right
  on your side and you will have all the country with you over this job. Within
  a week there won't be a single workman in a single dockyard in Great
  Britain."</p>

  <p>Overton stepped quietly forward.</p>

  <p>"Wait a minute," he said. "You might give the foreman a chance. You might
  wait to hear what he's got to say anyhow. Don't tell me that you are going to
  be influenced by that drunken, swaggering loafer any more."</p>

  <p>He pointed contemptuously at Herring. The latter darted forward, his
  course, red face aflame.</p>

  <p>"Meaning me?" he demanded hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Meaning you, you common, dissipated beer-swiller. You're a liar and a
  thief. You've been robbing these poor fools for years. Yes, and I'm in a
  position to prove it if you like. Regular work and contentment for the lads
  means starvation for you. Here, come, there must be at least five hundred of
  you chaps who have known Matthew Herring for years. But I'll wager a
  sovereign that the oldest-hand here cannot recollect when Herring did an
  honest day's work. Is it a bet."</p>

  <p>He held up the glittering coin between his fingers, and something like a
  sigh went up from the dockers. There was not one of them there who had not
  felt the pinch of hunger at least four times during the past twelve months,
  and very few of them who could not have recollected the loss of a wife or
  child, and all owing to the blighting influence of Matthew Herring. Something
  like a laugh went up, and more then one man in the crowd reached down for his
  tools.</p>

  <p>"Here, drop it," Herring yelled. "Who do you think's speaking to yer? Why
  this chap's a blackleg 'imself."</p>

  <p>"They're going back to work," Overton said quietly.</p>

  <p>Indeed, they looked very much like doing it. Their eyes, were averted from
  Herring: he would, perhaps, have been astonished could he have known the
  deep-rooted hatred that he had inspired in every breast there. In reality it
  seemed to him that this impudent blackleg was defying him on his own ground.
  Well, he would show the dockers what he was made of. He stripped off his coat
  and strode across to where Overton was standing. The latter's heart leapt
  with pure joy. He had but little fear of the conflict. And it pleased him to
  see that Herring had some knowledge of boxing. It was all absolutely
  irregular, not to say idiotic, for the crowd had gathered round, and even the
  strident foreman had forgotten his torrid blasphemy. Herring came on with a
  head-long rush intent upon carrying all before him. Something seemed to move
  something jolted him on the jaw, and, to his own intense surprise, he found
  himself rolling over in the dust. A deep sarcastic cheer rose from the crowd
  and the red danced before his eyes. From that moment there could only be one
  possible result of the fight. The turning agitator was blind with rage, he
  was dead out of condition, and Overton hit him just where and when he
  pleased. The blood was streaming down his face, his left eye was half blind,
  and still Overton refrained from the knock-out blow. He took a particular
  pleasure in punishing this ruffian, a certain savage delight which relieved
  the pent-up feelings of many weeks, and Herring needed no knockout blow. He
  dropped to his knees at length and blubbered like a child.</p>

  <p>"Better get back to work lads," Overton said quietly. "Nice specimen of a
  leader you're got, haven't you? Try a man next time. Here, get up and go
  home."</p>

  <p>He kicked Herring to his feet, and the vanquished orator slunk off without
  another word. There came a harsh command from the ready-witted foreman, and
  in a moment every hand was at work again. All but Overton. He put on his coat
  and left the dock.</p>

  <p>"'Ere, you're not going?" the foreman asked. "I can find you a better job
  if you need it. You're the stuff we want."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've got a job," Overton smiled. "It's not in the docks. It's down at
  a place in Sussex."</p>

  <p>He met Helen next morning. He no longer wore his suit of moleskins; he was
  attired in a neat, well-cut flannel suit and straw hat. Half a dozen women
  gave him a cheer as he stood by the side of the taxicab waiting for Helen.
  She, too, was changed almost beyond recognition. Her eyes were moist and her
  smile unsteady as she put her hand into Overton's.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going now?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"We are going straight away into Sussex," Overton explained. "Down to the
  house I told you about. Extravagant? Oh, I don't know. I have not spent much
  for the last 12 months, and I want to have you all to myself."</p>

  <p>"I heard all about yesterday afternoon," Helen said. "Oh, it was splendid,
  splendid! I loathe violence, but I should like to have been there? Are you
  very shocked?"</p>

  <p>They whirled along away from the misery and humiliation out into the
  country and the sunshine. Then they came at length to a fair old house
  nestling amongst the trees, and here on the balcony, looking across a garden
  so fair and sweet that the tears rose to Helen's eyes, Overton placed her in
  a seat and told his story.</p>

  <p>"I have a confession to make," he said. "This house and small estate
  belongs to me. For the last year my aunt has been looking after it. You will
  see her presently and fall in love with her, as everybody does. But I have
  something to tell you first. Now, do you know that 18 months ago I was one of
  the most selfish, indolent idlers who ever disgraced a good education? My
  father used to say that I had no heart at all, and when he died, somewhere
  about a year ago, he left a strange will. He said I was young and strong
  enough for anything, and that for a whole 12 months I must go away with
  nothing in my pockets and earn my own living. I was not to borrow a penny
  from anyone, and if I failed by a single day, everything was to go to a
  single relation. My word, this last year has been a revelation to me! It took
  the conceit out of me to find how useless I was. I had chances and lost them
  one after another. I knew what it was to be downright hungry. I've slept on
  the Embankment, and the day I first went to the docks I hadn't tasted food
  for 20 hours. Well, I got a job there, and I was only too glad to stick to
  it, and I did stick to it till the year was up, and nearly six weeks more and
  I am a man at last."</p>

  <p>"It was very fine," Helen cried. "But why did you go on after the year was
  up?"</p>

  <p>"You don't know that? Can you look me in the face and tell me you cannot
  guess? Do you think I could part with you now, you who came like a crown to
  my salvation. I brought you here to remain always after we are married, and
  my aunt is looking forward to welcoming you as a daughter. She will be here
  at any moment now. You won't disappoint her, Helen?"</p>

  <p>The girl held out her hand and smiled at Overton through her happy
  tears.</p>

  <p>"Oh," she whispered, "Oh, what a world it is!"</p><br>

  <h3>Published in <i>The Central Queensland Herald</i>, Rockhampton,
  Australia, 12 Oct 1944</h3><br>

  <h2>I</h2>

  <p class="first">THOUGH there was a smile on the girl's face, there was
  something like despair in her heart. It was not the kind of setting either,
  that one associates with misery or unhappiness, for on every side was
  evidence of wealth and luxury and extravagance. As a matter of fact, Evelyn
  Drayton reproached herself with being there at all. Why had she consented,
  she wondered, to give the light of her countenance to people of this class?
  Perhaps it was because she was good-natured; perhaps it was because she had
  not liked to say no. At the same time, she knew perfectly well why she had
  come. She had not seen Cecil Burt lately, and besides, she had heard certain
  strange rumours as to the financial status of himself, and his partner,
  George Lester. They were known to be a somewhat audacious firm. They were
  quite up-to-date in their methods, and prepared to take risks at which a more
  old-fashioned house would have held up its hands in horror. But, then, they
  were both well-known sportsmen, and the commercial world generally was
  getting accustomed to their dashing habits.</p>

  <p>It did not matter so much so far as Lester was concerned, for he had a
  rich old father behind him who would have seen that his son came to no harm.
  With Cecil Burt, however, the case was different. If anything happened to him
  he would have to stand or fall on the merits of the case. There was no one
  likely to come forward and give him a helping hand in case of disaster. There
  was one, but Cecil Burt did not dream that she was interested in his welfare,
  and, for her own reason, Mrs. Cranleigh did not want him to know. The lady in
  question was a widow of considerable means, unconventional enough, and a
  thorough Bohemian in her ways and habits. She was rich and fond enough of
  Cecil Burt, to whom she had decided upon leaving her entire wealth when she
  had done with it. But this was a secret known only to herself and Evelyn
  Drayton, and to the man who had made the volatile old lady's will. As a
  matter of fact, this man was George Lester, for Lester and Burt were partners
  as solicitors, and Lester's father was by way of being one of Mrs.
  Cranleigh's oldest friends. The matter was a profound secret, and Mrs.
  Cranleigh had extracted a promise from Lester that his partner should never
  know how Mrs. Cranleigh's money was to be disposed of.</p>

  <p>This is exactly how matters stood as Evelyn Drayton sat there at that
  interminable evening party, waiting and hoping for a chance to see Burt. The
  rumours had been more persistent the last day or two; they assumed ominous
  form now, and Evelyn was terribly anxious. She might not have cared to
  confess it to herself, but she was very deeply in love with Cecil Burt, and
  it only needed this trouble on his part to disclose the girl's feelings to
  herself. Cecil Burt might have been rash and foolish, he might even have been
  mad enough to speculate with clients' money, but what difference would a fact
  like that make to a girl where her affections were concerned? She had nothing
  or little of her own, but she was none the less desirous of finding some way
  to save Cecil Burt from the disaster which was hanging over him.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she was all the more keen on this because she profoundly disliked
  and distrusted George Lester. She knew perfectly well that the man cared for
  her; in fact, he made no attempt to disguise his feelings. He knew also that
  Burt was a successful rival, and Evelyn had a vague uncanny impression that
  he would not have scruples as to the means of getting Cecil Burt out of the
  way. And Burt was so rash and headstrong too. He was just the kind of man to
  carry on the reckless and hazardous game to the last moment, to run his head
  into the deadly noose, and then, if things failed, to take his own life
  without a moment's hesitation. More than once, in a half jesting way, he
  discussed this matter with Evelyn; but there was no jesting about him when he
  spoke of possible failure. His jaws stiffened then, his eyes had become
  sombre and serious. Perhaps, to a certain extent, the spirit of prophecy was
  upon him. At any rate, Evelyn could not shake off the impression of those
  words. She felt sure enough that Burt had been in deadly earnest.</p>

  <p>The matter was with her now as she sat there listening to the frivolous
  conversation going on about her. Her eyes ached with the glittering gaudiness
  of it all. Besides, it was getting late now, and it did not look as if Cecil
  Burt was going to put in an appearance. Evelyn turned away a little sore and
  disappointed, for she had written an argent note to Cecil Burt saying where
  she should be that evening and expressing a desire to see him. She would have
  passed from the drawing room now, only George Lester came in at the same
  moment and took a seat by her side. There was no mistaking the look of
  admiration in his eyes and the girl coloured now as she noticed it. She half
  rose.</p>

  <p>"I am just going," she said coldly.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't have been in such a hurry if Burt had been here," Lester
  replied. "Sit down a moment."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not." The girl took up the challenge boldly and coolly enough.
  "But then, you see, Cecil is not here. I wrote most particularly to him and
  asked him to meet me, but I suppose he is otherwise engaged, or he does not
  think it worth while."</p>

  <p>"He always was a fool," Lester said cynically.</p>

  <p>"Do you really think so?" the girl asked. "Well, perhaps that is better
  than being a knave. On second thoughts I won't go just yet. There are one or
  two things you can tell me. I am going to ask you plain questions, because I
  am fond of Cecil Burt, and I take a great interest in his welfare. I think
  you ought to know strange rumours are going about as to your firm. I have
  heard them freely mentioned lately. People say that you are in trouble, and
  that--well--that you are using money which is not altogether your own. I give
  it you for what it is worth, and I sincerely hope that there is no truth in
  the scandal."</p>

  <p>Lester laughed unconcernedly.</p>

  <p>"Not so far as I am concerned," he said. "Besides, even if there were, I
  have my father behind me. Still, one never knows, even in an office like
  ours. You see, we both have our separate departments, and if Burt were doing
  anything wrong I should probably be the last to know. Had you not better ask
  him yourself!"</p>

  <p>There was a sneer underlying the question, and Evelyn Drayton resented it
  accordingly. She checked the impulse which rose to the tip of her tongue, and
  smiled bravely.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I am going to do," she said. "But hasn't Cecil Burt
  any friends at all, no expectations?"</p>

  <p>It was Lester's turn now to hesitate. He did so for the fraction of a
  second, but it was not lost upon the girl by his side.</p>

  <p>"So far as I know, none," he said.</p>

  <p>There was something in the reply which excited all the girl's worst fears.
  Professional caution was all very well, but Lester was carrying it a little
  too far. He might, at any rate, have given her a hint, so Evelyn thought, as
  to Mrs. Cranleigh's will in Cecil's favour. There was no need to mention any
  name, but it seemed ominous, to the girl who knew everything, that he was
  concealing this fact so carefully. And again, he had listened with no sort of
  anger or impatience to the suggestion that there was anything wrong with his
  firm. Men of integrity did not usually accept such slander so calmly. In an
  illogical kind of way it occurred to Evelyn that Lester might be laying a
  deliberate trap for his partner. The consequences to Lester would be slight,
  for the simple reason that he had his father behind him. But for Burt they
  might be very serious indeed. It might mean disgrace, the loss of all social
  position, and perhaps dishonour in a gaol. There was not the slightest reason
  why Evelyn should come to these conclusions, but they were gradually being
  forced upon her. She rose now, almost afraid to continue the conversation,
  and moved across the room, with Lester by her side. A newcomer, with a face
  which betrayed excitement, accosted Lester.</p>

  <p>"Is it true?" he asked. "I mean is it true what I heard just now about
  Mrs. Cranleigh? I am told she is dead."</p>

  <p>Lester started uneasily. Evelyn Drayton's heart gave a great leap. She
  checked a sudden feeling of hopelessness of which she was ashamed. But she
  was only thinking about Burt now. At the same time, she was thinking about
  Lester, too and the sudden, unexpected embarrassment in his manner.</p>

  <p>"How should I know!" he stammered.</p>

  <p>"How should you know?" the other man echoed. "Why, you came away from the
  house with Dr. Bryant. I heard him say so. Of course, if you like to make a
  mystery about it, I am sorry I spoke." The speaker passed on, apparently in a
  huff. There was a red flush on Lester's face, and a furtive look in his eyes
  as he turned to Evelyn. Her manner was cold and self-contained, though
  inwardly she was burning. All she wanted now was to be alone to think this
  matter out. If she understood the thing at all Cecil Burt would be free now,
  there would be nothing to prevent him meeting his engagements. But why did
  Lester want to keep it secret? Why should he try and disguise from Burt the
  knowledge that his benefactress was dead. Was it possible that things had
  reached such an acute state--but Evelyn did not care to think of that.</p>

  <p>She would go home at once. She would telegraph Burt to come and see her
  without delay. It was just possible that she might be able to reach him by
  means of the telephone. At any rate, she would not rest an evening until she
  had met the man who was everything to her.</p>

  <p>She reached her own rooms at length. She dismissed her maid and drew the
  curtains close, for it was a chilly evening, and an inviting fire burnt on
  the hearth. There was a pile of letters on the table, and Evelyn turned them
  over carelessly. They might keep for the present, she told herself.</p>

  <p>She was in no mood now for idle gossip and frivolous feminine
  correspondence. She turned the letters over contemptuously with her hand,
  then the colour came into her cheeks and the sparkle to her eyes again.</p>

  <p>Here was a letter from Cecil Burt. She wondered what excuse he had to make
  for not replying to her urgent messages. Her heart beat more joyfully as she
  tore open the envelope.</p>

  <p>But as she read the few words, hastily scrawled upon the sheet of paper,
  the colour left her cheeks and her heart seemed to stand still. There was no
  heading or signature. The wild words were quite enough and pregnant with
  meaning without that.</p>

  <p>"You will never see me again," the message ran. "This is the last message
  I shall write to you or anybody else; for, my dear child, I am ruined beyond
  hope of recovery, I am dishonoured beyond despair. I have been playing with
  money belonging to other people, and my speculations have ended in disaster.
  Lester knows little or nothing about this. I doubt if he would care if he
  did. He will be all right, for his father will see to him, and Lester knows
  by this time; in fact, I saw him tonight. Think the best you can of me, and
  do not forget that with all my faults I loved you with a sincerity and
  passion beyond all words. I can say no more than this. It is my last word and
  thought."</p>

  <h2>II</h2>

  <p class="first">THE next hour or two passed for Evelyn Drayton like a dream.
  There was only one thought uppermost in her mind, and that was that Cecil
  Burt must be saved. For all her thoughts were in a whirl. She saw one thing
  steadily and clearly. She was satisfied now that George Lester had been in a
  position to save this disgrace, to save the loss of life. He had deliberately
  held his tongue. To all practical purposes he would be guilty of Cecil Burt's
  murder. And why had he done this? To Evelyn's mind there was no doubt
  whatever. He had remained silent, knowing that a few hours would see Burt out
  of the way, and the path rendered smooth and easy for himself. It was a
  horrible idea, so horrible that Evelyn could have cried aloud when she
  thought of this black treachery.</p>

  <p>But it was useless to sit there brooding and grieving. There was work to
  be done, and that without delay. Half an hour later Evelyn, closely cloaked
  and veiled, was making her way towards Burt's lodgings in the faint hope of
  finding him there. She had heeded nothing of the fact that the streets were
  now almost deserted, and that more than one belated wayfarer regarded her
  curiously. What did anything matter so long as the life of the man she loved
  was in danger. She came presently to her destination, only to be met with
  disappointment. Burt's discreet manservant raised his eyebrows significantly
  as he saw his visitor, but he was respectful enough. He had not seen Mr. Burt
  all day. The latter had said that he was not coming back, but that if anybody
  wanted him he would be at the office at 10 o'clock tomorrow.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure!" Evelyn asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"I think so, miss," the manservant said. "The master promised to do a
  little thing for me. I don't mind telling you that it is in connexion with an
  almshouse which my mother is looking for. I have never known master neglect a
  promise of that kind."</p>

  <p>Evelyn thanked the man and went away. After all it was a slender chance,
  but there was just a certain amount of hope in it. For Cecil Burt was just
  the kind of man to recollect a promise like that, even in the moment of his
  darkest despair. Where he was and what he was doing in the meantime Evelyn
  would have given much to know. It only remained for her now to pass the time
  as best she could to kill the laden hours till the morning, and then to make
  her way to Lincoln's Inn, where the offices of Lester and Burt were situated.
  There was hope yet.</p>

  <p>Ten o'clock in the morning found Evelyn in Lincoln's Inn. She walked
  boldly into the clerk's room and asked for Mr. Burt. At the same moment
  Lester came out of his own office. He was immaculately dressed, as usual, and
  self-possessed, but he obviously started at the beautiful vision standing
  there in his clerk's office. He had evidently caught the question, for he
  replied to it himself without the slightest hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Burt is not here," he said. "Is there any message I can give him? Perhaps
  you would like to come into my office."</p>

  <p>Evelyn glanced at the clerk to whom she had put the question. She saw
  there was a colour in his face, and that his manner was confused. Evidently
  it was not in the direction of the office, on the ground-glass door of which
  the name of Burt was inscribed in black letters. It seemed to her that she
  could see the shadow of someone looming behind the opaque panels. Then she
  changed her mind and followed Lester. He waved her to a chair. He sat at his
  own desk with the tips of his well-manicured fingers pressed together.</p>

  <p>"This is all unexpected pleasure," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Is it a pleasure?" Evelyn asked coldly. "I doubt it. You are wondering
  why I am here, and I will tell you. Last night I had a strange, unaccountable
  dream which impressed me very much. I thought that some friend of mine had
  been convicted of a crime of which he was innocent, and that he was going to
  be hanged this morning. It seemed to me that the proofs of his innocence came
  into my hands just in time for me to save him. This was a most extraordinary
  dream, because I found out that the governor of the gaol, who was responsible
  for the execution, was himself the guilty party. It was my duty to go down to
  the prison with a reprieve. But when I showed it to the governor in his
  private office he locked me in there so that I was powerless to do anything
  till that judicial murder was accomplished. It was a most vivid dream, for I
  could hear the funeral service being read, and the tolling of the bell. Then
  I battered my hands upon the door till they were raw and bleeding, and the
  clamour I was making awoke me. Now, don't you think that was a strange dream
  for a girl to have?"</p>

  <p>"And you came here to tell me this?" Lester asked.</p>

  <p>"Amongst other things, yes," Evelyn went on. "But I don't think I should
  have dreamt that dream but for the fact that I knew that the man I love was
  in danger. I came here to save Cecil Burt from his own folly and from your
  treachery."</p>

  <p>"Treachery?" Lester said hoarsely; "what do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't palter with me," Evelyn cried. "You know what I mean as well as
  if I had made a deliberate accusation against you. A pretty compliment you
  paid me. It is, indeed, good to think that a man should care for me so much
  that he should deliberately murder his own friend so as to clear the ground
  for himself. I did not think I should ever like to speak to a man in this
  shameless fashion, but this is no time to play with words and hide oneself
  behind a false femininity. Why do you shake your head and smile like that? I
  tell you I know everything, and you know everything, too. You have known for
  days the desperate position in which Cecil Burt stands. You knew that there
  was only one thing that could save him. But you never told him what that one
  thing was--you kept that assiduously to yourself. If you had told him that
  Mrs. Cranleigh was dying----"</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Cranleigh?" Lester echoed. "What has she to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you seem to forget the fact that she was a great friend of mine, and
  she told me what you have known for months. Then sooner or later, every penny
  she possessed would find its way into Cecil Burt's possession. She bound you
  to secrecy as she bound me, and that secret you had a right to respect. But
  when Cecil Burt came to you last night and told you how things were, why did
  you not tell him that there was a means whereby he could have escaped the
  consequences of his folly and lead a better life in future? You could have
  informed him that Mrs. Cranleigh was dying, that it was only a question of
  hours. You could have found him late last night, and let him know that he had
  come into a fortune which would place him beyond the reach of the law. Oh, it
  is a horrible thing to speculate thus on a poor woman's death, to rejoice, as
  it were, that her loss has been another's gain! But, then, we are all human,
  and such thoughts as these will not be denied. At ten o'clock last night you
  knew everything. It was after ten when you saw your partner, and he went away
  with the avowed intention of taking his own life, what time a single word
  from you would have saved him."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," Lester stammered. "I give you my word----"</p>

  <p>"Your word!" Evelyn echoed scornfully. "And what is that worth? A little
  less than nothing. Ring the bell, and tell your clerk to ask Mr. Burt to come
  in here at once! And don't let him know that I am here. Oh, I would have
  spared you this humiliation if I could; but moments are precious, and I am
  wasting valuable time. You will have to sit there and listen to all that I
  have to say. You will have to drink the cup to the dregs. How strange it
  seems! How different is the realisation to one's expectations! At one time I
  would have scorned the idea of giving my affections to a man who was not the
  pink of honour and integrity. And here am I prepared to commit something
  which is not much less than a crime to save a man for whose sake I would
  gladly die. Perhaps, after all, I am no better than either of you.
  Perhaps----"</p>

  <p>The door opened and the clerk came in. A moment later he disappeared and
  Burt walked into the room. He staggered back at the sight of Evelyn. He would
  have retreated had she not darted forward and laid her hand upon his arm. The
  whole room was spinning round the girl now, a red mist floated before her
  eyes. But her voice was firm and steady enough as she spoke again
  presently.</p>

  <p>"You wonder why I am here," she said. "I have been looking for you since
  last night, ever since I received your letter. Let me tell you that our dear
  old friend Mrs. Cranleigh is dead, and that she has left you the whole of her
  fortune. Before you wrote me that letter last night you saw Mr. Lester here
  and told him what you were going to do. He might have informed you then of
  what he already knew--that you were a rich man, and beyond the reach of all
  pecuniary troubles. But he had his own peculiar reasons for remaining silent,
  and I leave you to guess what they were. Heaven knows, I have been through
  humiliation enough already!"</p>

  <p>"For my sake?" Burt asked, with white lips.</p>

  <p>"For your sake. Yes, and perhaps for my own also. Why is it that women
  should never think the less of a man because he has made a false step like
  this? And yet if, on the other hand, the crime was the woman's--but this is
  no time for moralising. Ask Mr. Lester if what I say is not strictly true.
  But there is no occasion to do that because you can read his guilt on his
  face. Months ago Mrs. Cranleigh told me what she was going to do with her
  money, but she bound me to secrecy, and I have always respected her wishes.
  But I knew that your partner knew, because he made the will. At first, for
  professional reasons, he did not tell you. Later on he concealed his
  knowledge for reasons which I prefer not to go into. At any rate, he will
  tell you now that you are free, and that it is only a question of time before
  you are rid of this hateful business altogether. And now, will you kindly
  call a cab for me? I have taxed my strength a little more than I can
  bear."</p>

  <p>Lester sat at his desk in moody silence, whilst Burt procured the cab. His
  face was white and set, but no more so than Evelyn Drayton's features. She
  held out her hand, which Burt barely touched.</p>

  <p>"Come and see me this evening," she said; "I cannot bear to talk of it
  now, in a detestable atmosphere like this. Oh, you need not be afraid--you
  are quite forgiven. When a woman passes her heart over to a man she overlooks
  crime on his part, while she would turn with loathing from another whose
  indiscretions were far more trivial. And try and recollect that you belong to
  me now, and that all I have done is for your sake alone. Call me selfish, if
  you like; perhaps, after all, it is nothing else."</p>

  <p>It was about nine o'clock the same evening that Burt called round at
  Evelyn's rooms. She was seated thoughtfully by the firelight. But for its
  flickering glow the rest of the room was in darkness. She held out a long,
  slim hand to her lover. There was an unsteady smile upon her face. He knelt
  by the side of the low armchair and placed his arms about her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Am I quite forgiven?" he whispered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," the girl smiled through her tears. "It is all very weak on my
  part, and I am not a bit like the heroine I took myself to be. But then, you
  see, I happen to love you, and that makes all the difference. Still, there is
  something to be wiped out, something which will take time to forget. It is in
  your hands, Cecil, and the punishment will be yours if you do not teach me to
  forget."</p>

  <p>"I will try, my dear," the man said, "I will try."</p><br>
