  <h2>I. &mdash; SPEECH-DAY AT HARTON</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;A little bench of heedless bishops there,<br>
  And here a chancellor in embryo.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Shenstone.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT was Speech-day at Harton. From an early hour handsome
  equipages had been dashing down the street, and depositing their occupants at
  the masters&rsquo; houses. The perpetual rolling of wheels distracted the
  attention every moment, and curiosity was keenly on the alert to catch a
  glimpse of the various magnates whose arrival was expected. At the
  Queen&rsquo;s Head stood a large array of carriages, and the streets were
  thronged with gay groups of pedestrians, and full of bustle and
  liveliness.</p>

  <p>The visitors&mdash;chiefly parents and relatives of the Harton
  boys&mdash;occupied the morning in seeing the school and village, and it was
  a pretty sight to observe mothers and sisters as they wandered with delighted
  interest through the scenes so proudly pointed out to them by their young
  escort. Some of them were strolling over the cricket-field, or through the
  pleasant path down to the bathing-place. Many lingered in the beautiful
  chapel, on whose painted windows the sunlight streamed, making them flame
  like jewellery, and flinging their fair shadows of blue, and scarlet, and
  crimson, on the delicate carving of the pillars on either side. But, on the
  whole, the boys were most proud of showing their friends the old school-room,
  on whose rude panels many a name may be deciphered, carved there by the
  boyish hand of poets, orators, and statesmen, who in the zenith of their fame
  still looked back with fond remembrance on the home of their earlier days,
  and some of whom were then testifying by their presence the undying interest
  which they took in their old school.</p>

  <p>The pleasant morning wore away, and the time for the Speeches drew on. The
  room was thronged with a distinguished company, and presented a brilliant and
  animated appearance. In the centre was a table loaded with prize-books, and
  all round it sat the secular and episcopal dignitaries for whom seats had
  been reserved, while the chair was occupied by a young Prince of the royal
  house. On the other side was a slightly elevated platform, on which were
  seated the monitors who were to take part in the day&rsquo;s proceedings, and
  behind it, under the gallery set apart for old Hartonians, crowded a number
  of gentlemen and boys who could find no room elsewhere.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, papa,&rdquo; said a young lady sitting opposite the monitors,
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been asking Walter here which is the cleverest of those
  boys.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ahem! <i>young men</i> you mean,&rdquo; interrupted her elder
  sister.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Walter positively, &ldquo;call them boys; to
  call them young men is all bosh; we shall have &lsquo;young gentlemen&rsquo;
  next, which is awful twaddle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, which of those boys on the platform is the
  cleverest&mdash;the greatest swell <i>he</i> calls it? Now you profess to be
  a physiognomist, papa, so just see if you can guess.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m to look out for some future Byron or Peel among them; eh,
  Walter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old gentleman put on his spectacles, and deliberately looked round the
  row of monitors, who were awaiting the Headmaster&rsquo;s signal to begin the
  speeches.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, haven&rsquo;t you done yet, papa? What an age you are. Walter
  says you ought to tell at a glance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Patience, my dear, patience. I&rsquo;ll tell you in a
  minute.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s pause, &ldquo;that
  boy seated last but one on the bench nearest us has more genius than any of
  them, I should say.&rdquo; He pointed to one of the youngest-looking of the
  monitors, who would also have been the most striking in personal appearance
  had not the almost hectic rose-colour of his cheeks, and the quiet shining of
  his blue eyes, under the soft hair that hung over his forehead, given a look
  of greater delicacy than was desirable in a boyish face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wrong, wrong, wrong,&rdquo; chuckled Walter and his sister.
  &ldquo;Try again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very rarely wrong, you little rogue, in spite of you; but
  I&rsquo;ll look again. No, there can be no doubt about it. Several of those
  faces show talent, but one only has a look of genius, and that is the face of
  the boy I pointed out before. What is his name?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s Home. He&rsquo;s clever enough in his way, but the
  fellow you ought to have picked out is the monitor I fag for&mdash;Bruce, the
  head of the school.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, show me your hero.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There he sits, right in the middle of them, opposite us. There,
  that&rsquo;s he just going to speak now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pointed to a tall, handsome fellow, with a look of infinite self-
  confidence, who at that moment made a low bow to the assembly, and then began
  to recite with much force a splendid burst of oratory from one of
  Burke&rsquo;s great speeches; which he did with the air of one who had no
  doubt that Burke himself might have studied with benefit the scorn which he
  flung into his invective and the Olympian grace with which he waved his arm.
  A burst of applause followed the conclusion of his recitation, during which
  Bruce took his seat with a look of unconcealed delight and triumph.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There, papa&mdash;what do you think of that? Wasn&rsquo;t I right
  now?&rdquo; said the young Hartonian, whose name was Walter Thornley.</p>

  <p>But the old gentleman&rsquo;s only answer was a quiet smile, and he had
  not joined in the general clapping. &ldquo;Is Home to take any part in the
  speeches?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! He&rsquo;s got some part or other in one of the
  Shakespeare scenes; but he won&rsquo;t do it half as well as
  Bruce.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I observe he&rsquo;s got several of the prizes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true. He&rsquo;s a fellow that grinds, you know,
  and so he can&rsquo;t help getting some. But Bruce, now, never opens a book,
  and yet he&rsquo;s swept off no end of a lot, as you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph! Walter, I don&rsquo;t much believe in your boys that
  &lsquo;never open a book,&rsquo; and, as far as I can observe, the phrase
  must be taken with very considerable latitude; I still believe that the boy
  who &lsquo;grinds,&rsquo; as you call it, is the abler boy of the
  two.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Walter,&rdquo; said his brother, an old Hartonian,
  &ldquo;whenever a fellow, who has got a prize, tells you he won it without
  opening a book, set him down as a shallow puppy, and don&rsquo;t believe
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>By this time four of the monitors were standing up to recite a scene from
  the Merchant of Venice, and Home among them; his part was a very slight one,
  and although there was nothing remarkable in his way of acting, yet he had
  evidently studied with intelligence his author&rsquo;s meaning, and his
  modest self-possession attracted favourable regards. But, a few minutes
  after, he had to recite alone a passage of Tennyson&rsquo;s Morte
  d&rsquo;Arthur, and then he appeared to greater advantage. Standing in a
  perfectly natural attitude, he began in low clear tones, enunciating every
  line with a distinctness that instantly won attention, and at last warming
  with his theme he modulated his voice with the requirements of the verse, and
  used gestures so graceful, yet so unaffected, that when with musical emphasis
  he spoke the last lines,&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Long stood Sir Bedivere<br>
  Resolving many memories, till the hull<br>
  Looked one black dot against the verge of dawn,<br>
  And on the mere the wailing died away,&mdash;&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>he seemed entirely absorbed in the subject, and for half a minute stood as
  if unconscious, until the deep murmur of applause startled his meditations,
  and he sat down as naturally as he had risen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well done, old Home,&rdquo; said Walter; while Mr Thornley nodded
  rapidly two or three times, and murmured after him,&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;And on the mere the wailing died away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really, I think Julian did that admirably, did he not?&rdquo; said
  a young and lovely girl to her mother, as Home sat down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By jingo,&rdquo; whispered Walter, &ldquo;I believe these people
  just by us are Home&rsquo;s people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;People!&rdquo; said his sister; &ldquo;what do you mean by his
  people?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, <i>you</i> know, Mary; you girls are always shamming you
  don&rsquo;t understand plain English. I mean his <i>people</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mary smiled, and looked at the strangers. &ldquo;Yes, no doubt of
  it,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that young lady has just the same features as Mr
  Home, only softened a little; more refined they could not be. And
  they&rsquo;ve been hearing all your rude remarks, Walter, no
  doubt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The boy was right, for when the speeches were over, they saw Home offer
  his arm to the two ladies and lead them out into the courtyard, where
  everybody was waiting, under the large awning, to hear the lions of the day
  cheered as they came down the school steps. Bruce was leading the cheers; he
  seemed to know everybody and everybody to know him, and as group after group
  passed him, he was bowing and smiling repeatedly while he listened to the
  congratulations which were lavished upon him from all sides. Among the last
  his own family came out, and when he gave his arm to his mother and descended
  the school steps, one of the other monitors suddenly cried&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Three cheers for the Head of the school.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The boys cordially echoed the cheers, and taking off his hat, Bruce stood
  still with a flush of exultation on his handsome face, in an attitude
  peculiar to him whenever he was undergoing an ovation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pose plastique; King Bruce snuffing up the incense of
  flattery!&rdquo; muttered a school Thersites, standing by.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Green-minded scoundrel,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
  because he beat you to fits in the Latin verse.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How very popular he seems to be, Julian,&rdquo; said Miss Home to
  her brother, as they stood rather apart from the fashionable crowd.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very popular, and, on the whole, he deserves his popularity; how
  capitally he recited to-day,&rdquo; and Julian looked at him and sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now, mother, will you come to lunch?&rdquo; he said;
  &ldquo;you&rsquo;re invited to my tutor&rsquo;s, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went and took a hasty lunch, heartily enjoying the simple and general
  good-humour which was the order of the day; and finding that there was still
  an hour before the train started which was to convey them home, Julian took
  them up to the old churchyard, and while they enjoyed the only breath of air
  which made the tall elms murmur in the burning day, he showed them the
  beautiful scene spread out at their feet, and the distant towers of Elton and
  Saint George. Field after field, filled with yellowing harvests or grazing
  herds, stretched away to the horizon, and nothing on earth could be fairer
  than that soft sleep of the golden sunshine on the green and flowery
  meadowland, while overhead only a few silvery cloudlets variegated with their
  fleecy lustre the expanse of blue, rippling down to the horizon like curves
  of white foam at the edges of a summer sea.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No wonder a poet loved this view,&rdquo; said Mrs Home. &ldquo;By
  the bye, Julian, which is the tomb he used to lie upon?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There, just behind us; that one with the fragments broken off by
  stupid picturesque tourists, with the name of Peachey on it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And so Byron really used, as a boy, to rest under these elms, and
  look at this lovely view!&rdquo; said his sister.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Violet. I wonder how much he&rsquo;d have given, in after-
  life, to be a boy again,&rdquo; said Julian thoughtfully; &ldquo;and have a
  fresh start&mdash;a rejuvenescence, beginning after a summer hour spent on
  Peachey&rsquo;s tomb;&rdquo; and Julian sighed again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Julian,&rdquo; said Violet, gaily rallying him, &ldquo;what
  a boy you are! What business have you to sigh here of all places, and now of
  all times? That&rsquo;s the second time in the course of an hour that
  I&rsquo;ve heard you. Imagine a Harton monitor sighing twice on Speech-day!
  You must be tired of us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did I sigh? Abominably rude of me. I really didn&rsquo;t mean
  it,&rdquo; said Julian; and shaking off the influences which had slightly
  depressed him for the moment, he began to laugh and joke with the utmost
  mirth until it became time to meet the train. He accompanied his mother and
  sister to the station, bade them an affectionate farewell, and then walked
  slowly back, for the beauty of the summer evening made him loiter on the
  way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor Julian!&rdquo; said Violet to her mother when the train
  started; &ldquo;he lets the sense of responsibility weigh on him too much,
  I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Julian was thinking that the next time he came to the station would
  probably be at the end of term, when his schoolboy days would be over. He
  leaned against a gate, and looked long at the green quiet hill, with its tall
  spire and embosoming trees, till he fell into a reverie.</p>

  <p>A slap on the back awoke him, and turning round, he saw the genial, good-
  humoured face of one of his fellow-monitors, Hugh Lillyston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Julian, dreaming as usual&mdash;castle-building, and all that
  sort of thing, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; I was thinking how soon one will have to bid good-bye to dear
  old Harton. How well the chapel looks from here, doesn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;and
  the church towering above it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The chapel being like a fair daughter seated at her mother&rsquo;s
  feet, as your poetical tutor remarked the other day. Well, Julian, I&rsquo;m
  glad we shall leave together, anyhow. Come and have some tea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian went to his friend&rsquo;s room. The fag brought the tea and toast,
  and they spent a merry evening, chatting over the speeches, and the way in
  which the day had gone off. At lock-up, Julian went to write some letters,
  and then feeling the melancholy thought of future days stealing over him, he
  plunged into a book of poems till it was bed-time, being disturbed a good
  deal, however, by the noisy mirth which resounded long after forbidden hours
  from Bruce&rsquo;s study overhead. Bruce was also to leave Harton in a month,
  and they were going up together to Saint Werner&rsquo;s College, Camford. But
  the difference was, that Bruce went up wealthy and popular; Julian, whose
  retiring disposition and refined tastes won him far fewer though truer
  friends, was going up as a sizar, with no prospect of remaining at the
  University unless he won himself the means of doing so by his own success. It
  was this thought that had made him sigh.</p>

  <h2>II. &mdash; JULIAN HOME</h2>

  <p>&ldquo;O thou goddess,<br>
  Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon&rsquo;st<br>
  In these two princely boys; they are as gentle<br>
  As zephyrs blowing beneath the violet,<br>
  Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as fierce,<br>
  Their royal blood enchafed, as the rud&rsquo;st wind<br>
  That by the top doth take the mountain pine,<br>
  And makes him bow to the vale.&rdquo;<br>
  <i>Cymbeline, Act 4, scene 2</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">IT was but recently, (as will be explained hereafter), that
  the circumstances had arisen which had rendered it necessary for Julian Home
  to enter Saint Werner&rsquo;s as a sizar and since that necessity had arisen,
  he had been far from happy. A peculiar sensitiveness had been from childhood
  the distinctive feature of his character. It rendered him doubly amenable to
  every emotion of pleasure and pain, and gave birth to a self-conscious
  spirit, which made his nature appear weaker, when a boy, than it really was.
  While he was at Harton, this self-consciousness made him keenly, almost
  tremblingly, alive to the opinions of others about himself. His
  self-depreciation arose from real humility, and there was in his heart so
  deep a fountain of love towards all his fellows, and so sympathising an
  admiration of all their good or brilliant qualities, that he was far too apt
  to suffer himself to be tormented by the indifference or dislike of those who
  were far his inferiors.</p>

  <p>It was strange that such a boy should have had enemies, but he was sadly
  aware that in that light some regarded him. Had it been possible to
  conciliate them without any compromise in his line of action, he would have
  done so at any cost; but as their enmity arose from that vehement moral
  indignation which Julian both felt and expressed against the iniquities which
  he despised and disapproved, he knew that all union with them was out of his
  power. As a general rule, the best boys are by no means the most popular.</p>

  <p>It was the great delight of Julian&rsquo;s detractors to compare him
  unfavourably with their hero, Bruce. Bruce, as a fair scholar and a good
  cricketer, with no very marked line of his own&mdash;as a fine-looking
  fellow, anxious to keep on good terms with everybody, and with an apparently
  hearty &ldquo;well met&rdquo; for all the world&mdash;cut against the grain
  of no one&rsquo;s predilections, and had the voice of popular favour always
  on his side. While ambition made him work tolerably hard, as far as he could
  do so without attracting observation, the line he took was to disparage
  industry, and ally himself with the merely cricketing set, with some of whom
  he might be seen strolling arm-in-arm, in loud conversation, at every
  possible opportunity. Julian, on the other hand, though a fair cricketer,
  soon grew weary of the &ldquo;shop&rdquo; about that game, which for three
  months formed the main staple of conversation among the boys; and while his
  countenance was too expressive to conceal this fact, he in his turn found
  himself unable to enlist more than a few in any interest for those
  intellectual pursuits which were the chief joy of his own life.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Home, I&rsquo;ve been watching you for the last half-hour,&rdquo;
  said Bruce, one day at dinner, &ldquo;and you haven&rsquo;t opened your
  lips.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had nothing to say.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because, since we came in, not one word has been said about any
  human subject but cricket, cricket, cricket; it&rsquo;s been the same for the
  last two months; and as I haven&rsquo;t been playing this
  morning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, no one wants you to talk,&rdquo; interrupted Brogten, one of
  the eleven, Julian&rsquo;s especial foe. &ldquo;I say, Bruce, did you
  see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was only going to add,&rdquo; said Julian, with perfect good-
  humour, heedless of the interruption, &ldquo;that I couldn&rsquo;t discuss a
  game I didn&rsquo;t see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nobody asked you, sir, she said,&rdquo; retorted Brogten rudely;
  &ldquo;if it had been some sentimental humbug, I dare say you&rsquo;d have
  mooned about it long enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Better, at any rate, than some of your low stories, Brogten,&rdquo;
  said Lillyston, firing up on his friend&rsquo;s behalf.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I like something manly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vice and manliness being identical, then, according to your
  notions?&rdquo; said Lillyston.</p>

  <p>Brogten muttered an angry reply, in which the only audible words were
  &ldquo;confound&rdquo; and &ldquo;milksops.&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Well spoken, advocate of sin and shame;<br>
  Known by thy bleating, Ignorance thy name,&rdquo;</p>

  <p class="first">thought Julian; but he did not condescend to make any
  further answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hate that kind of fellow,&rdquo; said Brogten, loud enough for
  the friends to hear, as they rose from the table; &ldquo;fellows who think
  themselves everybody&rsquo;s superiors, and walk with their noses in the
  air.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder that you will still be talking, Brogten; nobody marks
  you,&rdquo; said Lillyston, treating with the profoundest indifference a
  stupid calumny. But poisoned arrows like these quivered long and rankled
  painfully in Julian&rsquo;s heart.</p>

  <p>Yet no sensible boy would have given Julian&rsquo;s reputation in exchange
  for that of Bruce; for in all except the mean and coarse minority, Julian
  excited either affection or esteem, and he had the rare inestimable treasure
  of some real and noble-hearted friends; while Bruce was too vain, too
  shallow, and too fickle to inspire any higher feeling than a mere transient
  admiration.</p>

  <p>Latterly it had become known to the boys that Julian was going up to Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s as a sizar, and being ignorant of the reasons which decided
  him, they had been much surprised. But the little clique of his enemies made
  this an additional subject of annoyance, and there were not wanting those who
  had the amazing bad taste to repeat to him some of their speeches. There are
  some who seem to think that a man must rather enjoy hearing all the low
  tittle-tattle of envious backbiters.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew he must be some tailor&rsquo;s son or other,&rdquo; remarked
  Brogten.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, Bruce, we shall have to cut him at Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s,&rdquo; observed an exquisite young exclusive.</p>

  <p>Such things&mdash;the mere lispings of malicious folly&mdash;Julian could
  not help hearing; and they galled him so much that he determined to have a
  talk on the subject with his tutor, who was a Saint Werner&rsquo;s man. It
  was his tutor&rsquo;s custom to devote the hour before lock-up on every half-
  holiday to seeing any of his pupils who cared to come and visit him; but as
  on the rich summer evenings few were to be tempted from the joyous sounds of
  the cricket-field, Julian found him sitting alone in his study, reading.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha, Julian!&rdquo; he exclaimed, rising at once, with a frank and
  cordial greeting. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a triumph! A boy actually enticed from
  bats and balls to pay me a visit!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian smiled. &ldquo;The fact is, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  come to ask you about something. But am I disturbing you? If so, I&rsquo;ll
  go and &lsquo;pursue vagrant pieces of leather again,&rsquo; as Mr Stokes
  says when he wants to dismiss us to cricket.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not in the least. I rather enjoy being disturbed during this hour.
  But what do you say to a turn in the open air? One can talk so much better
  walking than sitting down on opposite sides of a fireplace with no fire in
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian readily assented, and Mr Carden took his arm as they bent their way
  down to the cricket-field. There they stopped involuntarily for a time, to
  gaze at the house match which was going on, and the master entered with the
  utmost vivacity into the keen yet harmless &ldquo;chaff&rdquo; which was
  being interchanged between the partisans of the rival houses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a charming place this field is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on a
  summer evening, while the sunset lets fall upon it the last innocuous arrows
  of its golden sheaf. When I am wearied to death with work or
  vexation&mdash;which, alas! is too often&mdash;I always run down here, and it
  gives me a fresh lease of life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian smiled at his tutor&rsquo;s metaphorical style of speech, which he
  knew was in him the natural expressions of a glowing and poetic heart, that
  saw no reason to be ashamed of its own warm feelings and changeful fancies;
  and Mr Carden, wrapped in the scene before him, and the sensations it
  excited, murmured to himself some of his favourite lines&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alas that one<br>
  Should use the days of summer but to live,<br>
  And breathe but as the needful element<br>
  The strange superfluous glory of the air<br>
  Nor rather stand in awe apart, beside<br>
  The untouched time, and murmuring o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er<br>
  In awe and wonder, &lsquo;These are summer days!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall we stroll across the fields, sir, before lock-up?&rdquo; said
  Julian, as a triumphant shout proclaimed that the game was over, and the
  Parkites had defeated the Grovians.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, do. By the bye, what was it that you had to ask me
  about?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve told you before; but
  I&rsquo;m going up to Saint Werner&rsquo;s as a sub-sizar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr Carden looked surprised. &ldquo;Indeed! Is that necessary?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; it&rsquo;s a choice between that and not going at all.
  And what I wanted to ask you was, whether it will subject me to much
  annoyance or contempt; because, if so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Contempt</i>, my dear fellow!&rdquo; said Mr Carden quickly.
  &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he added, after a pause, &ldquo;the contempt of the
  contemptible&mdash;certainly of no one else.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But do you think that any Harton fellows will cut me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unquestionably not; at least, if any of them do, it will be such a
  proof of their own absolute worthlessness, that you will be well rid of such
  acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian seemed but little reassured by this summary way of viewing the
  matter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that no one, (even if they
  don&rsquo;t cut me), will regard my society as a matter of mere tolerance, or
  try an air of condescension.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Julian,&rdquo; said the master; &ldquo;a sub-sizar means
  merely a poor scholar, for whom the college has set apart certain means of
  assistance. From this body have come some of the most distinguished men whom
  Saint Werner&rsquo;s has ever produced; and many of the Fellows, (indeed
  quite a disproportionate number), began their college career in this manner.
  Now tell me&mdash;should you care the snap of a finger for the opinion or the
  acquaintance of a man who could be such an ineffable fool as to drop
  intercourse with you because you are merely less rich than he? Don&rsquo;t
  you remember those grand old words, Julian&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Lives there for honest poverty,<br>
  Who hangs his head and a&rsquo; that?<br>
  The coward slave we pass him by,<br>
  And dare be poor for a&rsquo; that.&rdquo;<br></p>

  <p>&ldquo;And yet, sir, half the distinctions of modern society rest upon
  accidents of this kind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, true! quite true; but what is the use of education if it does
  not teach us to look on man as man, and judge by a nobler and more real
  standard than the superficial distinctions of society? But answer my
  question.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I confess that I should think very lightly of the man
  who treated me in that way; still I should be <i>annoyed</i> very much by his
  conduct.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I really think, Julian,&rdquo; replied Mr Carden, &ldquo;that the
  necessity which compels you to go up as a sizar will be good for you in
  <i>many</i> ways. Poverty, self-denial, the bearing of the yoke in youth, are
  the highest forms of discipline for a brave and godly manhood. The hero and
  the prophet are rarely found in soft clothing or kingly houses; they are
  never chosen from the palaces of Mammon or the gardens of Belial.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They talked a little longer on the subject, and Mr Carden pointed out how,
  at the universities more than anywhere, the aristocracy of intellect and
  character are almost solely recognised, and those patents of nobility
  honoured which come direct from God. &ldquo;After a single term, Julian,
  depend upon it you will smile at the sensitiveness which now makes you shrink
  from entering on this position. At least, I assume that even by that time
  your name will be honourably known, as it will be if you work hard. You must
  never forget that &lsquo;Virtus vera nobilitas&rsquo; is the noble motto of
  your own college.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I <i>will</i> work at any rate,&rdquo; said Julian;
  &ldquo;indeed I <i>must</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But may I ask why you have determined on going up as
  sizar?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, sir. I am far too grateful for all your many kindnesses to
  me, not to tell you freely of my circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And so, as they walked on that beautiful summer evening over the green
  fields, Julian, happy in the quiet sympathising attention of one who was not
  only a master, but a true, earnest, and affectionate friend, told him some of
  the facts to which we shall allude in the retrospect of the next chapter.</p>

  <h2>III. &mdash; A RETROSPECT</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;Give me the man that is not Passion&rsquo;s
  slave,<br>
  And I will wear him in my own heart&rsquo;s core,<br>
  Yea, in my heart of hearts.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Shakespeare.</p><br>

  <p class="first">JULIAN&rsquo;S father was Rector of Ildown, a beautiful
  village on the Devonshire coast. As younger son, his private means were very
  small, and the more so as his family had lost in various unfortunate
  speculations a large portion of the wealth which had once been the
  inheritance of his ancient and honourable house. Mr Home regretted this but
  little; contentment of mind and simplicity of tastes were to him a far deeper
  source of happiness than the advantages of fortune. Immediately after his
  university career he had taken holy orders, and devoted to the genial duties
  of his profession all the energies of a vigorous intellect and a generous
  heart.</p>

  <p>During his first curacy he was happy enough to be placed in the diocese of
  a bishop, whose least merit was the rare conscientiousness with which he
  distributed the patronage at his disposal. Whenever a living was vacant, the
  Bishop of Elford used deliberately to pass in mental review all the clergy
  under his jurisdiction, and single out from amongst them the ablest and the
  best. He was never influenced by the spirit of nepotism; he was never
  deceived by shallow declaimers, or ignorant bigots, who had thrust themselves
  into the notoriety of a noisy and orthodox reputation. The ordinary
  Honourable and Reverend, whose only distinction was his title or his wealth,
  had to look for preferment elsewhere; but often would some curate, haply
  sighing at the thought that obscurity and poverty were his lot for this life,
  and meekly bearing both for the honour of his Master&rsquo;s work, be made
  deservedly happy by at last attaining the rewards he had never sought. Few,
  indeed, were the dioceses in which the clergy worked in a more hopeful
  spirit, in the certainty that the good bishop never suffered merit to pass
  unrecognised; and for talent and industry, no body of rectors could be
  compared to those whom Bishop Morris had chosen from the most deserving of
  the curates who were under his pastoral care.</p>

  <p>Mr Home, after five years&rsquo; hard work, had been promoted by the
  bishop to a small living, where he soon succeeded in winning the warmest
  affection of all his parishioners, and among others, of his squire and
  church-warden, the Earl of Raynes, who, from a feeling of sincere gratitude,
  procured for him, on the first opportunity, the rectory of Ildown.</p>

  <p>Here, at the age of thirty, he settled down, with every intention of
  making it his home for life; and here he shortly after wooed and won the
  daughter of a neighbouring clergyman, whose only dower was the beauty of a
  countenance which but dimly reflected the inner beauty of her heart.</p>

  <p>Very tranquil was their wedded life; very perfect was the peacefulness of
  their home. Under her hands the rectory garden became a many-coloured Eden,
  and the eye could rest delightedly on its lawns and flower-beds, even amid
  that glorious environment of woods and cliffs, free moors and open sea, which
  gave to the vicinity of Ildown such a nameless charm. But the beauty without
  was surpassed by the rarer sunshine of the life within and when children were
  born to them&mdash;when little steps began to patter along the hall, and
  young faces to shine beside the fire, and little strains of silvery laughter
  to ring through every room&mdash;there was a happiness in that bright family,
  for the sake of which an emperor might have been content to abdicate his
  throne. Oh that the river of human life could flow on for ever with such
  sparkling waters, and its margin be embroidered for ever with flowers like
  these.</p>

  <p>Julian was their eldest son, and it added to the intensity of each
  parent&rsquo;s love for him to find that he seemed to have inherited the best
  qualities of them both. Their next child was Violet, and then, after two
  years&rsquo; interval, came Cyril and Frank. The four children were educated
  at home, without even the assistance of tutor or governess, until Julian was
  thirteen years old; and during all that time scarcely one domestic sorrow
  occurred to chequer the unclouded serenity of their peace. Even without the
  esteem and respect of all their neighbours, rich and poor, the love of
  parents and children, brothers and sister, was enough for each heart
  there.</p>

  <p>But the day of separation must come at last, however long we may delay it,
  and after Julian&rsquo;s thirteenth birthday it was decided that he must go
  to school. In making this determination, his father knew what he was about.
  He knew that in sending his son among a multitude of boys he was exposing him
  to a world of temptation, and placing him amid many dangers. Yet he never
  hesitated about it, and when his wife spoke with trembling anxiety of the
  things which she had heard and read about school-life, he calmly replied that
  without danger there can be no courage, and without temptation no real virtue
  or tried strength.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor Julian,&rdquo; said Mrs Home, &ldquo;but won&rsquo;t he be
  bullied dreadfully?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, dear; the days of those atrocities about which you read in
  books are gone by for ever. At no respectable school, except under very rare
  and peculiar circumstances, are boys exposed to any worse difficulties in the
  way of cruelty than they can very easily prevent or overcome.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But then those dreadful moral temptations,&rdquo; pleaded the
  mother.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are very serious, love. But is it not better that our boy
  should learn, by their means, (as thousands do), to substitute the manliness
  of self-restraint for the innocence of ignorance&mdash;even on the very false
  supposition that such an innocence can be preserved? And remember that he
  does not escape these temptations by avoiding them; from the little I have
  seen, it is my sincere conviction that for after-life, (even in this aspect
  alone, without alluding to the innumerable other arguments which <i>must</i>
  be considered), the education of a public school is a far sounder preparation
  than the shelter of home. I cannot persuade our neighbour Mrs Hazlet of this,
  but I should tremble to bring up Julian with no wider experience than she
  allows to her boy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So Julian went to Harton, and, after a time, thoroughly enjoyed his life
  there, and was unharmed by the trials which must come to every schoolboy; so
  that when he came back for his first holidays, the mother saw with joy and
  pride that her jewel was not flawed, and remained undimmed in lustre. Who
  knows how much had been contributed to that glad result by the daily and
  nightly prayer which ever ascended for him from his parents&rsquo; lips,
  &ldquo;Lead him not into temptation, but deliver him from evil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For when he first went to school, Julian was all the more dangerously
  circumstanced, from the fact that he was an attractive and engaging boy. With
  his bright eyes, beaming with innocence and trustfulness, the healthy glow of
  his clear and ingenuous countenance, and the noble look and manners which
  were the fruit of a noble mind, he could never be one of those who pass
  unknown and unnoticed in the common throng. And since to these advantages of
  personal appearance he superadded a quick intelligence, and no little
  activity and liveliness, he was sure to meet with flattery and observation.
  But there was something in Julian&rsquo;s nature which, by God&rsquo;s grace,
  seemed to secure him from evil, as though he were surrounded by an atmosphere
  impermeable to base and wicked hearts. He passed through school-life not only
  unscathed by, but almost ignorant of, the sins into which others fell; and
  the account which his contemporaries might have given of their schoolboy days
  was widely different from his own. He was one of those of whom the grace of
  God took early hold, and in whom &ldquo;reason and religion ran together like
  warp and woof,&rdquo; to form the web of a wise and holy life. Such happy
  natures&mdash;such excellent hearts there are; though they are few and far
  between.</p>

  <p>To Hugh Lillyston Julian owed no little of his happiness. They had been in
  the same forms together since Julian came, and the friendship between them
  was never broken. When Lillyston first saw the new boy, he longed to speak to
  him at once, but respected him too much to thrust himself rudely into his
  acquaintance. During the first day or two they exchanged only a few shy
  words; for Julian, too, was pleased and taken with Lillyston&rsquo;s manly,
  honest look. But both had wisely determined to let their knowledge of each
  other grow up naturally and gradually, without any first-sight vows of
  eternal friendship, generally destined to be broken in the following
  week.</p>

  <p>Lillyston had observed, not without disgust, that two thoroughly bad
  fellows were beginning to notice the newcomer, and determined at all hazards
  to tell Julian his opinion of them. So one day as they left the school-room
  together, he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know Brant and Jeffrey?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; a little,&rdquo; answered Julian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you know them before you came, or anything?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; but they <i>will</i> wait for me every now and then at the door
  of the fourth-form room when I&rsquo;m coming out and I&rsquo;m sure I
  don&rsquo;t want them, but one doesn&rsquo;t wish to seem uncivil, and I
  don&rsquo;t know how to get rid of them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! well, I wouldn&rsquo;t see too much of them if I were
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No? but why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, never mind&mdash;only I thought I&rsquo;d tell you;&rdquo;
  and Lillyston, half-ashamed at having taken this step, and half-afraid that
  Julian might misconstrue it, ran away. Julian, who was little pleased with
  the coarse adulation of Brant and Jeffrey, took his friend&rsquo;s advice,
  and from that time he and Lillyston became more and more closely united. They
  were constantly together, and never tired of each other&rsquo;s society; and
  at last, when their tutor, observing and thoroughly approving of the
  friendship, put them both in the same room, the school began in fun to call
  them Achilles and Patroclus, Damon and Pythias, Orestes and Pylades, David
  and Jonathan, Theseus and Pirithous, and as many other names of <i>paria
  amicorum</i> as they could remember.</p>

  <p>Yet there was many a Harton boy who would have said, &ldquo;Utinam in tali
  amicitia tertius ascriberer!&rdquo; for each friend communicated to the other
  something at least of his own excellences. Lillyston instructed Julian in the
  mysteries of fives, racquets, football, and cricket, until he became an adept
  at them all; and Julian, in return, gave Lillyston very efficient help in
  work, and inspired him with intellectual tastes for which he felt no little
  gratitude in after days. The desire of getting his remove with Julian worked
  so much with him that he began to rise many places in the examinations; and
  while Julian was generally among the first few, Lillyston managed to be
  placed, at any rate, far above the ranks of the undistinguished herd.</p>

  <p>So, form by form, Lillyston and Julian Home mounted up the school side by
  side, and illustrated the noblest and holiest uses of friendship by adding to
  each other&rsquo;s happiness and advantage in every way. I am glad to dwell
  on such a picture, knowing, O holy Friendship, how awfully a schoolboy can
  sometimes <i>desecrate</i> thy name!</p>

  <p>Three years had passed, and they were now no longer little boys, but in
  the upper fifth form together, and Julian was in his sixteenth year. It was
  one March morning, when, shortly after they entered the school-room, the
  school &ldquo;Custos&rdquo; came in and handed to the master a
  letter&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for Mister Home, sir, by telegraph.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The master called Julian, (whose heart beat quick when he heard his name),
  and said to him&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps you had better take it out of the room, Home, before you
  read it, as it may contain something important.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a grateful look for this considerate kindness, Julian took the hint,
  and leaving the room, tore open the message, which was from his
  mother&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear Julian&mdash;Come home <i>instantly</i>; your father is most
  dangerously ill. I cannot add more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The boys heard a cry, and the master made a sign to Lillyston, who had
  already started to his feet. Springing out of the unclosed door, he found
  Julian half-fainting; for his home affections were the very mainsprings of
  his life. He read the message, helped Julian down-stairs, flung a little cold
  water over his face, and then led him to their own study, where he
  immediately began, without a word, to pack up for him such things as he
  thought he would require.</p>

  <p>Lillyston made all the necessary arrangements, and did not leave his
  friend until he had seen him into the railway carriage, and pressed his hand
  with a silent farewell. He watched the train till it was out of sight.</p>

  <p>Then first did Julian&rsquo;s anguish find vent in tears. Passionately he
  longed at least to <i>know</i> the worst, and would have given anything to
  speed the progress of the train, far too slow for his impatient misery. He
  was tormented by remembering the unusually solemn look and tone with which
  his father had parted from him a month before, and by the presentiment which
  at that moment had flashed across him with uncontrollable vividness, that
  they should never meet again. At last, at last they reached Ildown late in
  the evening, just as the flushed glare of crimson told the death-struggle of
  an angry sunset with the dull and heavy clouds. The station was a mile from
  the town, and it was a raw, gusty, foggy evening. There was no conveyance at
  the station, but leaving with the porter a hasty direction about his luggage,
  Julian flew along the road heedless of observation, reached the cliff, and at
  length stood before the rectory door. He was wet, hungry, and exhausted, for
  since morning he had tasted nothing, and his run had spattered him with mud
  from head to heel. It was too dark to judge what had happened from the
  appearance of the house, and half-frantic as he was with fear and eagerness,
  he had yet not dared to give a loud summons at the door, lest he should
  disturb his father&rsquo;s slumber or excite his nerves.</p>

  <p>Ah! Julian, you need not restrain your impetuous dread from that cause
  now&mdash;</p>

  <p>The door opened very quietly, and in reply to Julian&rsquo;s incoherent
  question, the good old servant only shook her head, and turned away to brush
  off with her apron the tears which she vainly struggled to repress. But the
  boy burst into the study where he knew that the rest would be, and in another
  moment his arm was round his mother&rsquo;s neck, while Cyril and Violet and
  little Frank drew close and wept silently beside them both. But still Julian
  knew not or would not know the full truth, and at last he drew up courage to
  ask the question which had been so long trembling on his lips&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is there no hope, mother, no hope?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know then, my boy? Your father is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not <i>dead</i>,&rdquo; said Julian, in a hollow voice. &ldquo;Oh,
  mother, mother, mother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His head drooped on her shoulder the news fell on him like a horrible
  blow, and, stunned as he was with weariness and anxiety, all sense and life
  flowed from him for a time.</p>

  <p>The necessity for action and the consolation of others are God&rsquo;s
  blessed remedies to lull, during the first intolerable moments, the poignancy
  of bereavement. Mrs Home had to soothe her children, and to see that they
  took needful food and rest; and she watched by the bedside of her younger
  boys till the silken swathe of a soft boyish sleep fell on their eyes, red
  and swollen with many tears. Then she saw Violet to bed, and at last sat down
  alone with her eldest son, who by a great prayerful effort aroused himself at
  last to a sense of his position.</p>

  <p>He took her hand in his, and said in a low whisper, &ldquo;Mother, let me
  see him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not now, dearest Julian; wait till to-morrow, for our
  sakes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was the cause of death, mother?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Disease of the heart;&rdquo; and once more the widow&rsquo;s
  strength seemed likely to give way. But this time it was Julian&rsquo;s turn
  to whisper, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s will be done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Next morning Mrs Home, with Julian and Violet, entered the room of death.
  Flowers were scattered on the bed, and on that face, calm as marble yet soft
  as life, the happy wondering smile had not yet even died away. And there
  Julian received from his mother a slip of paper, on which his father&rsquo;s
  dying hand had traced the last messages of undying love and when they had
  left him there alone, he opened and read these words, written with weak and
  wavering pen&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;My own dearest boy, in this world we shall never
  meet again. But I die happy, Julian, for my trust is in God, who cares for
  the widow and the fatherless. And you, Julian, will take my place with
  Violet, Cyril, and dear Frankie&mdash;I need say nothing of a mother to such
  a son. God bless you, my own boy. Be brave, and honest, and pure, and God
  will be with you. Your dying father,</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Henry Home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The last part was almost illegible, but Julian bent reverently over his
  father&rsquo;s corpse, and it seemed that the smile brightened on those dead
  lips as he bowed his young head in prayer.</p>

  <p>Reader, for many reasons we must not linger there. But I had to tell you
  of that death and of those dying words which Julian knew by heart through
  life, and which he kept always with him as the amulet against temptation. He
  never forgot them; and oh! how often in the hours of trial did it seem as if
  that dying message was whispered in his ear, &ldquo;Be brave, and honest, and
  pure, and God will be with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The concluding arrangements were soon made. The family left the rectory,
  but continued to reside at Ildown, a spot which they loved, and where they
  were known and loved. Mr Home had insured his life for a sum, not large
  indeed, but sufficient to save them from absolute penury, and had besides
  laid by sufficient to continue Julian&rsquo;s education. It was determined
  that he should return to Harton, and there try for the Newry scholarship in
  time. If he should be successful in getting this, there would be no further
  difficulty in his going to college, for it was expected that a wealthy aunt
  of his would assist him. His guardians, however, were kind enough to
  determine that, even in case of his failing to obtain the Newry, they would
  provide for his university expenses, although they did not conceal from him
  the great importance of his earnestly studying with a view to gain this
  pecuniary aid. Cyril was sent to Marlby, and Frank, who was but ten years
  old, remained for the present at Ildown grammar school.</p>

  <p>After the funeral Julian returned to Harton with a sadder and wiser heart.
  Though never an idle boy, he had not as yet realised the necessity of
  throwing himself fully into the studies of the place, but had rather given
  the reins to his fancy, and luxuriated in the gorgeous day-dreams of poetry
  and romance. Henceforward, he became a most earnest and diligent student, and
  day by day felt that his intellectual powers grew stronger and more developed
  by this healthier nourishment. At the end of that quarter he gained his first
  head-remove, and Mr Carden rejoiced heartily in the success of his favourite
  pupil.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Julian, you will beat us all if you go on at this rate,&rdquo;
  said he, after reading over the trial verses which Julian asked him to
  criticise after the examination. &ldquo;You always showed taste, but here we
  have vigour too; and for a wonder, you haven&rsquo;t made any
  mistakes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I shall be &lsquo;stumped&rsquo; in the Greek
  &lsquo;Iambi,&rsquo; sir, as Mr Clarke calls them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! well, you must take pains. You&rsquo;ve improved, though, since
  you had to translate Milton&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo; Smoothing the raven down<br>
  Of darkness, till it smiled;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;when, you remember, I gave you a literal version of your
  &lsquo;Iambi,&rsquo; which meant &lsquo;pounding a pea-green fog.&rsquo;
  Eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;I remember too that I rendered
  &lsquo;the moon-beams&rsquo; by &lsquo;the moon&rsquo;s
  rafters.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Mr Carden, laughing, &ldquo;improve in them
  as much as you have in Latin verse, and we shall see you Newry scholar
  yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A thrill of joy went through the boy&rsquo;s heart as he heard these
  words.</p>

  <h2>IV. &mdash; HOW JULIAN LOST A FORTUNE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;Most like a step-dame or a dowager<br>
  Long withering out a young man&rsquo;s revenue.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Shakespeare.</p><br>

  <p class="first">I MUST not chronicle Julian&rsquo;s school-life, much as I
  should have to tell about him, and strong as the temptation is, but another
  event happened during his stay at Harton which affected so materially his
  future years that I must proceed to narrate it now.</p>

  <p>Julian&rsquo;s father had a sister much older than himself, who many years
  before had married a baronet-farmer, Sir Thomas Vinsear of Lonstead Abbey. It
  was certainly not a love match on the lady&rsquo;s side, for the baronet was
  twenty years her senior, and his tastes in no respect resembled hers. But she
  was already of &ldquo;a certain age,&rdquo; and despairing of a lover,
  accepted the good old country squire, and was located for the rest of her
  life as mistress of Lonstead Abbey.</p>

  <p>As long as he lived all was well; Lady Vinsear, like a sensible wife,
  conformed herself to all his wishes and peculiarities, and won in no slight
  degree his gratitude and affection. But he did not long survive his marriage,
  and after a few years the lady found herself alone and childless in the
  solitary grandeur of her husband&rsquo;s home.</p>

  <p>Her brother Henry, the Rector of Ildown, had always been her special
  favourite, and she looked to his frequent visits to enliven her loneliness.
  But she was piqued by his having married without consulting her, and behaved
  so uncourteously to Mrs Home, that for a long time the intercourse between
  them was broken.</p>

  <p>One day, however, shortly before his death, she had written to announce an
  intended visit, and in due time her carriage stood before the rectory door.
  It so happened that it was Julian&rsquo;s holiday-time, and he was at home.
  Changed as the old lady had become by years and disappointment, and the ennui
  of an aimless widowhood, little relieved by the unceasing attendance of a
  confidante, yet Lady Vinsear&rsquo;s childless and withered heart seemed to
  be touched to life again when she gazed on her brother&rsquo;s beautiful and
  modest boy. Courteous without subservience, and attentive without servility,
  Julian, by his graceful and unselfish demeanour, won her complete affection,
  and she dropped to the family no ambiguous hints, that, for Julian&rsquo;s
  sake, she should renew her intercourse with them, and make him her heir.
  Circumstanced as he was, Mr Home could not but rejoice in this determination,
  and the more so from his proud consciousness that not even the vilest
  detractor could charge him with having courted his rich sister&rsquo;s favour
  by open or secret arts. From Julian he would have concealed Lady
  Vinsear&rsquo;s intention, but she had herself made him tolerably aware of
  it, after a fit of violent spleen against Miss Sprong, her confidante, who,
  seeing how the wind lay, had tried to drop little malicious hints against the
  favourite nephew, until the old lady had cut them short, by a peremptory
  order that Miss Sprong should leave the room. That little rebuff the lady
  never forgot and never forgave, and, under the guise of admiration, she
  nursed her enmity against the unconscious Julian until due opportunity should
  have occurred to give it vent.</p>

  <p>Every now and then, Julian, when wearied with study, would be tempted to
  think in his secret heart, &ldquo;What does it matter my working so hard,
  when I shall be master of Lonstead Abbey some day?&rdquo; And then perhaps
  would follow a rather inconsistent fit of idleness, till Mr Carden, or some
  other master, applied the spur again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make you out, Julian,&rdquo; said Lillyston;
  &ldquo;sometimes you grind away for a month like&mdash;like beans, and then
  you&rsquo;re as idle again for a week as the dog that laid his head against a
  wall to bark.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, shall I tell you, Hugh?&rdquo; answered Julian, who had often
  felt that it would be a relief to put his friend in possession of the secret.
  And he told Lillyston that he was the acknowledged heir of his aunt&rsquo;s
  property.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well then,&rdquo; said Lillyston, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why
  I should work either, seeing as how Lillyston Court will probably come to me
  some day. I say, Julian, I vote we both try for lag next trials. It&rsquo;d
  save lots of grind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>All this was brought out very archly, and instantly recalled to
  Julian&rsquo;s mind the many arguments which he had used to his friend,
  especially since his father&rsquo;s death, to prove that, under any
  circumstances, diligence was a duty which secured its own reward; indeed, he
  used to maintain that, even on selfish grounds it was best, for in the long
  run the idlest boys, with their punishments and extras, got far the most work
  to do&mdash;to say nothing of the lassitude that usurps the realm of
  neglected duty, and that disgraceful ignorance which is the nemesis of wasted
  time.</p>

  <p>He burst out laughing. &ldquo;You have me on the hip, Hugh, and I give in.
  In proof whereof, here goes the novel I&rsquo;m reading; and I&rsquo;ll at
  once set to work on my next set of verses;&rdquo; whereon Julian pitched his
  green novel to the top of an inaccessible cupboard, got down his Elegiacs for
  the next day, and had no immediate recurrence of what Lillyston christened
  the &ldquo;pudding theory of work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was during his last year at Harton that Lady Vinsear, in consequence of
  one of her sudden whims, wrote to invite him to Lonstead, with both his
  brothers; for she never took any notice of either Violet or Mrs Home. The
  time she mentioned was ten days before the Harton holidays began. So that
  Frank and Cyril, (who came back from Marlby just in time), had to go alone,
  rather to their disgust; Julian, however, promising to join them directly
  after he returned from school. The wilful old lady, urged on by the
  confidante, took considerable umbrage at this, and wrote that &ldquo;she was
  quite sure the Doctor would not have put any obstacles in the way of
  Julian&rsquo;s coming had he been informed of <i>her</i> wishes. And as for
  trials, (the Harton word for examination), which Julian had pleaded in
  excuse, he had better take care that, in attending to the imaginary trials of
  Harton, he didn&rsquo;t increase his own real trials.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This sentence made Julian laugh immoderately, both from his aunt&rsquo;s
  notion of the universal autocracy of <i>her</i> will, and from her obvious
  bewilderment at the technical word &ldquo;Trials,&rdquo; which had betrayed
  her unconsciously into a pun, which, of all things, she abhorred. However, he
  wrote back politely&mdash;explained what he meant by
  &ldquo;Trials&rdquo;&mdash;begged to be excused for a neglect of her wishes,
  which was inevitable&mdash;and reiterated his promise of joining his
  brothers, as early as was feasible, under her hospitable roof.</p>

  <p>It was not without inward misgiving that Cyril and Frank found themselves
  deposited in the hall of their glum old aunt&rsquo;s large and lonely house,
  the very size and emptiness of which had tended not a little to increase the
  poor lady&rsquo;s vapours. However, they were naturally graceful and
  well-bred, so that, in spite of the patronising empire assumed over them by
  the vulgar and half-educated Miss Sprong&mdash;which Cyril especially was
  very much inclined to resent&mdash;the first day or two passed by with
  tolerable equanimity.</p>

  <p>But this dull routine soon proved unendurable to the two lively boys. They
  found it impossible to sit still the whole evening, looking over sacred
  prints; and this was the only amusement which Miss Sprong suggested to Lady
  Vinsear for them. Of late the dowager had taken what she considered to be a
  religious turn; but unhappily the supposed religion was as different from
  real piety as light from darkness, and consisted mainly in making herself and
  all around her miserable by a semi-ascetic puritanism of observances, and a
  style of conversation fit to drive her little nephews into a lunatic
  asylum.</p>

  <p>Though they both felt a species of terror at their ungracious aunt, and
  the ever-detonating Miss Sprong, the long-pent spirit of fun at times grew
  too strong in them, and they would call down sharp rebukes by romping in the
  drawing-room, so as to disturb the two ladies while they read to each other,
  for hours together, the charming treatises of their favourite moderate
  divine.</p>

  <p>The boys were seated on two stools, in the silence of despair, and at last
  Cyril, who had been twirling his thumbs for half an hour, and listening to a
  dissertation on Armageddon, gave a yawn so portentous and prolonged that
  Frank suddenly exploded in a little burst of laughter, which was at once
  checked, when Miss Sprong observed&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think it would be profitable if your ladyship,&rdquo;&mdash;Miss
  Sprong never omitted the title&mdash;&ldquo;would set your nephews some of
  Watts&rsquo; hymns to learn.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The nephews protested with one voice and much rebellion, but at last their
  irate aunt quenched the unseemly levity, and they were fairly set to work at
  Dr Watts&mdash;Frank getting for his share &ldquo;The little busy bee.&rdquo;
  But instead of learning it, they got together, and Cyril began drawing
  pictures of cruet-stands and other impieties, whereby Frank was kept in fits
  of laughter, and when called up to say his hymn, knew nothing at all about
  it. Cyril sat by him, and when Frank had exhausted his stock of acquirements
  by saying, in a tone of disgust&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;How doth the little busy bee&mdash;&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Cyril suggested&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Delight to bark and bite.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;How doth the little busy bee<br>
  Delight to bark and bite&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;How <i>does</i> it go on, Cyril?&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;To gather honey all the day,<br>
  And eat it all the night,&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p class="first">whispered the audacious brother, conjuring into memory the
  schoolboy version of that celebrated poem.</p>

  <p>Frank, who was far too much engrossed in his own difficulties to think of
  what he was saying, artlessly repeated the words, and opened his large eyes
  in amazement, when he was greeted by a shout of laughter from Cyril, and a
  little shriek of indignation from Miss Sprong, which combined sounds started
  Lady Vinsear from the doze into which she had fallen, and ended in the
  summary ejectment of the young offenders.</p>

  <p>The next day, to their own great relief and delight, they were sent home
  in disgrace; and knowing that their mother would not be angry with them for a
  piece of childish gaiety under such trying circumstances, they were surprised
  and pained to see how grave she and Violet looked when they told their story.
  But Mrs Home&rsquo;s thoughts had reverted to Julian, and she knew Miss
  Sprong too well not to be aware that she had designs on Lady Vinsear&rsquo;s
  property, and would excite against Julian any ill-will she could.</p>

  <p>That her fears were not unfounded was proved by the fact that, in the
  middle of trial-week, Julian received an altogether intolerable epistle from
  Miss Sprong, written, she said, &ldquo;at the express request and dictation
  of his esteemed aunt,&rdquo; calling him to account for this little incident
  in a way that, (to use Lillyston&rsquo;s expression), instantly &ldquo;put
  him on his hind legs.&rdquo; He read a part of this letter to Lillyston, and,
  with his own comments, it ran thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Lady Vinsear desires me to say,&rdquo; (Hem! I doubt
  that very much), &ldquo;that the rudeness of those two little boys, to say
  nothing of their great immorality and impiety,&rdquo; (I say, that&rsquo;s
  coming it too strong, or rather too <u>Sprong</u>), &ldquo;is such as to
  reflect great discredit on the influences to which they have been
  <u>lately</u>&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By Jove! this is too bad,&rdquo; said Julian, passionately;
  &ldquo;when she adds innuendoes against my mother to her other malice&mdash;I
  won&rsquo;t stand it,&rdquo; and, without reading farther, he tossed the
  letter into the fire, watching with vindictive eyes its complete
  consumption&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;There goes the squire&mdash;revered, illustrious
  spark!<br>
  And there&mdash;no less illustrious&mdash;goes the clerk!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p class="first">he said, as he watched the little red streams flickering out
  of the black paper ashes. &ldquo;And now for the answer! Bother the woman for
  plaguing me, (for I know it&rsquo;s none of my aunt&rsquo;s handiwork), in
  the middle of trial-week.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, Julian, don&rsquo;t be too fiery in your answer, you know,
  for you really ought to appease the poor old lady. Only think of that
  impudent little brother of yours! I must make the young rogue&rsquo;s
  acquaintance some day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Julian had seized a sheet of note-paper, and wrote to his aunt, not
  condescending to notice even by a message her obnoxious
  amanuensis:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;My Dear Aunt&mdash;I cannot believe that the letter
  I received to-day really emanated from you, at least not in the language in
  which it was couched.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;I have neither time nor inclination,&rdquo;
  (&lsquo;Hoity, toity, how grand we are!&rsquo;) &ldquo;to attend to the
  foolish trifle to which your amanuensis,&rdquo; (&lsquo;Meaning me!&rsquo;
  screamed the irrepressible Sprong), &ldquo;alludes; but I am quite sure that,
  on reflection, you will not be inclined to judge too hardly a mere piece of
  fun and thoughtless liveliness; for that Frankie meant to be rude, I
  don&rsquo;t for a moment believe. I shall only add, that if I were not
  convinced that <i>you</i> can never have sanctioned the expressions which the
  lady,&rdquo; (Julian had first written &lsquo;person,&rsquo; but altered it
  afterwards), &ldquo;who wrote for you presumed to apply to my brothers, and
  above all, to my mother, I should have good reason to be offended; but
  feeling sure that they are not attributable to you, I pass them over with
  indifference. I am obliged to write in great haste, so here I must
  conclude.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Believe me, my dear Aunt, your affectionate
  nephew,</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Julian Home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lady Vinsear was secretly pleased with the spirit which this letter
  showed, and was not sorry for the snubbing which it gave to her
  lady-companion; but she determined to exercise a little tyranny, and fancied
  that Julian would be too much frightened to resent it. Accustomed to the
  legacy-hunting spirit of many parasites, the old lady thought that Julian
  would be like the rest, and hoped to enjoy the sight of him reduced to
  submission and obedience, in the hopes of future advantage; not that she
  would exult in his humiliation, but she was glad of any pretext to bring the
  noble boy before her as a suppliant for her favour. Accordingly, setting
  aside her first and better impulses, she wrote back a sharp reply, abusing
  Cyril and Frank in round and severe terms, and adding some bitter innuendoes
  about the poverty of the family, and their supposed expectations at her
  decease. Miss Sprong lent all the venom of her malicious ingenuity to this
  precious performance, which fortunately did not reach Julian until trials
  were nearly over. Tired with excitement and hard work, the boy could ill
  endure these galling allusions, and wrote back a short and fiery
  reply:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;My Dear Aunt&mdash;If any one has persuaded you that
  I am eager to purchase your good-will at any sacrifice, and that in
  consideration of &lsquo;supposed advantages&rsquo; hereafter to be derived
  from you&mdash;I shall be willing to endure unkindly language or groundless
  insinuations about my other relatives&mdash;then they have very seriously
  misled you as to my real character. This is really the only reply of which
  your letter admits. I shall always be ready, as in duty bound, to bestow on
  you such respect and affection as our relationship demands and your own
  kindness may elicit, but I would scorn to win your favour at the expense of a
  subservience at once ungenerous and unjust.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Believe me to remain, your affectionate nephew,</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Julian Home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This letter decided the matter. Lady Vinsear wrote back, that as he
  obviously cared nothing about her, and did not even treat her with ordinary
  deference, she had that day altered her will. Poor old lady! Julian&rsquo;s
  angry letter cost her many a pang; and that night, as she sat in her bedroom
  by her lonely hearth, and thought over her dead brother and this gallant
  high-souled boy of his, the tears coursed each other down her furrowed
  cheeks, and she could get no rest. At last she had taken her desk, and, with
  trembling hands, written:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Dearest Julian&mdash;Forgive an old woman&rsquo;s
  whim, and come to me and comfort my old age. All I have is yours, Julian; and
  I love you, though I wrote to you so bitterly.&mdash;Your loving aunt,</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Caroline Vinsear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But when morning came, Sprong resumed her ascendency, and by raking up and
  blowing the cooled embers of her patroness&rsquo; wrath, succeeded once more
  in fanning them to the old red heat, after which she poured vinegar upon
  them, and they exploded in the pungent fumes of the note which told our hero
  that he was not to hope, for the future, to be one day owner of a handsome
  fortune.</p>

  <p>Of course, at first he was a little downcast; and in talking to Lillyston,
  compared himself to Gautier sans avoir, and &ldquo;Wilfred the
  disinherited.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Julian; it matters very little to <i>you</i>,&rdquo;
  said Lillyston proudly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anyhow I must have no more fits of idleness,&rdquo; answered
  Julian.</p>

  <p>And indeed the only pain it caused him arose from the now necessary
  decision that he must go to Saint Werner&rsquo;s College <i>as a sizar</i>,
  or not at all. But for all that he went home with a light heart, and had once
  more gained the proud distinction of head-remove&mdash;one for which, at that
  time, I very much doubt whether he would have exchanged the prospect of a
  rich inheritance.</p>

  <p>And the misfortune proved an advantage to Cyril too, as we shall see.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So here&rsquo;s the little rogue who has lost me a thousand a
  year,&rdquo; said Julian laughingly, when he got home, and took Cyril on his
  knee by the fireside after dinner. The next moment he was very sorry he had
  said it, for Cyril hung his head, and seemed quite disconcerted; but his
  brother laughed away his sorrow, as he thought, and no further allusion to
  the subject was made.</p>

  <p>But that night, as Julian looked into his brother&rsquo;s bedroom before
  he went to bed, he found Cyril crying, and his pillow wet with tears.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cyril, what&rsquo;s the matter, my boy?&mdash;you&rsquo;re not ill,
  are you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cyril sat up, his eyes still swimming, and threw his arms round his
  brother&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve ruined you, Julian,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear child, what nonsense! Nay, my foolish little fellow,&rdquo;
  answered Julian, &ldquo;this is really a mistake of yours. Aunt Vinsear was
  angry with me for my letters,&mdash;not with you. Don&rsquo;t cry so, Cyril,
  for I really don&rsquo;t care a rush about it; but I shall care if it vexes
  you. But shall I tell you why you ought to know of it, Cyril?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because, my boy, it affects you too. You know, Cyril, that we are
  very poor now. Well, you see we shall have to support ourselves hereafter,
  and mother and Violet depend on us so you must work hard, Cyril, will you?
  and don&rsquo;t be idle at Marlby, as I&rsquo;m afraid you have been. Eh, my
  boy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The boy promised faithfully, and performed the promise well in after days;
  but that night Julian did not leave him until he was fast asleep.</p>

  <p>We shall tell only one more scene of Julian&rsquo;s Harton life, and that
  very briefly.</p>

  <p>It is a glorious summer afternoon; four o&rsquo;clock bell is just over,
  and it is expected that in a few minutes the examiner, (an old Hartonian and
  senior classic), will read out the list which shall give the result of many
  weeks&rsquo; hard work. The Newry scholarship is to be announced at the same
  time: Bruce and Home are the favourite names.</p>

  <p>A crowd of boys throng round the steps, but Julian is not among them; he
  is leaning over the rails of the churchyard, under the elm-trees by
  Peachey&rsquo;s tomb, filled with a trembling and almost sickening anxiety.
  Bruce, confident of victory, is playing racquets, just below the
  schoolyard.</p>

  <p>The Examiner suddenly appears from the speech-room door. There is a
  breathless silence while he reads the list, and then announces, in an
  emphatic voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Newry scholarship is adjudged to Julian Home!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Off darts Lillyston, bounds up the hill into the churchyard, and has
  informed the happy Julian of his good fortune long before the &ldquo;three
  cheers for Mr Burton,&rdquo; and &ldquo;three cheers for Home,&rdquo; have
  died away.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;So soon the boy a youth, the youth a man,<br>
  Eager to run the race his fathers ran.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Rogers&rsquo; <i>Human Life</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE last day at Harton came; the last chapel-service in that
  fair school fabric; the last sermon, &ldquo;Arise, let us go hence;&rdquo;
  the last look at the churchyard and the fourth-form room; the last
  &ldquo;Speecher,&rdquo; and delivering up of the monitor&rsquo;s keys; the
  last farewells to Mr Carden and the other masters, and the Doctor, and their
  schoolfellows and fags; and then with swelling hearts Julian and Lillyston
  got into the special train, thronged with its laughing and noisy passengers,
  and during the twenty minutes which were occupied by their transit to London,
  were filled with the melancholy thought that the days of boyhood were over
  for ever.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Frank,&rdquo; said Julian&mdash;&ldquo;To-morrow, to
  fresh fields and pastures new.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Julian. We must meet next at Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mind you write meanwhile.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right. You shall hear in a week. Good-bye.&rdquo; And Lillyston
  nodded from the cab window his last farewell to Julian Home, the Harton
  boy.</p>

  <p>But if there were partings, what glorious meetings there were too, during
  those twenty-four hours. Ah! they must be felt, not written of: but I am sure
  that no family felt a keener joy that day, than Julian&rsquo;s mother, and
  sister, and brothers, when they saw him again, and learnt with pride that he
  had won a scholarship of 100 pounds a year; even Will and Mary, the faithful
  servants, seemed, when they heard it, to look up to their young master with
  even more honour than before.</p>

  <p>Bruce spent the first part of his holidays in shooting, and the latter
  weeks in all the gaieties of a wealthy London family. He was naturally self-
  indulgent, and as no one urged him to make good use of his time, he devoted
  it to every possible amusement which riches could procure. Both he and his
  parents had a boundless belief in his natural abilities, and these, he
  thought, would be quite sufficient to gain him such honours as should be a
  graceful addition to the public reputation which he intended to win. A week
  or two before the Camford term commenced, he engaged some splendid lodgings,
  the most expensive which he heard of, and, turning out the furniture which
  was usually let with them, gave an almost unlimited order to a fashionable
  upholsterer to see them fitted out with due luxury and taste. When he came up
  as a freshman, which he deferred doing until the last possible moment, he was
  himself amazed to see how literally his orders had been obeyed. The rooms
  were refulgent with splendour: glossy tables, velvet-cushioned chairs, Turkey
  carpets, rich curtains, and an abundance of mirrors, made them, as the
  tradesman remarked &ldquo;fit for a lord;&rdquo; and Bruce took possession,
  with no little pride and self-satisfaction at finding himself his own master
  in so brilliant an abode.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the holidays had passed by with Julian very differently, but
  very happily. Without tiring himself, or harassing his attention by study, he
  made a rule of devoting to work some portion, at least, of every day. Long
  strolls with his mother and sister in the bright summer evenings, bathes and
  boating excursions with Cyril and Frank, and happy, lonely rambles on the
  beach, kept him in health and spirits, and he looked forward with eager
  ambition to the arena which he was so soon to enter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Harton boys have gone back by this time, haven&rsquo;t
  they?&rdquo; asked Violet, as she sat with her mother and brother on the lawn
  one afternoon. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish you were there again with them,
  Julian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t exchange Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s man even for Harton boy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How soon shall you have to go up to Saint Werner&rsquo;s?&rdquo;
  said Mrs Home.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On October 15th; in about a fortnight&rsquo;s time. I mean to go up
  a day or two beforehand to get settled. You and Violet must come with me,
  mother.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But is that usual? Won&rsquo;t you get laughed at as though you
  were coming up under female escort?&rdquo; asked Violet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh! you don&rsquo;t suppose I care for that,&rdquo; said Julian,
  &ldquo;even supposing it were likely to be true; besides&mdash;&rdquo; He
  said no more, but his proud look at his sister&rsquo;s face seemed to imply
  that he expected rather to be envied than laughed at.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, they went up together, and, as the train drew nearer and
  nearer to Camford, all three grew silent and thoughtful. They were rightly
  conscious that on the years to be spent in college life depended no small
  part of Julian&rsquo;s future happiness and prosperity. Three years at least
  would be spent there; years wealthy with all blessing, or prolific of evil
  and regret.</p>

  <p>It was night when they arrived, and in the dimly-lighted streets there was
  not enough visible to gratify Julian&rsquo;s eager curiosity. The omnibus was
  crowded with undergraduates, who were chiefly freshmen, but apparently
  anxious to seem very much at home. At the station, the piles of luggage
  seemed interminable, and Mrs Home and Violet were not sorry to escape from
  the unusual confusion to the quiet of their hotel.</p>

  <p>Next morning, directly after an impatient breakfast, Julian started to
  call on his tutor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which is the way to Saint Werner&rsquo;s College?&rdquo; he asked
  of the waiter.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Straight along, sir,&rdquo; was the reply, and off he started down
  King&rsquo;s Parade. In his hurry to make the first acquaintance with his new
  college, Julian hardly stopped to admire the smooth green quadrangle and
  lofty turrets of King Henry&rsquo;s College, or Saint Mary&rsquo;s, or the
  Senate House and Library, but strode on to the gate of Saint Werner&rsquo;s.
  Entering, he gazed eagerly at the famous great court, with its chapel, hall,
  fountain, and Master&rsquo;s lodge; and then made his way through the
  cloisters of Warwick&rsquo;s Court to his tutor&rsquo;s rooms.</p>

  <p>On entering, he found himself in a room, luxuriously furnished, and full
  of books. In a large armchair before the fire sat a clergyman, whom Julian at
  once conjectured to be Mr Grayson, the tutor on whose &ldquo;side&rdquo; he
  was entered. He was a tall, grave-looking man, of about forty, and rose to
  greet his pupil with a formal bow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr &mdash;? I did not quite catch the
  name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Home, sir,&rdquo; said Julian, advancing to shake hands in a
  cordial and confiding manner; but the tutor contented himself with a very
  cold shake, and seemed at a loss how to proceed.</p>

  <p>Julian was burning with curiosity and eagerness. He longed to ask a
  hundred questions; at such a moment&mdash;a moment when he first felt how
  completely he had passed over the boundary which divides boyhood from
  manhood, he yearned for a word of advice, of encouragement, of sympathy. He
  expected, at least, something which should resemble a welcome, or a direction
  what to do. Nothing of the kind, however, came. While Julian was awaiting
  some remark, the tutor shuffled, hemmed, and looked ill at ease, as though at
  a loss how to begin the conversation.</p>

  <p>At last Julian, in despair, asked, &ldquo;Whereabouts are my rooms,
  sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, the porter will show you; you&rsquo;ll find no difficulty about
  them,&rdquo; said the tutor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you anything further to ask me, Mr Home?&rdquo; he inquired,
  after another little pause.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing whatever, sir,&rdquo; said Julian, a little indignantly,
  for he began to feel much like what a volcano may be supposed to do when its
  crater is filled with snow. &ldquo;Have you anything to tell me,
  sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Mr Home. I hope you&rsquo;ll&mdash;that is&mdash;I
  hope&mdash;good morning,&rdquo; he said, as Julian, to relieve him from an
  unprofitable commonplace, backed towards the door, and made a formal bow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; thought Julian. &ldquo;What an icicle; not much good
  to be got out of that quarter. An intolerably cold reception. It&rsquo;s odd,
  too, for the man must have heard all about me from Mr Carden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As we shall have very little to do with Mr Grayson, we may here allow him
  a cordial word of apology. What was to Julian the commencement of an epoch,
  was, be it remembered, to the tutor a commonplace and almost everyday event.
  The whole of that week he had been occupied in receiving visits from
  &ldquo;the early fathers,&rdquo; who came up in charge of their sons, and all
  of whom seemed to expect that he would show the liveliest and tenderest
  interest in their respective prodigies. Other freshmen had visited him
  unaccompanied, and some of them seemed rather inclined to patronise him than
  otherwise. He was a shy man, and always had a painful suspicion at heart that
  people were laughing at him. Having lived the life of a student, he had never
  acquired the polished ease of a man of the world, and had a nervous dread of
  strangers. His manners were but an icy shield of self-defence against
  ridicule, and they suited his somewhat sensitive dignity. He persuaded
  himself, too, that the &ldquo;men&rdquo; on his side were &ldquo;men&rdquo;
  in years and discretion as well as name, and that they must stand or fall
  unaided, since the years of boyish discipline and school constraint were gone
  by. It never occurred to him that a word spoken in due season might be of
  incalculable benefit to many of his charge. Being a man of slow
  sensibilities, he could not sympathise with the enthusiastic temperament of
  youths like Julian, nor did he ever single out one of his pupils either for
  partiality or dislike. Yet he was thoroughly kind-hearted, and many
  remembered his good deeds with generous gratitude. Nor was he wholly wrong in
  his theory that a tutor often does as much harm by meddling interference as
  he does by distance and neglect.</p>

  <p>When a boy goes to college, eager, quick, impetuous, rejoicing as a giant
  to run his course, he is generally filled with noble resolutions and
  elevating thoughts. There is a touch of flame and of romance in his
  disposition; he feels himself to be the member of a brotherhood, and longs to
  be a distinguished and worthy one; he is anxious for all that is grand and
  right, and yearns for a little sympathy to support his determination and
  enliven his hopes. Some there may be so dull and sensual, so swallowed up in
  selfishness and conceit, so chill to every generous sentiment, and callous to
  every stirring impulse, that they experience none of this; their sole aim is,
  on the one hand to succeed, or on the other, to amuse and gratify themselves,
  to cultivate all their animal propensities, and drown in the mud-honey of
  premature independence the last relics of their childish aspirations. With
  men like this, to dress showily, to drive tandem and give champagne
  breakfasts, comes as a matter of course; while their supremest delight is to
  wander back to their old school, in fawn-coloured dittos, and with a cigar in
  their mouths, to show their superiority to all sense of decency and good
  taste. But these are the rare exceptions. However much they may conceal their
  own emotions, however dead and cynical, and contemptible they may grow in
  after days, there are few men of ordinary uprightness who do not feel a
  thrill of genuine enthusiasm when they first enter the walls of their
  college, and who will not own it without a blush.</p>

  <p>Now Julian was an enthusiast by nature and temperament; all the sentiments
  which we have been describing he felt with more than ordinary intensity. It
  gave a grandeur to his hopes, and a distinct sense of ennobling pleasure to
  remember that he was treading the courts which generations of the good and
  wise had trodden before him, and holding in his hand the torch which they had
  handed down to him. <i>Their</i> memory still lingered there, and he trusted
  that <i>his</i> name too might in after days be not wholly unremembered. At
  least he would strive, with a godlike energy, to fail in no duty, and to
  leave no effort unfulfilled. If he viewed his coming life too much in its
  poetical aspect, at least his glowing aspirations and golden dreams were
  tempered with a deep humility and a childlike faith.</p>

  <p>After fuming a little at the icy reception which his tutor had given him,
  he walked up and down the court, thinking of his position, and his
  intentions&mdash;of the past, the present, and the future&mdash;until proud
  tears glistened in his eyes. It was clear to him that now he would have to
  stand alone amid life&rsquo;s trials, and alone face life&rsquo;s
  temptations. And he was ready for the struggle. With God&rsquo;s help he
  would not miss the meaning of his life, but take the tide of opportunity
  while it was at the flood.</p>

  <p>Before rejoining his mother, he determined to call on one of the junior
  fellows, the only one with whom he had any acquaintance, the Reverend N
  Admer. He only knew him from a casual introduction; but Mr Admer had asked
  him to call, on his arrival at Saint Werner&rsquo;s, and Julian hoped both to
  get some information from him to dissipate the painful feeling of strangeness
  and novelty, and also partially to do away with the effect of Mr
  Grayson&rsquo;s coldness.</p>

  <p>Although it was now past ten in the morning, he found Mr Admer only just
  beginning breakfast, and looking tired and lazy. He was received with a
  patronising and supercilious tone, and the Fellow not only went on with his
  breakfast, but occasionally glanced at a newspaper while he talked. Not that
  Mr Admer at all meant to be unkind or rude, but he hated enthusiasm in every
  shape; he did not believe in it, and it wearied him&mdash;hence freshmen
  during their first few days were his profound abhorrence.</p>

  <p>After a few commonplace remarks, Julian ventured on a question or two as
  to the purchases which he would immediately require, the hours of lecture and
  hall, and the thousand-and-one trifles of which a newcomer is necessarily
  ignorant. Mr Admer seemed to think this a great bore, and answered languidly
  enough, advising Julian not to be &ldquo;more fresh&rdquo; than he could
  help. It requires very small self-denial to make a person at home by
  supplying him with a little information; but small as the effort would have
  been, it was greater than the Reverend N Admer could afford to make, and his
  answers were so little encouraging that Julian, making ample allowance for
  the ennuy condition of the young Fellow, relapsed into silence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what do you think of Saint Werner&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Mr
  Admer, taking the initiative, with a yawn.</p>

  <p>Julian&rsquo;s face lighted up. &ldquo;Think of it! I feel uncommonly
  proud already of being a Saint Werner&rsquo;s man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Genius loci, and all that sort of thing, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sneering way in which this was said left room for no reply, so Mr
  Admer continued.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah you&rsquo;ll soon find all that sort of twaddle wear
  off.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Julian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course you intend to be senior classic, or senior wrangler, or
  something of that sort?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I expect simply nothing; but if I were inclined to soar, one might
  have a still higher ambition than that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I see; an embryo Newton,&mdash;all that sort of
  thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean quite &lsquo;all that sort of thing,&rsquo;
  since you seem fond of the phrase,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;but really I
  think my aspirations, whatever they are, would only tire you. Good
  morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Mr Admer, nodding. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
  shake hands up here. I shall come and call on you soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The later the better,&rdquo; thought Julian, as he descended the
  narrow stairs. &ldquo;Good heavens! is that a fair specimen of a don, I
  wonder. If so, I shall certainly confine my acquaintance to the
  undergraduates.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No, Julian, not a fair specimen of a don altogether, but in some of his
  aspects a fair specimen of a certain class of university men, who profess to
  admire nothing, hope for nothing, love nothing; who think warmth of heart a
  folly, and sentiment a crime; who would not display an interest in any thing
  more important than a boat-race or a game of bowls, to save their lives; who
  are very fond of the phrase, &ldquo;all that sort of nonsense,&rdquo; to
  express everything that rises above the dead level of their own dead
  mediocrity in intelligence and life. If you would not grovel in spirit; if
  you would not lose every tear that sparkles, and every sigh that burns; if
  you would not ossify the very power of passion; if you would not turn your
  soul into a mass of shapeless lead, avoid those despicable cynics, who never
  leave their discussion of the merits of beer, or the powers of stroke oars,
  unless it be to carp at acknowledged eminence, and jeer at genuine emotion.
  How often in such company have I seen men relapse into stupid silence,
  because, if they ventured on any expression of lively interest, one of the
  throng, amid the scornful indifference of the rest, would give the only
  acknowledgment of his remark, by taking the pipe out of his mouth, to give
  vent to a low guttural laugh.</p>

  <p>After this it was lucky for Julian that he had brought his mother and
  sister with him, and that a moment after leaving Mr Admer he caught sight of
  Hugh Lillyston. With a joyful expression of surprise, they grasped each
  other&rsquo;s hands, and interchanged so friendly a greeting that Julian in
  an instant had scattered to the winds the gloomy impression which was
  beginning to creep over him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How long have you been here, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I came yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you seen your rooms yet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; I am just going to look for them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, come along; I know where they are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But stop,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;I must go to the Eagle first
  for my people. They&rsquo;ll be expecting me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really. So Mrs Home&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; asked Lillyston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and my sister. If you&rsquo;ve nothing to do, come and be
  introduced.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How immensely jolly. I wish <i>my</i> mother and sister had taken
  the trouble to come with me, I know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went to the hotel, and Lillyston was able to gratify the curiosity he
  had long felt to see his friend&rsquo;s relations.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whom do you think I&rsquo;ve brought back with me, mother?
  guess,&rdquo; said Julian, as he entered the room beaming with pleasure.
  &ldquo;Here, Hugh, come along. My mother&mdash;my sister&mdash;Mr
  Lillyston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! is this the Mr Lillyston of whom we&rsquo;ve heard so
  much?&rdquo; asked Mrs Home, with a cordial shake of the hand, while Violet
  looked up with a quick glance of curiosity and pleasure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No other,&rdquo; said Hugh, laughing; &ldquo;and really I feel as
  if I were an old friend already.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are so, I assure you,&rdquo; said Mrs Home, &ldquo;and I hope
  we shall often meet now.&rdquo; Lillyston hoped the same, as he looked at
  Violet.</p>

  <p>It was arranged that they should all four go at once to Julian&rsquo;s
  rooms, and help in the grand operation of unpacking. The rooms were very
  pleasant attics in the great court, looking out on the Fellows&rsquo;
  bowling-green, and the Iscam flowing beyond it. The furniture, most of which
  Julian was going to take from the previous possessor, was neat and
  comfortable, and when the book shelves began to glitter with his Harton
  prizes and gift-books, Julian was delighted beyond measure with the
  appearance of his new home.</p>

  <p>For some hours the unpacking continued vigorously, only interrupted by an
  excursion for lunch to the hotel, since Julian had as yet purchased no plates
  and received no commons.</p>

  <p>On their return they found an old lady in the room&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;A charred and wrinkled piece of
  womanhood;&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p class="first">who, in a voice like the grating of a blunt saw, informed
  Julian that she was to be his bedmaker, and asked him whether he intended
  &ldquo;to tea&rdquo; in his rooms that evening. (The verb &ldquo;to
  tea&rdquo; is the property of bedmakers, and, with beautiful elasticity, it
  even admits of a perfect tense&mdash;as &ldquo;have you
  tea&rsquo;d?&rdquo;)</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;lay the table for four
  this evening at eight o&rsquo;clock, and get me some bread and butter.
  You&rsquo;ll stay, Hugh, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like to, very much. But won&rsquo;t it be your last
  evening with your mother and Miss Home?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but never mind that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lillyston shook his head, and bidding the ladies a warm good-bye, left
  them to enjoy with Julian his first quiet evening in Saint Werner&rsquo;s,
  Camford.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must hang my pictures before you go, Violet. I shall want your
  advice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, let me see,&rdquo; said Violet. &ldquo;The water-colour
  likenesses of Cyril and Frankie ought to go here, one on each side of Mr
  Vere; at least, I suppose, you mean to put Mr Vere in the place of
  honour?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;every time I look on that
  noble face, so full of strength and love, and so marked with those
  &lsquo;divine hieroglyphics of sorrow,&rsquo; I shall learn fresh lessons of
  endurance and wisdom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;People will certainly call you a heretic, if you do,&rdquo; laughed
  Violet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;People!&rdquo; said Julian scornfully.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Of whom to be dispraised were no small praise.</p>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;Let them yelp.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr Vere was an eminent clergyman, who had been an intimate friend of Mr
  Home before his death. Julian had only heard him preach, and met him
  occasionally; but he had read some of his works, and had received from him so
  much sympathising kindness and intellectual aid, that he regarded him with a
  love and reverence little short of devotion&mdash;as a man distinguished
  above all others for his gentleness, his eloquence, his honesty, his
  learning, and his love. This likeness had belonged to Mr Home, and Julian had
  asked leave to carry it with him whenever he should go to the University.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, the place of honour for Mr Vere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And where shall we hang this?&rdquo; said Julian, taking up a
  photograph of Van Dyck&rsquo;s great painting of Jacob&rsquo;s Dream: the
  Hebrew boy is sleeping on the ground, and his long, dark curls, falling off
  his forehead, mingle with the rich foliage of the surrounding plants, fanned
  by the waving of mysterious wings; a cherub is lightly raising the
  embroidered cap that partially shades his face, and at his feet, blessing him
  with uplifted hand, stands a majestic angel, on whose flowing robes of white
  gleams a celestial radiance from the vista, alight with heavenly faces, that
  opens over his head. A happy and holy slumber seems to breathe from the
  lad&rsquo;s countenance, and yet you can tell that the light of dreams has
  dawned under his &ldquo;closed eyelids,&rdquo; and that the inward eye has
  caught full sight of that Beatific Epiphany.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We must hang this in your bedroom, Julian,&rdquo; said Mrs Home.
  &ldquo;I shall love to think of you lying under the outstretched hand of this
  heavenly watcher.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So they hung it there, and the task was over, and they spent a happy happy
  evening together. Next morning Julian accompanied them to the train, and
  walked back to the matriculation examination.</p>

  <h2>VI. &mdash; RENCONTRES</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;A boy&mdash;no better&mdash;with his rosy
  cheeks<br>
  Angelical, keen eye, courageous look,<br>
  And conscious step of purity and pride.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Wordsworth&rsquo;s <i>Prelude</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">A PUBLIC school man is by no means lonely when he first
  enters the university. He finds many of his old school-fellows accompanying
  him, and many who have gone up before him, and he feels united to them all by
  a bond of fellowship, which at once creates for him a circle of friends. Had
  Julian merely kept up his Harton acquaintances, he would have known as many
  Camford men as were at all necessary for the purposes of society.</p>

  <p>But although with most or all of the Hartonians Julian remained on
  pleasant and friendly terms, there were others whom he saw quite as much, and
  whose society he enjoyed all the more thoroughly because their previous
  associations and experiences were different from his own. And on looking back
  in aftertimes, what a delight it was to remember the noble hearts which,
  during those years of college life, had always beaten in unison with his own.
  Few enjoyments were more keen than that social equality and unconventional
  intercourse common among all undergraduates, which might at any time ripen
  into an earnest and invaluable friendship, or merely stop at the stage of an
  agreeable acquaintanceship. A great, and not the least useful portion of
  University education consisted in the intimate knowledge of character and the
  many-sided sympathies which were thus insensibly acquired.</p>

  <p>During the first few weeks of college life, of course, a good deal of time
  was spent in receiving and returning the visits of acquaintances, old and
  new. Of the latter, there was one with whom Julian and Lillyston were equally
  charmed, and who soon became their constant companion. His name was Kennedy,
  and Julian first got to know him by sitting next him in lecture-room. His
  lively remarks, his keen and vivid sense of the ludicrous, the quick yet
  kindly notice he took of men&rsquo;s peculiarities, his ardent appreciation
  of the books which occupied their time, and the pleasant, rapid way in which
  he would dash off a caricature, soon attracted notice, and he rapidly became
  popular, both among undergraduates and dons. He was known, too, by the warm
  eulogy of his fellow-Marlbeians, who were never tired of singing his praises
  among themselves.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; whispered he to Julian warmly, after Julian had
  just finished construing a difficult clause in the Agamemnon, which he had
  done with a spirit and fire which even kindled a spark of admiration in the
  cold breast of Mr Grayson. &ldquo;Splendidly done, Home! I say, how very
  reserved you are. Here have I been longing to know you for the last ten days,
  and we have hardly got beyond a nod to each other yet. Do come in to tea at
  my rooms to-night at eight. I want to introduce you to a friend of
  mine&mdash;Owen of Roslyn school.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; said Julian. &ldquo;That dark-haired fellow
  is Owen, is it not? I hear he&rsquo;s going to do great things!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes! booked for a Fellow and a double-first; so you ought to
  know him, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr Grayson, turning his stony gaze
  on Kennedy, whose bright face instantly assumed a demure expression of deep
  attention, while the light of laughter which still danced in his eyes might
  have betrayed to a careful observer the fact that the notes on which he
  appeared to be so assiduously occupied mainly consisted of replications of Mr
  Grayson&rsquo;s placid physiognomy and Roman nose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought an umbra with me, Kennedy, in the person of Mr
  Lillyston, who sits next to me at lectures, and wanted to be introduced to
  you,&rdquo; said Owen, as he came in to Kennedy&rsquo;s room that
  evening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted,&rdquo; said Kennedy. &ldquo;Mr Lillyston, let
  me introduce you to Mr Home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We hardly need an introduction, Hugh, at this time of day; do
  we?&rdquo; said Julian, laughing; and the four were soon as much at home as
  it was possible for men to be. There was no lack of conversation. I think the
  rooms of a Camford undergraduate are about the last place where conversation
  ever flags; and when men like Kennedy, Owen, Julian, and Lillyston meet, it
  is perhaps more genuinely earnest and interesting than in any other time or
  place.</p>

  <p>The next day, as Kennedy was sitting in Julian&rsquo;s rooms, glancing
  over the Aeschylus with him, in strutted Hazlet, whom we have incidentally
  mentioned as having been the son of a widow lady living at Ildown. He had
  come up to Camford straight from home, and as he had only received a
  home-education everything was strangely bewildering to him, and Julian was
  almost the only friend he knew. Nor was he likely to attract many friends;
  his manner was strangely self-confident, and his language dictatorial and
  dogmatic. In his mother&rsquo;s house he had long been the centre of
  religious tea-parties, before which he was often called upon to read and even
  to expound the Scriptures. &ldquo;At the tip of his subduing tongue&rdquo;
  were a number of fantastic phrases, originally misapplied, and long since
  worn bare of meaning, and the test of his orthodoxy was the universality with
  which he could reiterate proofs of heresy against every man of genius,
  honesty, and depth&mdash;who loved truth better than he loved the oracles of
  the prevalent idols. Hazlet practised the duty of Christian charity by
  dealing indiscriminate condemnation against all except those who belonged to
  his own exclusive and somewhat ignorant school of religious intolerance. His
  face was the reflex of his mind; his lank black hair stuck down in stiff dry
  straightness over a contracted forehead and an ill-shaped head; his
  spectacles gave additional glassiness to a lack-lustre eye, and the manner in
  which he carried his chin in the air seemed like an acted representation of
  &ldquo;I am holier than thou.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Far be it from me to hold up to ridicule any body of earnest and honest
  men, to whatever party they may belong. I am writing of Hazlet, not of those
  who hold the same opinions as he did. That man must have been unfortunate in
  life who has not many friends, and friends whom he holds in deep affection,
  among the adherents of opinions most entirely antagonistic to his own.
  Hazlet&rsquo;s repulsiveness was due to a very mistaken education, developing
  a very foolish idiosyncrasy, and especially to the pernicious system of
  encouraging sentiments and expressions which in a boy&rsquo;s mind
  <i>could</i> not be other than sickly exotics. He had to be taught his own
  hypocrisy by the painful progress of events, and, above all, he had to learn
  that religious shibboleths may be no proof of sanctification, and that
  religious intolerance is usually the hybrid offspring of ignorance and
  conceit. In many essential matters he held the truth,&mdash;but he held it in
  unrighteousness.</p>

  <p>It may be imagined that Hazlet was no favourite companion of Julian Home.
  But Julian loved and honoured to the utmost of his power the good points of
  all; he had a deep and real veneration for humanity, and rarely allowed
  himself an unkind expression, or a look which indicated ennui, even to those
  associates by whose presence he was most unspeakably bored. Hazlet mistook
  his courteous manner for a deferential agreement, and was, too often, in
  Julian&rsquo;s presence more than usually insufferable in his Pharisaical
  tendencies.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; said Kennedy, who saw Hazlet coming across the
  court. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this, Home? He looks as if he had been just
  presiding at three conventicles and a meeting at Philadelphus Hall. Surely he
  can&rsquo;t be coming here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a compatriot of
  mine named Hazlet; a very good fellow, I believe, though rather obtrusive
  perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, Home,&rdquo; said Hazlet, in a measured and
  sanctified tone, as he entered the room and sat down.</p>

  <p>Kennedy glanced impatiently at the Aeschylus.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! I see you&rsquo;re engaged on that heathen poet. It often
  strikes me, Home, that we may be wrong after all in spending so much time on
  these works of men, who, as Saint Paul tells us, were &lsquo;wholly given to
  idolatry.&rsquo; I have just come from a most refreshing meeting
  at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, Home,&rdquo; cut in Kennedy hastily, &ldquo;shall I go? I
  suppose you won&rsquo;t do over any more of the Agamemnon this
  morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;perhaps Hazlet will
  join us in our construe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I think not,&rdquo; said Hazlet, with a compassionate sigh.
  &ldquo;I have looked at it; but some of it appeared to me so pagan in its
  sentiments that I contented myself with praying that I might not be put on.
  But you haven&rsquo;t told me what you think about what I was
  saying.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Botheration,&rdquo; said Kennedy; &ldquo;so your theory is that
  Christianity was intended to put an extinguisher over the light of
  heaven-born genius, and that the power and passion and wisdom of Aeschylus
  came from himself or the devil, and not from God? Surely, without any further
  argument on such an absurd proposition, it ought to be sufficient for you
  that this kind of learning forms a part of your immediate duty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I find other duties more paramount&mdash;now prayer, for instance,
  and talk with sound friends.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Phew!!!&rdquo; whistled Kennedy, thoroughly disgusted at language
  which was as new to him as it was distasteful; and, to relieve his feelings,
  he abandoned the conversation to Julian, and began to turn over the books on
  the table. Julian, however, seemed quite disinclined to enter into the
  question, and after a pause, Hazlet, gracefully waiving his little triumph,
  asked him with a peculiar unction&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And how goes it, my dear Home, with your immortal soul?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My soul!&rdquo; said Julian carelessly. &ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s all
  right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hazlet then began to look at Julian&rsquo;s pictures.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he observed with a deep sigh, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to
  see that you have the portrait of so unsound, so dangerous a man as Mr
  Vere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drop that topic, please, Hazlet,&rdquo; said Julian,
  &ldquo;as we&rsquo;re not likely to agree upon it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you ever read one word that Mr Vere ever wrote?&rdquo; asked
  Kennedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes; at least no, not exactly: but still one may judge, you
  know; besides, I&rsquo;ve seen extracts of his works.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Extracts!&rdquo; answered Kennedy scornfully; &ldquo;extracts which
  often attribute to him the very sentiments which he is opposing. But it
  isn&rsquo;t worth arguing with one of your school, who have the dishonesty to
  condemn writers whom you are incapable of understanding, on the faith of
  extracts which they haven&rsquo;t even read.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The wrathful purpling of Hazlet&rsquo;s sallow countenance portended an
  explosion of orthodox spleen, but Julian gently interposed in time to save
  the devoted Kennedy from a few unmeasured anathemas.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;none of the odium theologicum, please,
  lest the mighty shade of Aeschylus smile at you in scorn. Do drop the
  subject, Hazlet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, if you like, Home; but I must deliver my conscience, you
  know. But really, Julian, you are not very Christian in your other
  pictures.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This was too much even for Julian&rsquo;s politeness, and he joined in the
  shout of laughter with which Kennedy greeted this appeal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fools make a mock at sin,&rdquo; said Hazlet austerely. &ldquo;I
  trust that you will both be brought to a better state of mind. Good
  morning!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy flung himself into an armchair, and after finishing his laugh,
  exclaimed, &ldquo;My dear Home, where did you pick up that intolerable
  hypocrite?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Kennedy, hush! Don&rsquo;t call him a hypocrite. His mode of
  religion may be very offensive to us, and yet it may be sincere.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Faugh! the idea of asking you, &lsquo;How&rsquo;s your soul?&rsquo;
  It reminds me of a friend of mine who was suddenly asked by a minister in a
  train &lsquo;if he didn&rsquo;t feel an aching void?&rsquo; &lsquo;An aching
  void? Where?&rsquo; said Jones, in a tone of alarm, for he was an
  unimaginative person. &lsquo;Within, sir, within!&rsquo; said the stranger.
  Jones felt anxiously to find whether one of his ribs was accidentally
  protruding, but finding them all safe, set down the minister for a lunatic,
  and moved to the further end of the carriage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian smiled; he was more accustomed to this kind of phraseology than his
  friend, and knew that outrageous as it was to good taste under the
  circumstances, it yet might spring from a sincere and honourable motive, or
  at best must be regarded as the natural result of innate vulgarity and
  mistaken training.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely at best,&rdquo; continued Kennedy, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a most
  unwarrantable impertinence for a fellow like that to want to dabble his
  ignorant and coarse hand in the hallowed secrets of the microcosm. Not to
  one&rsquo;s nearest and dearest friend, not to one&rsquo;s mother or brother
  would one babble promiscuously on such awful themes; and to have the
  soul&rsquo;s sublime and eternal emotions, its sacred and unspoken
  communings, lugged out into farcical prominence by such conversational cant
  as that, is to dry up the very fountain of true religion, and put a premium
  on the successful grin of an offensive hypocrisy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy seemed quite agitated, and as usual found relief in striding up
  and down the room. His religious feelings were deep and real&mdash;none the
  less so for being hidden&mdash;and Hazlet&rsquo;s language and manner had
  given him a rude shock.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Another hour in that fellow&rsquo;s company would make me an
  infidel,&rdquo; he exclaimed with quivering lip. &ldquo;Pray for me, indeed,
  with some of his &lsquo;sound and congenial friends.&rsquo; Faugh!
  &lsquo;sound!&rsquo; how does he dare to judge whether his superiors are
  &lsquo;sound&rsquo; or not? and why must he borrow a metaphor from Stilton
  cheeses when he&rsquo;s talking of religious convictions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why really, Kennedy,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;to see the contempt
  written in your face, one would think you were an archangel looking at a
  black beetle, as a learned judge once observed. If you won&rsquo;t regard
  Hazlet as a man and a brother, at least remember that he&rsquo;s a vertebrate
  animal.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Kennedy was not to be joked out of his indignation, so Julian
  continued. &ldquo;I wish you knew more of Lillyston. At one time, I should
  have been nearly as much bothered by Hazlet as you, but Lillyston&rsquo;s
  kind, genial good-humour with every one, and the genuine respectful sympathy
  which he shows even for things he can least understand, have made me much
  happier than I should have been. Now, <i>he</i> might have done Hazlet some
  good, whereas your opposition, my dear fellow, will only make him more
  rampant than ever. Ah, here Lillyston comes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What an honest open face,&rdquo; said Kennedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like the soul which looks through it, <i>sans peur et sans
  reproche</i>,&rdquo; said Julian warmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rather a contrast to the last comer,&rdquo; murmured Kennedy, as he
  picked up his cap and gown to walk to the lecture-room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There, don&rsquo;t think of Hazlet any more,&rdquo; said
  Julian.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;&lsquo;He prayeth best who loveth best<br>
  All things both great and small,<br>
  For the dear God who loveth us,<br>
  He made and loveth all.&rsquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;A capital good motto that; isn&rsquo;t it, Hugh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must love Hazlet as one of the very small things, then,&rdquo;
  said the incorrigible Kennedy as he left the room with the other two.</p>

  <p>Hazlet was put on to construe during the lecture, and if anything could
  have shaken the brazen tower of his self-confidence, it would have been the
  egregious display of incapacity which followed; but Hazlet rather piqued
  himself on his indifference to the poor blind heathen poets, on whose names
  he usually dealt reprobation broadcast. &ldquo;Like lions that die of an
  ass&rsquo;s kick,&rdquo; those wronged great souls lay prostrate before
  Hazlet&rsquo;s wrathful heels.</p>

  <h2>VII. &mdash; THE SCORN OF SCORN</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;And not a man, for being simply man,<br>
  Hath any honour, but honour for those honours<br>
  That are without him&mdash;as place, riches, favour,<br>
  Prizes of accident as oft as merit.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Shakespeare.</p><br>

  <p class="first">VERY different in all respects were Julian&rsquo;s
  rencontres with others of his old schoolfellows. There were some, indeed,
  among them who had left Harton while they were still in low forms, and some
  whose tastes and pursuits were so entirely different from his own, that it
  was hardly likely that he should maintain any other intercourse with them
  than such as was demanded by a slight acquaintance. But of Bruce, at any
  rate, it might have been expected that he would see rather more than proved
  to be the case. Bruce, as having been head of the school during the period
  when Julian was a monitor, had been thrown daily into his company, and, as
  inmates of the same house, they had acted together in the thousand little
  scenes which diversify the bright and free monotony of a schoolboy&rsquo;s
  life.</p>

  <p>But the first fortnight passed by, and Bruce had not called on Julian, and
  as they were on different &ldquo;sides,&rdquo; they had not chanced to meet,
  either in lecture-room or elsewhere. Julian, not knowing whether his position
  as sizar would make any difference in Bruce&rsquo;s estimation of him, had
  naturally left him to take the initiative in calling; while Bruce, on the
  other hand, always a little jealous of his brilliant contemporary, and not
  too anxious to be familiar with a sizar, pretended to himself that it was as
  much Julian&rsquo;s place as his to be first in calling. Hence it was that,
  for the first fortnight, the two did not happen to come across each
  other.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Bruce also had made many fresh acquaintances. His reputation for
  immense wealth and considerable talent&mdash;his dashing easy
  manner&mdash;his handsome person and elaborate style of dress, attracted
  notice, and very soon threw him into the circle of all the young fashionables
  of Saint Werner&rsquo;s. His style of life cannot be better described than by
  saying that he affected the fine gentleman. Hardly a day had passed during
  which he had not been at some large breakfast or wine-party, or formed one of
  a select little body of supping aristocrats. He did very little work, and
  pretended to do none, (for Bruce was a first-rate specimen of the
  never-open-a-book genus), although at unexpected hours he took care to get
  up the lecture-room subjects sufficiently well to make a display when he was
  put on. Even in this he was unsuccessful, for scholarship cannot be acquired
  <i>per saltum</i>, and Mr Serjeant, the lecturer on his side, looked on him
  with profound contempt as a puppy who was all the more offensive from
  pretending to some knowledge. He told him that he might distinguish himself
  by hard steady work, but would never do so without infinitely more pains than
  he took the trouble to apply. His quiet and caustic strictures, and the easy
  sarcasm with which he would allow Bruce to flourish his way through a
  passage, and then go through it himself, pointing out how utterly Bruce had
  &ldquo;hopped with airy and fastidious levity&rdquo; above all the nicer
  shades of meaning, and slurred over his ignorance of a difficulty by some
  piece of sonorous nonsense, made him peculiarly the object of the young
  man&rsquo;s disgust. But though Mr Serjeant wounded his vanity, the irony of
  &ldquo;a musty old don,&rdquo; as Bruce contemptuously called him, was amply
  atoned for by the compliments of the fast young admirers whom Bruce soon
  gathered round him, and some of whom were always to be found after hall-time
  sipping his claret or lounging in his gorgeous rooms. To them Bruce&rsquo;s
  genius was incontestably proved by the faultless evenness with which he
  parted his hair behind, the dapperness of his boots, and the merit of his
  spotless shirts.</p>

  <p>Sir Rollo Bruce, Vyvyan&rsquo;s father, was a man of no particular family,
  who had been knighted on a deputation, and contrived to glitter in the most
  splendid circles of London society. His magnificent entertainments, his
  exquisite appointments, his apparently fabulous resources, were a sufficient
  passport into the saloons of dukes; and, although ostensibly Sir Rollo had
  nothing to live on but his salary as the chairman of a bank, nobody who had
  the entre of his house cared particularly to inquire into the sources of his
  wealth. Vyvyan imitated his father in his expensive tastes, and cultivated,
  with vulgar assiduity, the society of the noblemen at his college. In a short
  time he knew them all, and all of them had been at his rooms except a young
  Lord De Vayne, of whom we shall hear more hereafter, and whose retiring
  manners made him shrink with dislike from Bruce&rsquo;s fawning
  familiarity.</p>

  <p>The sizars at Saint Werner&rsquo;s do not dine at the same hour as the
  rest of the undergraduates, but the hour after, and their dinner consists of
  the dishes which have previously figured on the Fellows&rsquo; table. It
  seems to me that the time may come when the authorities of that royal
  foundation will see reason to regret so unnecessary an arrangement, the relic
  of a long, obsolete, and always undesirable system. Many of Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s most distinguished alumni have themselves sat at the
  sizars&rsquo; table, and if any of them were blessed or cursed with sensitive
  dispositions, they will not be dead to the justice of these remarks. The
  sizars are, by birth and education, invariably, so far as I know, the sons of
  gentlemen, and perhaps most often of clergymen whose means prevent them from
  bearing unassisted the heavy burden of University expenses. After a short
  time many of these sizars become scholars, and eventually a large number of
  them win for themselves the honours of a fellowship. Why put on these young
  students a gratuitous indignity? Why subject them to the unpleasant remarks
  which some are quite coarse enough to make on the subject? The authorities of
  Saint Werner&rsquo;s are full of real courtesy and kindness, and that the
  arrangement is not intended as an indignity I am well aware; it is, as I have
  said, the accidental fragment of an obsolete period&mdash;a period when
  scholars dined on &ldquo;a penny piece of beef,&rdquo; and slept two or three
  in a room at the foot of the Fellows&rsquo; beds. All honour to Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s; all honour to the great, and the wise, and the learned, and
  the noble whom she has sent forth into all lands; all honour to the bravery
  and the truthfulness of her sons; all honour to the profound scholars, and
  able teachers, and eloquent orators who preside at her councils; she is a
  Queen of colleges, and may wield her sceptre with a strong hand and a proud.
  But are there not some among her subjects who are deaf to the sounds of calm
  advice?&mdash;some who are so blind as to love her faults and prop up her
  abuses?&mdash;some who daub her walls with the untempered mortar of their
  blind prejudice, and treat every one as an enemy who would aid in removing
  here and there a bent pillar, and here and there a crumbling stone? (These
  words were written some time ago. I trust that since then all causes of
  offence, if they ever existed, have long been forgiven and forgotten.)</p>

  <p>And now let all defenders of present institutions, however bad they may
  be&mdash;let all violent supporters of their old mumpsimus against any new
  sumpsimus whatever, listen to a conversation among some undergraduates. It
  may convince them, or it may not&mdash;I cannot tell; but I know that it had
  a powerful influence on me.</p>

  <p>Bruce was standing in the Butteries, where he had just been joined by Lord
  Fitzurse and Sir John D&rsquo;Acres, who by virtue of their
  titles&mdash;certainly not by any other virtue&mdash;sat among reverend
  Professors and learned Doctors at the high table, far removed from the herd
  of common undergraduates. With the three were <i>Mr</i>. Boodle and
  <i>Mr</i>. Tulk, (the &ldquo;Mister&rdquo; is given them in the college-lists
  out of respect for the long purses which have purchased them, the privilege
  of fellow-commoners or ballantiogennaioi), who enjoyed the same enviable
  distinction and happy privilege. By the screens were four or five sizars; a
  few more were scattered about in the passage waiting, whilst the servants
  hurriedly placed the dishes on the table set apart for them; and Julian was
  chatting to Lillyston, who chanced at the moment to have been passing by.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is that table for?&rdquo; asked D&rsquo;Acres, pointing through
  the open door of the hall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s for the sizars,&rdquo; tittered the feeble-minded
  Boodle, who tittered at everything.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;S&mdash;s&mdash;sizars!&rdquo; stammered Lord Fitzurse.
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that mean? Are they v&mdash;v&mdash;very big
  f&mdash;f&mdash;fellows?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo; said Bruce. &ldquo;No; they&rsquo;re sons of
  gyps and that kind of thing, who feed on the semese fragments of the high
  table.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They must be g&mdash;g&mdash;ghouls!&rdquo; said his lordship,
  shudderingly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Acres, who was a thorough gentleman,
  &ldquo;some of the sizars may be here;&rdquo; and he dropped Bruce&rsquo;s
  arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh! they&rsquo;ll feel flattered,&rdquo; said Bruce carelessly,
  as D&rsquo;Acres walked off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Julian, striding indignantly forward, for the
  conversation was so loud that he had heard every word of it. &ldquo;Flattered
  to be the butt for the insolence of puppyism and every fool who is coarse
  enough to insult them publicly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who the d&mdash;d&mdash;d&mdash;deuce are you?&rdquo; said Lord
  Fitzurse, &ldquo;for you&rsquo;re coming it r&mdash;r&mdash;rather
  strong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; said Lillyston, breaking in, &ldquo;your equal,
  sir, in birth, as he is your superior in intellect, and in every moral
  quality. Gentlemen,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;let me warn you not to have
  the impertinence to talk in this way again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Warn us!&rdquo; said Bruce, trying to hide under bravado his
  crestfallen temper; &ldquo;why, what&rsquo;ll you do if we choose to
  continue?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make a few counter-remarks to begin with, Bruce, on parasites and
  parvenus, tuft-hunting freshmen, and the tenth transmitters of a foolish
  face,&rdquo; retorted Lillyston, glowing with honest indignation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And turn you out of the butteries by the shoulders,&rdquo; said a
  strong undergraduate, who had chanced to be a witness of the scene. &ldquo;A
  somewhat boyish proceeding, perhaps, but exactly suited to some
  capacities.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bruce and his friends, seeing that they were beginning to have the worst
  of it, thought it about time to swagger off, and for the future learnt to
  confine their remarks to a more exclusive circle.</p>

  <p>There had been another silent spectator of the scene in the person of Lord
  De Vayne. He was a young viscount whose estate bordered on the grounds of
  Lonstead Abbey, and he had known Julian since both of them were little boys.
  He had been entirely educated at home with an excellent tutor, who had filled
  his mind with all wise and generous sentiments; but his widowed mother lived
  in such complete seclusion that he had rarely entered the society of any of
  his own age, and was consequently timid and bashful. Meeting sometimes with
  Julian, he had conceived a warm admiration for his genius and character, and
  at one time had earnestly wished to join him at Harton. But his mother was so
  distressed at the proposition that he at once abandoned it, while he eagerly
  looked forward to the time when he should meet his friend at Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s, on the books of which college he had entered his name partly
  for this very reason. He had not been an undergraduate many days before he
  called on Julian, who had received him indeed very kindly, but who seemed
  rather shy of being much in his company for fear of the remarks which he had
  not yet learnt entirely to disregard. This was a great source of vexation to
  De Vayne, though the reason of it was partly explained after the remarks
  which he had just overheard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Home,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d come into my
  rooms after hall, I should so much like to have a talk. Do,&rdquo; he said,
  as he saw that Julian hesitated, &ldquo;I assure you I have felt quite lonely
  here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Accordingly, after hall, Julian strolled into Warwick&rsquo;s Court, and
  found his way to Lord De Vayne&rsquo;s rooms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am so glad to see you, Julian, at last. As I have told
  you,&rdquo; he said, with a glistening eye, &ldquo;I have been very lonely. I
  have never left home before, and have made no friend here as yet;&rdquo; and
  he heaved a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>Julian felt his heart full of friendliness for the gentle boy whose total
  inexperience made him seem younger than he really was. He glanced round the
  rooms; they were richly furnished, but full of memorials of home, that gave
  them a melancholy aspect. Over the fireplace was a water-colour likeness of
  his lady-mother in her widow&rsquo;s weeds, and on the opposite side of the
  room another picture of a beautiful young child&mdash;De Vayne&rsquo;s only
  brother, who had died in infancy. The handsomely-bound books on the shelves
  had been transferred from their well-known places in the library of Uther
  Hall, and the regal antlers which were fastened over the door had once graced
  the dining-room. Thousands would have envied Lord De Vayne&rsquo;s position;
  but he had caught the shadow of his mother&rsquo;s sadness, his relations
  were few, at Saint Werner&rsquo;s as yet he had found none to lean upon, and
  he felt unhappy and alone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was so ashamed, Julian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so utterly and
  unspeakably ashamed to hear the rudeness of these men as we came out of hall.
  I&rsquo;m afraid you must have felt deeply hurt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, for the moment; but I&rsquo;m sorry that I took even a
  moment&rsquo;s notice of it. Why should one be ruffled because others are
  unfeeling and impertinent; it is their misfortune, not ours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why did you come up as a sizar, Julian? Surely with Lonstead
  Abbey as your inheritance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Julian with a smile; &ldquo;I am lord of my
  leisure, and no land beside.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really! I had always looked on you as a future neighbour and
  helper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was too delicate to make any inquiries on the subject, but while a
  bright airy vision rose for an instant before Julian&rsquo;s fancy, and then
  died away, his friend said, with ingenuous embarrassment:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know, Home, I am very rich. In truth, I have far more money
  than I know what to do with. It only troubles me. I wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, dear no!&rdquo; said Julian hastily; &ldquo;I got the Newry
  scholarship, you know, at Harton, and I really need no assistance
  whatever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope I haven&rsquo;t offended you; how unlucky I am,&rdquo; said
  De Vayne blushing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a whit, De Vayne; I know your kind heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, do let me see something of you. Won&rsquo;t you come a walk
  sometimes, or let me come in of an evening when you&rsquo;re taking tea, and
  not at work?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said Julian, and they agreed to meet at his rooms on the
  following Sunday evening.</p>

  <p>Sunday at Camford was a happy day for Julian Home. It was a day of perfect
  leisure and rest; the time not spent at church or in the society of others,
  he generally occupied in taking a longer walk than usual, or in the luxuries
  of solemn and quiet thought. But the greatest enjoyment was to revel freely
  in books, and devote himself unrestrained to the gorgeous scenes of poetry,
  or the passionate pages of eloquent men; on that day he drank deeply of pure
  streams that refreshed him for his weekly work; nor did he forget some hour
  of commune, in the secrecy of his chamber and the silence of his heart, with
  that God and Father in whom alone he trusted, and to whom alone he looked for
  deliverance from difficulty, and guidance under temptation. Of all hours his
  happiest and strongest were those in which he was alone&mdash;alone except
  for a heavenly presence, sitting at the feet of a Friend, and looking face to
  face upon himself.</p>

  <p>He had been reading Wordsworth since hall-time, when the ringing of the
  chapel-bell summoned him to put on his surplice, and walk quietly down to
  chapel. As there was plenty of time, he took a stroll or two across the court
  before going in. While doing so, he met De Vayne, and in his company suddenly
  found himself vis--vis with his old enemy Brogten.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; whispered Brogten to his companion; &ldquo;the sizars
  are getting on. A sizar and a viscount arm-in-arm!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian only heard enough of this sentence to be aware that it was highly
  insolent; and the flush on De Vayne&rsquo;s cheek showed that he too had
  caught something of its meaning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that boor&rsquo;s rudeness,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
  feel more than honoured to be in the sizar&rsquo;s company. How admirably
  quiet you are, Julian, under such conduct!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I try to be; not always with success, though,&rdquo; he answered,
  as his breast swelled, and his lip quivered with indignation</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Scorn!&mdash;to be scorned by one that I scorn:<br>
  Is that a matter to make me fret?<br>
  Is that a matter to cause regret?<br>
  Stop! let&rsquo;s come into chapel.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>They went into chapel together. De Vayne walked into the noblemen&rsquo;s
  seats, and Julian, hot and angry, and with the words, &ldquo;Scorn!&mdash;to
  be scorned by one that I scorn,&rdquo; still ringing in his ears, strode up
  the whole length of the chapel to the obscure corner set apart&mdash;is it
  not very needlessly set apart?&mdash;for the sizars&rsquo; use.</p>

  <p>Saint Werner&rsquo;s chapel on a Sunday evening is a moving sight. Five
  hundred men in surplices thronging the chapel from end to end&mdash;the very
  flower of English youth, in manly beauty, in strength, in race, in courage,
  in mind&mdash;all kneeling side by side, bound together in a common bond of
  union by the grand historic associations of that noble place&mdash;all
  mingling their voices together with the trebles of the choir and the
  thunder-music of the organ. This is a spectacle not often equalled; and to
  take a share in it, as one for whose sake in part it has been established, is
  a privilege not to be forgotten. The music, the devotion, the spirit of the
  place, smoothed the swelling thoughts of Julian&rsquo;s troubled heart.
  &ldquo;Are we not all brethren? Hath not one Father begotten us?&rdquo; Such
  began to be the burden of his thoughts, rather than the old
  &ldquo;Scorn!&mdash;to be scorned by one that I scorn.&rdquo; And when the
  glorious tones of the anthem ceased, and the calm steady voice of the
  chaplain was heard alone, uttering in the sudden hush the grand overture to
  the noble prayer&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>O Lord, our heavenly Father, high and mighty, King of Kings,
  Lord of Lords, the only Ruler of princes, who dost from thy throne behold all
  the dwellers upon earth</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Then the last demon of wrath was exorcised, and Julian thought to
  himself&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; from henceforth I scorn no one, and am indifferent alike to the
  proud man&rsquo;s scorn and the base man&rsquo;s sneer.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two incidents that we have narrated made Julian fear that his position
  as a sizar would be one of continual annoyance. He afterwards gratefully
  acknowledged that in such a supposition he was quite mistaken. Never again
  while he remained a sizar did he hear the slightest unkind allusions to the
  circumstance, and but for the external regulations imposed by the college, he
  might even have forgotten the fact. Those regulations, especially the hall
  arrangements, were indeed sufficiently disagreeable at times. It could not be
  pleasant to dine in a hall which had just been left by hundreds of men, and
  to make the meal amid the prospect of slovenly servants employed in the
  emptying of wine-glasses and the ligurrition of dishes, sometimes even in
  passages of coquetry or noisy civilities, on the interchange of which the
  presence of these undergraduates seemed to impose but little check. These
  things may be better now, and in spite of them Julian felt hearty reason to
  be grateful for the real kindness of the Saint Werner&rsquo;s authorities. In
  other respects he found that the fact of his being a sizar made no sort of
  difference in his position; he found that the majority of men either knew or
  cared nothing about it, and sought his society on terms of the most
  unquestioned equality, for the sake of the pleasure which his company
  afforded them, and the thoughts which it enabled them to ventilate or
  interchange.</p>

  <h2>VIII. &mdash; STUDY AND IDLENESS</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;Then what golden hours were for us,<br>
  While we sate together there!<br>
  How the white vests of the chorus<br>
  Seemed to wave up a live air.<br>
  How the cothurns trod majestic,<br>
  Down the deep iambic lines,<br>
  And the rolling anapaestic<br>
  Curled like vapour over shrines!&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;E. Barrett Browning.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE incentives which lead young men to work are as various
  as the influences which tend to make them idle. One toils on, however
  hopelessly, from a sense of duty, from a desire to please his parents, and
  satisfy the requirements of the place; another because he has been well
  trained into habits of work, and has a notion of educating the mind; a third
  because he has set his heart on a fellowship; a fourth, because he is
  intensely ambitious, and looks on a good degree as the stepping-stone to
  literary or political honours. The fewest perhaps pursue learning for her own
  sake, and study out of a simple eagerness to know what <i>may</i> be known,
  as the best means of cultivating their intellectual powers for the attainment
  of at least a personal solution of those great problems, the existence of
  which they have already begun to realise. But of this rare class was Julian
  Home. He studied with an ardour and a passion, before which difficulties
  vanished, and in consequence of which, he seemed to progress not the less
  surely, because it was with great strides. For the first time in his life,
  Julian found himself entirely alone in the great wide realm of
  literature&mdash;alone, to wander at his own will, almost without a guide.
  And joyously did that brave young spirit pursue its way&mdash;now resting in
  some fragrant glen, and by some fountain mirror, where the boughs which bent
  over him were bright with blossom, and rich with fruit&mdash;now plunging
  into some deep thicket, where at every step he had to push aside the heavy
  branches and tangled weeds&mdash;and now climbing with toilful progress some
  steep and rocky hill, on whose summit, hardly attained, he could rest at
  last, and gaze back over perils surmounted, and precipices passed, and mark
  the thunder rolling over the valleys, or gaze on kingdoms full of peace and
  beauty, slumbering in the broad sunshine beneath his feet.</p>

  <p>Julian read for the sake of knowledge, and because he intensely enjoyed
  the great authors, whose thoughts he studied. He had read parts of Homer,
  parts of Thucydides, parts of Tacitus, parts of the tragedians, at school,
  but now he had it in his power to study a great author entire, and as a
  whole. Never before did he fully appreciate the &ldquo;thunderous lilt&rdquo;
  of Greek epic, the touching and voluptuous tenderness of Latin elegy, the
  regal pomp of history, the gorgeous and philosophic mystery of the old
  dramatic fables. Never before had he learnt to gaze on &ldquo;the bright
  countenance of truth, in the mild and dewy air of delightful studies.&rdquo;
  Those who decry classical education, do so from inexperience of its real
  character and value, and can hardly conceive the sense of strength and
  freedom which a young and ingenuous intellect acquires in all literature, and
  in all thought, by the laborious and successful endeavour to enter into that
  noble heritage which has been left us by the wisdom of bygone generations.
  Those hours were the happiest of Julian&rsquo;s life; often would he be
  beguiled by his studies into the &ldquo;wee small&rdquo; hours of night; and
  in the grand old company of eloquent men, and profound philosophers, he would
  forget everything in the sense of intellectual advance. Then first he began
  to understand Milton&rsquo;s noble exclamation&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;How charming is divine philosophy!<br>
  Not harsh and rugged as dull fools suppose,<br>
  But musical as is Apollo&rsquo;s lute,<br>
  And a perpetual feast of nectared sweets,<br>
  Where no crude surfeit reigns.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>He studied accurately, yet with appreciation; sometimes the two ways of
  study are not combined, and while one man will be content with a cold and
  barren estimate of <i>ge</i>&rsquo;s and <i>pon</i>&rsquo;s derived from
  wading through the unutterable tedium of interminable German notes, of which
  the last always contradicted all the rest; another will content himself with
  eviscerating the general meaning of a passage, without any attempt to feel
  the finer pulses of emotion, or discriminate the nicer shades of thought.
  Eschewing commentators as much as he could, Julian would first carefully go
  over a long passage, solely with a view to the clear comprehension of the
  author&rsquo;s language, and would then re-read the whole for the purpose of
  enjoying and appreciating the thoughts which the words enshrined; and
  finally, when he had finished a book or a poem, would run through it again as
  a whole, with all the glow and enthusiasm of a perfect comprehension.</p>

  <p>Sometimes Kennedy, or Owen, or Lord De Vayne, would read with him. This
  was always in lighter and easier authors, read chiefly for practice, and for
  the sake of the poetry or the story, which lent them their attraction. It was
  necessary to pursue in solitude all the severer paths of study; but he found
  these evenings, spent at once in society and yet over books, full both of
  profit and enjoyment. Lillyston, although not a first-rate classic, often
  formed one of the party; Owen and Julian contributed the requisite
  scholarship and the accurate knowledge, while Lillyston and De Vayne would
  often throw out some literary illustration or historical parallel, and
  Kennedy gave life and brightness to them all, by the flow and sparkle of his
  gaiety and wit. But it must be admitted that Kennedy was the least studious
  element in the party, and was too often the cause of digressions, and
  conversations which led them to abandon altogether the immediate object of
  their evening&rsquo;s work.</p>

  <p>Kennedy had a tendency to idleness, which was developed by the freedom
  with which he plunged into society of all kinds. His company was so
  agreeable, and his bright young face was so happy an addition to all parties,
  that he was in a round of constant engagements&mdash;breakfast parties,
  wines, supper parties, and dinners&mdash;that encroached <i>far</i> too much
  on the hours of work. At school the perpetual examinations kept alive an
  emulous spirit, which counteracted his fondness for mental vagrancy; but at
  college the examinations&mdash;at least those of any importance&mdash;are few
  and far between; and he always flattered himself that he meant soon to make
  up for lost time, for three years looks an immense period to a young man at
  the entrance of his university career. It was nearly as necessary, (even in a
  pecuniary point of view), for him as for Julian to make the best use of his
  time; for although he was an only son, he was not destined to inherit a
  fortune sufficient for his support.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just look at these cards,&rdquo; he said to Julian one day;
  &ldquo;there is not one of them which hasn&rsquo;t an invitation scribbled on
  it. These engagements really leave one no time for work. What a bore it is!
  How do you manage to escape them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;first, I haven&rsquo;t such a large acquaintance as you;
  that makes a great deal of difference. But, besides, I make a point of
  leaving breakfast parties at ten, and wines at chapel-time&mdash;so that I
  really don&rsquo;t find them any serious hindrance. No hindrance, I mean, in
  comparison with the delight and profit of the society itself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish I could make the same resolution,&rdquo; said Kennedy;
  &ldquo;but the fact is, I find company so thoroughly amusing, that I&rsquo;m
  always tempted to stay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why not decline sometimes?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;it looks uncivil. Here, which of these
  shall I cut?&rdquo; he said, tossing three or four notes and cards to
  Julian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This for one,&rdquo; said Julian, as he read the first:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Dear Kennedy&mdash;Come to supper and cards at ten.
  Bruce wants to be introduced to you. Yours,</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;&lsquo;C Brogten.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I shall. I don&rsquo;t like that fellow Brogten, who
  is always thrusting himself in my way,&rdquo; said Kennedy. &ldquo;Heigh
  ho!&rdquo; and Kennedy leant his head on his arm, and fell into a reverie,
  thinking that after all his three years at college might be over almost
  before he was aware of how much time he lost.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t play cards much,&rdquo; said Julian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why? I hear Hazlet has been denouncing them in hall with unctuous
  fervour, and I do think it was that which led me to join in a game which was
  instantly proposed by some of the men who sat near.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that there&rsquo;s anything diabolical,&rdquo;
  said Julian, smiling, &ldquo;in paint and pasteboard, or that I should have
  the least objection to play them myself if I wanted amusement, but I think
  them&mdash;except very occasionally, and in moderation&mdash;a waste of time;
  and if you play for money I don&rsquo;t think it does you any
  good.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never played for money yet. By the bye, do you
  know Bruce? He has the character and manner of a very gentlemanly
  fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know him,&rdquo; said Julian, who made a point of holding
  his tongue about a man when he had nothing favourable to say.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, ay, I forgot; of course; he&rsquo;s a Hartonian. But
  didn&rsquo;t you think him gentlemanly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has an easy manner, and is accustomed to good society, which is
  usually all that is intended by the word,&rdquo; said Julian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I must go just this one evening. I like to see a variety of
  men; one learns something from it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy went. The supper took place in Brogten&rsquo;s rooms, and the
  party then adjourned to Bruce&rsquo;s, where they immediately began a game at
  whist for half-a-crown points, and then &ldquo;unlimited loo.&rdquo; Kennedy
  was induced to play &ldquo;just to see what it was like.&rdquo; As the game
  proceeded he became more and more excited; the others were accustomed to the
  thing, and concealed their eagerness; but Kennedy, who was younger and more
  inexperienced than any of them, threw himself into the game, and drank
  heedlessly of the wine that freely circulated. Surely if guardian spirits
  attend the footsteps of youth, one angel must have wept that evening
  &ldquo;tears such as angels weep&rdquo; to see him with his flushed face and
  sparkling eyes, eagerly seizing the sums he won, or, with clenched hand and
  contracted brow, anxiously awaiting the result of some adverse turn in the
  chances of the game. I remember once to have accidentally entered a scene
  like this in going to borrow something from a neighbour&rsquo;s room; and I
  shall never forget the almost tiger-like eagerness and haggard anxiety
  depicted on the countenances of the men who were playing for sums far too
  extravagant for an undergraduate&rsquo;s purse.</p>

  <p>How Kennedy got home he never knew, but next morning he awoke headachy and
  feverish, and the first thing he saw on his table was a slip of paper on
  which was written, &ldquo;Kennedy <i>admonished</i> by the senior Dean for
  being out after twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo; The notice annoyed and ashamed
  him. He lay in bed till late, was absent from lecture, and got up to an
  unrelished breakfast, at which he was disturbed by the entrance of Bruce, to
  congratulate him on his winnings of the evening before.</p>

  <p>While Bruce was talking to him, Lillyston also strolled in on his way from
  lecture to ask what had kept Kennedy away. He was surprised to see the pale
  and weary look on his face, and catching sight of Bruce seated in the
  armchair by the fire, he merely made some commonplace remarks and left the
  room. But he met Julian in the court, and told him that Kennedy didn&rsquo;t
  seem to be well.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not surprised,&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;he supped with
  Brogten, and then went to play cards with Bruce, and I hear that
  Bruce&rsquo;s card parties are not very steady proceedings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we manage to keep him out of that set, Julian? It will
  be the ruin of his reading.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, and worse, Hugh. But what can one say? It will hardly do to
  read homilies to one&rsquo;s fellow undergraduates.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You might at least give him a hint.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will. I suppose he&rsquo;ll come and do some Euripides to-
  night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did come, and when they had read some three hundred lines, and the rest
  were separating, he proposed to Julian a turn in the great court.</p>

  <p>The stars were crowding in their bright myriads, and the clear silvery
  moonlight bathed the court, except where the hall and chapel flung fantastic
  and mysterious shadows across the green smooth-mown lawns of the quadrangle.
  The soft light, the cool exhilarating night air were provocative of thought,
  and they walked up and down for a time in silence.</p>

  <p>Many thoughts were evidently working in Kennedy&rsquo;s mind, and they did
  not all seem to be bright or beautiful as the thoughts of youth should be.
  Julian&rsquo;s brain was busy, too; and as they paced up and down, arm in
  arm, the many-coloured images of hope and fancy were flitting thick and fast
  across his vision. He was thinking of his own future and of Kennedy&rsquo;s,
  whom he was beginning to love as a brother, and for whose moral weakness he
  sometimes feared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Julian,&rdquo; said Kennedy, suddenly breaking the silence;
  &ldquo;were you ever seized by an uncontrollable, unaccountable, irresistible
  presentiment of coming evil,&mdash;a feeling as if a sudden gulf of blackness
  and horror yawned before you&mdash;a dreadful <i>something</i> haunting you,
  you knew not what, but only knew that it was there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have had presentiments, certainly; though hardly of the kind you
  describe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Julian, I have such a presentiment now, overshadowing me with
  the sense of guilt, of which I was never guilty; as though it were the shadow
  of some crime committed in a previous state of existence, forgotten yet
  unforgotten, incurred yet unavenged.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Probably the mere result of a headache this morning, and the night
  air now,&rdquo; said Julian, smiling at the energetic description, yet pained
  by the intensity of Kennedy&rsquo;s tone of voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Julian! I hate all that stupid materialism. Depend upon it,
  some evil thing is over me. I wonder whether crimes of the future can throw
  their crimson shadow back over the past. My life, thank God, has been an
  innocent one, yet now I feel like the guiltiest thing alive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One oughtn&rsquo;t to yield to such feelings, or to be the victim
  of a heated imagination, Kennedy. In my own case at least, half the feelings
  I have fancied to be presentiments have turned out false in the
  end&mdash;presentiments, I mean, which have been suggested, as perhaps this
  has, by passing circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;God grant this may be false,&rdquo; said Kennedy, &ldquo;but
  something makes me feel uneasy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It will be a lying prophet, if you so determine, Kennedy. The only
  enemy who has real power to hurt us is ourselves. Why should you be agitated
  by an idle forecast of uncertain calamity? Be brave, and honest, and pure,
  and God will be with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be surprised,&rdquo; continued Julian, &ldquo;if
  you&rsquo;ve heard me say the same words before; they were my father&rsquo;s
  dying bequest to his eldest son.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be brave, and honest, and pure&mdash;&rdquo; repeated Kennedy;
  &ldquo;yes, you <i>must</i> be right, Julian. Look what a glorious sky, and
  what numberless &lsquo;patines of bright gold.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian looked up, and at that moment a meteor shot across the heaven,
  plunging as though from the galaxy into the darkness, and after the white and
  dazzling lustre of the trail had disappeared, seeming to leave behind the
  glory of it a deeper gloom. It gave too true a type of many a young
  man&rsquo;s destiny.</p>

  <p>Kennedy said nothing, but although it is not the Camford custom to shake
  hands, he shook Julian&rsquo;s hand that night with one of those warm and
  loving grasps, which are not soon forgotten. And each walked slowly back to
  his own room.</p>

  <h2>IX. &mdash; THE BOAT-RACE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;And caught once more the distant shout,<br>
  The measured pulse of racing oars<br>
  Between the willows.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;In Memoriam.<br></p>

  <p class="first">THE banks of &ldquo;silvery-winding Iscam&rdquo; were
  thronged with men; between the hours of two and four the sculls were to be
  tried for, and some 800 of the thousand undergraduates poured out of their
  colleges by twos and threes to watch the result from the banks on each
  side.</p>

  <p>The first and second guns had been fired, and the scullers in their boats,
  each some ten yards apart from the other, are anxiously waiting the firing of
  the third, which is the signal for starting. That strong splendid-looking
  young man, whose arms are bared to the shoulder, and &ldquo;the muscles all
  a-ripple on his back,&rdquo; is almost quivering with anxious expectation.
  The very instant the sound of the gun reaches his ear, those oar-blades will
  flash like lightning into the water, and &ldquo;smite the sounding
  furrows&rdquo; with marvellous regularity and speed. He is the favourite, and
  there are some heavy bets on his success; Bruce and Brogten and Lord Fitzurse
  will be richer or poorer by some twenty pounds each from the result of this
  quarter of an hour.</p>

  <p>The three are standing together on the towing-path opposite that little
  inn where the river suddenly makes a wide bend, and where, if the rush of men
  were not certain to sweep them forward, they might see a very considerable
  piece of the race. But directly the signal is given, and the boats start,
  everybody will run impetuously at full speed along the banks to keep up with
  the boats, and cheer on their own men, and it will be necessary for our trio
  to make the best possible use of their legs, before the living cataract pours
  down upon them. Indeed, they would not have been on the towing-path at all,
  but among the rather questionable occupants of the grass plot before the inn
  on the other side of the river, were it not for their desire to run along
  with the boats, and inspirit the rowers on whom they have betted.</p>

  <p>But what is this? A great odious slow-trailing barge looms into sight,
  nearly as broad as the river itself, black as the ferrugineous ferryboat of
  Charon, and slowly dragged down the stream by two stout cart horses, beside
  which a young bargee is plodding along in stolid independence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hi! hi! you clodhopper there, stop that infernal barge,&rdquo;
  shouted Bruce at the top of his voice, knowing that if the barge once passed
  the winning posts, the race would be utterly spoilt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;St&mdash;t&mdash;t&mdash;topp there, you cl&mdash;l&mdash;lown,
  w&mdash;w&mdash;will you,&rdquo; stuttered Fitzurse more incoherent than
  usual, with indignation.</p>

  <p>The young bargee either didn&rsquo;t hear these apostrophes, or
  didn&rsquo;t choose to attend to them, when they were urged in that kind of
  way; and besides this, as the men were entirely concealed from his view by
  the curve of the river, he wasn&rsquo;t aware of the coming race, and
  therefore saw no reason to obey such imperious mandates.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Confound the grimy idiot; doesn&rsquo;t he hear?&rdquo; said Bruce,
  turning red and pale with excitement as he thought of the money he had at
  stake, and remembered that the skiff on which all his hopes lay was first in
  order, and would therefore be most likely to suffer by any momentary
  confusion. &ldquo;Come, Brogten, let&rsquo;s stop him somehow before
  it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s cut the scoundrel&rsquo;s ropes,&rdquo; said Brogten
  between his teeth; and at once the three darted forward at full speed, at the
  very instant that the sharp crack of the final signal-gun was heard.</p>

  <p>It so happened that Julian and Lillyston had started rather late for the
  races, and had come up with the barge just as it had first neglected the
  summons of Bruce and Fitzurse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, bargee,&rdquo; said Lillyston good-humouredly, &ldquo;out of
  the way with the barge as quick as ever you can; there&rsquo;s a boat-race,
  and you&rsquo;ll spoil the fun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a race, be it?&rdquo; said the man, as he instantly
  helped Lillyston to back the horses. &ldquo;If them young jackanapes had only
  toald me, &rsquo;stead of blusterin&rsquo; that way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His speech was interrupted by Bruce, who, with his friends, had instantly
  sprung at the ropes, and cut them in half a dozen places, while the great
  heavy horses, frightened out of their propriety, turned tail and bolted away
  at a terrifically heavy trot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You big hulking blackguard,&rdquo; roared Brogten, who had been the
  first to use his knife, &ldquo;why the devil didn&rsquo;t you move when we
  told you? What business have louts like you to come blundering up the river,
  and spoil our races?&rdquo; And Fitzurse, confident in superior numbers, gave
  emphasis to the question by knocking off the man&rsquo;s cap.</p>

  <p>The bargee was a strongly-built, stupid, healthy-looking young man, of
  some twenty-three years old, who, from being slow of passion was all the more
  terrible when aroused. Not finding any vent for his anger in words, he
  suddenly seized Bruce, (who of the three stood nearest him), by the collar of
  his boating jersey, shook him as he might have done a baby, and almost before
  he was aware, pitched him into the river. Instantly swinging round, he gave
  Lord Fitzurse a butt with his elbow, which sent his lordship tottering into
  the ditch on the other side, and while his wrath was still blazing, received
  in one eye a blow from Brogten&rsquo;s strong fist, which for an instant made
  him reel.</p>

  <p>But it was only for an instant, and then he repaid Brogten with a cuff
  which felled him to the ground. Brogten was mad with fury. At that moment the
  men were running round the corner, at the bend of the Iscam, in full career,
  and hundreds on both sides of the river must have seen him sprawl before the
  man&rsquo;s blow. He sprang to his feet, and, blind with rage, lifted the
  clasp-knife with which he had cut the ropes. A second more, and it would
  have been buried to the handle in the right arm which, quick as lightning,
  the bargee raised to shield his face, when Brogten&rsquo;s arm was seized
  from behind by Lillyston, who wrested the knife from him, and pitched it into
  the river.</p>

  <p>Brogten turned round, still unconscious what he was about. Julian stood
  nearest him, and he thought it was Julian who had disarmed him. Old hatred
  was suddenly joined to outrageous passion, and clenching his fist, he struck
  Julian in the face. Julian started back just in time to evade the full force
  of the blow, and fearing a second attack, suddenly tripped his aggressor as
  he once more rushed towards him.</p>

  <p>But now the full tide of men had reached the spot; the barge had drifted
  helplessly lengthwise across the stream, and an angry circle closed round the
  chief actors in the scene we have described, while a hundred hasty voices
  demanded what was the row, and what the bargee meant by &ldquo;stopping the
  race in that stupid way?&rdquo; Meanwhile Bruce, wet and muddy, was
  declaiming on one side, and Fitzurse, bruised and dirty, on the other, was
  stammering his uncomprehended oaths; while a dozen men were holding Brogten,
  who, foiled a second time, and now in a dreadfully ungovernable passion, was
  struggling with the men who held him, and vowing murder against Julian and
  the bargee.</p>

  <p>It was no time for deliberation, nor are excited, hasty, and disappointed
  boys the most impartial of jurors. Julian and Lillyston were rapidly
  explaining the true state of the case to the few who were calm enough to
  listen; but all that appeared to most of the bystanders was, that a bargee
  had spoiled the event of the day, and assaulted two or three undergraduates.
  A cry arose to duck the fellow in the muddiest angle of the Iscam, and twenty
  hands were laid on his shoulder, to drag him off to his fate. But a sense of
  injustice, joined to strength and passion, are all but irresistible when
  their opponents are but half in earnest; and violently exerting his
  formidable muscles, the man shook himself free with a determination, agility,
  and pluck which, by a visible logic, showed the men how cruel and cowardly it
  was to punish him before they knew anything of the rights of the case.
  Lillyston&rsquo;s voice, too, began to be loudly heard, and several dons
  among the crowd exerted themselves to restore order out of the hubbub.</p>

  <p>There is nothing like a touch of manliness. A feeble, and fussy, and
  finicking little proctor, who happened to be on the bank, was pompously
  endeavouring to assert his dignity, and make himself attended to. He was just
  beginning to get indignant at the laughing contempt with which his impotent
  efforts were received, and was asking men for their names and colleges, in a
  futile sort of way, when a tall and stately tutor in the crowd raised his
  voice above the uproar, and said, &ldquo;Silence, gentlemen, if you please,
  for a moment.&rdquo; He was recognised and respected, and the men made room
  for him into the centre of the throng.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, my man, just tell us what&rsquo;s the matter.&rdquo; The man
  was beginning to tell them how wantonly his ropes had been cut, and he
  himself insulted, when Bruce broke in, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie, you beggar;
  we asked you to move, and you wouldn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll have you in prison
  yet, my fine fellow, you&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t make you pay for they ropes, you young pink-
  and-white monkey, my name ain&rsquo;t Jem&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did anybody see what really took place?&rdquo; asked the don,
  cutting short the altercation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rdquo; said Lillyston instantly; &ldquo;the fellow was
  civil enough, and began to back his horses the moment I told him there was a
  race, when these gentlemen ran up, abused him, struck him, and cut the
  ropes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, it&rsquo;s all very fine for you gentlefolk,&rdquo; said the
  man with bitter scorn, &ldquo;to take away a poor man&rsquo;s living for your
  pleasure. How do you think I&rsquo;m to pay for them ropes? Am I to take the
  bread out of the children&rsquo;s mouths, let alone being kicked and speered
  at? Hang you all, I ain&rsquo;t afeard o&rsquo; none o&rsquo; you; come on,
  the whole lot o&rsquo; you to one. I ain&rsquo;t afeard&mdash;not I,&rdquo;
  he said again, glaring round like a bull at bay, and stripping an arm of iron
  strength.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never cut your ropes, you brute,&rdquo; said Bruce, between his
  teeth, &ldquo;though you wouldn&rsquo;t move when we asked you
  civilly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s <i>that</i>, then?&rdquo; said the man, pointing to a
  bit of rope two inches long which Bruce still held dangling in his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you forget the facts, Bruce, in your
  excitement,&rdquo; said Lillyston, very sternly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Facts or not, I&rsquo;ll have you up for assault,&rdquo; said Bruce
  affectedly, wringing the mud out of his wet sleeve.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have me up for assault,&rdquo; mimicked the man, trying to mince
  his broad rough accents into Bruce&rsquo;s delicate tones; and he
  condescended to add no more, but turned round to catch his horses, which had
  trotted through the open gate of a neighbouring field, and were now quietly
  grazing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope, gentleman,&rdquo; said Brogten, bluntly, &ldquo;that
  you&rsquo;re not going to believe that blackguard&rsquo;s word against
  ours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You forget, sir,&rdquo; said Mr Norton, the tall don, &ldquo;that
  what the blackguard, (as you are pleased to call him), said is confirmed by a
  gentleman here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And impugned by three gentlemen,&rdquo; said Bruce, who felt how
  thoroughly he was in disgrace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to deny, Bruce, that you swore at the man first, and
  then cut his ropes, when he was already stopping his barge?&rdquo; asked
  Lillyston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean to say he wouldn&rsquo;t move when we told him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I appeal to Home,&rdquo; said Lillyston; &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t the
  man instantly stop when he understood why we wanted him to do so?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Julian, who, still dizzy with Brogten&rsquo;s
  blow, was standing a little apart, &ldquo;I am bound to say that the man was
  entirely in the right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am inclined to think so,&rdquo; said Mr Norton, with scorn in his
  eye; and so saying, he took the little proctor&rsquo;s arm, and strode away,
  while the crowd of undergraduates also broke up, and streamed off in twos and
  threes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to pay that fellow for his rope, Bruce?&rdquo; asked
  Lillyston; &ldquo;if not, <i>I do</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pay!&rdquo; said Brogten, with an explosion of oaths;
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll <i>pay</i> you and your sizar friend there for this, depend
  upon it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not afraid,&rdquo; said Lillyston, quietly. Julian only
  answered the threat by a bow, and the two walked off to the bargee, who, in
  despair and anger, was knotting together the cut pieces of his rope.</p>

  <p>Lillyston slipped a sovereign into his hand, and told him how sorry he was
  for what had happened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said the man, humbly; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
  hard thing for a poor chap to be treated as I&rsquo;ve been; but
  <i>you&rsquo;re</i> a rale gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, do me one favour, then. Promise not to say a word to, or take
  any notice of, those three fellows as they pass you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man promised; but there was no need to have done so, for furious as
  Brogten was, he and his companions were too crestfallen to take any notice of
  the bargee in passing, except by contemptuous looks, which he returned with
  interest. On the whole, it struck them that they would not make a
  particularly creditable display in hall that evening, and therefore they
  partook instead of a sumptuous repast in the rooms of Lord Fitzurse, who made
  up for the dirt which they had been eating by the splendour of his
  entertainment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be even yet with that fellow Home,&rdquo; muttered
  Brogten, as they were parting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not w&mdash;w&mdash;worth it,&rdquo; said the host.
  &ldquo;He&rsquo;s one of the g&mdash;g&mdash;ghouls; eh, Bruce&mdash;ha! ha!
  ha!&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>X. &mdash; CONTRASTS</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;And here was Labour his own bond slave; Hope<br>
  That never set the pains against the prize;<br>
  Idleness halting with his weary clog,<br>
  And poor misguided Shame and witless Fear<br>
  And simple Pleasure foraging for Death.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Wordsworth. <i>The Prelude</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">ALTHOUGH Julian did not immediately feel, and had not
  particular reason to dread, the results of Brogten&rsquo;s displeasure, yet
  it was very annoying to be on the same stair-case with him. It was a constant
  reminder that there was one person, and he near at hand, who regarded him as
  an enemy. For a time, indeed, Brogten tried a few practical jokes on his
  neighbour and quondam school-fellow, which gratified for the moment his
  desire for revenge. Thus he would empty the little jug of milk which stood
  every day before Julian&rsquo;s door into the great earthenware pitcher of
  water which was usually to be found in the same position or he would make a
  surreptitious entry into his rooms, and amuse himself by upturning chairs and
  tables, turning pictures with their faces to the wall, and doing sometimes
  considerable damage and mischief. Once Julian, on preparing to get into bed,
  found a neat little garden laid out for his reception, between the
  sheets&mdash;flower-beds and gravel walks, all complete. This course of petty
  annoyance he bore, though not without a great struggle, in dignified and
  contemptuous silence. He looked Brogten firmly in the face, whenever they
  chanced to meet, and never gave him the triumph of perceiving that his small
  arts of vexation had taken the slightest effect. He merely smiled when the
  hot-headed Kennedy suggested retaliation, and would not allow Lillyston to
  try the effect of remonstrance. It was not long before Brogten became
  thoroughly ashamed that his malice should be tried and despised, and he would
  have proceeded to more overt acts of hatred had he not been one day informed
  by Lillyston that the Hartonians generally had heard of his proceedings, and
  that if he continued them he would be universally cut. For, indeed, such
  practical jokes as Brogten attempted are now almost unknown at Camford, and
  every man&rsquo;s room is considered sacred in his absence. But although he
  desisted from this kind of malice, it was not long before Brogten was
  generally shunned by his former schoolfellows. He developed into such a
  thorough blackguard that, had it not been for his merits as an oarsman and a
  cricketer, even the countenance of Bruce and Lord Fitzurse would have been
  insufficient to prevent him from being deserted by all the undergraduates of
  Saint Werner&rsquo;s, except that small and wretched class who take refuge
  from vacuity in the society of cads, dog-fanciers, and grooms.</p>

  <p>Yet Brogten&rsquo;s Harton education, idle as he had been, sufficed to
  make him see that he was sinking lower and lower, not only in the
  world&rsquo;s estimation, but in his own. Unable to make the mental effort
  which the least approach to study would have required, he suffered his few
  intellectual faculties to grow more and more gross and stolid, and spent his
  mornings in smoking, drinking beer, or lounging in the rooms of some one as
  idle and discontented as himself. It was sad to see the change which even in
  his first term came over his face; it was not the change from boyhood to
  youth which gave a manlier beauty to the almost feminine delicacy of
  Julian&rsquo;s features, but it was a look in which effrontery supplied the
  place of self-dependence, and coarseness was the substitute for strength.
  Beer in the morning, and brandy in the evening, cards, and low company, and
  vice, made him sink into a degradation from which he was only redeemed by the
  still lingering ambition to excel in athletic sports, and by the manly
  exercises which rescued him for a time from such dissipation as would have
  incapacitated him from shining in the boat or in the field.</p>

  <p>Lillyston was a singular contrast with Brogten; originally they were about
  equal in ability, position, and strength. They had entered school in the same
  form, and, until Julian came, they had generally been placed near each other
  in the quarterly examinations. Both of them were strong and active, and
  without being clever or brilliant they were both possessed of respectable
  powers of mind. Both of them had been in the Harton eleven, and now each of
  them was already in the second boat of their respective clubs; but with all
  these similarities Lillyston was beginning to be one of the men most liked
  and respected among all the best sets of his own year, and was reading for
  honours with a fair chance of ultimate success, while Brogten was looked on
  as a low and stupid fellow, whose company was discreditable, and whose doings
  were a disgrace to his old school.</p>

  <p>The two presented much the same contrast as was also visible between
  Julian and Bruce. While Julian and Lillyston had mutually influenced each
  other for good, while they had been growing up together in warm and
  honourable friendship, thinking whatsoever things are pure and true and of
  good report, the other two had only fostered each other&rsquo;s vanity, and
  rather encouraged than checked each other&rsquo;s failings. At school they
  were always exchanging the grossest flattery, and the lessons and tendencies
  which each had derived from the other&rsquo;s society were lessons of
  weakness and sin alone. And now Bruce was looked on at Saint Werner&rsquo;s
  as a vain, empty fellow, living on a reputation for cleverness which he had
  never justified,&mdash;low, dressy, and extravagant, despised by the reading
  men, (whose society he affected to avoid), for his weakness and want of
  resolution; by the real athletes for his deficiency in strength and pluck,
  and by the aristocrats, (whose rooms he most frequented), for the
  ill-concealed obscurity of his father&rsquo;s origin, and the ill-understood
  source of his wealth. Since he first astonished the men of his year by the
  brilliancy of his entertainments and the gorgeousness of his rooms, he had
  steadily declined in general estimation among all whose regard was most
  really valuable, and he would have found few among his immense acquaintance
  who cared as much for <i>him</i> as they did for his good dinners and
  recherch wines. Julian, on the other hand, who knew far fewer men, could
  count among his new and old companions some real friends&mdash;friends who
  would cling to him in adversity as well as in prosperity, and who loved him
  for his own sake, whether his fortunes were in sunshine or in cloud. First
  among these newly-acquired friends he counted the names of Owen and Kennedy,
  among the old ones of Lillyston and De Vayne. But, besides these, he had been
  sought out by all the most distinguished men among the Saint Werner&rsquo;s
  undergraduates, while Mr Admer, who improved immensely on acquaintance, had
  introduced him to some of the most genial and least exclusive dons. Even Mr
  Grayson used to address him with something approaching to warmth, and so high
  was his general reputation, that he had no difficulty in making the
  acquaintance of every man of his college, whom he in the least cared to see
  or know.</p>

  <p>Brogten was one of those who perceived these contrasts, and the bitter
  intense malice with which they filled him was one of the evil feelings which
  helped to drag him down from following out his occasional resolutions for
  better things.</p>

  <p>Strange that a few weeks could produce such differences but so it was. At
  the end of those few weeks Bruce went back to take part in his mother&rsquo;s
  splendid theatricals and routs, with a consciousness of neglected
  opportunities and wasted times even if his conscience laid no worse sins to
  his charge. Brogten went back, cursing himself and all around him, with the
  violent self-accusations of a reprobate obstinacy, a man in vice, though
  hardly more than a boy in years. Kennedy went back happy on the whole, happy
  above all in the certainty that he had made in Julian one noble friend.
  Lillyston went back happy, well-pleased with the sense of duty done, and the
  prime of life well and innocently enjoyed. And Julian went back in the same
  train with De Vayne, happy too, with a mind strengthened and expanded, with
  knowledge deepened and widened, with an honourable ambition opening before
  him, and friends and a fair position already won. All these results had
  sprung from those few and swiftly-gliding weeks.</p>

  <p>The Christmas time passed very pleasantly for the Homes. They had few
  relations, and Lady Vinsear had dropped all intercourse with them, but they
  were happy in themselves. Violet, too, had the pleasure of forming an
  acquaintance with Kennedy&rsquo;s sister Eva, who, with her aunt, happened to
  be paying a short visit to a family in the neighbourhood. Frank and Cyril
  were at home for their holidays, and the house and garden at Ildown rang all
  day long with their merry voices and incessant games. Old Christmas
  observances were not yet obsolete in Ildown, and Yule logs and royal feasts
  were the order of the day. The bright, clear, frosty air&mdash;the sparkling
  sea and freshening wind&mdash;a lovely country, a united and cheerful family,
  and the delights of moderate study, made the weeks speed by in pure
  enjoyment. With his mother, his brothers, and Violet, Julian felt the need of
  no other society, but he corresponded with Kennedy and other college friends,
  and saw a great deal of Lord De Vayne, who continually rode over to pass the
  Sunday with them at Ildown, and sometimes persuaded all the Homes to come and
  spend the day with him and his mother in the beautiful but lonely grounds of
  Other Hall.</p>

  <p>Whenever they accepted the invitation, the young and pensive viscount
  seemed another man. He would join in the boys&rsquo; mirth with the most
  joyous alacrity, and talked to Violet with such vivacity that none who saw
  him would believe what a shade of melancholy usually hung over his mind. His
  life had been spent in seclusion, and he had never yet seen any to whom his
  heart turned with such affection as he felt for Julian and Violet. His mother
  observed it, and often thought that if she saw in Violet Home the future Lady
  De Vayne, a source of happiness was laid up for her only son, which would
  fulfil, and more than fulfil, her fondest prayers. It never occurred to her
  to think that he would do better to choose a bride among the noblest and
  wealthiest houses of England, rather than in the orphan family of a poor and
  unknown clergyman. What she sought for him was goodness and usefulness, not
  grandeur or riches; a lonely and sorrowful life had taught her at how slight
  a value rank and wealth are to be reckoned in any high or true estimate of
  the meaning of human life; nor did it add greatly to her desire for such a
  match that Violet, with her bright hair, and soft eyes, and graceful
  figure&mdash;with her sweet musical voice, and the rippling silver of her
  laugh, and the rich imagery which filled her fancy&mdash;might well have
  fulfilled the ideal of a poet&rsquo;s dream. But Violet was still very young,
  and none of Lady De Vayne&rsquo;s hopes had ever for an instant crossed her
  mind.</p>

  <p>Julian was at this time, and had been for some months, intensely occupied
  with the thought and desire of winning the Clerkland scholarship, a
  university scholarship of 60 pounds a year, open to general competition among
  all the undergraduates of less than one year&rsquo;s standing. This
  scholarship was the favourite success of Camford life. It stamped at once a
  man&rsquo;s position as one of the most prominent scholars of his year, and
  as the names of many remarkable men were found in the list of those who had
  already obtained it, it gave a strong prestige of future distinction and
  success. Julian had a peculiar reason for longing to gain it, because, with
  his Harton scholarship, it would not only enable him at once to enter his
  name as a pensioner, instead of a sizar, at Saint Werner&rsquo;s, but even
  make him independent of all help from his family and guardians. There would
  have been reasons sufficient to account for his passionate desire for this
  particular distinction, even independently of his natural wish to justify the
  general opinion of his abilities, and the eager ambition caused by the
  formidable numbers of the other competitors. In short, at this time, to
  obtain the Clerkland scholarship was the most prominent personal desire in
  Julian&rsquo;s heart, and could some genius have suddenly offered him the
  fulfilment of any one wish, this would undoubtedly have been the first to
  spring to his lips. He looked with emulation, almost with envy, on those who
  had won it before him; he almost knew by heart the list of Clerkland
  scholars; and when he returned to Camford, constantly discussed the chances
  of success in favour of the different candidates. Do not blame him; his
  motives were all high and blameless, although he at length turned over this
  thought so often in his mind as to recur to it with almost selfish iteration,
  and to regard success in this particular struggle as the one thing wanting to
  complete, or even to create his happiness.</p>

  <p>He could not refrain from mentioning it at home, although, for the sake of
  preventing disappointment, he generally avoided dwelling on any of his school
  or college struggles. Deprecating his own abilities, it made him doubly
  anxious to find that not only did his Saint Werner&rsquo;s contemporaries
  regard him as the favourite candidate, and bet upon him in the sporting
  circles, (although Brogten furiously took the largest odds against him), but,
  what was worse, his own family, always proud of him, seemed to regard his
  triumph as certain. Thus circumstanced, and most fondly avoiding every
  possibility of causing pain or disappointment to that thrice-loved circle, of
  which he regarded himself as the natural protector and head, he was more than
  ever determined to do his very utmost to prevent failure, and give them the
  lasting pride and pleasure which they would all receive by seeing his name in
  the public papers as Clerkland scholar.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, Julian, and let&rsquo;s have a row or a sail,&rdquo; said
  Cyril one morning to him, as he sat at work. &ldquo;Frank and I have nothing
  to do to-day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not to-day, Cyril, my boy. I really must do some work; you know De
  Vayne made me ride with him yesterday, and I&rsquo;ve done very little the
  last day or two.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish I liked work as you do, Julian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t only that I like work, (though I do),&rdquo; said
  Julian; &ldquo;but you know a good deal depends on it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I know!&rdquo; said Cyril; &ldquo;you mean the Clerkland
  scholarship; but never mind, Julian, Lord De Vayne told me you were sure of
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; said Julian, a little anxiously; &ldquo;then for
  goodness&rsquo; sake, don&rsquo;t believe him. It&rsquo;s very kind of him to
  say so&mdash;but he&rsquo;s quite mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, you always say so beforehand, you know. You used to say that
  about the Harton scholarship, Julian, and yet you see? Do come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; said Julian, smiling a little sadly.
  &ldquo;But, Cyril, don&rsquo;t, pray, say anything of that kind to mother or
  to Violet, for if I should fail it would make me doubly sad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cyril, thanking Julian, and still laughingly prophesying success, ran out
  to tell Frank; and, when he had gone, Julian stamped his foot passionately on
  the ground, and said half-aloud, &ldquo;I <i>will</i> get this Clerkland, I
  <i>will</i> get it, I <i>must</i> get it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paused a moment, and then, raising his eyes and hands to heaven, prayed
  that &ldquo;God would do for him that which was best for his highest
  welfare;&rdquo; but even as he prayed, he secretly determined that obtaining
  the Clerkland scholarship was, and must necessarily be, the best piece of
  worldly prosperity that could possibly happen to him.</p>

  <h2>XI. &mdash; SCREWED IN</h2>

  <p class="first">READER, if the latter part of the preceding chapter has been
  dull to you, it is because you have never entered into the devouring ambition
  which, in a matter of this kind, actuates a young man&rsquo;s heart when he
  is aiming at his first grand distinction&mdash;an ambition which, if
  selfishly encouraged, becomes dangerous both to health and peace, and works
  powerfully, perhaps by a merciful provision, to the defeat of its own darling
  hope.</p>

  <p>As long as Julian had been at home, a thousand objects helped to divert
  his thoughts from their one cherished desire; but when he returned to
  Camford, finding the Clerkland a frequent subject of discussion among the
  men, even in hall, and constantly meeting others who were as absorbed in the
  thought of the approaching examination as himself, he once more fell into the
  vortex, and thought comparatively of little else.</p>

  <p>As yet he had had no means of measuring himself with others, except so far
  as the lecture-room enabled him to judge of the abilities of some few in his
  own college. Under these circumstances all conjecture must have seemed to be
  idle; but somehow or other at Camford, by a sort of intuition, the exact
  place a man will ultimately take is often prophesied from the first with
  wonderful accuracy. Saint Werner&rsquo;s, being by far the largest college at
  Camford, supplied the majority of the candidates, and Julian, Owen, and
  Kennedy were all three mentioned as likely to be first; but the rival ranks
  of Saint Margaret&rsquo;s boasted their champions also, and almost every
  small college nursed some prodigy of its own, for which it vehemently
  predicted an easy and indisputable success.</p>

  <p>Owen was the competitor whom Julian most really feared; educated at
  Roslyn, a comparatively small school, his scholarship was not so ready and
  polished as that acquired by the training of Marlby and Harton, but, on the
  other hand, he had improved greatly in the short time he had been at Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s, and besides his sound knowledge he had a strong-headed common
  sense, and a clearness and steadiness of purpose, more valuable than a quick
  fancy and refined taste. In composition, and in all the lighter and more
  graceful requirements of a classical examination, Julian had an undoubted
  superiority, but Owen was his equal, if not his master, in the power of
  unravelling intricacies and understanding logic; and, besides this, Owen was
  a better mathematician, and, although classics had considerable
  preponderance, yet one mathematical paper always formed part of the Clerkland
  examination. Kennedy who, if he had properly employed his time, would have
  been no mean rival to either of them, had unfortunately been so idle, and
  continued to be so gay and idle even for the weeks immediately preceding the
  examination, that they all felt his chance to be gone. He acknowledged the
  fact himself, with something between a laugh and sigh, and only threatening
  to catch them both up in the classical tripos, he resigned all hope for
  himself, and threw all his wishes into the scale of Julian&rsquo;s
  endeavours. And although Owen was liked and respected, there was no doubt
  that Julian was regarded throughout the University as the popular candidate;
  the Hartonians especially, who had carried off the prize for several years,
  were confident that he would win them another victory.</p>

  <p>As the time drew near, Julian became more and more feverish with
  eagerness, and his friends feared that he would hinder, by over reading, his
  real probability of success. Kennedy felt this most strongly, but being
  himself engaged in the competition, was afraid that any attempt to divert
  Julian&rsquo;s thoughts would not have a disinterested look. Lillyston and De
  Vayne, unrestrained by such motives, did all they could to take him from his
  books, and amuse him by turning his attention to other subjects; but with
  such strong reasons for exertion, and so much depending on success or
  failure, the Clerkland scholarship continued ever the prominent subject of
  Julian&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>

  <p>At last the long looked for week arrived. After chapel, on the Sunday
  morning, De Vayne invited himself to breakfast with Julian, and continued in
  his company the greater part of the day, going with him to the University
  sermon. He entirely forbade Julian even to allude more than once to the
  coming examination, and managed in the evening to get him to come to his
  rooms, where, with some other Hartonians and Kennedy, they spent a very
  pleasant evening.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; he said to Julian, as he strolled with him to
  his stair-case across the starlight court; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t stay up
  to-night. In quietness and confidence shall be your strength.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The examination was to last a week, and Julian rose for it refreshed and
  cheerful on Monday morning. The papers suited him excellently, and his hopes
  rose higher and higher as he felt that in each paper he had done to the
  utmost of his knowledge and ability. He had not been able to afford a private
  tutor during the term, with whom he might have discussed the papers, but he
  sent his Iambics and Latin verse to Mr Carden at Harton, who wrote back a
  most favourable and encouraging judgment of them, and seemed to regard
  Julian&rsquo;s success as certain. Julian had implicit confidence in his
  opinion, for Mr Carden entered very warmly into all his hopes and wishes, and
  kept up with him an affectionate correspondence, which had helped him out of
  many intellectual difficulties, and lessened the force of many a
  temptation.</p>

  <p>The papers usually lasted from nine till twelve in the morning, and from
  two to four in the afternoon. It was on the Friday morning, when only three
  more papers remained, that Julian found Mr Carden&rsquo;s kind and hopeful
  letter lying on his breakfast-table at eight o&rsquo;clock; he read it with a
  glow of pleasure, because he knew that he could rely thoroughly on the
  accuracy and truth of his old tutor&rsquo;s judgment, and as he read and re-
  read it, his hopes rose higher and higher. Finishing breakfast, he began to
  build castles in the air, and to imagine to himself the delight it would be
  to write and tell the Doctor and Mr Carden of this new leaf to the Harton
  laurels. Never before had he a more reasonable ground for favourable
  expectation, and he began almost to run over in his mind the sort of letter
  he would write, and the kind of things he would say. Leaning over his
  window-sill, he enjoyed the cool feeling of the early spring breeze on his
  brow and hair, and then, finding by his watch that it was time to start, he
  took his cap and gown, and prepared to sally out to the senate-house.</p>

  <p>It was the custom of the gyp, when he had laid breakfast, and put the
  kettle on the fire, to go away and &ldquo;sport the oak,&rdquo; (<i>i e</i>,
  shut the outer door), so as to prevent any one from coming into the rooms
  until their owner was awake and dressed. Julian therefore was not surprised
  to see his door &ldquo;sported,&rdquo; but was surprised to find that, when
  he lifted the latch, the door did not open to his touch. He pushed it with
  some force, and then kicked it with his foot to see if some stone or coal had
  not caught against it, but the door still remained obstinately closed; he put
  his shoulder against it, fancying that some heavy weight like the coal-box or
  water-pitcher might have been placed outside,&mdash;but all in vain; the
  thick door did not even stir, and then there flashed upon Julian the bitter
  truth that he had been screwed in. He understood now the stifled titter which
  he fancied he had heard after one of his most violent efforts to get out.</p>

  <p>In one instant, before he had time to think, a fit of blind, passionate,
  uncontrollable fury had clouded and overpowered Julian&rsquo;s whole mind.
  Almost unconscious of what he was doing, he kicked the door with all his
  might, and beat on it savagely with his clenched fists until his knuckles
  streamed with blood; he forgot everything but the one burning determination
  to get out at all hazards, and to wreak on Brogten, whom he felt to be the
  author of his calamity, some desperate and terrible revenge. But the thick
  oak door, screwed evidently with much care; and in many places, resisted all
  his efforts, and no one came to help him from outside. The gyp, who was
  usually about, happened to have gone on an errand; the stair-case was one of
  the most secluded in the college; the Fellow who was Julian&rsquo;s nearest
  neighbour had &ldquo;gone down&rdquo; for a few days, and it was improbable
  that any one ever heard him except Brogten, to whom, he thought, every sound
  of his angry violence would be perfect music.</p>

  <p>All was useless, and Julian, as he strode up and down the room, clenched
  his hands, and bit his lips in passionate excitement. Suddenly it struck him
  that he would escape by the window; but looking out for the purpose, he found
  that, when he had jumped on the sloping roof below him, he was still thirty
  feet above the ground, which, in that place, was not the turf of the bowling-
  green, but a hard gravel road. Giving up the attempt in despair he sat down,
  and covered his face with his hands; but instantly the picture of the senate-
  house, with the sixty candidates who were trying for the scholarship, all
  writing at some new paper&mdash;while he was thus cut off, (as he thought),
  from the long-desired accomplishment of all his hopes&mdash;rose before his
  eyes, and springing up once more he seized the poker, and raising it over his
  shoulder like a hammer, brought down the heavy iron knob with a crash on the
  oaken panels. He struck again and again, but, by a shower of fierce blows,
  could only succeed in covering the door with deep round dents. Finally he
  seized the heaviest chair in the room, and dashed it savagely with one heavy
  drive against the unyielding oak; a second blow shivered the chair to
  splinters, and Julian, a compulsory prisoner at that excited moment, flung
  himself on the sofa, furious and weary, with something that sounded like a
  fierce imprecation.</p>

  <p>Full twenty minutes had been occupied by his futile and frantic efforts,
  and for a few moments longer he sat still in a stupor of grief and rage.
  Meanwhile, several of the other competitors for the Clerkland had noticed his
  absence in the senate-house, and Owen and Kennedy kept directing anxious
  glances to the door, and dreading that he was ill. At last half an hour had
  elapsed, and Kennedy, unable any longer to endure the suspense, went up to
  the examiner and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One of the candidates is absent, sir. Would you allow me to go and
  inquire the reason?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; asked the examiner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Home, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed. But I am afraid I cannot allow you to leave the senate-
  house; the rules, you know, on this subject are necessarily very
  strict.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then, sir, I will merely show up what I have written, for I am sure
  there must be some unusual reason for Home&rsquo;s absence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Mr Kennedy, pray don&rsquo;t do so,&rdquo; said the
  examiner, who knew how well Kennedy had been doing; &ldquo;I will send the
  University marshal to inquire for Mr Home; it is a very unusual compliment to
  pay him, but I think it may be as well to do so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It so happened that, as the marshal crossed the court to Julian&rsquo;s
  rooms, Lillyston and De Vayne, who were strolling towards the grounds, caught
  sight of him, and went with much curiosity to inquire the object of his
  errand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Home not in the senate-house,&rdquo; said Lillyston, on hearing the
  marshal&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;Good heavens, what can be the matter?&rdquo;
  and without waiting to hear more, he darted to Julian&rsquo;s door, and
  called his name.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; said Julian in a fretful and angry
  voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why are you sported? And why aren&rsquo;t you in for the
  Clerkland?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What! So you are screwed in,&rdquo; said Lillyston in deep
  surprise; &ldquo;wait three minutes, Julian, three minutes, and I will let
  you out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He sprang down-stairs, four steps at a time, borrowed a screwdriver at the
  porter&rsquo;s lodge, was back in a moment, and then with quick and skilful
  hand he drew out, one after another, the screws which had been driven deep
  into the door.</p>

  <p>Julian lifted the latch inside, and Lillyston saw with surprise and pain
  his scared and wild glance. Julian said not a word, but rushed past his
  friend, and burst furiously into Brogten&rsquo;s room. Fortunately Brogten
  was not in, for the moment he heard steps approaching, he had purposely gone
  out; but Lillyston followed Julian, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, this is folly, Julian; you have not a moment to lose. You
  will be already nearly an hour late, and remember that the Clerkland may
  depend upon it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He suffered himself to be led, but as he walked he was still silent, and
  seemed as though he were trying to gulp down some hard knot that rose in his
  throat. His expression was something totally different from anything that
  Lillyston had ever observed in him, even from a boy, and his feet seemed to
  waver under him as he walked.</p>

  <p>De Vayne joined them in the court, and was quite startled to see Julian
  looking so ill. He saw that it was no time to trouble him with idle
  inquiries, and merely pressed him to come into his rooms and take some wine
  before going to do the paper. Julian silently complied. The kind-hearted
  young viscount took out a bottle of wine, of which Julian swallowed off a
  tumblerful, and then, without speaking a word, strode off to the
  senate-house, which he reached pale and agitated, attracting, as he entered,
  the notice and commiseration of all present.</p>

  <p>The examiner, with a kind word of encouragement, and an inquiry as to the
  cause of his delay, which Julian left unanswered, promised to allow him in
  the evening as much additional time for doing the paper as he had already
  lost. Julian bowed, and walked to his place.</p>

  <p>And now that he was seated, with the paper before him, he found himself in
  a condition to do nothing. His mind was in a tumult of wrath and sorrow.
  Bitter sorrow that his hopes should be shattered; fiery wrath that any one
  should have treated him with such malignant cruelty. His brain swam giddily,
  and his head throbbed with violent pain. His hands were still raw and
  bleeding with his efforts to burst open the door; and the consciousness that
  his whole appearance was wild, and that several eyes were upon him, unnerved
  him so completely, that he was quite unable to collect or control his
  scattered senses. He made but little progress. The clock of Saint
  Mary&rsquo;s told the passing hours, and at twelve Julian found himself with
  nothing written except a few half-finished and incoherent sentences which he
  was ashamed to show up. Dashing the nib of his pen on the desk, he split it
  to pieces; and then, tearing up his papers, was hurrying out, when the voice
  of the examiner suddenly recalled him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You have not shown me up any papers, Mr Home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; he answered sullenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed! But why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have not done any, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really. I am sorry for that. It is a serious matter, for you have
  been doing remarkably well, and&mdash; Are you not feeling well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, not exactly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hum! Well, it is a great pity; a <i>great</i> pity; a <i>very</i>
  great pity. However&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There seemed to be no more to say, and as Julian&rsquo;s mind was in too
  turbulent a state to allow of his being communicative, he did not trust
  himself to make any remark, and left the room.</p>

  <p>Kennedy, who came up with him as he went out, asked what was the matter;
  but as he only answered with an impatient gesture, and evidently seemed to
  wish to be alone, Kennedy left him and went to inquire of Lillyston what had
  happened, while Julian hastened to the solitude of his own room, and breaking
  with his poker one of the outer hinges of his door, to secure himself from a
  second imprisonment, flung himself on a chair, and pressed his hands to his
  burning forehead. In his bitterness of soul he half determined to abandon all
  further attempt to gain the Clerkland, and dwelt, with galling recurrence, on
  the anguish of defeated aims. But the sound of the clock striking the hour of
  examination started him into sudden effort, and almost mechanically he seized
  his cap and gown, and went out without food and unrefreshed.</p>

  <p>Although he endeavoured, with all his might, to shake off all thought of
  the morning&rsquo;s insult and misfortune, he only partially succeeded, and
  when he folded up his papers, he felt that the fire and energy which had
  shone so conspicuously during the earlier days of the examination, and had
  imparted such strength and brilliancy to his efforts, were utterly
  extinguished, and had left him wandering and weak. When the time was over, he
  went to De Vayne&rsquo;s rooms, and said abruptly&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;De Vayne, will you lend me your riding-whip?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said De Vayne, starting up to meet him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you going to have a ride? I wish you would ride my horse;
  I&rsquo;ll hire another, and come with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t want a ride.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want the whip for, then?&rdquo; said De Vayne
  uneasily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing. Let me go; it must be time for you to go to
  hall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to dine in hall to-day,&rdquo; said De Vayne.
  &ldquo;Dining at the high table, with none but dons to talk to, is dull work
  for an undergraduate. Stop! you shall dine with me here, Julian. I know you
  won&rsquo;t care to go to hall to-day. Nay, you shall,&rdquo; he said,
  putting his back against the door; &ldquo;I shall be as dull as night without
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He made Julian stay, for it happened that at that moment his gyp brought
  up dinner, and Julian, hungry and weary, was tempted to sit down. De Vayne,
  who only too well divined his reason for borrowing the whip, was delighted at
  having succeeded in detaining him, for he knew that the only time when Julian
  would be likely to meet Brogten was immediately after hall.</p>

  <p>Wiling away the time with exquisite tact&mdash;talking to him without
  pressing him to talk much in reply&mdash;turning his thoughts to indifferent
  subjects, until he had succeeded in arousing his interest&mdash;the young
  viscount detained his guest till evening, and then persuaded him to have tea.
  Lord De Vayne played well on the piano, and knowing Julian&rsquo;s passion
  for music, was rewarded for his unselfish efforts by complete success in
  rousing his attention. He played some of the finest passages of a recent and
  beautiful oratorio, until Julian almost forgot his troubles, and was ready to
  talk with more freedom and in a kindlier mood.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You surely won&rsquo;t want the whip now,&rdquo; said De Vayne in
  some dismay, as Julian picked it up on saying good-night.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall,&rdquo; answered Julian. &ldquo;Good-
  night!&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>XII. &mdash; A GUST OF THE SOUL</h2>

  <p class="quote">&ldquo;<i>Once more will the wronger, at this last of
  all.<br>
  Dare to say &lsquo;I did wrong,&rsquo; rising in his fall?&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Browning.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE story of Brogten&rsquo;s practical joke, and the
  circumstances which made it so unusually disgraceful, spread with
  lightning-like rapidity through Saint Werner&rsquo;s College; and when he
  swaggered into hall with his usual self-confident air, he was surprised to
  find himself met with cold and even with frowning looks. Snatches of
  conversation which went on around him soon showed him the reason of the
  general disapprobation; and when he learnt how violently the current of
  popular opinion was beginning to set against him, and how unfavourable a view
  was taken of his conduct, he began seriously to regret that he had given the
  reins to his malice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder now if Home were to lose the Clerkland; he
  was <i>sure</i> of it before this morning,&rdquo; said one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a cursed shame!&rdquo; echoed another. &ldquo;I never in my
  life heard a more blackguard trick. That fellow Brogten has lost the
  Hartonians the scholarship; lucky if he hasn&rsquo;t lost it to Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s too. Perhaps that Benedict man will get it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, Kennedy,&rdquo; said a third, &ldquo;if I were you or
  Lillyston, or any other of Home&rsquo;s particular friends, I&rsquo;d duck
  Brogten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait till we see whether Home <i>does</i> lose the
  scholarship first,&rdquo; said Lillyston. &ldquo;<i>If</i> he does, Brogten
  deserves anything; but I have strong hopes yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know Home,&rdquo; said Kennedy, &ldquo;and he would never forgive
  such an interference, or I declare I should be inclined to do it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like to see you do it,&rdquo; thundered Brogten, from a
  farther end of the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have just given my reasons for not seeing fit to do it,&rdquo;
  said Kennedy, with a curl of the lip. &ldquo;By the bye, Mr Brogten,&rdquo;
  he continued sarcastically, &ldquo;I hope that you don&rsquo;t, after this,
  expect to be paid any of the <i>bets</i> you have made against Home&rsquo;s
  getting the Clerkland?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my betting-book,&rdquo; replied Brogten, flinging it
  at Kennedy, whom it struck in the face, and who took no further notice of the
  insult than to pick up the book, and throw it into the great brazier, full of
  glowing charcoal, which stands in the centre of Saint Werner&rsquo;s
  hall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, confound you!&rdquo; cried Brogten, springing
  up. &ldquo;Do you think there are no bets in it but those about the
  Clerkland?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Keep your missiles to yourself, then,&rdquo; said Kennedy, while
  Brogten burnt his fingers in the vain attempt to rescue his book.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve at least hedged, or behaved as judiciously in
  the case of your other bets as in those about the Clerkland,&rdquo; suggested
  one of his sporting friends.</p>

  <p>This last sneer and insinuation was too much, and it galled the proud man
  to the quick to hear the laugh of scorn which followed it. He turned round,
  seized his cap, and flinging at Kennedy a look of intense and concentrated
  hatred, left the hall, and rushed up to his rooms.</p>

  <p>To do Brogten justice, he had never intended for a moment to affect
  Julian&rsquo;s chance of ultimate success, when he enjoyed the mean
  satisfaction of screwing up his door. He had regarded him with indeed
  dislike, which received a tinge of deeper intensity from the envy, and even
  admiration, with which it was largely mingled. But although he had calculated
  that his trick might be more telling and offensive if done at this particular
  opportunity, and although he had quite sufficient grudge against his former
  school-fellow to wish him a deep annoyance, yet he would never have dreamed
  of wilfully thwarting his most cherished aims, or materially affecting his
  prospects and position. So vile a malice would have been intolerable to any
  one, and the thought of it was thoroughly intolerable to Brogten, in whom all
  gleams of honourable feeling were by no means extinguished, however dormant
  they might seem. It had never entered into his thoughts to anticipate the
  violent consequences which his act had produced; and when told of
  Julian&rsquo;s passion and suffering, he had felt such real remorse that he
  had even half intended to wait for him as he went to hall, and there, (in a
  quasi-public manner, since some men were sure to be standing about on the
  hall steps), to endure the mortification of expressing his regret to the man
  whom he had chosen to treat as his enemy. But when he found himself cut and
  jeered at&mdash;when he was even met by the suggestion that he had intended
  basely to serve his own pecuniary interests at Julian&rsquo;s expense&mdash;a
  method of swindling which he had never for one instant contemplated&mdash;all
  his softer and better feelings vanished at once, and created a brutal
  hardness in his heart, which now once more he was striving in solitude to
  mollify or remove.</p>

  <p>And he succeeded so far that, while brooding savagely over the venomous
  shafts of sarcasm and ridicule with which Kennedy had wounded him, he
  gradually softened his feelings towards Julian, by transferring them in
  tenfold virulence against Julian&rsquo;s nearest friend. Home and he had been
  school-fellows after all, and Julian had never done him any wrong; on the
  contrary, he liked the boy; he remembered distinctly how the first seeds of
  ill-will against him had been sown, by the reserve with which Julian, as a
  school-fellow, had received his advances. Without being rude and uncivil, he
  had yet managed to hold aloof from him, and as Brogten was in some repute at
  Harton, when Home came, and was moreover an Hartonian of much longer
  standing, his sensitive pride had been stung by the fact that the &ldquo;new
  fellow,&rdquo; whose pleasant face and manners had attracted his notice, did
  not at once and gratefully embrace his proffered friendship. Circumstances
  had tended to widen the breach between them, but secretly he liked Home
  still, and would have gladly been his friend. &ldquo;And, after all,&rdquo;
  he thought, &ldquo;Home has never once retaliated any injury which I have
  undoubtedly done him; he has never done me any harm. Even in the affair at
  the boats, he only did what was quite justifiable, and I was far more in the
  wrong than he was when I struck him. And now they all say I shall have
  prevented him from getting this confounded Clerkland. And I know how he
  longed for it, and how much all his hopes and wishes were fixed upon it. Upon
  my word, when I come to think of it, it was a very blackguard thing of me to
  do, and I wish I had been at the bottom of the sea before I did it. I
  think&mdash;yes&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ll go and see Home, and ask his pardon;
  yes, upon my word I need his forgiveness, and would give a good deal to get
  it. He&rsquo;s a grand fellow after all. I wish he&rsquo;d take me as a
  friend. I should be infinitely better for it; and I <i>will</i> be better,
  too.&rdquo; And as he thus reasoned with himself, Brogten began to yearn for
  better things, and for Julian&rsquo;s friendship as a means of helping him to
  higher aims; and he remembered the lines&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;I would we were boys as of old,<br>
  In the field, by the fold;<br>
  His outrage. God&rsquo;s patience, man&rsquo;s scorn,<br>
  Were so easily borne.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>So his thoughts ran on, but when it occurred to him that no such
  humiliation on his part would perhaps go very far to mend the general disgust
  with which he had been greeted, he began to waver again. &ldquo;What business
  had they to assume that I meant the worst? I may be a bad fellow, but,&rdquo;
  (and a mental oath followed), &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a black-leg after all.
  That fellow Kennedy&mdash;curse him!&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be even with him yet. I
  swear that he shall rue it. I&rsquo;ll be a very fiend in the vengeance I
  take&mdash;curse him, curse him!&rdquo; And stamping his heel furiously on
  the floor, he swallowed some raw brandy, and began to pace up and down his
  room.</p>

  <p>The conflict of his thoughts lasted, almost without intermission, till
  evening. Finally, however, his heart softened towards Julian, as he ran over
  in his mind all the circumstances of the day. Cheating his conscience with
  the fancy that he was conquering his feelings of revenge and hate, while he
  was only displacing them with others of a deeper dye, he at last determined
  to go up at once to Julian&rsquo;s room, ask his pardon openly, honestly, and
  unreservedly, confess his past unworthy malice, and obtain, if possible, at
  least, Julian&rsquo;s forgiveness, perhaps even his friendship, in return for
  so great a victory over himself.</p>

  <p>It <i>was</i> a victory over himself, and no slight one. For at least five
  years he had been nursing into dislike an inward feeling of respect for his
  enemy, and now to humble himself so completely before him, required a
  struggle of which he had hardly supposed himself capable, and of which he was
  secretly a little proud. It inspired him with better hopes for the future,
  and gave him a pledge of combating successfully other vicious propensities
  which had gained an ascendency over him.</p>

  <p>Hesitatingly he went up to Julian&rsquo;s rooms; he saw the broken door,
  and it made him waver. All was silence inside, but still he hoped that Julian
  was in, because he felt sure that he should never persuade his natural pride
  to consent to such a sacrifice again. But yet, <i>what should he say</i>? He
  had been thinking of a thousand set forms of apology, but they all vanished,
  as, with beating heart, he knocked, a little loudly, at the door.</p>

  <p>Julian, too, had been brooding on the events of the day, and fanning every
  now and then into fierce bursts of flame the dying embers of his
  morning&rsquo;s indignation. He took the worst view, and had every reason to
  take the worst view, of Brogten&rsquo;s intentions. He had received at his
  hands many wrongs, and an incivility as unvarying as it was undeserved. Of
  course he could not tell that this rudeness was but the cover of a real
  desire for cordiality between them, and now he fully believed that Brogten
  had intentionally, deliberately, and with malice prepense, formed a deep laid
  scheme to dash from his lips the cup of happiness as he was in the very act
  of tasting it. The success which had seemed in his very grasp would have
  removed the poverty, which had been one of the severest trials, not to
  himself only, but to those whom he most dearly loved; it was the
  thing&mdash;the <i>one</i> thing&mdash;of which he had thought, and for which
  he had prayed. &ldquo;And now it was wrenched from him,&rdquo; so he thought,
  &ldquo;by this mean and dastardly villain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had determined to horse-whip Brogten, at all hazards, though he knew
  that Brogten was far stronger than himself. De Vayne&rsquo;s manoeuvre had
  disconcerted his intention, for he could not carry it out in cold blood; but
  even now he felt by no means sure that he was right to take passively an
  insult which, if unresented, might, he thought, be repeated, some other time,
  and which, if frequently repeated would render college life wholly
  intolerable. All this was floating through his mind, when there came a
  loud&mdash;he took it for an insolent&mdash;knock at the door, and his enemy
  stood before him.</p>

  <p>His enemy stood before him, humbled and remorseful, with the words of
  apology on his lips, and his heart full of such emotions as might have
  enabled Julian to convert him from an enemy into a lasting and grateful
  friend. But when he saw him, in one instant furious, unreasoning, headlong
  anger had again seized Julian&rsquo;s mind&mdash;the more easily because he
  had already yielded to it once. Without stopping to hear a word&mdash;without
  catching the gentler tone of Brogten&rsquo;s rough voice&mdash;without
  noticing his downcast expression of countenance&mdash;Julian sprang up,
  assumed that Brogten had come to ridicule or even insult him, glared at him,
  clenched his teeth, and then seizing De Vayne&rsquo;s riding-whip, laid it
  without mercy about Brogten&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>

  <p>During the first few blows, Brogten was disarmed by intense surprise. Of
  all receptions, this was the only one which it had never occurred to him to
  contemplate. He had imagined Julian bitter, sarcastic, cold; he had prepared
  himself for a torrent of passionate and overwhelming invective; he had
  thought how to behave if Julian remained silent, or rejected with simple
  contempt his stammered apology; but to be horse-whipped by one so much weaker
  than himself&mdash;by one whom he remembered to have pitied and patronised
  when he came to Harton, a delicate rosy-cheeked boy&mdash;this he had
  certainly never thought of. Julian had almost expended his rage in half a
  dozen wild blows before Brogten was startled from his surprise into a
  consciousness of his position.</p>

  <p>But when he did realise it all the demon took possession of his heart. He
  seized Julian by the collar, wrenched the whip out of his hand, and raised
  the silver knob at the end of the handle. What fearful hurt Julian might have
  received from so heavy a weapon in so powerful a hand, or how far
  Brogten&rsquo;s fury might have transported him, none can tell; but at that
  very moment he heard a step on the stairs, which arrested his violence, and
  the moment after Lillyston entered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Lillyston indignantly, as he caught the almost
  diabolical expression of Brogten&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Not content with doing
  your best to ruin Home, you are using personal violence to one not so strong
  as yourself. Come, sir, you have felt what I can do before. Drop that whip,
  or take the consequences.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop, Hugh,&rdquo; said Julian sullenly; &ldquo;I horse-whipped him
  first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; said Lillyston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Brogten slowly, while his voice shook with
  passion; &ldquo;yes, he did horse-whip me, and I took it. Note that, you
  Lillyston, and don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m afraid of <i>you</i>. And as for
  you, Home, listen to me. I came here solely to tell you that though I screwed
  you in, I never dreamt that such results would follow. I never
  dreamt&mdash;so help me, God!&mdash;of doing more than causing you ten
  minutes&rsquo; annoyance; and now, when I was told how it had hindered you in
  the examination, I was heartily sorry and ashamed of what I had done,
  and,&rdquo;&mdash;he began to speak lower and faster, as the remembrance of a
  better mood came over him&mdash;&ldquo;and I came here, Home, to ask your
  forgiveness. <i>Yes; I to beg pardon of you, and humbly and honestly too</i>.
  And now you see how you have received me. Yes,&rdquo; he continued fiercely;
  &ldquo;no word between us from henceforth. You have horse-whipped me, sir,
  and I, who never took a blow from man yet without returning it, have taken
  your horse-whipping. Take your whip,&rdquo; he said, flinging it to the end
  of the room; &ldquo;and after that never dare to say that all accounts are
  not squared between us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lillyston made room for him to pass. With a lowering countenance he turned
  from them, and they continued silent till they had heard his last heavy
  footfall as he went down the echoing stairs.</p>

  <p>Lillyston sat on the sofa, and Julian kept his eyes fixed on the floor.
  There seemed nothing to talk about, so Lillyston merely said, &ldquo;Good-
  night, Julian. I came to advise you to go to bed early, and so get a good
  night&rsquo;s rest, that you may be <i>yourself</i> to-morrow. You have not
  been yourself to-day. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But a worse evil had happened to Julian that day than hindrance in his
  career of ambition and hope. He had lost a golden opportunity for an act of
  Christian forgiveness which might have had the noblest influence on the life
  of an erring human soul. He had lost a golden opportunity of doing lasting
  good, and that, too, to one who hated him. Alas, it is too seldom that we
  have power in life to raise up them that fall! Julian felt bitterly, he felt
  even with poignancy, Brogten&rsquo;s closing words; but it was too late now
  to offer the forgiveness which would have been invaluable to his persecutor,
  and would have had a healing effect on his own troubled thoughts so short a
  time before. All this gave deeper vexation to Julian&rsquo;s heart as he went
  moodily to bed.</p>

  <p>And Brogten? He sat sullenly over his fire till the last spark died from
  its ashes, and his lamp flickered out, and he shivered with cold. &ldquo;It
  is of no use to conquer myself,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;it is of no use to
  do better or be better if this comes of it. Horse-whipped, and by him!&rdquo;
  But, as he had said, he no longer grieved over Julian&rsquo;s injury.
  <i>That</i> was wiped off by the horse-whipping, and he had now made himself
  understand that his inward respect for Home was deeper than the long
  superficial quarrel that had existed between them. It was against Kennedy
  that the current of his anger now swept this ever-growing temptation for
  revenge. His craving, often yielded to, became terrible in its virulence, and
  from this day forward there was in Brogten&rsquo;s character a marked change
  for the worse. He ever watched for his opportunity, certain that it would
  come in time; and this encouragement of one bad passion opened the floodgates
  for a hundred more. And so on this evening he went on selling himself more
  and more completely to the devil, till the anger within him burned with a red
  heat, and as he went to bed the last words he muttered to himself were,
  &ldquo;That fellow Kennedy shall rue it; curse him, he shall rue it to his
  dying day.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>XIII. &mdash; THE CLERKLAND SCHOLARSHIP</h2>

  <p class="first">HOW different our smaller trials look, when they are seen
  from the distance of a quiet and refreshful rest. Utterly wearied, Julian
  slept deeply, and when the servant awoke him next morning, he determined that
  as the errors of yesterday were irreparable, he would at least save the
  chances of to-day.</p>

  <p>He rose at once, and read during breakfast the letter from home, which
  came to him from one of his family nearly every day. This morning it was from
  Violet, and he could see well how anxiously they were awaiting the result of
  his present examination, and yet how sure they were that he would succeed.
  Unwilling to trouble them by the painful circumstances of the day before, he
  determined not to write home again until the decision was made known.</p>

  <p>This morning&rsquo;s paper was to be the last, and Julian applied to it
  the utmost vigour of his powers. After the first few moments, he had utterly
  banished every sorrowful reflection, and when the clock struck twelve, he
  felt that once more he had done himself justice. He answered with a smiling
  assent, the examiner&rsquo;s expressed hope, that his health was better than
  it had been the day before, and joining Owen as he left the senate-house,
  found, on comparing notes, that he had done the paper at least as well as his
  dreaded but friendly rival.</p>

  <p>His spirits rose, and his hopes revived in full. Shaking off examination
  reminiscences, he proposed to De Vayne, Kennedy, and Lillyston a bathe in the
  Iscam, and then a long run across the country. They started at once, laughing
  and talking incessantly on every subject, except the Clerkland, which was
  tabooed. Ten minutes&rsquo; run brought them to a green bend of the Iscam,
  where a bathing-shed had been built, and after enjoying the bathe as only the
  first bathe in a season can be enjoyed, they struck off over the fields
  towards some neighbouring villages, which De Vayne had often wanted to visit,
  because their old churches contained some quaint specimens of early
  architecture. On the way they passed through Barton Wood, and there found
  some fine specimens of herb Paris, with large bright purple berries resting
  on its topmost trifoliations, one of which Julian eagerly seized, saying that
  his sister had long wanted one for her collection of dried plants.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you want the one you have gathered, De Vayne, for some
  botanist,&rdquo; said Lillyston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;yes&mdash;at least I meant it for a lady, too; but
  it&rsquo;s of no use now,&rdquo; he said stammering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For a lady&mdash;of no use <i>now</i>,&rdquo; said Kennedy
  laughing; &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind,&rdquo; said Julian, as he noticed De Vayne&rsquo;s
  blush, and divined that he had meant the plant for Violet, but without
  knowing how much he was vexed by losing the opportunity of doing something
  for her.</p>

  <p>They had a beautiful walk; De Vayne made little sketches of the windows
  and gargoyles of the village churches, and they all returned in the evening
  to a dinner which Lillyston had ordered in his own rooms, and which gave the
  rest an agreeable surprise when they got in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Julian,&rdquo; whispered De Vayne as they went away, &ldquo;would
  you mind my sending that herb Paris to Vi&mdash; I beg pardon, to Miss Home,
  to your sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh dear, yes, if you like,&rdquo; said Julian carelessly, surprised
  at the earnestness of his manner about such a trifle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only, you know, because Miss Home had heard that they
  were to be found near Camford, and asked me to get her one for her
  herbarium.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, send it by all means. I shouldn&rsquo;t like you to
  break a promise.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said De Vayne; &ldquo;and I suppose that Miss
  Home wouldn&rsquo;t mind my sending it in a letter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Julian, laughing; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no
  doubt she&rsquo;ll be highly flattered. Here&rsquo;s the plant. Good-
  night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What could he have meant,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;by making such
  a fuss about the trifolium, and by blushing so when Kennedy chaffed him? He
  surely can&rsquo;t have fallen in love with my dear little Vi.&rdquo; Now he
  thought of it, many indications seemed to show that such was really the case,
  and Julian contemplated the thought with singular pleasure. It did him good
  by diverting his attention from all harassing topics, and knowing that Violet
  was well worthy of Lord De Vayne, and could make him truly happy, while his
  high character and cultivated intellect rendered him well suited for her, he
  hoped in his secret heart that some day might see them united.</p>

  <p>But Lord De Vayne, full of delight, took the plant, dressed it carefully,
  cut it to the size of an envelope, and then with a thrill of exquisite
  emotion sat down to write his letter to Violet Home.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear Violet,&rdquo; he wrote, after having chosen a good sheet of
  note-paper and a first-rate pen, &ldquo;you remember that I promised to find
  you a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear Violet&mdash;no, that won&rsquo;t quite do,&rdquo; he said, as
  he read over what he had written, &ldquo;at least not yet. How pretty it
  looks! What a charming name it is! I wish I might leave it, it does look so
  happy. I wonder whether it would do to call her Violet? No, I suppose not; at
  least not yet&mdash;not yet!&rdquo; and the young viscount let his fancy
  wander away to Other Hall, and there by the grand old fireplace in the
  drawing-room he placed in imagination a slight graceful figure with soft fair
  hair, and a smile that lighted up an angel face,&mdash;and by her side he sat
  down, and let his thoughts wander through a vista of golden years.</p>

  <p>Waking from his reverie, he found that his letter would be too late for
  the post, so he deferred it till Monday, and then wrote&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Dear Miss Home&mdash;I enclose you a specimen of the
  herb Paris, which I promised to procure for you, if I could find one in
  Barton Wood. Julian was the actual discoverer, but has kindly allowed me to
  send it in fulfilment of my promise; he is quite well, and we are all hoping
  that you may hear in a day or two that he has got the Clerkland scholarship.
  With kindest remembrances to Mrs Home and your brothers, I remain, dear Miss
  Home, very truly yours, De Vayne.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Little did Violet dream that this commonplace note had given its author
  such deep pleasure, and that before he despatched it he had kissed it a
  thousand times for her sake, and because it was destined for her hand.</p>

  <p>De Vayne would not have added the allusion to the Clerkland, but that
  rumours were already gaining ground in Julian&rsquo;s favour. The universal
  brilliancy of his earlier papers had already attracted considerable
  attention, and from mysterious hints at the high table, De Vayne began to
  gather almost with certainty that Julian was the successful candidate.
  Similar reports from various quarters were rife among the undergraduates, and
  were supposed to be traceable to competent authorities.</p>

  <p>Wednesday evening came, and next morning the result was to be made known.
  As certainty approached, and suspense was nearly terminated, Julian awaited
  his fate with sickening, almost with trembling anxiety. At nine o&rsquo;clock
  he knew that the paper on which was written the name of the Clerkland scholar
  would be affixed to the senate-house door, but he did not venture to go and
  read it. He knew that, if he were successful, a hundred men would be eager to
  rush up to his rooms with the joyful intelligence; if unsuccessful, he still
  trusted that he had one or two friends sufficiently sincere to put an end to
  his painful anxiety by telling him the news.</p>

  <p>Nine o&rsquo;clock struck. Oh, for the sound of some footstep on the
  stairs! Many must know the result by this time. Julian&rsquo;s hopes were
  still high, and he could not fail to hear of the numerous and seemingly
  authoritative reports which had ascribed success to him. He pressed his hands
  hard together, as he prayed that what was most for his welfare might be
  granted to him, and thought what boundless delight success would bring with
  it. What a joy it would be, above all, to write home, and gladden their
  hearts by the news of his triumph.</p>

  <p>Every moment his suspense made him more feverish, and now the clock struck
  a quarter past nine, and he feared that in this case no news must be bad
  news. He leaned out of the window, and at this moment Mr Grayson strolled
  across the bowling-green. Then he heard another don, who was following him,
  call out&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, do you know that the Clerkland is out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; said Mr Grayson, with unusual show of interest.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Who do you think has got it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A Saint Werner&rsquo;s man, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, who is it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What was the answer&mdash;Owen or Home?&mdash;at that distance the names
  sounded <i>exactly alike</i>.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, then, I am very sorry for&mdash;&rdquo; Again Julian
  <i>could</i> not, with his utmost effort, catch the name with certainty; and,
  unable any longer to endure this state of doubt, he seized his cap and gown,
  when the sound of a slow footstep stopped him.</p>

  <p>But it was Brogten&rsquo;s step, and Julian heard him pass into his own
  room.</p>

  <p>A moment of breathless silence, and then another step, or rather the steps
  of two men; he detected by the sound that they were Lillyston and De Vayne.
  In one moment he would know the&mdash; Was it the best or the worst? He stood
  with his hand on the handle of the door; but it seemed as if they would never
  get to the top of the stairs. Why on earth were they so slow?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Julian, as they came in sight, &ldquo;is the
  Clerkland out?&rdquo; He knew it was, but would not ask them the result.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they both said; and Lillyston added, in a sorrowful
  tone of voice, &ldquo;I am sorry for you, Julian, but Owen has got
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian grew very pale, and for one second reeled as if he would faint.
  Lord De Vayne caught him as he staggered, and added eagerly, &ldquo;But you
  are most honourably mentioned, Julian, &lsquo;proxime accessit,&rsquo; and an
  allusion to your illness during one paper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing,&rdquo; muttered Julian; &ldquo;please leave me by
  myself.&rdquo; They were unwilling to leave him, and both lingered, but he
  entreated them to go, and respecting his desire for solitude they left him
  alone.</p>

  <p>Julian found relief in a burst of passionate tears. He flung himself on
  the ground and cursed his birth, and his hard fate, and above all he cursed
  Brogten, who, as was clear, had been the cause, the sole cause, as Julian
  obstinately said, of his heavy misfortune. &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; he
  murmured, &ldquo;a sizar, an orphan, poor, without relations, with others
  depending on me, with my own way to make in the world, and now he has lost me
  the one thing I longed for, the one thing which would have made me
  happy,&rdquo; and as Julian kept brooding on this, on the loss of reputation,
  of help, of hope, his eyes grew red and swollen, and his temples throbbed
  with pain. He was far from strong, and the shock of news that shattered all
  his hopes, and dashed rudely to the ground his long, long cherished desires,
  came more heavily upon him, because his constitution, naturally delicate, had
  suffered much during the last week from study and over anxiety. The necessity
  of writing home haunted him,&mdash;to his mother and sister, whose pride in
  him was so great, and who hoped so much for the honours which they thought
  him so sure to win,&mdash;to his brothers who had seen his diligence, and who
  would be deeply sorry to know that it had been in vain; to them at least he
  would be forced to announce the humiliating intelligence of defeat. He might
  leave his other friends to learn it from accidental sources, but oh, the
  bitterness of being obliged to announce it for himself, to those to whose
  disappointment he was most painfully alive, and oh, the intolerable plague of
  receiving letters of commiseration.</p>

  <p>He could not do anything, he could not read, or write, or even think,
  except of the one blow which had thus laid him prostrate. He leaned over his
  window-sill, and stared stupidly at the great stone bears carved on the
  portals of Saint Margaret&rsquo;s; his eyes wandered listlessly over the
  smooth turf of the Fellows&rsquo; bowling-green, and the trim parterres full
  of crocus and anemone and violet which fringed it; he watched the boats skim
  past him on the winding gleams of the Iscam, and shoot among the water-lilies
  by the bridge and then he stared upwards at the sun, trying to think of
  nothing until his eyes watered, and then the sight of a don in the garden
  below made him shrink back, to avoid observation, into his own room.</p>

  <p>Some of the Saint Werner&rsquo;s men would be coming soon to condole with
  him. What a nuisance it would be! He got up and sported the door. This action
  recalled in all their intensity his bitterest and angriest feelings, and he
  flung the door open again, and threw himself full length on the sofa, until a
  sort of painful stupor came over him, and he became unconscious of how the
  time went by.</p>

  <p>At length a slight sound awoke him, and he saw De Vayne standing by him.
  De Vayne was so gentle in heart and manner, so full of sympathy and kindness,
  that of all others he was the one whom at that moment Julian could best
  endure to see.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that you will think me very
  foolish, De Vayne. But to me everything almost depended on this scholarship,
  and you can hardly tell how absolutely it had engrossed my hopes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is very natural that you should feel it, Julian. But I came to
  ask if you would like me to save you the trouble of writing home to-day. I
  could say more, you know, than you could,&rdquo; he added with a pleasant
  smile, &ldquo;of the splendid manner in which you acquitted yourself, of
  which I have heard a great deal that I will tell you some day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, De Vayne. I should be really and truly grateful if you
  would. They will expect to hear by to-morrow, and I know that if I write now,
  I shall be saying something bitter and hasty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, I will. Are you inclined for a stroll now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Julian, unwilling to encounter the many
  eyes which he knew would look on him with curiosity to see how he bore his
  loss.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning then; I shall come again soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do, I shall like to see <i>you</i>,&rdquo; said Julian; and De
  Vayne went away, thinking with some happiness, that if he had won
  Julian&rsquo;s affection, that would be something towards helping him to win
  Violet&rsquo;s too.</p>

  <p>Julian had no intention that any strange eye should see how much he had
  felt his disappointment, so when Mr Admer came to see him, he gave no sign of
  vexation, and they talked indifferently for a few minutes, till Mr Admer
  said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Home, I&rsquo;m sorry you haven&rsquo;t got this scholarship.
  Not that it makes the least difference, you know, really. No sensible man
  would have thought one atom the better of you for getting it, and even your
  reputation stands just as high as before.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, I see you take it to heart rather; all very natural, but when
  you&rsquo;re my age you&rsquo;ll think less of these things. There are higher
  successes in the world than these small University affairs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But they aren&rsquo;t small to me,&rdquo; said Julian. &ldquo;Not
  to men up here,&rdquo; said Mr Admer.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;&lsquo;They think the rustic cackle of their body<br>
  The murmur of the world.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps, after all, if you had got it, it would only have helped to
  make you as fussy, as foolish, and as self-important as Jones, and Brown, and
  Robinson, who, because they are dons, think themselves the most important
  people in England, when really they are only conspicuous for empty-headedness
  and conceit; or as the senior Wrangler, who entering the theatre at the same
  moment as the queen, bowed graciously on all sides in acknowledgment of the
  acclamations. As it is, Home, you are a man who ought to do something in the
  world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian could not help smiling at Mr Admer&rsquo;s usual style, and would
  have found some relief in arguing with him, had not Hazlet entered, whose
  very appearance put Mr Admer to a precipitate flight. There could not have
  been any human being less likely to give Julian any effectual consolation at
  such a moment, and he could not help sighing as Mr Admer left him to his
  persecutor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fugit improbus ac me sub cultro linquit,&rdquo; he said
  appealingly, secure in Hazlet&rsquo;s ignorance of the Latin tongue; but Mr
  Admer only shook his head significantly, and disappeared.</p>

  <p>With his black shining hair brushed down in unusual lankiness over his
  receding forehead, and with an expression of sleek resignation unusually
  sanctimonious, Hazlet sat down, and gave a half groan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;dear Julian&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Home, if you please, Hazlet,&rdquo; interrupted Julian.</p>

  <p>Hazlet was a little taken aback, but he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, dear Home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Home <i>only</i>, if you please,&rdquo; said Julian still more
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! I see you are in a rebellious&mdash;excuse me, dear&mdash;I
  mean Home,&mdash;a rebellious spirit. I feared it would be so when I saw that
  godless young clergyman with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian relieved his disgust by an expression of impatience.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have no doubt, dear Ju&mdash;, I mean Home&mdash;I have no
  doubt,&rdquo; he continued, with a gusto infinitely annoying, &ldquo;that you
  needed this rod. I am afraid that you are as yet unconverted; that you have
  as yet no saving, no vital sense of Christianity. Some sin, perhaps, needs
  correction; some&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Confound your intolerable impudence and cant!&rdquo; said Julian,
  starting from his seat, aroused by his hypocritical prate into unwonted
  intolerance; and he suddenly observed, by the cowering attitude which Hazlet
  assumed, that the worthy youth was afraid of receiving at his head the water-
  bottle, on which Julian&rsquo;s hand was resting. Julian thought it best to
  avoid the temptation, and hoping Hazlet would take the hint, he said,
  &ldquo;Forgive my rudeness, Hazlet, but I am very tired and annoyed just now;
  in fact, I am hardly in a condition to talk with, as you see, and you are
  really <i>quite</i> incapable of saying anything to help me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Hazlet had come prepared to say his say, and did not attempt to
  move.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, with a sigh which seemed to express
  satisfaction&mdash;(some people always sigh when they thank
  God)&mdash;&ldquo;I am afraid you are unprepared for the consolations of
  religion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of such a religion as yours, most certainly,&rdquo; interrupted
  Julian, with haughty vehemence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The natural man, you see&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped as he saw
  Julian&rsquo;s hand fidgeting towards the water-bottle. &ldquo;Ah! well, you
  will have still to sit at the sizars&rsquo; table, and dine on the
  Fellows&rsquo; leavings; perhaps it might inscrutably be good for you to bear
  the yoke&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Had the fellow come to insult him? Was he there on purpose to gratify his
  malice at another&rsquo;s misfortune, under the pretext of pious reflections?
  Half-a-dozen times Julian had thought so, and thought so correctly.
  Hazlet&rsquo;s very little and very ignorant mind had been fed into self-
  complacency by the cheering belief that he and his friends formed a select
  party whose future welfare was secure, while &ldquo;the world&rdquo; was very
  wicked, and destined to everlasting burning; and in proportion to his gross
  conceit, was he nettled with the evident manner in which Julian, though
  without any rudeness, avoided his company even at Ildown, where he reigned
  with undisputed sway among his own admiring circle of <i>gynaikazia</i>.
  (Excuse the word, gentle reader; it is Saint Paul&rsquo;s&mdash;not mine.)
  Hazlet had come there, though in the depth of his hypocrisy he hardly knew it
  himself, to enjoy a little triumph over Julian&rsquo;s pride, and to pour a
  little vinegar, in the guise of a good Samaritan, on wounds which he knew to
  be bleeding still.</p>

  <p>In saying the last sentence, in which he cut Julian to the very quick,
  Hazlet had seemed to his victim&rsquo;s excited imagination to be actually
  smacking his lips with undisguised delight. &ldquo;Ah, you will have still to
  dine at the sizars&rsquo; table on the Fellows&rsquo; leavings.&rdquo; Julian
  knew that the form of the sentence made it most maliciously and odiously
  false;&mdash;and that this hypocritical son of Belial should address him at
  such a moment in such a way was so revolting to his own generous spirit, that
  he could endure it no longer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What did you say?&rdquo; he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, my dear Ju&mdash;, Home, I mean&mdash;poverty is no
  disgrace to you, you know. Some of the sizars are pious men, I have no doubt,
  and I dare say the Fellows leave&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I swear this is too much,&rdquo; said Julian, using the only oath
  that ever in all his life-time crossed his lips. &ldquo;You canting and
  mean&mdash; Pshaw! you are beneath my abuse. <i>Sizar</i> indeed! there, take
  that, and begone.&rdquo; He had meant to empty the tumbler in his face, but
  his hand shook with passion, and the glass flew out of it, and after cutting
  the top of Hazlet&rsquo;s head, fell broken on the floor.</p>

  <p>With a howl of dismay Hazlet fled to his own rooms, where, having
  satisfied himself that the cut had done little other harm than leaving some
  red streaks upon his damp and lanky hair, he put over it some strips of
  plaster as large as he conveniently could, and then with a lugubrious
  expression went to hall, and gratified his malice by buzzing and babbling
  among his fellows all sorts of lies and exaggerations about Julian&rsquo;s
  conduct and state of mind. When Kennedy came in, however, he put an abrupt
  end to Hazlet&rsquo;s calumnies by handling his own tumbler with so
  significant a glance, that Hazlet assumed a look of terror, and, amid shouts
  of laughter, retired with all speed out of reach of the danger.</p>

  <p>Lillyston, always a firm and faithful friend, was grieved to the soul to
  hear of Julian&rsquo;s condition; for, without believing half that Hazlet
  said, it was at least clear that Julian had shown some violence, and, if
  Hazlet was to be trusted, &ldquo;had sworn at him in a manner perfectly
  awful.&rdquo; What had come over Julian of late? Since that fit of
  uncontrollable and lasting passion which had overpowered him when he was
  screwed in, he did not seem to have recovered that noble moral strength and
  equilibrium which was usually conspicuous in his character. The restlessness
  which had prevented him from doing the paper, the half sullen silence through
  the day, the horse-whipping of Brogten, the second outburst of unchecked
  feeling at the loss of the scholarship, and finally, this treatment of
  Hazlet, caused Lillyston a deep regret that his friend should have strayed so
  widely from his usual calm and manly course. It was as if one staggering blow
  had loosened all the joints of his moral armour, and left room for successive
  wounds. He determined to go and see him before chapel, and, if possible, get
  him to come and spend the evening quietly with him; he was only prevented
  from going at once by supposing that Julian would be dining by himself to
  avoid meeting any one in hall, and he did not wish to disturb him at his
  lonely meal.</p>

  <p>Julian&rsquo;s head was aching with mortification, passion, and fatigue;
  it seemed as if he had but one thought to which he could turn, and that this
  was a thought of weariness and pain. He dwelt much less on his own defeat
  than on the disappointment which he knew it would cause to Violet and his
  young brothers. He knew well that Mrs Home would bear it with equanimity,
  because she regarded all the events of life, however painful, with the same
  quiet resignation, and trusted ever in the gentle dealing and loving purposes
  of His hand who guides them all. Poor Julian longed to be able to regard it
  in this light too, but he had suffered the angry part of his nature to gain
  the victory, and his human reason was now being torn by his lion heart.</p>

  <p>Unable to endure the notion of going to hall, which would be a painful
  reminder that the opportunity to which he had long looked for emancipation
  from his sizarship had passed by, he determined to take some wine, in the
  hope that it would support him till the evening. He could not of course
  afford to give wine parties, but he always kept a few bottles in his rooms
  for medicinal purposes, or to offer to any stranger who might come to visit
  him. Taking out a decanter, he sat down in his armchair, and drank a glass or
  two. The wine exhilarated him; as he had scarcely tasted anything all day, it
  got rapidly into his head, and in a few minutes his thoughts seemed in a
  tumult of delirious emotion. Pride and passion triumphed over every other
  feeling; after all, what was the scholarship to him? Tush! he looked for
  better things in life than scholarships. He would discard the petty successes
  of pedantry, and would seek a loftier greatness. He had been a fool to
  trouble himself about such trifles. And as these arrogant mists clouded his
  fancy, he broke out into irregular snatches of unmeaning song.</p>

  <p>It was a saint&rsquo;s-day evening, and consequently chapel was at a
  quarter past six instead of six, and the undergraduates wore surplices in
  chapel instead of their ordinary gowns. On saints&rsquo;-days there is always
  a choral service at Saint Werner&rsquo;s College, and the excellence of the
  choir generally attracted a large congregation. To Julian, who was fond of
  music, these saint&rsquo;s-day services had a peculiar interest; and now
  while his brain was swimming with the fumes of wine, he determined to go to
  chapel, and imagined to himself the pleasure he should feel in striding
  haughtily through the throng of men up the long aisle to the sizar&rsquo;s
  seat, to show by his look and manner that his courage was undaunted, and that
  his self-confidence rose superior to defeat. Although the chapel-bell had not
  yet begun to ring, he put out his cap and surplice, and sat down to drink
  more wine.</p>

  <p>Just as the clock struck six, Lillyston knocked at Julian&rsquo;s
  door.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aha! old fellow,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;you are just in time to
  have a glass of wine before chapel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Lillyston coldly, sick at heart to see a
  fresh proof of his friend&rsquo;s unworthy excitement, but without realising
  as yet his true condition.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tush! you think I care about that trumpery Clerkland? Not I!
  Won&rsquo;t you have some wine?&mdash;no? well, I shall, and then I&rsquo;m
  going to chapel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His flushed countenance, and excited manner, joined to the harsh tones of
  his generally pleasant and musical voice, produced on Lillyston&rsquo;s mind
  a feeling of deep pain and shame, and when with unsteady hand, Julian
  endeavoured to pour out for himself a fresh glass, and in doing so spilt the
  wine in great streams over the table, Lillyston saw that he was in an utterly
  unfit state to go to chapel, and that the attempt to do so would certainly
  draw upon him exposure and disgrace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Julian,&rdquo; he said gently; &ldquo;you are not in a condition to
  go to chapel; you must not think of it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Julian with a stupid stare.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; he replied slowly, &ldquo;that the wine has got into
  your head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A laugh, half hysterical, half defiant, was the only answer, and Julian
  began to put on his surplice, wrong side out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Julian, I beg of you to stay here as you would avoid
  ruin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh! I am not a child, as you seem to think. You are&mdash;Yes,
  you are a fool, Lillyston.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Pained to the very heart, Lillyston wavered for a moment, but a glance at
  Julian decided him. Five years of happy uninterrupted friendship, five years
  during which he had regarded his friend&rsquo;s stainless character with
  ever-growing pride and affection, determined him at all hazards to save him
  from the effects of this temporary possession. Firmly, but quietly, he
  planted his back against the door, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear Julian, I beseech you not to go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The tone of voice, the mention of his own name recalled Julian for a
  moment, but the sound of the chapel-bell renewed his determination, and he
  answered, &ldquo;Nonsense. Come, make room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You <i>shall not go</i>, Julian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I will,&rdquo; shouted he angrily; &ldquo;how dare you prevent
  me; stand aside.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lillyston did not stir, and rendered furious by opposition, Julian
  grappled with him. It required all Lillyston&rsquo;s strength to retain his
  position against this wild assault, but he managed to do so without
  inflicting any hurt; and when Julian paused, Lillyston noticed with a sense
  of relief that the chapel-bell had ceased to ring.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I WILL go,&rdquo; said Julian, madly renewing the struggle. But
  with all his efforts he could not stir Lillyston from the door, and only
  succeeded in tearing his surplice from the neck downwards. He paused, and,
  baffled of his intention, glared at his opponent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The clock has now struck,&rdquo; said Lillyston calmly, &ldquo;and
  the doors will be shut. You are too late to get in.&rdquo; Julian stamped
  impatiently on the floor, and prepared to close with Lillyston again, but now
  Lillyston stepped from the door, and as he slowly went out, turned round and
  said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Julian, do you call this being brave or strong? Can you let one
  disappointment unman you so utterly?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Be brave, and honest, and pure, and God will be with you.&rdquo;
  The words flashed into light from the folded pages of Julian&rsquo;s memory,
  and with them the dim image of a dead face, and the dying echo of a
  father&rsquo;s voice.</p>

  <h2>XIV. &mdash; MR CARDEN</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;Pol pudere quam pigere proestat totidem
  literis.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Plautus <i>Trinum</i>, Two, 2.</p><br>

  <p class="first">WHO has not felt, who does not know, that one sin yielded
  to, that one passion uncontrolled, too often brings with it a train of other
  sins, and betrays the drawbridge of the citadel to a thousand enemies
  beside?</p>

  <p>It had been so with Julian Home, and in proportion to the true strength
  and beauty of his character, was the poignancy of his bitterness when he
  awoke the next morning, and calmly reviewed the few last excited, prayerless,
  and unworthy days. Surely after so many proofs of weakness, surely after
  emotions and acts so violently inadequate to the circumstances which had
  caused them, his best friends must despise him as utterly as he despised
  himself.</p>

  <p>He arose that morning strong out of weakness. He determined that he would
  be checked no longer by unavailing regrets, and that his repentance should be
  open and manly, as his prostration had been conspicuous. Fortified by the
  humiliating experience of his own want of strength he sought for help in
  resolute determination and earnest prayer. After breakfast, his first step
  was to call on Owen, and congratulate him with hearty and unaffected
  simplicity on his success&mdash;a success which Owen generously acknowledged
  to be due solely to Julian&rsquo;s misfortune. It was much more difficult to
  call on Hazlet, but this, too, Julian felt to be his duty; and distasteful as
  it was, he would not shrink from performing it. Hazlet received him with a
  ludicrous air of offended dignity, and was barely overcome into a tone of
  magnanimous forgiveness by Julian&rsquo;s frank apology. On the whole, Julian
  decided that it would be best not to call on Brogten, lest, by so doing, he
  should seem to be reminding him of the consequences of his enmity under the
  appearance of expressing a regret. It only remained therefore to see
  Lillyston, and to this visit Julian looked with unmitigated joy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forgive me, Hugh,&rdquo; he said, as he entered the room;
  &ldquo;from this time forward I shall owe you a new debt of gratitude; you
  have saved me from I know not what disgrace.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lillyston was delighted to see him look like his old self once more. The
  thunder-cloud which had been hanging on his brow was dissipated, and the
  sullen expression had wholly passed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of debt, Julian,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;between
  friends, you know, there are no obligations&mdash;they are merged in the
  friendship itself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am amazed at my own intolerable folly, Hugh. I hope this is the
  last time that I shall yield to such storms of passion. I have much to be
  ashamed of.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Julian,&rdquo; said Lillyston, changing the subject,
  &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t think any more of this Clerkland, for potentially
  you got it, as everybody acknowledges; <i>dynamei</i> you were successful, if
  not <i>ezgo</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t <i>mean</i> to let it discourage me,&rdquo; said
  Julian, &ldquo;though the potential is mightily different from the
  actual.&rdquo; Nor <i>did</i> he suffer it to discourage him, or weaken his
  endeavours. His life soon began to flow once more in its usual, even, and
  quiet course. It did not take him long to discover that it was possible to
  live happily without the Clerkland, and he wondered in himself at the
  intensity of the desire to obtain it, which he had suffered to overpower him.
  He felt no touch of envy towards Owen, whose friendship he began to value
  more and more, and who voluntarily told him, from information that he had
  derived from the examiners themselves, that the decision had long hung in a
  doubtful scale. In fact, the scholarship would have been divided between both
  of them but for one of the examiners, who hardly appreciated Julian&rsquo;s
  merits. It was so well understood that Julian must have been the successful
  candidate but for the one fatal paper on Monday morning, that he rather
  gained than lost in reputation from the result of the competition.</p>

  <p>It was a few days after these events that Julian received from Mr Carden a
  pressing invitation to spend a Sunday with him at Harton. Glad of a change,
  he easily obtained an exeat, and went down on the Saturday morning. Even the
  half-year since he had left had made a perceptible change in the old place.
  There were many new faces, and many old ones had disappeared, so that,
  already, he began to feel himself half a stranger among the familiar scenes.
  But alike from boys and masters he received a kindly greeting, and Mr Carden
  entertained him with a pleasant and genial hospitality. The only thing which
  pained him was the obvious change for the worse in Mr Carden&rsquo;s health.
  He wore a sadder expression than of old, and though he made no remark about
  his health, yet every now and then his face seemed to be suddenly contracted
  by a throb of pain.</p>

  <p>On the Monday morning, when it was necessary for Julian to return to
  Camford, Mr Carden called him into his study after breakfast, and asked him
  to choose any book he liked, as a farewell present, from the shelves.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But why a <i>farewell</i> present, Mr Carden?&rdquo; asked Julian,
  laughing. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ever going to ask me to Harton
  again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr Carden with a sad smile, &ldquo;never again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I resign my mastership at the end of this term,&rdquo; he
  continued, in answer to Julian&rsquo;s inquiring look; &ldquo;my health is so
  uncertain that I feel unequal any longer to these most arduous, most
  responsible duties. Perhaps, too,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I may be a little
  disappointed in the result of my labours; but, at any rate, though as yet few
  are aware of it, this is my last month at Harton&mdash;so choose one of my
  books, Julian, as a farewell present.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian expressed his real sorrow at Mr Carden&rsquo;s failing health.
  &ldquo;If you go away,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it will seem as if the chief
  tie which bound me to dear old Harton was suddenly snapped.&rdquo; He chose
  as his memento a small volume of sermons which Mr Carden had published in
  former days, and asked him to write his name on the title-page.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the master, &ldquo;you shall have that book if you
  like; but I mean you to have also a more substantial memorial of my library.
  Here, Julian, this book I always destined to be yours some day; you may as
  well have it now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took down from the shelves a richly bound copy of Coleridge&rsquo;s
  works, in ten volumes, which Julian knew to be the one book of his library
  which he most deeply prized. His marginal comments enriched almost every
  page, and Julian was ashamed to take what he knew that the owner so highly
  valued.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I thought you told me once that you were thinking of publishing
  a biography of Coleridge, and an edition of his writings,&rdquo; said Julian.
  &ldquo;Surely, sir, you will want these manuscript notes, won&rsquo;t
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Julian! that is one of the many plans which have floated
  through my mind unfulfilled. My life, I fear, will have been an incomplete
  one. Thank God that there is no such thing as a necessary man&mdash;<i>il
  n&rsquo;y a point d&rsquo;hommes ncessaires</i>; others will be found to do
  a thousandfold better the work which I had purposed to do.&rdquo; And then he
  murmured half to himself&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Till, in due time, one by one,<br>
  Some with lives that came to nothing, some with deeds as well undone,<br>
  Death came suddenly, and took them where men never see the
  sun.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>His eyes filled with tears. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take the
  book, Julian. If it does you all the good it has done me, it will have been
  more useful than I could ever have made it. And when you hang on the eloquent
  and earnest words of the great poet philosopher, mingle his teachings with
  some few memories of me; it will be like a drop of myrrh, perhaps, in the
  cup, but I should like,&rdquo; he added, with faltering voice, &ldquo;to
  leave at least <i>one</i> to think of me with affection.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned away as his old pupil grasped his hand; and Julian, as he went
  back in the train to Camford, could not help a feeling of real pity that one
  so generous and upright in heart and life should be destined to so lonely and
  sorrowful a lot.</p>

  <p>As he had said, he resigned his Harton mastership at the end of the term,
  and sailed to Madeira for his health. He begged Julian to continue his
  correspondence with him, and to tell him all about his old Harton and Camford
  friends.</p>

  <p>During Easter week, while Julian was at Ildown, he received from him a
  letter to the following effect:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Dear Julian&mdash;I was not mistaken in hinting,
  while you were at Harton, that we should never meet again. I am on my
  death-bed; and, in all probability, the rapid decline which is now wasting my
  powers, and which, while I write, shakes me with painful fits of coughing,
  will have terminated my life before this letter reaches your hands.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;I leave life, I hope, with simple resignation; and
  although I have left undone much which I hoped to have accomplished, yet I
  die trusting in God. My friends in this world have been few, and my fortune
  have not been bright, yet happiness has largely preponderated even in
  <i>my</i> destiny, and I look on the death which is approaching as the
  commencement, not as the end, of true existence.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;But I did not write to you, dear Julian, to tell you
  of the frame of mind in which death finds me. I wrote to bid you farewell,
  and to tell you of something which concerns you&mdash;I mean my intention,
  recently adopted, of leaving you my small private fortune, and the added
  earnings which my labours have procured. Together, they amount only to ten
  thousand pounds, but I hope that they may be of real service to you. Had you
  still been the heir to your aunt&rsquo;s property, perhaps even if you had
  got the Clerkland, I should have disposed of this money in some other way;
  but as these events have been ordered otherwise, and as I have no relations
  of my own who need the legacy, nor any friend in whose welfare I take deeper
  interest than in yours, it gives me a gleam of real satisfaction to be able
  to place at your disposal this little sum.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Good-bye, my dear Julian. When these words meet your
  eye, I expect to be in that state where even your prayers can benefit me no
  more. But I know your affectionate and grateful heart, and I know that you
  will sometimes recur with a thought of kindness to the memory of your
  affectionate friend, Henry Carden.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>The next mail brought the news of Mr Carden&rsquo;s death. It caused many
  a sorrowing heart both at Harton and at Camford. Mr Carden was a man whose
  impetuous and enthusiastic disposition had caused him to commit many serious
  errors in life, and these had been a barrier to the success which must
  otherwise have rewarded his energy and talent. But even among those who were
  envious of his ability, and offended by his eccentricities, they were few who
  did not do justice to the rectitude of his motives, and none who did not
  admit the warmth of his affections. There were more to mourn over his
  untimely death than there had been to forgive the mistakes he made, and by
  wise and friendly counsel to raise him to that height which he might easily
  have obtained. And among the crowd who had known him, and the many who
  honoured him, there were some who loved him with no ordinary love, and who
  were not too proud to admit the obligation of a permanent gratitude. It was
  one of the great happinesses of Mr Carden&rsquo;s life that of this number
  was Julian Home.</p>

  <p>With a clear 300 pounds a year of his own, it was of course unnecessary
  for Julian to return to Saint Werner&rsquo;s as a sizar, and he at once wrote
  to his tutor to beg that his name might be removed from the list. There was
  one respect in which he found this a very material addition to his comfort
  and happiness. As the sizars dined an hour later than the other men, and at a
  separate table, he had been by this means cut off from the society of many of
  his friends in hall, where men have more opportunities of meeting and
  becoming intimate than anywhere else. It was no slight addition to his
  happiness to sit perpetually with the group of friends he valued most.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a magnificent plan for the Long, Julian,&rdquo; said
  Kennedy to him one day, as they left the hall. &ldquo;My father is going to
  Switzerland for three months, with my sister Eva and me. Eva goes under the
  wing of an aunt of mine, Mrs Dudley, whom I think you met at Ildown once.
  Won&rsquo;t, you come with us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The proposal was very tempting, the more so as Julian had never been
  abroad. He mentioned it in his next letter home, and asked if it would be
  possible for any of them to accompany him, without which he gave up all
  intention of making the tour. In reply, Mrs Home proposed that Violet should
  go, (if Mrs Dudley would kindly chaperon her), because the trip would be of
  great advantage to her in many ways; and that Cyril should go, as a reward
  for his industry and success at Marlby. &ldquo;As for Frankie and me,&rdquo;
  she continued, &ldquo;we will stay at home to take care of Ildown in your
  absence. Frank is too young to enjoy travelling, and I have but little desire
  for it; we two will stay behind, and I daresay we shall be very happy,
  especially if you write us long accounts of all your proceedings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So this most delightful plan was definitely adopted, and all concerned
  were full of the happiest anticipations. Kennedy and Julian looked forward to
  it with the utmost eagerness; Violet, who had already grown fond of Mrs
  Dudley and Eva, was charmed at the prospect, and Cyril, with all a
  boy&rsquo;s eagerness for novelty, was well-nigh wild with joy.</p>

  <p>But as yet six weeks were to elapse before the Long commenced.</p>

  <h2>XV. &mdash; KENNEDY&rsquo;S DISHONOUR</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;I fancied Cuthbert&rsquo;s reddening face<br>
  Beneath its garniture of curly gold,<br>
  Dear fellow, till I almost felt him fold<br>
  An arm in mine, to fix me to the place.<br>
  That way he used, ... Alas! one hour&rsquo;s disgrace!&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Robert Browning. <i>Childe Roland</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;I AM very doubtful, after all, Julian, whether I
  shall be one of the Switzerland party,&rdquo; said Kennedy, with a sigh, as
  he and Julian were walking round the Saint Werner&rsquo;s gardens one bright
  evening of the May term. The limes and chestnuts were unfolding their tender
  sprays of spring-tide emerald, the willows shivered as their green buds made
  ripples in the water, and the soft light of sunset streamed over towers and
  colleges, giving a rich glow to the broad windows of the library, and bathing
  in its rosy tinge the white plumage of the swans upon the river. The friends
  were returning from a walk, during which they had thoroughly enjoyed the blue
  and golden weather. Up to this time Kennedy had seemed to be in the highest
  spirits, and Julian was astonished at the melancholy tone in which the words
  were spoken.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Doubtful? Why?&rdquo; said Julian, quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because my father has made it conditional on my getting a first
  class in the May examination.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, my dear fellow, there is not the ghost of a doubt of your
  doing that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel so sure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, there are often thirty in the first class in the
  freshman&rsquo;s year; and just as if <i>you</i> wouldn&rsquo;t be among
  them!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All very well; I know that anybody can do it who works, but I am
  ashamed to say that I haven&rsquo;t read one of the books yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you, really? Well then, for goodness&rsquo; sake,
  lose no more time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s only a fortnight to the examination.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Kennedy, what <i>have</i> you been doing to be so
  idle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somehow or other the time manages to slip away. Heigh ho!&rdquo;
  said Kennedy, &ldquo;my first year at college nearly over, and nothing
  done&mdash;nothing done! How quickly the time has gone!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Julian;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;<i>ptezugas gaz epoomaduas phezai<br>
  Kampes bzadutezoi ta poteemena syllabein</i>,</p>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;as Theocritus prettily observes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Seized with the strong determination not only to pass the examination, but
  even to excel in it, Kennedy devoted the next fortnight to unremitted study
  for the first time since he had been an undergraduate. But the more he read
  the more painfully he became aware of his own deficiencies, and the more
  bitterly he deplored the waste of time. He seemed to be toiling in vain after
  the opportunities he had lost. He knew that the examination, though limited
  in subjects, was searching in character, and he found it impossible to
  acquire, by a sudden impulse, what he should have learned by continuous
  diligence. As the time drew nearer, he grew more and more nervous. He had set
  his heart on the Swiss tour, and it now seemed to him painfully probable that
  he would fail in fulfilling the condition which his father had exacted, and
  without which he well knew that Mr Kennedy would insist on his spending the
  vacation either at Camford or at home.</p>

  <p>Of the three main subjects for examination he had succeeded by desperate
  effort, aided by natural ability, in very quickly mastering two sufficiently
  well to secure a creditable result; but the third subject, the Agamemnon of
  Aeschylus, remained nearly untouched, and Kennedy was too good and accurate a
  scholar not to be aware that the most careful and elaborate study was
  indispensable to an even tolerable understanding of that masterpiece of
  Grecian tragedy. Besides this, he had a hatred of slovenly and superficial
  work, and he therefore determined to leave the Aeschylus untouched, while, at
  the same time, he was quite conscious that if he did so, all chance of
  distinction, and even all chance of a first class were out of the question.
  With some shame he reflected over this proof, that, for all purposes of
  study, a third of his academical life had been utterly and wholly lost.</p>

  <p>As he had decided on giving up the Aeschylus, it became more imperative to
  make sure of the Tacitus and Demosthenes, and he therefore went to Mr
  Grayson&rsquo;s rooms to get a library order which should entitle him to take
  from the Saint Werner&rsquo;s library any books that would be most likely to
  give him effectual help.</p>

  <p>At the moment of his arrival, Mr Grayson was engaged, and he was shown
  into another room until he should be ready. This room was the tutor&rsquo;s
  library, and like many of the rooms in Camford, it opened into an inner and
  smaller study, the door of which was partly open.</p>

  <p>Kennedy sat down, and after a few minutes, as there seemed to be no signs
  that he would be summoned immediately, he began to grow very restless. He
  tried some of the books on the table, but they were all unspeakably dull; he
  looked at the pictures on the wall, but they were most of them the likenesses
  of Camford celebrities which he already knew by heart; he looked out of the
  window, but the court was empty, and there was nothing to see. Reflecting
  that the only thing which can really induce ennui in a sensible man, is to be
  kept waiting when he is very busy for an <i>indefinite</i> period, which may
  terminate at any moment, and may last for almost any length of time, Kennedy,
  vexed at the interruption of his work, chose the most comfortable armchair in
  the room, and settled himself in it with a yawn.</p>

  <p>At this moment, as ill fate would have it, his eye caught sight of a book
  lying on Mr Grayson&rsquo;s reading-desk. Lazily rising to see what it was,
  he found it to be an Aeschylus, and turned over the leaves with a feeling of
  listless indifference. Between two of the leaves lay a written paper, and
  suddenly, after reading two or three lines, he observed it to be a manuscript
  copy of the much-dreaded Agamemnon paper for the May examination.</p>

  <p>Temptation had surprised him with sudden and unexpected violence. He
  little knew that on this idle weary moment rested the destiny of many
  years.</p>

  <p>As when in a hostile country one has laid aside his armour, and from
  unregarded ambush the enemy leaps on him, and, though he be strong and noble,
  stabs him with a festering wound, so this temptation to a base act sprang on
  poor Kennedy when he was unarmed and unprepared. In the gaieties of life, and
  the brightnesses of hope, and the securities of unbroken enjoyment, he had
  long been trusting in himself only, in his own high principle, his own
  generous impulses, his own unstained honour. But these were never sufficient
  for any human being yet, and they snapped in an instant under this unhappy
  boy.</p>

  <p>The only honourable thing to do, the thing which at another moment Kennedy
  might have done, and which any man would have done, whose right instincts and
  high character had the reliable support of higher principles than mere
  personal self-confidence and pride, would have been to shut the book
  instantly, inform Mr Grayson that he had accidentally read one of the
  questions, and beg him to change it before the examination. This Kennedy knew
  well; it flashed before him in an instant as the only proper course but at
  the same instant he passionately obliterated the suggestion from his mind,
  fiercely stifled the impulse to do right, choked the rebukes of honour and
  principle, and blindly willed to save his reputation as a scholar, and his
  chance of enjoyment for the vacation by reading through the entire number of
  the questions. This mental struggle did not last an instant, for the emotions
  of the spirit belong only to eternity, and the guilt of human actions is not
  commensurate with the length of time they occupy. But in the intense wish to
  see what the examination would be like, and to secure his first class,
  Kennedy repressed altogether by one blow the moral element of his being, and
  concentrated his whole intellect on the paper before him. To read it through
  was the work of a minute; when it was read through, it was too late to wish
  the act undone, and without suffering himself to dwell, or even to recur in
  thought to the nature of his proceedings, Kennedy deliberately read through
  the whole paper a second time.</p>

  <p>But this imperious effort of the will was not exercised without visible
  effects. Absorbed as he was in seizing every prominent subject in the
  questions, his forehead contracted, his hand shook, his knees trembled, and
  his heart palpitated with violence. He observed nothing; he did not notice
  the shadow that chequered the sunlight streaming from the door of the inner
  room; he did not hear the light step which passed over the carpet; he did not
  feel the breath of a man who stood behind him, looked over his shoulder,
  watched his eager determination to secure the unfair advantage, smiled at his
  agitation, and then slipped back again into the inner room, unnoticed as
  before.</p>

  <p>It was done. Not a question but was printed indelibly on Kennedy&rsquo;s
  memory. Quickly, fearfully, he shut the book, and glided back to the
  armchair, in the vain attempt to look and feel at ease.</p>

  <p>At ease! No, now the tumult broke. Now Kennedy hated himself; called
  himself mean, vile, contemptible, a reptile, a cheat. Now his insulted honour
  began to vindicate its rights, and his trampled sense of truth to spring up
  with a menacing bound, and his conscience to speak out calmly and clearly the
  language of self-condemnation and contempt. Good heavens! how could he have
  sunk so low; fancy if Julian had seen him, or could know his meanness. Fancy
  if <i>anybody</i> had seen him. Hazlet, or Fitzurse, or Brogten himself,
  could hardly have been guilty of a more dishonourable act.</p>

  <p>You miserable souls, that do not know what honour is, or what torments
  rend a truly noble heart, if ever it be led to commit an act which to your
  seared consciences and muddy intelligence appears a trivial sin, or even no
  sin at all; you, the mean men to whom an offence like this is so common,
  that, unless it were discovered, it would not trouble your recollections with
  a feather&rsquo;s weight of remorse,&mdash;for you, I scorn to write, and I
  scorn from my inmost being the sneer with which you will regard the agony
  that Kennedy suffered from his fall. But to the high and the generous, who
  have erred and have bewailed their error in secret,&mdash;to them I appeal to
  imagine the anguish of self-reproach, the bitterness of humiliation, which
  stung him in those few moments after his first dishonour. It is the lofty
  tower that falls with the heaviest crash; it is the stately soul that suffers
  the deepest abasement; it is the white scutcheon on which the dark stain
  seems to wear its darkest hue.</p>

  <p>He had not sat there for many minutes&mdash;though to him they seemed like
  hours&mdash;when a step on the stairs told him that his tutor&rsquo;s visitor
  had departed, and the gyp blandly entering, observed&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, sir, Mr Grayson can see you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! very well,&rdquo; said Kennedy, rising and assuming, with a
  painful effort, his most indifferent look and tone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Mr Kennedy, my turn first; I have been waiting
  longest,&rdquo; said a harsh voice behind him, that sounded mockingly to his
  excited ear. He turned sharply round, and with a low bow and a curl on the
  protruding lip, and a little guttural laugh, Brogten came from the inner
  room, and passed before him into Mr Grayson&rsquo;s presence.</p>

  <p>If a thunderbolt had suddenly fallen before Kennedy&rsquo;s feet and
  cloven its sulphurous passage into the abyss, he could hardly have been more
  startled or more alarmed. Without a word he sat down half stupefied. Was any
  one else in the inner room? For very shame he dare not look. Had Brogten seen
  him? If so, would he at once tell Mr Grayson? What would be done in that
  case? Dare he deny the fact? Passionately he spurned the hateful suggestion.
  Would Brogten tell all the Saint Werner&rsquo;s men? Brogten of all others,
  whom he had publicly insulted and branded with dishonour! Ah me, there is no
  anguish so keen, so <i>deadly</i>, as the anguish of awakened shame!</p>

  <p>With unspeakable anxiety Kennedy awaited Brogten&rsquo;s departure. Why
  should he be so long? Surely he must be telling Mr Grayson.</p>

  <p>At last the heavy step was heard, the door opened, and the gyp once more
  announced that Mr Grayson was disengaged.</p>

  <p>Pale and almost breathless, Kennedy went into the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, Mr Kennedy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He quite expected that Mr Grayson was about at once to address him on the
  subject of the paper, and, expecting this, totally forgot the purpose for
  which he had come. The tutor&rsquo;s cold eye was upon him, and after a pause
  he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Mr Kennedy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo; he replied, with a start.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you want anything?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I came for&mdash; Really, sir, I must beg your pardon, but I
  have forgotten what it was.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To look at an examination-paper,&rdquo; were the words which, in
  his embarrassment, sprang to his lips, but he checked them just in time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really, Mr Kennedy, you appear to be strangely absent this
  morning,&rdquo; said Mr Grayson, in a tone the reverse of encouraging.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I remember now,&rdquo; he replied, desperately; &ldquo;it was a
  library order I wanted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr Grayson wrote him the order. Kennedy took it, and, without even shaking
  the cold hand which the tutor proffered, hurried out of the room, relieved at
  least by the conviction that Brogten, if he had seen him look at the paper,
  had not, as yet at any rate, revealed it to the examiner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;he was hardly likely to do
  that. But had he told the men?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy did not go to the library; he could not bear to meet anybody, and
  hastened to bury himself in his own rooms. His walk, usually so erect and gay
  as he went across the court&mdash;the tune he used to hum so merrily in the
  sunshine&mdash;and the bright open glance of recognition with which he passed
  his acquaintances and friends, were gone to-day. He shuffled silently along
  the cloisters with downcast eyes.</p>

  <p>Hall-time would be the time to know whether Brogten had seen him and
  betrayed him. And if he had seen him, surely there could be no doubt he would
  tell of him. What a sweet revenge it would be for that malicious heart! How
  completely it would turn the tables on Kennedy for the day when he had
  sarcastically alluded to Brogten&rsquo;s bets! How amply it would fulfil the
  promise of which that parting scowl of hatred had been full.</p>

  <p>He went to hall rather late on purpose; and instead of sitting in his
  usual place near Julian, he chose a vacant place at another table. Half a
  minute sufficed to show him that there was no difference in his reception;
  the same frequent nods and smiles from all sides still gave him the frank
  greeting of which, as a popular man, he was always sure. He looked round for
  Brogten, but could make nothing of his face; it simply wore a somewhat slight
  smile when their eyes met, and Kennedy&rsquo;s fell. Kennedy began to
  convince himself that Brogten could <i>not</i> have seen what he had done in
  Mr Grayson&rsquo;s room.</p>

  <p>The thought rolled away a great load&mdash;a heavy, intolerable load from
  his heart. It was not that with him, as with so many thousands, the fear of
  discovery constituted the sense of sin, but young as he was, and high as his
  character had stood hitherto in man&rsquo;s estimation, he prayed for any
  chastisement rather than that of detection, any stroke in preference to open
  shame. This was the one thing which he felt he could not bear.</p>

  <p>Even now, as conscience strongly suggested, he might make, by private
  confession to his tutor, or at any rate by not using the knowledge he had
  thus acquired, the only reparation which was still in his power. But it was a
  hard thing for conscience to ask&mdash;too hard for poor Kennedy&rsquo;s
  weakness. Much of the paper, as he saw at once, he could very easily have
  answered from his previous general knowledge and scholarship; so easily, that
  he now felt convinced that he might have done quite enough of it to secure
  his first class. His sin then had been useless, quite useless, worse than
  useless to him. Was he obliged also to make it positively injurious? was he
  to put himself in a <i>worse</i> position than if he had never committed it?
  After all the punishment which the sin had brought with it, was he also to
  lose, in consequence of it, the very advantage, the very enjoyment, for the
  sake of which he had harboured the temptation? It was too much&mdash;too much
  to expect.</p>

  <p>The night before the Aeschylus examination he began to read up the general
  information on the subject, and he intended to do it quite as if he were
  unaware of what the actual questions were to be. But it was the merest self-
  deception. Each question was branded in fiery letters on his recollection,
  and he found that, as he read, he was skipping involuntarily every topic
  which he knew had not been touched on in Mr Grayson&rsquo;s paper.</p>

  <p>Oh, the sense of hypocrisy with which he eagerly seized the paper next
  morning, and read it over as though unaware of its contents.</p>

  <p>Julian could not help observing that, during the last few days,
  Kennedy&rsquo;s spirits had suffered a change. His old mirth came only in
  fitful bursts, and he was often moody and silent; but Julian attributed it to
  anxiety for the result of the examination, and doubt whether he should be
  allowed by his father to make one of the long-anticipated party in the
  foreign tour.</p>

  <p>Kennedy dared not admit any one into his confidence, but the last evening,
  before they went down, he turned the conversation, as he sat at tea in
  Owen&rsquo;s room, to the topic of character, and the faults of great men,
  and the aberrations of the good.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, Owen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as you&rsquo;re a
  philosopher&mdash;tell me what difference the faults of good men make in our
  estimate of them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In our real estimate,&rdquo; said Owen, &ldquo;I fancy we often
  adopt, half unconsciously, the maxim, that &lsquo;the king can do no
  wrong&rsquo;&mdash;that the true hero is all heroic.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kennedy; &ldquo;but when some one calls your
  attention to the fact of their failings, and <i>makes</i> you look at
  them&mdash;what then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, in nine cases out of ten the faults are grossly exaggerated
  and misrepresented, and I should try to prove that such is the fact; and for
  the rest,&mdash;why, no man is perfect.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You shirk the question, though,&rdquo; said Lillyston; &ldquo;for
  you have to make very tremendous allowance indeed for some of the very best
  of men.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As, for instance?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As, for instance, king David.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t take Scripture instances,&rdquo; said Suton, an
  excellent fellow whom they all liked, though he took very different views of
  things from their own.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not, in heaven&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; said Kennedy; &ldquo;if
  they suit, they are good because so thoroughly familiar.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but somehow one judges them differently.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I daresay you do,&mdash;in fact I know you do; but you&rsquo;ve no
  business to. I maintain that even according to Moses, king David deserved a
  felon&rsquo;s death. Murder and adultery were crimes every bit as heinous
  then as they are now. Yet David, this most <i>human</i> of heroes, was the
  man after God&rsquo;s own heart. Solve me the problem.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Practically,&rdquo; said Lillyston; &ldquo;I believe one follows a
  genuine instinct in <i>determining not</i> to look at the spots, however wide
  or dark they are, upon the sun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And in accepting theoretically old Strabo&rsquo;s grand dictum,
  <i>ouch oion agathon genesthai poieeteen mee pzotezon geneethenta anoza
  agathon</i>. Eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As Coleridge was so fond of doing,&rdquo; said Julian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ay, he needed the theory,&rdquo; said Suton.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand any such
  Philadelphus hints about Coleridge. By the bye, Owen, you might have quoted a
  still more apt illustration from Seneca, who criticises Livy for saying
  &lsquo;Vir ingenii magni magis quam boni&rsquo; with the remark, &lsquo;Non
  potest illud separari; aut <i>et</i> bonum erit aut <i>nec</i>
  magnum.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr Admer, who was one of the circle, chuckled inwardly at the discussion.
  &ldquo;I was once,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at a party where a lady sang one of
  Byron&rsquo;s Hebrew melodies. At the close of it a young clergyman sighed
  deeply, and with an air of intense self-satisfaction, observed, &lsquo;Ah! I
  was wondering where poor Byron is now!&rsquo; What should you have all said
  to that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Detesting Byron&rsquo;s personal character, I should have said that
  the very wonder was a piece of idle and meddling presumption,&rdquo; said
  Owen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I should have answered that the Judge will do right,&rdquo;
  said Suton reverently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or if he wanted a text, &lsquo;Who art thou that judgest
  another?&rsquo;&rdquo; said Lillyston contemptuously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Julian, should have said,&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Let feeble hands iniquitously just,<br>
  Rake up the relics of the sinful dust,<br>
  Let Ignorance mock the pang it cannot heal,<br>
  And Malice brand what Mercy would conceal;&mdash;<br>
  It matters not!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said Kennedy, &ldquo;should have been vehemently
  inclined to tweak the man&rsquo;s nose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what did <i>you</i> say, Mr Admer?&rdquo; asked Lillyston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I answered a fool according to his folly. I threw up my eyes and
  said, &lsquo;Ah, where, indeed! What a good thing it is that you and I, sir,
  are not as that publican.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should think he skewered you with a glance, didn&rsquo;t
  he?&rdquo; said Kennedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, he was going to <i>bore</i> me with an argument, which I
  declined.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve all cut the question: tell me now, supposing you
  had known king David, should you have thought worse of him, should you have
  been cool to him&mdash;in a word, should you have <i>cut</i> him after his
  fall?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think not&mdash;I mean, I shouldn&rsquo;t have <i>cut</i>
  him,&rdquo; said Owen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And yet you would have treated so any ordinary friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not necessarily. But remember that the two best things happened to
  David which could possibly happen to a man who has committed a
  crime.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Namely?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Speedy detection,&rdquo; said Lillyston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And prompt punishment,&rdquo; added Julian; &ldquo;but for these
  there&rsquo;s no knowing what would have become of him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Unsatisfactory as the discussion had been, yet those words rang hauntingly
  in Kennedy&rsquo;s ears; he could not forget them. During all those first
  days of happy travel they were with him; with him as they strolled down the
  gay and lighted Boulevards of Paris; with him beside the quaint fountains of
  Berne; and the green rushing of the Rhine at Basle; with him amid the scent
  of pine-cones, and under the dark green umbrage of forest boughs; with him
  when he caught his first glimpse of the everlasting mountains, and plunged
  into the clear brightness of the sapphire lake&mdash;the thought of speedy
  detection and prompt punishment. It was no small pleasure to partake in
  Violet&rsquo;s happiness, and mark the ever fresh delight that lent such a
  bright look to Cyril&rsquo;s face; but before Kennedy in the midst of
  enjoyment, the memory of a dishonourable act started like a spectre, and
  threw a sudden shadow on his brow. He felt its presence when he saw the sun
  rise from Rigi; it stood by him amid the wreathing mists of Pilatus; it even
  checked his enthusiasm as they gazed together on the unequalled glories
  spread beneath the green summit of Monterone, and as their graceful boat made
  ripples on the moonlit waves of Orta and Lugans. In a word, the conviction of
  weakness was the only alloying influence to the pleasure of his tour, the one
  absinthe-drop that lent bitterness to the honeyed wine. It was not only the
  consciousness of the wrong act and its possible results, but horror at the
  instability of moral principle which it showed, and a deep fear lest the same
  weakness should prove a snare and a ruin to him in the course of future
  life.</p>

  <h2>XVI. &mdash; A DAY OF WONDER</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;Flowers are lovely. Love is flowerlike,<br>
  Friendship is a sheltering tree;<br>
  O the joys that came down showerlike<br>
  With virtue, truth, and liberty,<br>
  When I was young.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Coleridge.</p><br>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;TO-MORROW, then, we are all to ascend the
  Schilthorn,&rdquo; said Mr Kennedy, as he bade good-night to the merry party
  assembled in the salle  manger of the chalet inn at Mrrem.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or as high as we ladies can get,&rdquo; said Mrs Dudley.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll get you up, aunt,&rdquo; said Kennedy; &ldquo;if
  Julian and my father and I can&rsquo;t get you and Miss Home and Eva up,
  we&rsquo;re not worth much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To say nothing of <i>me</i>&rdquo; said Cyril, putting his arms
  akimbo, with a look of immense importance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Breakfast, then, at five to-morrow morning, young people,&rdquo;
  said Mr Kennedy, retiring; and full of happy anticipations they went off to
  bed.</p>

  <p>Punctually at five they were all seated round the breakfast-table, eagerly
  discussing the prospects of the day.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, <i>did</i> any of you see the first sunbeam tip the Jungfrau
  this morning?&rdquo; said Kennedy. &ldquo;It looked
  like&mdash;like&mdash;what did it look like, Miss Home?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like the golden rim of a crown of pearls,&rdquo; said Violet,
  smiling. &ldquo;And did you see the morning star, shining above the orange-
  coloured line of morning light, over the hills behind us, Eva? What did that
  remind you of?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t <i>invent</i> poetic similes,&rdquo; answered
  Eva. &ldquo;I must take refuge in Wordsworth&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;&lsquo;Sweet as a star when only one<br>
  Is shining in the sky.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;or Browning&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;&lsquo;One star&mdash;the
  chrysolite!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said Cyril, who had been standing impatiently at the
  door during the colloquy; &ldquo;when you young ladies and people have done
  poetising, etcetera, the guide&rsquo;s quite ready.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come along, then; we&rsquo;re soon equipped,&rdquo; said Violet,
  adjusting at the looking-glass her pretty straw hat, with its drooping
  feather, and the blue veil tied round it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, Miss Kennedy&mdash;bother take it though, I can&rsquo;t
  always be saying Miss Kennedy&mdash;it&rsquo;s too long. I shall call you
  Eva&mdash;may I?&rdquo; said Cyril.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By all means, if you like.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, Eva, the guide <i>is</i> such a rum fellow; he looks
  like a revived mummy out of&mdash;out of Palmyra,&rdquo; said he, blundering
  a little in his geography.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mummy or no,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll carry all our
  provisions and plaids to-day up to the top, which is more than most of your A
  Cs would do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A C&mdash;what does that mean?&rdquo; asked Violet. &ldquo;One sees
  it constantly in the visitors&rsquo; books.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, Vi?&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;It stands for
  athletic climber.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alpine Club, you little monkey,&rdquo; said Kennedy, throwing a
  fir-cone at him. &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;ll</i> be qualified for the Alpine
  Club, Miss Home, before the day&rsquo;s over, I&rsquo;ve no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;they want 13,000 feet, I believe,
  and the Schilthorn is only 9,000.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nearly three times higher than Snowdon; only fancy!&rdquo; said
  Cyril.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the party had started with fair weather, and in high spirits.
  The guide, with the gentlemen&rsquo;s plaids strapped together, led the way
  cheerily, occasionally talking his vile patois with Julian and Mr Kennedy, or
  laughing heartily at Cyril&rsquo;s &ldquo;bad language&rdquo;&mdash;for
  Cyril, not being strong in German, exercised a delightful ingenuity in making
  a very few words go a very long way. Kennedy walked generally with Eva and
  Violet, while Julian often joined them, and Cyril, always with some new
  scheme in hand, or some new fancy darting through his brain, ran chattering,
  from one group to another, plucking bilberries and wild strawberries in
  handfuls, and trying the merits of his alpenstock as a leaping-pole.</p>

  <p>The light of morning flowed down in an ever-broadening river, and peak
  after peak flashed first into rose, then into crimson, and then into golden
  light, as the sun fell on their fields of snow; high overhead rose Alp after
  Alp of snow-white and luminous cloud, but the flowing curves of the hills
  themselves stood unveiled, with their crests cut clearly on the pale, divine,
  lustrous blue of heaven, and our happy band of travellers gazed untired on
  that glorious panorama of glistering heights from the towering cones of the
  Eiger and the Moench to the crowding precipices of the Ebenen-fluen and the
  Silberhorn. Deep below them, in the valley, &ldquo;like handfuls of pearl in
  a goblet of emerald,&rdquo; the quiet chlets clustered over their pastures
  of vivid grass, and gave that touch of human interest which alone was wanting
  to complete the loveliness of the scene.</p>

  <p>Every step brought them some new object to gaze upon with loving
  admiration; now the gaunt spurs of some noble pine that had thrust his
  gnarled roots into the crevices of rock to look down in safety on the torrent
  roaring far below him, and now the track of a chamois, or the bright black
  eyes of some little marmot peering from his burrow on the side of a sunny
  bank, and whistling a quick alarm to his comrades at their play.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What an extraordinary howl,&rdquo; said Cyril, laughing, as the
  guide whooped back a sort of jodel in answer to a salute from the other side
  of the valley.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very harmonious&mdash;is it not?&rdquo; said Violet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s one of the varieties of the Ranz des
  Vaches,&rdquo; said Kennedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And why do they shout at each other in that way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because the mountains are lonely, Cyril, and the shepherds
  don&rsquo;t see human faces too often; so men begin to feel like brothers,
  and are glad to greet each other in these silent hills.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you hear how the mountain echoed back his cry?&rdquo; said Eva;
  &ldquo;it sounded like a band of elves mocking at him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll hear something finer directly; the guide told me
  he was going to borrow an alpen-horn at one of these chlets, and then
  you&rsquo;ll discover for the first time what echo can do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>In a few minutes the guide appeared with the horn, and blew. Heavens! what
  a melody of replications! How in the hollows of the hills every harsh tone
  died away, and all the softer notes flowed to and fro in tenderest music, and
  fainted in distant reverberations more and more exquisite, more and more
  exquisitely low. Can it be a mere echo of those rude blasts? It seemed as
  though some choir of spirits had caught each tone as it came from the
  peasant&rsquo;s horn, and had deified it there among the clouds, and had
  repeated it over and over with divinest variations, to show man how crabbed
  were the sounds which he produced, and yet how ravishing they might one day
  become, when to the symphony of silver strings they rang out amid the seraph
  harps and choral harmonies of heaven. All the party stood still in rapturous
  attention, and even Cyril forgot for ten minutes his frolicsome and noisy
  mirth.</p>

  <p>Reader, have you ever seen an Alpine pasture in warm July at early
  morning? If not, you can hardly conceive the glorious carpet over which the
  feet of the wanderer in Switzerland press during summer tours. Around them as
  they passed the soft mosses glowed with gold and crimson, and the edges of
  the lady&rsquo;s-mantle shimmered with such diamonds and pearls as never
  adorned a lady&rsquo;s mantle yet. Everywhere the grass was vivid with a
  many-coloured tissue of dew-dropped flowers: pale crocuses, and the bright
  crimson-lake carnation, and monk&rsquo;s-hood, and crane&rsquo;s-bill, and
  aster alpinus, and the lovely myosotis, and thousands of yellow and purple
  flowers, nameless or lovelier than their names, were the tapestry on which
  they trod; and it was interwoven through warp and woof with the blue gleam of
  a myriad harebells. At last they came to the cold region of those delicate
  nurslings of the hills, the gentianellas and gentians. Kennedy, who had been
  keenly on the look out, was the first of the party to find the true Alpine
  gentian, and instantly recognising it, ran with it to Violet and his
  sister.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the first Alpine gentian you ever
  saw. Did you ever know real blue in a flower before? Doesn&rsquo;t it
  actually seem to shed a blue radiation round it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How perfectly beautiful!&rdquo; said Violet; &ldquo;see, Eva, how
  intense blue and green seem to be shot into each other, or to play together
  like the waters of a shoaling sea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall I take a root or two?&rdquo; said Kennedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not the slightest use,&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;they only grow at
  certain elevations, and would be dead before you got down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange, Violet, that Nature should fling such a
  tender and exquisite gem so high up among these awful hills, where so few
  eyes see them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just look,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;how the moss and the grass
  seem to be illuminated with them, as though the heavens were golden, and
  stars in it were of blue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While they talked, Cyril dashed past them with all the ardour of a young
  entomologist in full chase of a little mountain-ringlet, which he soon caught
  and pinned on the top of his straw hat. In a few minutes more he had added a
  great fritillery to his collection, and it gave him no trouble to pick out
  the finest of the superb lazy-flying Apollos, which quickly shared the same
  fate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another for you, Cyril,&rdquo; said Eva, pointing to a
  gorgeous peacock-butterfly which had settled amicably by a bee on the pink-
  and-downy coronet of a great thistle.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want that; one can get it any day in England;
  here though, look at this lovely burnet-moth,&rdquo; he cried, as the
  blue-and-red-winged little creature settled on the same thistle-head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a shame to disturb that beautiful Psyche,&rdquo; said Julian,
  as Cyril dashed his cap over the prey, and the peacock fluttered off;
  &ldquo;it was enjoying itself so intensely in the sunshine, opening and
  shutting its wings in unmitigated contentment.&rdquo; But Cyril had secured
  his moth without heeding the remark, and was now twenty yards ahead.</p>

  <p>A sudden roar of sound stopped him, and he waited to ask the rest,
  &ldquo;if they had heard the thunder?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t thunder, but the rush of an avalanche,&rdquo; said
  Kennedy; &ldquo;there, you may see it still on the side of the
  Jungfrau.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, those little white streaks, which look like a mountain
  torrent?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And can those threads of snow make all that row?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must remember that the threads of snow are five miles off, and
  are perhaps thousands of tons in weight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>By this time they had reached the part of the mountain where the climb
  became really toilsome, and they settled down into the steady pace, which the
  Swiss guides always adopt because they know that it is the quickest in the
  long run. And at this point Mr Kennedy and Mrs Dudley left them, preferring,
  like sensible old people, to stroll back in quiet, and avoid an exertion
  which they found too fatiguing. They knew that they could safely entrust the
  party to the care of Julian and the guide. The ladies often needed help, and
  there seemed to be something very pleasant to Kennedy in the light touch of
  Violet&rsquo;s hand, for he lent her his arm or his alpenstock oftener than
  was absolutely required. They only stopped once more to quench their thirst
  at a streamlet which was rushing impetuously down the rocks, and a little
  below them foamed over the precipice into a white and noisy cataract.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never noticed water before falling from such a height,&rdquo;
  said Julian; &ldquo;it looks exactly like a succession of white comets
  plunging through the sky in a crowd.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or a throng of white-sheeted ghosts hurrying deliriously through
  the one too-narrow entrance of the lower world,&rdquo; said Kennedy.
  &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it remind one of Schiller&rsquo;s line&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Und es wallet und liedet und brauset und
  Pikcht?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I admire the rainbow most, which over-arches the fall, and plays
  into light, or dies away as the sunbeams touch the foam,&rdquo; said
  Violet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it remind you of Al-Sirat&rsquo;s arch, Miss
  Home?&rdquo; asked Kennedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the pleasure of that gentleman&rsquo;s
  acquaintance,&rdquo; observed Cyril.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; said Kennedy; &ldquo;but Al-Sirat&rsquo;s arch is the
  bridge&mdash;narrow as the edge of a razor, or the thread of an attenuated
  spider&mdash;which is supposed to span the fiery abyss, over which the good
  <i>skate</i> into Paradise, while the bad topple over it. Don&rsquo;t you
  remember Byron&rsquo;s lines about it in the Giaour?</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yea, <i>Soul</i>, and should our prophet
  say<br>
  That form was nought but breathing clay,<br>
  By Alla! I would answer nay;<br>
  Though on Al-Sirat&rsquo;s arch I stood,<br>
  That topples o&rsquo;er the fiery flood,<br>
  With Paradise within my view,<br>
  And all its Houris beckoning through.&rsquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty nearly the only lines of Byron I know.&rdquo; Somehow
  Kennedy was looking at Violet while he repeated the lines.</p>

  <p>A few minutes more brought them on to the great field of snow, through
  which they toiled along laboriously, treading as much as possible in the
  footsteps of the guide.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a glacier, is it?&rdquo; asked Cyril.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh dear, no! If it were, you wouldn&rsquo;t find it such easy
  walking, for it would be full of hidden crevasses, and we should have to
  march much more carefully, occasionally poking our feet through the snow that
  lightly covers a fathomless depth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, you must have read in Murray that eerie story of the guide
  that actually tumbled, though not very deep, into the centre of the glacier,
  and found his way back to light down the bed of a sub-glacial torrent, with
  no worse result than a broken arm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is a still eerier story, though, of two brothers,&rdquo; said
  Kennedy, &ldquo;of whom one fell into a crevasse, and was caught on a ledge
  some fifty feet down, where he could be actually seen and heard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did he ever get out?&rdquo; asked Violet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; the guide went back four hours&rsquo; walk, and brought ropes
  and assistance just before dark, and meanwhile the other brother waited
  anxiously by the side of the crevasse, talking, and letting down brandy and
  other things to keep the poor fellow alive. He did escape, but not without
  considerable risk of being frozen to death.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Beguiling the way with talk, they at last got over the tedious climb, and
  reached the summit. Eva and Violet were very tired, but the difficult and
  eager air of the icy mountain-top was exhilarating as new wine, and the
  provisions they had brought with them reinvigorated them completely. To
  hungry and thirsty climbers black bread and <i>vin ordinaire</i> taste like
  nectar and ambrosia. The day was cloudless, the view unspeakably magnificent,
  and Cyril&rsquo;s high spirits were contagious. They lingered long before
  they began the descent, and laughingly pooh-poohed the guide&rsquo;s repeated
  suggestion that it was getting late.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I bet you Kennedy has been writing poetry,&rdquo; said Cyril;
  &ldquo;do make him read it, Julian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; said all in chorus, and Julian with playful
  force possessed himself of the pocket-book, while Kennedy, only asseverating
  that the verses were addressed to nobody in particular, fled from the sound
  of his own lyrics, which Julian proceeded to read.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Rose-opals of the sunlit hills<br>
  Are flashing round my lonely way,<br>
  And cataracts dash the rushing rills<br>
  To plumes of glimmering spray.<br>
  But mountain-streams and sunny gleams<br>
  Are not so dear to me,<br>
  As dawning of the golden love<br>
  My spirit feels for thee!<br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;Their diamond crowns and giant forms,<br>
  The lordly hills upraise;<br>
  Nor rushing winds nor shattering storms<br>
  Can shake their solid base:<br>
  Though Europe rests beneath their crests,<br>
  And empires sleep secure,<br>
  Less firm their bases than my love,<br>
  Their snow less brightly pure.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;There, rubbish enough,&rdquo; said Kennedy, returning and snatching
  away the pocket-book before Julian could read another verse.
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Like coffee made without trouble, drunk without regret,&rsquo;
  as the Monday Oracle, with its usual exquisite urbanity, observed of a recent
  poet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course addressed quite to an imaginary object, Eddy,&rdquo; said
  Eva, while Violet looked towards the hills, and hoped that the glow which
  covered her fair face might be taken for a reflection of the faint tinge that
  already began to fall over the distant ridges of pale snow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We really must come away,&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be
  sunset very soon, and then we shall have to climb down nearly in the
  dark.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So they left the ridge, and while Kennedy and Cyril, amid shouts of
  laughter, glissaded gallantly over the slopes of snow, Julian and the guide
  conducted the girls by a method less rapid, but more secure. Arrived at the
  rocks, Cyril went forward with the guide, Julian followed with Eva, and
  Kennedy with Violet led up the rear.</p>

  <p>Why did they linger so long? Violet was tired, no doubt, but could she not
  have walked as fast as Eva, or was Kennedy&rsquo;s arm less stout than
  Julian&rsquo;s? She lingered, it seemed, with something of a conscious
  pleasure, now to pluck a flower or a fern, now to look at some yellow lichens
  on the purple crags; and once, when Julian looked back, the two were some way
  behind the rest of the party. They were standing on a rock gazing on the
  fading splendour of the mountains in front of them, while the light wind that
  had risen during the sunset, flung back his hair from his forehead, and
  played with one golden tress which had strayed down Violet&rsquo;s neck. He
  shouted to them to make haste, and they waved their hands to him with a gay
  salute. Thinking that they would soon overtake him, he pressed forward with
  Eva, and did not look back again.</p>

  <p>While Kennedy walked on with Violet in silence more sweet than speech,
  they fell into a dreamy mood, and wandered on half-oblivious of things around
  them, while deeper and deeper the shades of twilight began to cast their
  gloom over the hills.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look, Violet, I mean Miss Home; the moon is in crescent, and we
  shall have a pleasant night to walk in; won&rsquo;t it be
  delightful?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she murmured; but neither of them observed that the
  clouds were gathering thick and fast, and obscured all except a few
  struggling glimpses of scattered stars.</p>

  <p>They came to a sort of stile formed by two logs of wood laid across the
  gap in a stone wall, and Kennedy vaulting over it, gave her his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; she said, stopping timidly for a moment, &ldquo;we
  did not pass over this in coming, did we?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy looked back. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
  remember it; but no doubt it has been put up merely for the night to prevent
  the cattle from going astray.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They went forward, but a deeper and deeper misgiving filled Violet&rsquo;s
  mind that they had chosen a wrong road.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said with a fluttered voice, &ldquo;that the
  path looks much narrower than it did this morning. Do you see the
  others?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They both strained their eyes through the gloom, now rendered more thick
  than ever by the dark driving clouds, but they could see no trace of their
  companions, and though they listened intently, not the faintest sound of
  voices reached their eager ears.</p>

  <p>They spoke no word, but a few steps farther brought them to a towering
  rock around the base of which the path turned, and then seemed to cease
  abruptly in a mass of loose shale. It was too clear now. They had lost their
  road and turned, whilst they were indulging those golden fancies, into a mere
  cattle-path worn by the numerous herds of goats and oxen, the music of whose
  jangling bells still came to them now and then in low sweet snatches from the
  pastures of the valley and hill.</p>

  <p>What was to be done? They were alone amid the all but unbroken silence,
  and the eternal solitudes of the now terrible mountain. The darkness began to
  brood heavily above them; no one was in sight, and when Kennedy shouted there
  was no answer, but only an idle echo of his voice. Sheets of mist were
  sweeping round them, and at length the gusts of wind drove into their faces
  cold swirls of plashing rain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr Kennedy, what can we do? Do shout again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Once more Kennedy sent his voice ringing through the mist and darkness,
  and once more there was no answer, except that to their now excited senses it
  seemed as if a scream of mocking laughter was carried back to them upon the
  wind. And clinging tightly to his arm, as he wrapped her in his plaid to
  shelter her from the wet, she again cried, &ldquo;Oh, Edward, what must we
  do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Even in that fearful situation&mdash;alone on the mountain, in the
  storm,&mdash;he felt within him a thrill of strength and pleasure that she
  called him Edward, and that she clung so confidingly upon his arm.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dare you stay here, Violet,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;while I run
  forward and try to catch some glimpse of a light?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I dare not, I dare not,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;you might miss
  your way in coming back to me, and I should be alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He saw that she loved him; he had read the secret of her heart, and he was
  happy. Passionately he drew her towards him, and on her soft fragrant
  cheek&mdash;on which the pallor of dread had not yet extinguished the glow
  which had been kindled by the mountain wind&mdash;he printed a lover&rsquo;s
  kiss; but in maidenly reserve she drew back, and was afraid to have revealed
  her secret, and once more she said, &ldquo;Oh, Mr Kennedy, we shall die if we
  stay here unsheltered in this storm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As though to confirm her words, the thunder began to growl, and while the
  sounds of it were beaten back with long loud hollow buffetings from the rocks
  on every side, the blue and winged flash of lightning glittered before their
  eyes, cleaving a rift with dazzling and vivid intensity amid the purple
  gloom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stay here but one instant, Violet&mdash;Miss Home,&rdquo;&mdash;he
  said; &ldquo;I will climb this rock to see if any light is near, and will be
  with you again in a moment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He bounded actively up the rock, reckless of danger, and gazed from the
  summit into the night. For a second, another flash of lightning half blinded
  him with its lurid glare, but when he was again accustomed to the darkness,
  he saw a dull glimmer in the distance, and supposing it to come from the
  hotel, sprang down the rock again to Violet&rsquo;s side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;dear Violet; I see a light, and
  from the direction of it I think it must be from our hotel. Keep up courage,
  and we shall soon reach it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dangerous as it was to hurry over the wet and slippery shale, and down the
  steep sides of the rugged hill, Kennedy half drew, half-carried her along
  with swift steps towards the place from which the dim light still seemed to
  allure them by its wavering and uncertain flicker.</p>

  <h2>XVII. &mdash; A NIGHT OF TERROR</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;For the strength of the hills we bless Thee,<br>
  Our God, our Father&rsquo;s God;<br>
  Thou hast made our spirits mighty,<br>
  By the touch of the mountain sod!&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Hemans.</p><br>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;HERE you all are, then,&rdquo; said the cheerful
  voice of Mr Kennedy, as Julian, Eva, and Cyril, followed by the guide,
  entered the little Mrrem Inn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here are three of us,&rdquo; answered Julian; &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t
  Edward and Violet arrived? Not having seen them for the last half-hour, I
  fancied they must have got before us by some short cut.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;ve not come yet. Fortunately for you, Eva, Aunt
  Dudley is very tired and has gone to bed,&rdquo; he said laughing,
  &ldquo;otherwise you would have got a scolding for not taking better care of
  Violet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, then, they must be close behind somewhere for certain,&rdquo;
  said Julian; &ldquo;they could not have missed the path&mdash;it lay straight
  before us the whole way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I hope they&rsquo;ll be in soon, for it begins to look
  lowering. I&rsquo;ve ordered tea for you; make haste and come down to it.
  You&rsquo;re ready for tea, Cyril, I have no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Rather</i>!&rdquo; said Cyril, reviving; for fatigue had made
  him very quiet during the last half-hour. And, indeed, the tempting-looking
  display on the table, the bright teapot, and substantial meal, and amber-
  coloured honey, would have allured a more fastidious appetite.</p>

  <p>They ran up-stairs to make themselves comfortable before having tea and
  retiring to bed, and on re-entering the warm and glowing room, their first
  question was, &ldquo;Have they come?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr Kennedy, anxiously, and even the boy&rsquo;s
  face grew grave and thoughtful as Julian rose from the tea-table and said,
  &ldquo;I must go and search for them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He seized his straw hat, put on his boots again, and ran out, calling on
  the guide to accompany him. They took out with them a lighted torch, but it
  was instantly extinguished by the streaming rain. Julian and the guide
  shouted at the top of their voices, but heard no sound in reply; and the
  darkness was now so intense, that it was madness to proceed farther amid that
  howling storm.</p>

  <p>They ran back to the inn, where the rest sat round the table, pale and
  trembling with excessive fear. In reply to their hasty questions, Julian
  could only shake his head sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The guide says that in all probability they must have been
  overtaken by the storm, and have run to some chalet for refuge. If so, they
  will be safe and well-treated till the morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You children had better go to bed,&rdquo; said Mr Kennedy to Eva
  and Cyril, who reluctantly obeyed. &ldquo;You cannot be of any help, and
  directly the storm begins to abate, Julian and I will go and find the
  others.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, papa,&rdquo; sobbed Eva; &ldquo;poor Eddy and Violet! What will
  become of them? Perhaps they have been struck by the lightning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are in God&rsquo;s hand, dearest,&rdquo; he said, tenderly
  kissing her tearful face, &ldquo;as we all are. In His hand they are as safe
  as we.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s hand, dear Eva,&rdquo; said Julian, as he bade her
  good-night. &ldquo;Go to sleep, and no doubt they will be here safe before
  you awake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall not sleep, Julian,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;I shall go
  and pray for their safety. Dear, dear Eddy and Violet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cyril lingered in the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do let me stay up with you, Julian. I couldn&rsquo;t
  sleep&mdash;indeed, I couldn&rsquo;t; and I might be of some use when morning
  comes, and when you go to look for them. Do let me stay, Julian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian could not resist his brother&rsquo;s wish, though Mr Kennedy
  thought it best that the boy should go to bed.</p>

  <p>So they compromised matters by getting him to lie down on the sofa, while
  they sat up, and stared out of the windows silently into the rain. How
  wearily the time goes by when you dread a danger which no action can
  avert.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the objects of their anxiety had hurried up to the light, and
  found that it came from the ragged windows of an old tumble-down tenement,
  built of pine-boards which the sun had dried and charred, until they looked
  black and stained and forbidding. Going up the rotten wooden steps to the
  door, and looking through the broken windows, Kennedy saw two men seated,
  smoking, with a flaring tallow candle between them.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Must we go in there?&rdquo; asked Violet; and Kennedy observed how
  her arm and the tones of her voice were trembling with agitation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it better than staying out in this dreadful
  storm?&rdquo; said Kennedy. &ldquo;The Swiss are an honest people, and I
  daresay these are herdsmen who will gladly give us food and
  shelter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Their voices had roused the inmates of the chlet, and both the men jumped
  up from their seats, while a large and fierce mastiff also shook himself from
  sleep, and gave a low deep growl.</p>

  <p>Kennedy knocked at the door. A gruff voice bade him enter; and as he
  stepped over the threshold, the dog flew at him with an angry bark. Violet
  uttered a cry of fear, and Kennedy struck the dog a furious blow with the
  knobbed end of his alpenstock, which for the moment stunned the animal, while
  it drew down on the heads of the tired and fainting travellers a volley of
  brutal German oaths.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you give us shelter?&rdquo; said Kennedy, who spoke German with
  tolerable fluency. &ldquo;We have lost our way, and cannot stay out in this
  storm.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man snarled an affirmative, and Violet observed with a shudder that he
  was an ill-looking, one-eyed fellow, with villainy stamped legibly on every
  feature. The other peasant looked merely stolid and dirty, and seemed to be
  little better than a cretin, as he sat heavily in his place without offering
  to stir.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you give us some food, or at any rate some
  milk?&mdash;we have been to the top of the Schilthorn, and are very
  tired.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man brought out a huge coarse wooden bowl of goat&rsquo;s milk, and
  some sour bread; and feeling in real need of food, they tried to eat and
  drink. While doing so, Kennedy noticed that Violet gave a perceptible start
  and looking up, observed the one eye of their grim entertainer intently fixed
  on the gold watch-chain which hung over his silk jersey. He stared the man
  full in the face, finished his meal, and then asked for a candle to show the
  lady to her room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No light but this,&rdquo; said the Cyclops, as Kennedy mentally
  named him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you must lend me this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And taking it without more ado, he went first to the cupboard from which
  the milk had been produced, where seeing another dip, he coolly took it,
  lighted it, and pushed open the creaking door which opened on the close, damp
  closet which the man had indicated as the only place where Violet could
  sleep.</p>

  <p>This room opened on another rather larger; and here, putting the candle on
  the floor, for the room, (if room it could be called), was destitute of all
  furniture, he spread his plaid on the ground over some straw, and
  said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Try to sleep here, Miss Home, till morning. I will keep watch in
  the outer room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shut the door, went back to the two men, looked full at them both, and
  leaving them their candle, returned to the closet, where, fastening the door
  with his invaluable alpenstock, he sat on the ground by the entrance of
  Violet&rsquo;s room. He heard her murmuring words of prayer, and knew well
  that she could not sleep in such a situation; but he himself determined to
  sit in perfect silence, to keep watch, and to commend himself and her, whom
  he now knew that he loved more than himself, in inward supplication to the
  merciful protection of their God and Father.</p>

  <p>He felt a conviction that they had fallen into bad hands. The man&rsquo;s
  anger had first been stirred by the severe wound which Kennedy had in self-
  defence inflicted on the dog, and now there was too much reason to dread that
  his cupidity had been excited by the sight of the gold chain, and by
  Violet&rsquo;s ornaments, which gave promise that he might by this accident
  gain a wealthy prize.</p>

  <p>After an interval of silence, during which he perceived that they listened
  at his door, and were deceived by his measured breathing into a notion that
  he was asleep, he noticed that they put out the candle, and continued to
  whisper in low thick voices. He was very very weary, his head nodded many
  times, and more than once he was afraid that sleep would overcome him,
  especially as he dared not stir or change his position; but the thought of
  Violet&rsquo;s danger, and the blaze of the lightning mingled with the yell
  of the wind kept him watchful, and he spent the interminable moments in
  thinking how to act when the attack came.</p>

  <p>At last, about an hour and a half after he had retired, he heard the men
  stir, and with a thrill of horror he detected the sound of guns being loaded.
  Violet&rsquo;s candle was yet burning, as he perceived by the faint light
  under her door, so he wrote on a leaf of his pocket-book in the dark,
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Violet, whatever you may hear; trust in
  God,&rdquo; and noiselessly pushed it under the crevice of the door into her
  room.</p>

  <p>The muffled footsteps approached, but he never varied the sound of his
  regular breathing. At last came a push at the door, followed by silence, and
  then the whisper, &ldquo;he has fastened it.&rdquo; Still he did not stir,
  till he observed that they were both close against the door, and were
  preparing to force it open. Then guided by a swift instinctive resolution, he
  determined to trust to the effects of an unexpected alarm. Noiselessly moving
  his alpenstock, he suddenly and with all his force, dashed the door open,
  shouted aloud, and with his utmost violence swung round the heavy iron spike.
  A flash, the report of a gun, and a yell of anguish instantly followed; and
  as Violet in terror and excitement threw open her door, the light which
  streamed from it showed Kennedy in a moment that the foremost villain,
  startled by the sudden opposition, had accidentally fired off his gun, of
  which the whole contents had lodged themselves in the shoulder of his
  comrade.</p>

  <p>This second man had also armed himself with a chamois-gun, which slipped
  out of his hands as he fell wounded to the ground. Springing forward Kennedy
  wrenched it out of his relaxing grasp, and presented it full at the head of
  the other, who, half-stunned with the blow he had received from the heavy
  iron-shod point of the ashen alpenstock, was crouching for concealment in the
  corner of the chalet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;all is now safe. These wretches are
  disarmed; if you like to take shelter here till the morning, I can secure you
  from any further attack. If you stir but an inch,&rdquo; he continued,
  addressing the unwounded man, &ldquo;I will shoot you dead. Lay down your
  gun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man&rsquo;s one eye glared with rage and hatred, but Kennedy still
  held the loaded gun at his head, and he was forced sullenly to obey. Kennedy
  put his foot upon the gun, and was in perplexity what to do next, fearing
  that the wounded murderer, who was moaning heavily, might nevertheless spring
  at him from behind, and also momentarily dreading an attack from the mastiff,
  who kept up a sullen growl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us leave this dreadful place,&rdquo; said Violet, who, pale but
  undaunted at the horrors of the scene, had taken refuge by Kennedy&rsquo;s
  side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dare you pick up and carry the gun?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It
  would be dangerous to leave it in their hands.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Violet picked it up, where it lay under his feet, and then glided rapidly
  out of the chlet, while Kennedy slowly followed, never once taking his eye
  from his crouching antagonist. Before he stepped into the open air, he said
  to the men, &ldquo;If I hear but one footstep in pursuit of us, I will shoot
  one of you dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, what a relief to be on the mountain-turf once more!&rdquo; said
  Violet in a low and broken whisper, as she grasped Kennedy&rsquo;s arm, and
  he cautiously led her down a rude path, which was faintly marked a few
  hundred yards from the lonely cottage where they had been. &ldquo;Are we safe
  now, do you think?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, quite safe, Violet, I trust. They will not dare pursue me, now
  that their guns are gone, and I have this loaded one in my hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear brave Mr Kennedy. How shall I ever thank you enough for having
  saved my life so nobly? If you had not been so strong and watchful, we should
  both have now been killed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would die a thousand deaths,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;to save
  you from the least harm, Violet. But you are tired, you must rest here till
  the dawn. Sit under this rock, dearest, and cover yourself with my plaid. I
  will keep watch still.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sat down wearily, and her head sank upon the rock. The storm was over:
  the thunder was still muttering like a baffled enemy in the distance, but the
  wind after its late fury was sobbing gently and fitfully like a repentant
  child. The rock gave her shelter, and after her fatigue and agitation she was
  sleeping peacefully, while Kennedy bowed down his head, and thanked God for
  the merciful protection which He had extended to them.</p>

  <p>He had not been seated long when his eye caught the light of torches,
  being waved at a distance in the direction of the hotel. In an instant, he
  felt sure that Julian was come out to search for them, and gently awakening
  Violet, he told her with a thrill of joy that help was at hand. The torches
  drew nearer the place where they were seated, and he raised a joyous shout.
  As yet they were too far off to hear him, but suddenly it occurred to him to
  fire his gun. The flash and echoing report attracted their notice; the
  torches grew rapidly nearer; he could almost see the dark figures of those
  who carried them; and now in answer to his second shout came the hurried
  sound of familiar voices, and in five minutes more Julian and his father had
  grasped him by the hands, and Cyril had flung his arms round Violet&rsquo;s
  neck.</p>

  <p>And now at last Kennedy gave way to his emotion, and his highly-wrought
  feelings found relief in a burst of passionate tears. It was no time for
  questionings. Julian passed his arm round his sister&rsquo;s waist, and,
  aided by Mr Kennedy, half-carried her to their hotel. Kennedy leaned heavily
  on the guide&rsquo;s arm; the honest landlord, who accompanied the searching
  party, carried the plaid, the alpenstock, and one of the guns, and Cyril,
  impressed by the strange scene, carried the other gun, full of wondering
  conjecture what Kennedy could have been doing with it, and from whence it
  could have come.</p>

  <p>And when Violet reached Eva&rsquo;s room, in which she slept, she could
  only say, as they sat locked in a long embrace:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dearest Eva, it is only through Edward that my life has been
  saved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Eva had never before heard Violet call her brother by his name, and she
  was glad at heart.</p>

  <h2>XVIII. &mdash; THE ALPEN-GLHEN</h2>

  <p>&ldquo;And, last of all,<br>
  Love, like an Alpine harebell, hung with tears,<br>
  By some cold morning glacier.&rdquo;<br>
  <i>The Princess.</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">VIOLET&rsquo;S fluttered nerves and wearied frame rendered
  it necessary for the party of English travellers to stay for a few days at
  Mrrem, and afterwards it was decided that they should all go down to
  Grindelwald, and spend there the remainder of the time which they had set
  apart for the Swiss tour. The landlord of the Jungfrau treated them with the
  utmost consideration, and amused Kennedy by paying him as much deference as
  if he had been Tell or Arnold himself. Leaving in his hands all endeavours to
  discover the two scoundrels, who had entirely decamped, Kennedy gave him one
  of the guns, while he carried with him the other to keep as a trophy in his
  rooms at Camford.</p>

  <p>There are few sights more pleasant than that of two families bound
  together by the ties of friendship and affection, and living together as
  though they were all brothers and sisters of a common home. For long years
  afterwards the Homes and the Kennedys looked back on those days at
  Grindelwald as among the happiest of their lives, and, indeed, they glided by
  like a dream of unbroken pleasure. How is it that there can be such a thing
  as ennui, or that people ever can be at a loss what to do? In the morning
  they took short excursions to the glaciers or the roots of the great
  mountains, and Cyril made adventurous expeditions with his fishing-rod to the
  mountain-streams. And at evening they sat in the long twilight in the balcony
  of their room, while Eva and Violet sang them sweet, simple English songs,
  which rang so softly through the air, that the crowd of guides and porters
  which always hang about a Swiss hotel used to gather in the streets to
  listen, and the English visitors collected in the garden to catch the
  familiar tones. Julian and Kennedy always gave some hours every day to their
  books, and Cyril, though he could be persuaded to do little else, spent some
  of his unemployed time on his much-abused holiday task for the ensuing
  quarter at Marlby.</p>

  <p>And when the candles were lit, the girls would sketch or work, and Julian
  or Kennedy would read or translate to them aloud. Sometimes they spent what
  Mr Kennedy used to call &ldquo;an evening with the immortals,&rdquo; and
  taking some volume of the poets, would each choose a favourite passage to
  read aloud in turn. This was Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s great delight, and he got
  quite enthusiastic when the well-remembered lines came back to him with fresh
  beauty, borne on the pleasant voices of Eva, Julian, or Cyril, like an old
  jewel when new facets are cut on its lustrous surface.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop there; that&rsquo;s an immortal, lad&mdash;an immortal,&rdquo;
  he would say to Cyril, when the boy seemed to be passing over some flower of
  poetic thought without sufficient admiration; and then he would repeat the
  passage from memory with such just emphasis, that on these evenings all felt
  that they were laying up precious thoughts for happy future hours.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Mrs Dudley, and you young ladies, we&rsquo;re going to
  translate you part of a Greek novel to-night,&rdquo; said Julian.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A Greek novel!&rdquo; said Cyril, with a touch of incredulous
  suspicion. &ldquo;Those old creatures didn&rsquo;t write novels, did
  they?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only the best novel that ever was written, Cyril.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it called?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Odyssey.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, what a chouse! You don&rsquo;t mean to call that a novel, do
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, let the ladies decide.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So he read to them how Ulysses returned in the guise of a beggar, after
  twenty years of war and wandering to his own palace-door, and saw the haughty
  suitors revelling in his halls; and how, as he reached the door, Argus, the
  hunting-dog, now old and neglected, and full of fleas, recollected him, when
  all had forgotten him, and fawned upon him, and licked his hand and died; and
  how the suitors insulted him, and one of them threw a foot-stool at him,
  which by one quick move he avoided, and said nothing, and another flung a
  shin-bone at his head, which he caught in his hand, and said nothing, but
  only smiled grimly in his heart&mdash;ever so little, a grim, sardonic smile
  and how the old nurse recognised him by the scar of the boar&rsquo;s tusk on
  his leg, but he quickly repressed the exclamation of wonderment which sprang
  to her lips; and how he sat, ragged but princely, by the fire in his hall,
  and the red light flickered over him, and he spake to the suitors words of
  solemn warning; and how, when Agelaus warned them, a strange foreboding
  seized their souls, and they looked at each other with great eyes, and smiled
  with alien lips, and burst into quenchless laughter, though their eyes were
  filled with tears; and how Ulysses drew his own mighty bow, which not one of
  them could use, and how he handled it, and twanged the string till it sang
  like a swallow in his ear, and sent the arrow flying with a whiz through the
  twelve iron rings of the line of axes; and then, lastly, how, like to a god,
  he leapt on his own threshold with a shout, and gathered his rags about him,
  and aided by the young Telemachus and the divine Swineherd, sent hurtling
  into the band of wine-stained rioters the swift arrows of inevitable
  death.</p>

  <p>Pleased with the tale, which the girls decided, in spite of Cyril&rsquo;s
  veto, to be a genuine novel, they asked for a new Greek romance, and Julian
  read to them from Herodotus about the rise and fall of empires, and
  &ldquo;Strange stories of the deaths of kings.&rdquo; One of his stories was
  the famous one of Croesus, and the irony of his fate, and the warning words
  of Solon, all of which, rendered into quaint rich English, struck Cyril so
  much, that, mingling up the tale with reminiscences of Longfellow&rsquo;s
  &ldquo;Blind Bartimeus,&rdquo; he produced, with much modesty at the
  breakfast-table next morning, the following very creditable boyish
  imitation:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Speak Grecia&rsquo;s wisest, thou, &rsquo;tis
  said,<br>
  Full deeply in Life&rsquo;s page hast read,<br>
  And many a clime hath known my tread;<br>
  Tis pantoon olbiotatos?<br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;The monarch raised his eager eye,<br>
  Gazed on the sage exultingly,<br>
  And slow came forth the calm reply<br>
  Tellos ho Atheenaios.<br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;Upon his funeral pyre he lay<br>
  Crownless, his sceptre passed away,<br>
  The shade of Solon seem to say,<br>
  oudeis toon zoontoon holbios.<br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;How little thought that Grecian sage<br>
  Those words should live from aye to aye,<br>
  Tis pantoon olbiotatos?<br>
  Tellos ho Atheenaios,<br>
  oudeis toon zoontoon holbios.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>(Note. These verses were really written by a boy of fourteen.)</p>

  <p>In a manner such as this the summer hours glided happily away. But all
  things, happy or mournful, must come to an end, lest we should forget God in
  our prosperity, or curse Him in our despair. Too quickly for all their wishes
  their last Sunday in Switzerland had come. Most of them had spent the day in
  thoughtful retirement or quiet occupations, and both morning and evening they
  assembled together in their pleasant sitting-room for matins and evensong.
  Their thoughts were full of the coming separation, and it gave a deep
  interest to these last services; for the Homes, unwilling to leave their
  mother and Frank so long alone at Ildown, were to start for England on the
  following day, and the Kennedys intended to visit Chamounix for two weeks
  more.</p>

  <p>On the Sunday evening they strolled down to the glacier to look once
  again, for the last time, into its crevices, and wonder at its fairy caverns,
  fringed with icicles, like rows of silver daggers, and ceiled with
  translucent sapphire, beneath whose blue fretwork the stray sunbeams lost
  their way amid ice-blocks of luminous green, and pillars of lapis-lazuli and
  crystal. They sat on a huge boulder of granite, which some avalanche had torn
  down, and tumbled from the mountain&rsquo;s side, and there enjoyed the icy
  wind which tempered the warm evening air, as it swept over the leaping waves
  of the glacier stream.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a mixture of terror and beauty these monstrous glaciers
  are,&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;crawling down the valleys, and shearing away
  the solid rocks before them like gigantic ploughshares.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Eva. &ldquo;When you look up at the tumbled
  pinnacles of those sracs, does it not seem as if Summer had rent in anger
  with some great ice-axe the huge enemy whom she could not quite
  destroy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And see,&rdquo; said Mr Kennedy, &ldquo;how Nature gets out of
  these terrible heaps of shattered ice both use and beauty; and since she must
  leave them as the eternal fountains of her rivers, see how she tinges them
  with her loveliest blue.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They talked on until it was time to return, but Violet and Kennedy still
  lingered, sitting on the vast boulder, under pretence of seeing the
  sunset.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t get lost again, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; said
  Cyril sagely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh no, we shall be back very soon,&rdquo; answered Violet, but she
  felt instinctively that the &ldquo;very soon&rdquo; in time might measure an
  eternity of emotion.</p>

  <p>Need we say that Kennedy and Violet had, since that night of wild
  adventure, loved each other, hour by hour, with deeper affection? He was
  young, and brave, and light-hearted, and of a pleasant countenance; and she
  was a young, and confiding, and graceful, and lovely girl, and they were
  drawn to one another with a love which absorbed all other thoughts, and
  overpowered all other considerations; and it was unspeakable happiness for
  each to know how lovely were all their acts, and how dear were all their
  words in the other&rsquo;s eyes. And now that the time was come to declare
  the love in words, and ratify it by a plighted troth, there was something in
  the act so solemn as almost to disturb their dream of a lover&rsquo;s
  paradise.</p>

  <p>They sat silent on the rock until the sun had set behind the peaks of
  snow, and their eyes were filled with idle yet delicious tears. Ripples of
  luminous sunshine, and banks of primrose-coloured cloud still lingered on the
  path which the sun had traversed, and, when even these began to fade, there
  stole along the hill crests above them a film of tender colour, flinging a
  veil of the softest carnation over their cold grey rocks, and untrodden
  fields of perpetual snow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Look, Violet, at that rose-colour on the hills; does it not seem as
  it rests on those chill ledges, as though Nature had said that her last act
  to-day should be a triumph of glory, and her last thought a thought of
  love?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Violet murmured an assent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Violet,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you know that I love you,
  and I know that you love me;&mdash;is it not so, Violet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He hardly heard the &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; which came half like a sigh from
  her lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Violet, dear Violet, we part to-morrow; let me hear you say
  &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; more clearly still.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know I love you, Edward&mdash;did you not save my
  life?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know you love me,&rdquo; he repeated slowly, &ldquo;but, oh
  Violet, I am not worthy of you&mdash;I am not all you think me.&rdquo; There
  passed over his fair forehead the expression of humiliation and pain which
  she had seen there with wonder once or twice before.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are good and noble, Edward,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I see
  you to be good and noble, or I could not love you as I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;alas! not good, not noble,
  Violet&mdash;in no wise worthy of one so pure, and bright, and beautiful as
  you are.&rdquo; He bent his face over her hand, and his warm tears fell fast
  upon it. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I will strive to be so
  hereafter, Violet, for your sweet sake. Oh, can you take me as I am? Will you
  make me good and noble, Violet, as Julian is? Can you let the sunshine of
  your life fall on the shadow of mine?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did not understand his passion as he raised to her his face, not
  bright and laughing as it generally was, but stained with the traces of many
  tears; she only knew that he had won her whole heart, and for one moment she
  let her hand rest in the curls of the head which he had bent once more.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Violet,&rdquo; he said, looking up again, &ldquo;I can be
  anything if you love me.&rdquo; In an instant the cloud had passed away from
  his face, and the old sunshine brightened his blue eyes. For one instant
  their eyes met with that lustrous and dewy love-gleam that only lovers know,
  but during that instant it seemed as if their souls had flowed together into
  a common fount. With a happy look she suffered him to take her hand, and draw
  off from her finger a sapphire ring; this he put on his own finger, while on
  hers he replaced it by the gold-set ruby, his mother&rsquo;s gift, which he
  usually wore.</p>

  <p>The crescent moon had risen as they walked home, and they found the rest
  of the party seated in the hotel garden, under her soft silver light; but
  nobody seemed to be much in a mood for talking, until that little monkey
  Cyril, who observed everything, exclaimed&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Julian, do look; Violet has got Kennedy&rsquo;s ring on,
  and&mdash;well, I declare if he hasn&rsquo;t got hers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us all come up-stairs,&rdquo; said Kennedy hastily and then,
  before them all, he drew Violet to his side, and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Julian, Violet and I are betrothed to each other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As I thought,&rdquo; said Julian with a smile, as a rush of sudden
  emotion made his eyes glisten, and he warmly grasped Kennedy&rsquo;s
  hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And as I hoped, Julian,&rdquo; said Mr Kennedy, as he turned away
  to wipe his spectacles, which somehow had grown dim.</p>

  <p>The moonlight streamed over them as the two stood there together, young,
  happy, hopeful, beautiful, and while Cyril held Kennedy&rsquo;s hand, Eva and
  Violet exchanged a sister&rsquo;s kiss.</p>

  <p>And Julian looked on with a glow of happiness&mdash;happiness that had one
  drawback only&mdash;a passing shadow of sorrow for the possible feelings of
  De Vayne.</p>

  <h2>XIX. &mdash; ONLY A BLUSH</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;Erubuit! salva res est!&rdquo;</i>
  &mdash;Plautus.</p>

  <p class="first">BACK from the glistening snow-fields, where every separate
  crystal flashes with a separate gleam of light&mdash;back from the Alpine
  pastures, embroidered with their tissue of innumerable flowers, over which,
  like winged flowers, the butterflies flutter continually&mdash;back from the
  sunlit silver mantle of the everlasting hills, and the thunder of the
  avalanche, and the wild leap of the hissing cataract&mdash;back to the cold
  grey flats and ancient towers of Camford, and the lazy windings of the muddy
  Iscam, and the strife and struggle of a university career.</p>

  <p>Kennedy arrived at Camford at mid-day, and as but few men had yet come up,
  he beguiled the time by going out to make the usual formal call on his tutor.
  As he passed the door of the room where temptation had brought on him so many
  heavy hours, he could hardly repress an involuntary shudder; but on the
  whole, he was in high spirits, and Mr Grayson received him with something
  almost approaching to cordiality.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You did very well in the examination, Mr Kennedy; very well indeed.
  With diligence you might have been head of your year&mdash;as it was, you
  were in the first ten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was Owen head of the year, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Home was head; his brilliant composition, and thorough
  knowledge of the books, brought him to the top. Either he or Owen were first
  in all the papers except one.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which was that, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The Aeschylus paper, in which you were first, Mr Kennedy; you did
  it remarkably accurately. If you had seen the paper, you could hardly have
  done it better.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Indeed! Would you give me a library order, sir?&rdquo; said
  Kennedy, rising abruptly, to change the subject. Mr Grayson was offended at
  this sudden change of subject, and, silently writing the order, bade Kennedy
  a cold &ldquo;good morning.&rdquo; All that Kennedy hoped was that he would
  not tell others as well as himself, the odious fact of his success.</p>

  <p>The thought damped his spirits, but he shook it off. The novelty of
  returning as a junior soph, the pleasure of meeting the familiar faces once
  more, the consciousness of that bright change of existence, which, during the
  past vacation, had bound the golden thread of Violet&rsquo;s destiny with
  his, filled him with inward exultation. And then there was real delight in
  the warmth with which he was greeted by all alike.</p>

  <p>He found himself, very unexpectedly, a hero in the general estimation. The
  romantic adventure on the Schilthorn had been rumoured about among the
  numerous English visitors to the Valley of Lauterbrunnen, until it had
  reached the editor of a local paper, and so had flowed through
  <i>Galignani</i> into the general stream of the English journals. True, the
  names had been suppressed, but all the Saint Werner&rsquo;s men knew who was
  intended by &ldquo;Mr K dash y,&rdquo; and as he entered the hall there was a
  murmur of applause.</p>

  <p>He was greeted on all sides with eager questions.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, Mr K dash y,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;did the fellow whom you
  shot die of his wound?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was rather a chouse to shoot a cretin, though,&rdquo; said
  another, in chaff.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> shoot him,&rdquo; said Kennedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, you very leerily managed to make the other fellow shoot him.
  Preserve me from my friends, must have been his secret
  reflections.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you kept the guns, Kennedy? You must let me have a look after
  hall.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While this kind of talk was going on, Brogten, who was nearly opposite to
  Kennedy, sat silent, and watched him.</p>

  <p>He did not join in the remarks about the night adventure in Switzerland,
  but when there was a slight pause in the fire of questions, he turned the
  conversation to the subject of the May examination.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Those are not your only triumphs, Kennedy, it appears. You seem to
  have been doing uncommonly well in the examination, too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh aye, you were in the first ten,&rdquo; said Suton; &ldquo;Mr
  Grayson told me so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who was first?&rdquo; asked Lillyston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Home of course; except in one paper, and Kennedy was first in
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I believe that was the Aeschylus paper,&rdquo; said Brogten,
  throwing the slightest unusual emphasis into his tone; &ldquo;you were first
  in that, weren&rsquo;t you, Kennedy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The men were surprised to hear Brogten address him with such careless
  familiarity, knowing the old quarrel that existed between them; and they were
  still more surprised to hear Brogten interest himself about a topic usually
  so indifferent to him as the result of an examination. It seemed particularly
  strange that he should give himself any trouble to inquire about the present
  list, because he himself had been <i>posted</i>, in company with Hazlet and
  Lord Fitzurse, <i>i e</i>, their names had been written up below the eighth
  class, as &ldquo;<i>unworthy to be classed</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was I?&rdquo; said Kennedy in the most careless tone he could
  assume.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;really, didn&rsquo;t you know it? You did it so well that
  Grayson said, you <i>couldn&rsquo;t have done the paper better if you had
  seen it beforehand</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, Kennedy, you <i>must</i> have come out swell, then,&rdquo;
  said D&rsquo;Acres, &ldquo;for Grayson said just the same thing to
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How very odd,&rdquo; said Brogten, affectedly. &ldquo;You
  <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> see the papers beforehand, Kennedy&mdash;did
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The last few moments had been torture to Kennedy; he had moved uneasily;
  the bright look of gratified triumph, which the allusions to his courage had
  called forth, had gone out the moment the examination was mentioned, and it
  was only by a painful and violent exercise of the will that he was able to
  keep back the blood which had begun to rush towards his cheeks. In the
  endeavour to check or suppress the blush, he had grown ashy pale; but now
  that Brogten&rsquo;s dark and cruel eye was upon him&mdash;now that the
  protruding underlip curled with a sneer that left no more room to doubt that
  he <i>was</i> master of Kennedy&rsquo;s guilty secret&mdash;the effort was
  useless, and spite of will, the burning crimson of an uncontrollable shame
  burst and flashed over Kennedy&rsquo;s usually clear and open face. It was no
  ordinary blush&mdash;no common passage of colour over the cheeks. Over face,
  and neck, and brow the guilty blood seemed to be crowding tumultuously, and
  when it had filled every vein and fibre till it swelled, then the rich
  scarlet seemed to linger there as though it would never die away again, and
  if for an instant it began to fade, then the hidden thought sent new waves of
  hot agony in fresh pulses to supply its place. And all the while the
  conscious victim made matters worse by his attempts to seem unconcerned,
  until his forehead was wet with heavy perspiration. By that time the men had
  turned to other topics, and were talking about Bruce&rsquo;s laziness, and
  the utter manner in which he must have fallen off for his name to appear, as
  it had done, in the second class; and, in course of time, Kennedy&rsquo;s
  face was as pale and cold as it before had burned and glowed.</p>

  <p>And all this while, though he would not look&mdash;though he looked at his
  plate, and at the busts over his head, and the long portraits of Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s worthies on the walls, and on this side and on
  that&mdash;Kennedy knew full well that Brogten&rsquo;s eye had been on him
  from beginning to end, and that Brogten was enjoying, with devilish
  malignity, the sense of power which he had gained from the knowledge of
  another&rsquo;s sin. The thought was intolerable to him, and, finishing his
  dinner with hasty gulps, he left the hall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Brogten, how rude you were to Kennedy,&rdquo; said Lillyston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was I?&rdquo; said Brogten, in a tone of sarcasm and defiance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No wonder he blushed at your coarse insinuations.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; said Brogten, in the same tone; &ldquo;am I the
  only person who makes coarse insinuations, as you call them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is just like you to do so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it? Oh well, I shall have to make some more, perhaps, before I
  have done.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better look out what you say to Kennedy, at any
  rate. He is a fiery subject.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, I will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This wrangling was very unprofitable, and Lillyston gladly dropped it, not
  however without feeling somewhat puzzled at the air which Brogten
  assumed.</p>

  <p>That night Kennedy was sitting miserably in his room alone; he had refused
  all invitations, and had asked nobody to take tea with him. He was just
  making tea for himself, when Brogten came to see him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I stay to tea?&rdquo; he asked, in mock humility.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said Kennedy.</p>

  <p>He stayed to tea, and talked about all kinds of subjects rather than the
  one which was prominent in the thoughts of both. He told Kennedy old Harton
  stories, and asked him about Marlby; he turned the subject to Home, and
  really interested Kennedy by telling him what kind of a boy Julian had been,
  and what inseparable friends he had always been with Lillyston, and how
  admirably he had recited on speech-day, and how stainless his whole life had
  been, and how vice and temptation seemed to skulk away at his very look.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are reconciled to him, then,&rdquo; said Kennedy in
  surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. At heart, I always respected him. He wasn&rsquo;t a fellow
  to take the worst view of one&rsquo;s character, you know, or to make nasty
  innuendoes&mdash;&rdquo; He stopped, and eyed Kennedy as a parrot eyes a
  finger put into his cage, which he <i>could</i> peck if he would. &ldquo;He
  wasn&rsquo;t, you know, a kind of fellow who would force you to leave the
  table by sneering at you in hall&mdash;&rdquo; He still continued to eye
  Kennedy, but in vain, for Kennedy kept his moody glance on the table and was
  silent, and would not look at him or speak to him. Brogten could not help
  being struck with his appearance as he sat there motionless,&mdash;the noble
  and perfectly formed head, the well-cut features, the cheek a little pale
  now, so boyishly smooth and round, the latent powers of fire and sarcasm and
  strength in the bright eye and beautiful lip. It was a base source of triumph
  that made Brogten exult in the knowledge that this youth was in his power;
  that he held for a time at least the strings of his happiness or misery; that
  at any time by a word in any public place he could bring on his fine features
  that hue of shame; that for his own purposes he could at any time ruin his
  reputation, and put an end to his popularity.</p>

  <p>Not that he intended to do so. He had the power, but unless provoked, he
  did not wish or mean to use it. It was far more luxurious to keep it to
  himself, and use it as occasion might serve. Everybody&rsquo;s secret is
  nobody&rsquo;s secret, and it was enough for Brogten to enjoy privately the
  triumph he had longed for, and which accident had put into his hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, come, Kennedy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is nonsense; we
  understand each other. I saw you coolly read over the whole
  examination-paper, you know, which wasn&rsquo;t the most honourable thing in
  the world to do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paused and half relented as he saw a solitary tear on Kennedy&rsquo;s
  cheek, which was indignantly brushed away almost as soon as it had
  started.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;cheer up, man. I&rsquo;m not going to
  tell of you; neither Grayson nor any of the men shall know it, and at present
  not a soul has a suspicion of such a thing except ourselves.
  Come&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had my triumph over you, for your sharp words in hall
  last term, before all the men, and that&rsquo;s all I wanted. Don&rsquo;t
  let&rsquo;s be enemies any longer. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But Kennedy sat there passively, and when Brogten had gone away whistling
  &ldquo;The Rat-catcher&rsquo;s Daughter,&rdquo; he leant his head upon his
  hand, and his thoughts wandered away to Violet Home.</p>

  <p>O holy, ennobling, purifying love! He felt that if he had known Violet
  before, he should not now have been in Brogten&rsquo;s power. He fancied that
  the secret had oozed out; he fancied that men eyed him sometimes with strange
  glances; he pictured to himself the degradation he should feel if Julian, or
  De Vayne, or Lillyston ever knew of what weakness he was capable. This one
  error rode like a night-mare on his breast.</p>

  <p>But none of his gloomy presentiments on the score of detection were
  fulfilled. Except to Bruce, and that under pledge of secrecy, Brogten never
  betrayed what he knew, and the only immediate way in which he exercised the
  influence which his knowledge gave him, was by claiming with Kennedy a tone
  of familiarity, and asking him to card parties, suppers, and idle riots of
  all kinds, in which Bruce and Fitzurse were frequent visitors.</p>

  <h2>XX. &mdash; BRUCE THE TEMPTER</h2>

  <p><i>&ldquo;Oui autrefois; mais nous avons chang tout cela.&rdquo;</i>
  &mdash;Molire.</p><br>

  <p class="first">BRUCE was disgusted with his second class in the Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s May examination. He had quite flattered himself that he could
  not fail to be among the somewhat large number who annually obtained the
  pleasant and easy distinction of a first. He had not been nearly so idle as
  men supposed, although he had managed to waste a large amount of time; and if
  he could have foreseen that his name would only appear in the Second class,
  he would have endeavoured to be lower still, so as to make it appear that he
  had not condescended to give a thought to the subject. As it was, he hoped
  that if he got a first, men would remark, &ldquo;Clever fellow that Bruce!
  Never opened a book, and yet got a first class;&rdquo; whereas now he knew
  that the general judgment would be, &ldquo;Bruce can&rsquo;t be half such a
  swell as one fancied. He&rsquo;s only taken a second.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His vanity was wounded, and he determined to throw up reading altogether.
  &ldquo;What good would it do him to grind? His father was rolling in money,
  and of course he should cut a very good figure in London when he had left
  Camford, which was a mere place for crammers and crammed,
  etcetera.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So Bruce became more and more confirmed as a trifler and an idler, and he
  suffered that terrible ennui, which dogs the shadow of wasted time.
  Associating habitually with men who were his inferiors in ability, and whose
  tastes were lower than his own, the vacuity of mind and lassitude of body,
  which at times crept over him, were the natural assistants of every
  temptation to extravagance, frivolity, and sin.</p>

  <p>An accidental conversation gave a mischievous turn to his idle
  propensities. Coming into hall one evening, he found himself seated next to
  Suton, and observing from the goose on the table, and the audit ale which was
  circling in the loving cup that it was a feast, he turned to his neighbour,
  and asked:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it a saint&rsquo;s-day to-day?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Suton, &ldquo;and the most memorable of them
  all&mdash;All Saints&rsquo; Day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, really,&rdquo; said Bruce with an expression of half
  contemptuous interest, &ldquo;then I suppose chapel&rsquo;s at a quarter past
  six, and we shall have one of those long winded choral services.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Like them? I should think not! Since one&rsquo;s forced to do a
  certain amount of chapels, the shorter they are the better.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, if you regard it in the light of &lsquo;doing&rsquo; so
  many chapels, you won&rsquo;t find it pleasant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me now,&rdquo; said Bruce, turning round and
  looking full at Suton, &ldquo;that you regard chapels as anything but an
  unmitigated nuisance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Most certainly I do mean to tell you so, if you ask me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah! I see&mdash;a Sim!&rdquo; said Bruce, with the slightest
  possible shrug of the shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by a &lsquo;Sim,&rsquo; Mr
  Bruce,&rdquo; said Suton, slightly colouring; &ldquo;but whether a Sim or
  not, I at least expect to be treated as a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I beg pardon,&rdquo; said Bruce; &ldquo;but I couldn&rsquo;t
  help recognising the usual style of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of cant, I suppose you would say. Thank you. You must find it a
  cold faith to disbelieve in all sincerity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. At any rate, I don&rsquo;t believe that
  all your saints put together were really a bit better than their neighbours;
  so I can&rsquo;t get up an annual enthusiasm in their honour. All men are
  really alike at the bottom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nero&rsquo;s belief,&rdquo; said Owen, who had overheard the
  conversation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether it was Nero&rsquo;s or Neri&rsquo;s
  or Neander&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered Bruce; &ldquo;experience proves it to be
  true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Suton had finished dinner, and as he did not relish Bruce&rsquo;s off-
  hand and patronising manner, he left the discussion in Owen&rsquo;s hand. But
  between Owen and Bruce there was an implacable dissimilarity, and neither of
  them cared to pursue the subject.</p>

  <p>Bruce, who went to wine with D&rsquo;Acres, repeated there the subject of
  the conversation, and found that most of his audience affected to agree with
  him. In fact, he had himself set the fashion of a semi-professed infidelity;
  and amid his most intimate associates there were many to adopt with readiness
  a theory which saved them from the trouble and expense of a scrupulous
  conscience. With Bruce this infidelity was rather the decay of faith than the
  growth of positive disbelief. He had dipped with a kind of wilful curiosity
  into Strauss&rsquo;s Life of Jesus, and other books of a similar description,
  together with such portions of current literature as were most clever in
  sneering at Christianity, or most undisguised in rejecting it.</p>

  <p>Such reading&mdash;harmless, or even desirable, as it might have been to a
  strong mind sincere in its search for truth, and furnished with that calm
  capacity for impartial thought which is the best antidote against
  error&mdash;was fatal to one whose superficial knowledge and irregular life
  gave him already a powerful bias towards getting rid of everything which
  stood in the way of his tendencies and pursuits. Bruce was not in earnest in
  the desire for knowledge and wisdom: he grasped with avidity at a popular
  objection, or a sceptical argument, without desiring to understand or master
  the principles which rendered them nugatory; and he was ignorant and untaught
  enough to fancy that the very foundations of religion were shaken if he could
  attack the authenticity of some Jewish miracle, or impugn the genuineness of
  some Old Testament book.</p>

  <p>When all belief was shaken down in his shallow and somewhat feeble
  understanding, the structure of his moral convictions was but a baseless
  fabric. Error in itself is not fatal to the inner sense of right; but
  Bruce&rsquo;s error was not honest doubt, it was wilful self-deception,
  blindness of heart, first deliberately induced, then penally permitted.</p>

  <p>In Bruce&rsquo;s character there was not only the <i>error in
  intellectu</i>, but also the <i>pertinacia in voluntate</i>. All sense of
  honour, all delicacy of principle, all perception of sin and righteousness,
  all the landmarks of right and wrong, were obliterated in the muddy
  inundation of flippant irreverence and ignorant disbelief.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;For when we in our viciousness grow hard,<br>
  O, misery on&rsquo;t! the wise gods seal our eyes:<br>
  In our own filth drop our clear judgments, make us<br>
  Adore our errors, laugh at us while we strut<br>
  To our confusion.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sometimes half inclined to agree with what you were
  saying about would-be saints,&rdquo; said Brogten, as they left
  D&rsquo;Acres&rsquo; wine-party.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What fun it would be to try the experiment of a saint&rsquo;s
  peccability on some living subject,&rdquo; said Bruce.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rather! Suppose you try on that fellow Hazlet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean the lank party who snuffles the responses with such
  oleaginous sanctimony. Well, I bet you 2 to 1 in ponies that I have him
  roaring drunk before a month&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take the bet,&rdquo; said Brogten, &ldquo;because I
  believe you&rsquo;ll succeed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll t&mdash;t&mdash;take it for the fun,&rdquo; said
  Fitzurse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Done, then!&rdquo; said Bruce.</p>

  <p>So Bruce, <i>pour passer le temps</i>, deliberately undertook the
  corruption of a human soul. That soul might have been low enough already; for
  Hazlet was, as we have seen, mean-hearted and malicious, and in him, although
  unknown to himself, the garb of the Pharisee but concealed the breast of the
  hypocrite. But yet Hazlet <i>was</i> free, and if Bruce had not undertaken
  the devil&rsquo;s work, might have been free to his life&rsquo;s end, from
  all gross forms of transgression&mdash;from all the more flagrant and open
  delinquencies that lay waste the inner sanctities of a fallen human soul.</p>

  <p>He was an easy subject for Bruce&rsquo;s machinations, and those
  machinations were conceived and carried on with consummate and characteristic
  cleverness. Bruce did not spread his net in the sight of the bird, but set to
  work with wariness and caution. He determined to try the arts of fascination,
  not of force. The thought of the desperate wickedness involved in his attempt
  either never crossed his mind, or, if it did, was rejected as the feeble
  suggestion of an over-scrupulous conscience. Bruce pretended at least to
  fancy that the basis of all men&rsquo;s characters was identical, and that,
  as they only differed in external manifestations, it made very little
  difference whether Hazlet became &ldquo;fast&rdquo; or continued
  &ldquo;slow.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fast&rdquo; and &ldquo;slow&rdquo; were the mild
  euphemisms with which Bruce expressed the slight distinction between a
  vicious and a virtuous life.</p>

  <p>At hall&mdash;the grand place for rencontres&mdash;he managed to get a
  seat next to his victim, and began at once to treat him with that appearance
  of easy and well-bred familiarity which he had learnt in London circles. He
  threw a gentle expression of interest into his face and voice, he listened
  with deference to Hazlet&rsquo;s remarks, he addressed several questions to
  him, thanked him politely for all his information, and then adroitly
  introduced some delicate compliments on the agreeableness of Hazlet&rsquo;s
  society. His bait took completely; Hazlet, whom most men snubbed, was quite
  flustered with gratified vanity at the condescending notice of so
  unexceptionable a man of fashion as the handsome and noted Vyvyan Bruce.
  &ldquo;At last,&rdquo; thought Hazlet, &ldquo;men are beginning to appreciate
  my intellectual powers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After continuing this process for some days, until Hazlet was unalterably
  convinced that he must be a vastly agreeable and attractive person, Bruce
  asked him to come to breakfast, and invited Brogten and Fitzurse to meet him.
  He calculated justly that Hazlet, accustomed only to the very quiet
  neighbourhood of a country village, would be duly impressed with the presence
  and acquaintance of a live lord; and he instructed both his guests in the
  manner in which they should treat the subject of their experiment. Hazlet
  thought he had never enjoyed a breakfast party so much. There was a delicious
  spice of worldliness in the topics of conversation which was quite refreshing
  to him, accustomed as he was to the somewhat droning moralisms of his
  &ldquo;congenial friends.&rdquo; Nothing which could deeply shock his
  prejudices was ever alluded to, but the discussions which were introduced
  came to him with all the charm of novelty and awakened curiosity.</p>

  <p>Hazlet never could endure being a silent or inactive listener while a
  conversation was going forward. No matter how complete his ignorance of the
  subject, he generally managed to hazard some remarks. Bruce talked a good
  deal about actors and theatres, and Hazlet had never seen a theatre in his
  life. He did not like, however, to confess this fact, and, after a little
  hesitation, began to talk as if he were an habitu. The dramatic criticisms,
  which he occasionally saw in the papers, furnished him with just materials
  enough to amuse Bruce and the others at his assumption of &ldquo;savoir
  vivre,&rdquo; and to furnish a laugh at his expense the moment he was gone;
  but of this he was blissfully unconscious, and he rather plumed himself on
  his knowledge of the world. He had yet to learn the lesson that consistency
  alone can secure respect. He had indeed ventured at first to remark,
  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think the stage a little&mdash;just a
  little&mdash;objectionable?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Objectionable,&rdquo; said Bruce, with a bland smile; &ldquo;oh, my
  dear fellow, what can you mean? Why, the stage is a mirror of the world, and
  to show virtue her own image is one of its main objects.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Hazlet, &ldquo;I am inclined to think so. I should
  like to see a theatre, I confess.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had let slip unintentionally the implied admission that he had never
  been to a theatre; but when Fitzurse asked in astonishment, &ldquo;What, have
  you never been to a theatre?&rdquo; he merely replied, &ldquo;Well, I can
  hardly say I have; at least not for a long time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, then we must all run down to London some night very
  soon,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll go together to the
  Regent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve no friend in London, except&mdash;except a clergyman
  or two, who perhaps might object, you know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, never mind the clergymen,&rdquo; said Bruce; &ldquo;you shall
  all come and stay with me at Vyvyan House.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here was a triumph!&mdash;to go to the celebrated Vyvyan House, and that
  in company with a lord, and to be a partaker of Bruce&rsquo;s hospitality! Of
  course it would be very rude and wrong to refuse so eligible an invitation.
  How pleasant it would be to remark casually at hall-time, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
  just going to run down for the Sunday to Vyvyan House with Bruce and Lord
  Fitzurse!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;to-day&rsquo;s Monday;
  supposing you come to wine with me on Thursday, and then we&rsquo;ll see if
  we can&rsquo;t manage to get to London from Saturday to Monday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thursday&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve an engagement on
  Thursday to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo; asked Bruce.</p>

  <p>The more Hazlet coloured and hung back, the more Bruce, in his agreeable
  way, pressed to know, till at last Hazlet, unable to escape such genial
  importunity, reluctantly confessed that it was to a prayer-meeting in a
  friend&rsquo;s rooms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Bruce, with the least little laugh, &ldquo;tea and
  hassocks, eh?&rdquo; He said no more, but the little, scornful laugh, and the
  few scornful words had done their work more effectually than a volume of
  ridicule. It need not be added that Hazlet came, not to the prayer-meeting,
  but to the wine-party. Cards were introduced in the evening, and one of the
  players was Kennedy. Kennedy played often now, but he certainly did feel a
  qualm of intense and irrepressible disgust as, with great surprise, he found
  himself <i>vis  vis</i> with the spectacled visage of Jedediah Hazlet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But how shall I get my exeat to go to London?&rdquo; said
  Hazlet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, say a particular friend has invited you to spend the Sunday
  with him. Say you want to hear Starfish preach.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr Norton, Hazlet&rsquo;s tutor, who did not expect him to fall into
  mischief, and thought that very likely Mr Starfish&rsquo;s eloquence might be
  the operating attraction, granted him the exeat without any difficulty, and
  on Saturday Hazlet was reclining in a first-class carriage, with Bruce,
  Brogten, and Fitzurse, on his way to Vyvyan House. A change was observable in
  his dress. Bruce had hinted to him that his usual garb might look a little
  formal and odd at a theatre, and had persuaded him to come to his own
  egregious Camford tailor, Mr Fitfop, who, as a particular favour to his
  customer Bruce, produced with suspicious celerity the cut-away coat and
  mauve-coloured pegtops, in which unwonted splendour Hazlet was now arrayed.
  It was a pity that his ears were so obturated with vanity as not to have
  heard the shrieks of half-stifled laughter created by his first public
  appearance in this fashionable guise, which only required to be completed by
  the death&rsquo;s-head pin with which Bruce presented him, (and which
  therefore he was obliged to wear), to make it perfect.</p>

  <p>The sumptuous and voluptuous richness of all the appointments in Vyvyan
  House introduced Hazlet to a new world. Sir Rollo and Lady Bruce were not in
  town, so that the four young men had the house entirely to themselves, and
  Bruce ordered about the servants with royal energy. Soon after their arrival
  they sat down to a choice dinner, and Bruce took care, although the champagne
  had been abundant at dinner, to pass pretty freely, at dessert, the best
  claret and amontillado of his father&rsquo;s cellars. Hazlet was not slow to
  follow the example which the others set him; he helped himself plentifully to
  everything, and after dinner, lolling in an easy attitude, copied from
  Fitzurse, he even ventured to exhibit his very recently acquired
  accomplishment of smoking a weed. Very soon he imagined that he had quite
  made an impression on the most fashionable members of the Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s world.</p>

  <p>They went to the Regent, and between the acts, Bruce, who knew everything,
  introduced them behind the scenes. Hazlet, rather amazed at his own boldness,
  but in reality entirely ignorant which way to turn, necessarily followed his
  guides, and, exultant with the influence of mellow wine, imitated the others,
  and tried to look and feel at home. Within a month of Bruce&rsquo;s
  manipulation this excellent and gifted young man, this truly gracious light
  in the youthful band of confessors, was seated, talking to a fascinating
  young <i>danseuse</i> who wore a gossamer dress, behind the scenes of a petty
  London theatre. Bruce looked on with a smile, and hummed to
  himself&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Jene Tnzerin<br>
  Fliegt, mit leichtem Sinn<br>
  Und noch leichtern Kleide<br>
  Durch den Saal der Freude<br>
  Wie ein Zephyr bin, etcetera.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>The head of Jedediah Hazlet was somewhat confused, when, after the play
  and an oyster supper in the cider cellars, it sank deep into the reposeful
  down of a spare chamber in the gay Sir Rollo Bruce&rsquo;s London house.</p>

  <p>The next morning was Sunday. They none of them got up till twelve to a
  languid breakfast, and then read novels. Hazlet, who was rather shocked at
  this, did indeed faintly suggest going to church. &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said
  Bruce, looking up with a smile from his Balzac, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll do that,
  or some other equally harmless amusement.&rdquo; The dinner hour, however,
  coincided with the time of evening service, so that it was impossible to go
  then, and finally they spent the evening in what they all agreed to call
  &ldquo;a perfectly quiet game at cards.&rdquo;</p>
  <hr>

        id="ch21"></a>

  <h2>XXI. &mdash; ONE OF THE SIMPLE ONES</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;I tempted his blood and his flesh,<br>
  Hid in roses my mesh,<br>
  Choicest cates, and the flagon&rsquo;s best spilth.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Robert Browning.</p><br>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;FAUGH,&rdquo; said Bruce, on his return to Camford,
  &ldquo;that fellow Hazlet isn&rsquo;t worth making an experiment
  upon&mdash;<i>in corpore vili</i> truly; but the creature is so wicked at
  heart, that even his cherished traditions crumble at a touch. He&rsquo;s no
  game; he doesn&rsquo;t even run cunning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I hope you&rsquo;ll p&mdash;p&mdash;pay me my
  p&mdash;p&mdash;p&mdash;ponies,&rdquo; said Fitzurse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;By no means; only I shall cut things short; he isn&rsquo;t worth
  playing; I shall haul him in at once.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Accordingly, Hazlet was invited once more to one of Bruce&rsquo;s
  parties&mdash;this time to a supper. It was one of the regular, reckless,
  uproarious affairs&mdash;D&rsquo;Acres, Boodle, Tulk, Brogten, Fitzurse, were
  all there, and the lite of the fast fellow-commoners, and sporting men
  besides. Bruce had privately entreated them all not to snub Hazlet, as he
  wanted to have some fun. The supper was soon despatched, and the wine circled
  plentifully. It was followed by a game of cards, during which the punch-bowl
  stood in the centre of the table, rich, smoking, and crowned with a
  concoction of unprecedented strength. Hazlet was quite in his glory. When
  they had plied him sufficiently&mdash;which Bruce took care to do by
  repeatedly replenishing his cup on the sly, so that he might fancy himself to
  have taken much less than was really the case&mdash;they all drank his health
  with the usual honours:</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;For he&rsquo;s a jolly good
  fe&mdash;el&mdash;low.<br>
  For he&rsquo;s a jolly good fe&mdash;el&mdash;low,<br>
  For he&rsquo;s a jolly good fe&mdash;el&mdash;l&mdash;ow&mdash;<br>
  Which nobody can deny,<br>
  Which nobody can deny;<br>
  For he&rsquo;s a jolly good fe&mdash;el&mdash;low,&rdquo; etcetera.<br></p>

  <p>And so on, <i>ad infinitum</i>, followed by &ldquo;Hip! hip! hip! hurrah!
  hurrah!! hurrah!!!&rdquo; and then the general rattling of plates on the
  table, and breaking of wine-glass stems with knives of &ldquo;boys who
  crashed the glass and beat the floor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hazlet was quite in the seventh heaven of exaltation, and made a feeble
  attempt at replying to the honour in a speech; but he was in so very
  oblivious and generally foolish a condition, that, being chiefly accustomed
  to Philadelphus oratory, he began to address them as &ldquo;My Christian
  Friends;&rdquo; and this produced such shouts of boisterous laughter, that he
  sat down with his purpose unaccomplished.</p>

  <p>Before the evening was over, Bruce, in the opinion of all present,
  including Fitzurse himself, had fairly won his bet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t mind p&mdash;p&mdash;paying a bit,&rdquo; said the
  excellent young nobleman; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s been such r&mdash;r&mdash;rare
  f&mdash;f&mdash;fun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rare fun indeed! The miserable Hazlet, swilled with unwonted draughts, lay
  brutally comatose in a chair. His head rolled from side to side, his body and
  arms hung helpless and disjointed, his eyelids dropped&mdash;he was
  completely unconscious, and more than fulfilled the conditions of being
  &ldquo;roaring drunk!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Now for some jolly amusement&mdash;the opportunity&rsquo;s too good to be
  lost! What exhilaration there is on seeing a human soul imbruted and
  grovelling hopelessly in the dirt or rather to have a body before you,
  <i>without</i> a soul for the time being&mdash;a coarse animal mass, swinish
  as those whom the wand of Circe smote, but with the human intelligence
  quenched besides, and the charactery of reason wiped away. Here, some ochre
  and lamp-black, quick! There&mdash;plaster it well about the whiskers and
  eyelids, and put a few patches on the hair! Magnificent!&mdash;he looks like
  a Choctaw in his war-paint, after drinking fire-water.</p>

  <p>Screams of irrepressible laughter&mdash;almost as ghastly, (if the cause
  of them be considered), as those that might have sounded round a
  witch&rsquo;s cauldron over diabolical orgies&mdash;accompanied the whole
  proceeding. So loud were they that all the men on the stair-case heard them,
  and fully expected the immediate apparition of some bulldog, dean, or
  proctor. It was nobody&rsquo;s affair, however, but Bruce&rsquo;s, and he
  must do as he liked. Suton, who &ldquo;kept&rdquo; near Bruce, was one of
  those whom the uproar puzzled and disturbed, as he sat down with sober
  pleasure to his evening&rsquo;s work. His window was opposite Bruce&rsquo;s,
  and across the narrow road he heard distinctly most of what was said. The
  perpetual and noisy repetition of Hazlet&rsquo;s name perplexed him
  extremely, and at last he could have no doubt that they were making Hazlet
  drunk, and then painting him; nor was it less clear that many of them were
  themselves half intoxicated.</p>

  <p>It had of course been impossible for Suton and others of similar character
  to avoid noticing the eccentricities of dress, and manner which had been the
  outward indications of Hazlet&rsquo;s recent course. When a man who has been
  accustomed to dress in black, and wear tail coats in the morning, suddenly
  comes out in gorgeous apparel, and begins to talk about cards, betting and
  theatres, his associates must be very blind, if they do not observe that his
  theories are undergoing a tolerably complete revolution. Suton saw with
  regret mingled with pity, Hazlet&rsquo;s contemptible weakness, and he had
  once or twice endeavoured to give him a hint of the ridicule which his
  metamorphosis occasioned; but Hazlet had met his remarks with such silly
  arrogance, nay, with such a patronising assumption of superiority, that he
  determined to leave him to his own experiences. This did not prevent Suton
  from feeling a strong and righteous indignation against the iniquity of those
  who were inveigling another to his ruin, and he felt convinced that, as at
  this moment Hazlet was being unfairly treated, it was his duty in some way to
  interfere.</p>

  <p>He got up quietly, and walked over to Bruce&rsquo;s rooms. His knock
  produced instant silence, followed by a general scuffle as the men
  endeavoured to conceal the worst signs of their recent outrage. When Suton
  opened the door, he was greeted with a groan of derision.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Confound you,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;I thought it must be the
  senior proctor at the very least.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Without noticing his remark, Suton quietly said, &ldquo;I see, Bruce, that
  you have been treating Hazlet in a very unwarrantable way; he is clearly not
  in a fit condition to be trifled with any more; you must help me to take him
  home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ha! ha! rather a good joke. I shall merely shove him into the
  street, if I do anything. What business has he to make a beast of himself in
  my rooms?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What business have you to do the devil&rsquo;s work, and tempt
  others to sin? You will have a terrible reckoning for it, even if no
  dangerous consequences ensue,&rdquo; said Suton sternly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;C&mdash;c&mdash;c&mdash;cant!&rdquo; said Fitzurse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;what you call cant, Fitzurse. You shall hear some more,
  and tremble, sir, while you hear it,&rdquo; replied Suton, turning towards
  him, and raising his hand with a powerful but natural gesture; &ldquo;it is
  this &lsquo;Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that putteth thy
  bottle to him, and makest him drunken also&mdash;<i>thou art filled with
  shame for glory</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bruce,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Acres, the least flushed of the party,
  &ldquo;I really think we ought to take the fellow home. Just look at
  him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bruce looked, and was really alarmed at the grotesque yet ghastly
  expression of that striped and sodden face, with the straight black hair, and
  the head lolling and rolling on the shoulder. Without a word, he took Hazlet
  by one arm, while Suton held the other, and D&rsquo;Acres carried the legs,
  and as quickly as they could they hurried along with their lifeless burden to
  the gates of Saint Werner&rsquo;s. It was long past the usual hour for
  locking up, and the porter took down the names of all four as they entered. A
  large bribe which D&rsquo;Acres offered was firmly, yet respectfully refused,
  and they knew that next day they would be called to account.</p>

  <p>Having put Hazlet to bed they separated; Suton bade the others a stiff
  &ldquo;Good-night;&rdquo; and D&rsquo;Acres as he left Bruce, said,
  &ldquo;Bruce, we have been doing a very blackguard thing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Speak for yourself,&rdquo; said Bruce.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said D&rsquo;Acres, &ldquo;and allow me to add that I
  have entered your rooms for the last time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Next morning Suton spoke privately to the porter, and told him that it
  would be best for many reasons not to report what had taken place the night
  before, beyond the bare fact of their having come into college late at night.
  The man knew Suton thoroughly and respected him; he knew him to be a man of
  genuine piety, and the most regular habits, and consented, though not without
  difficulty, to omit all mention of Hazlet&rsquo;s state. All four had of
  course to pay the usual gate fine, and D&rsquo;Acres and Bruce were besides
  &ldquo;admonished&rdquo; by the senior Dean, but Suton and Hazlet were not
  even sent for. The Dean knew Suton well, and felt that his character was a
  sufficient guarantee that he had not been in any mischief; Hazlet had been
  irregular lately, but the Dean considered him a very steady man, and
  overlooked for the present this breach of rules.</p>

  <p>Of course all Saint Werner&rsquo;s laughed over the story of
  Hazlet&rsquo;s escapade. He did not know how to avoid the storm of ridicule
  which his folly had stirred up. He had already begun to drop his
  &ldquo;congenial friends&rdquo; for the more brilliant society to which Bruce
  had introduced him, and so far from admitting that he felt any compunction,
  he professed to regard the whole matter merely as &ldquo;an amusing
  lark.&rdquo; Bruce and the others hardly condescended to apologise, and at
  first Hazlet, who found it impossible at once to remove all traces of the
  paint, and who for a day or two felt thoroughly unwell, made a half-resolve
  to resent their coolness. But now, deserted by his former associates, and
  laughed at by the majority of men, he found the society of his tempters
  indispensable for his comfort, and even cringed to them for the notice which
  at first they felt inclined to withdraw.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that trick on Hazlet a disgraceful affair,
  Kennedy?&rdquo; said Julian, a few days after. &ldquo;Some one told me you
  were at the supper party; surely it can&rsquo;t be true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was for about an hour,&rdquo; said Kennedy, blushing, &ldquo;but
  I had left before this took place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;May I say it, Kennedy?&mdash;a friend&rsquo;s, a
  <i>brother&rsquo;s</i> privilege, you know&mdash;but it surprises me that you
  care to tolerate such company as that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Believe me, Julian, I don&rsquo;t enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then why do you frequent it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy sighed deeply and was silent for a time; then he said&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Not e&rsquo;en the dearest heart, and next our
  own,<br>
  Knows half the reasons why we smile or sigh.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Julian; for he had long observed that some heavy
  weight lay on Kennedy&rsquo;s mind, and with deep sorrow noticed that their
  intercourse was less cordial, less frequent, less intimate than before. Not
  that he loved Kennedy, or that Kennedy loved him less than of old, for, on
  the contrary, Kennedy yearned more than ever for the full cherished unreserve
  of their old friendship; but, alas there was not, there could not be complete
  confidence between them, and where there is not confidence, the pleasure of
  friendship grows dim and pale. And, besides this, new tastes were growing up
  in Edward Kennedy, and, by slow and fatal degrees, were developing into
  passions.</p>

  <p>Hazlet had come to Camford not so much innocent as ignorant. He had never
  learnt to restrain and control the strong tendencies which, in the quiet
  shades of Ildown, had been sheltered from temptation. A few months before he
  would have heard with unmitigated horror the delinquencies which he now
  committed without a scruple, and defended without a blush. None are so
  precipitate in the career of sin and folly as backsliders; none so unchecked
  in the downward course as those to whom the mystery of iniquity is suddenly
  displayed when they have had none of the gradual training whereby men are
  armed to resist its seductions.</p>

  <p>Who does not know from personal observation that the cycle of sins is
  bound together by a thousand invisible filaments, and that myriads of unknown
  connections unite them to one another? Hazlet, when he had once
  &ldquo;forsaken the guide of his youth, and forgotten the covenant of his
  God,&rdquo; did not stop short at one or two temptations, and yield only to
  some favourite vice. With a rapidity as amazing as it was disastrous, he
  developed in the course of two or three months into one of the most shameless
  and dissipated of the worst Saint Werner&rsquo;s set. There was something
  characteristic in the way in which he frothed out his own shame, boasting of
  his infamous liberty with an arrogance which resembled his former conceit in
  spiritual superiority.</p>

  <p>Julian, who now saw less of him than ever, had no opportunity of speaking
  to him as to his course of life; but at last an incident happened which
  persuaded him that further silence would be a culpable neglect of his duty to
  his neighbour.</p>

  <p>Montagu, of Roslyn School, came up to Camford to spend a Sunday with Owen,
  and Owen asked Julian and Lillyston to meet him. They liked each other very
  much, and Julian rapidly began to regard Montagu as a real friend. In order
  to see as much of each other as possible, they all agreed to take a four-oar
  on the Saturday morning, and row to Elnham; at Elnham they dined, and spent
  two pleasant hours in visiting the beautiful cathedral, so that they did not
  get back to Camford till eleven at night.</p>

  <p>Their way from the boats to Saint Werner&rsquo;s lay through a bad part of
  the town, and they walked quickly, Owen and Montagu being a little way in
  front.</p>

  <p>A few gas-lights were burning at long intervals in the narrow lane through
  which they had to pass, and as they walked under one of them they observed a
  group of four standing half in shadow. One of them Julian instantly
  recognised as the very vilest of the Saint Werner &ldquo;fast men;&rdquo;
  another was Hazlet; there could be no doubt as to the company in which he
  was.</p>

  <p>For one second, Julian turned back to look in sheer astonishment,&mdash;he
  could hardly believe the testimony of his own eyes. The figure which he took
  to be Hazlet hastily retreated, and Julian half-persuaded himself that he was
  mistaken.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you see who that was?&rdquo; asked Lillyston sadly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;one of the simple ones; &lsquo;but
  he knoweth not that the dead are there, and that her guests are in the depths
  of hell.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You must speak to him, Julian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As Hazlet was out when he called, Julian wrote on his card, &ldquo;Dear H,
  will you come to tea at 8? Yours ever, J Home.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At 8 o&rsquo;clock accordingly Hazlet was seated, as he had not been for a
  very long time, by Julian&rsquo;s fireside. Julian&rsquo;s conversation
  interested him, and he could not help feeling a little humbled at the
  unworthiness which prevented him from more frequently enjoying it. It was not
  till after tea, when they had pulled their chairs to the fire, that Julian
  said, &ldquo;Hazlet, I was sorry to see you in bad company last
  night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; said Hazlet, feigning surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hazlet saw that all attempt at concealment was useless. &ldquo;For
  God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t tell my mother, or any of the Ildown
  people,&rdquo; he said, turning pale.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it likely I should? Yet my doing so would be the very least harm
  that could happen to you, Hazlet, if you adopt these courses. I had rather
  see you afraid of the sin than of the detection.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hazlet stammered out in self-defence one of those commonplaces which he
  had heard but too often in the society of those who &ldquo;put evil for good
  and good for evil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian very quietly tore the miserable sophism to shreds, and said,
  &ldquo;There is but one way to describe these vices, Hazlet,&mdash;they are
  deadly, bitter, ruinous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they are very common. Lots of men&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tush!&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;their commonness, if indeed it be
  so, does not diminish their deadliness. Not to put the question on the
  religious ground at all, I fully agree with Carlyle that, on the mere
  consideration of expedience and physical fact, nothing can be more fatal,
  more calamitous than &lsquo;to burn away in mad waste the divine aromas and
  celestial elements from our existence; to change our holy of holies into a
  place of riot; to make the soul itself hard, impious,
  barren.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hazlet, ashamed and bewildered, confused his present position with old
  reminiscences, and muttered some balderdash about Carlyle &ldquo;not being
  sound.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Carlyle not sound?&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;good heavens! You can
  still retain the wretched babblements of your sectarianism while your courses
  are what they are!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was inclined to drop the conversation in sheer disgust, but
  Hazlet&rsquo;s pride was now aroused, and he began to bluster about the
  impertinence of interference on Julian&rsquo;s part, and his right to do what
  he chose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Julian, sternly, &ldquo;the choice lies with
  yourself. Run, if you will, as a bird to the snare of the fowler, till a dart
  strike you through. But if you are dead and indifferent to your own miserable
  soul, think that in this sin you cannot sin alone; think that you are
  dragging down to the nethermost abyss others besides yourself. Remember the
  wretched victims of your infamous passions, and tremble while you desecrate
  and deface for ever God&rsquo;s image stamped on a fair human soul. Think of
  those whom your vileness dooms to a life of loathliness, a death of shame and
  anguish, perhaps an eternity of horrible despair. Learn something of the days
  they are forced to spend, that they may pander to the worst instincts of your
  degraded nature; days of squalor and drunkenness, disease and dirt; gin at
  morning, noon, and night; eating infection, horrible madness, and sudden
  death at the end. Can you ever hope for salvation and the light of
  God&rsquo;s presence, while the cry of the souls of which you have been
  <i>the murderer</i>&mdash;yes, do not disguise it, the <i>murderer</i>, the
  cruel, willing, pitiless murderer&mdash;is ringing upwards from the depths of
  hell?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by the murderer?&rdquo; said Hazlet, with an
  attempt at misconception.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean this, Hazlet; setting aside all considerations which affect
  your mere personal ruin&mdash;not mentioning the atrophy of spiritual life
  and the clinging sense of degradation which is involved in such a course as
  yours&mdash;I want you to see if you will be honest, that the fault is yet
  more deadly, because you involve <i>other</i> souls and <i>other</i> lives in
  your own destruction. Is it not a reminiscence sufficient to kill any
  man&rsquo;s hope, that but for his own brutality some who are now perhaps
  raving in the asylum might have been clasping their own children to their
  happy breasts, and wearing in unpolluted innocence the rose of matronly
  honour? Oh, Hazlet, I have heard you talk about missionary societies, and
  seen your name in subscription lists, but believe me you could not, by
  myriads of such conventional charities, cancel the direct and awful quota
  which you are now contributing to the aggregate of the world&rsquo;s misery
  and shame.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It took a great deal to abash a mind like Hazlet&rsquo;s. He said that he
  was going to be a clergyman, and that it was necessary for him to see
  something of life, or he would never acquire the requisite experience.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Loathly experience!&rdquo; said Julian with crushing scorn.
  &ldquo;And do you ever hope, Hazlet, by centuries of preaching such as yours,
  to repair one millionth part of the damage done by your bad passions to a
  single fellow-creature? Such a hateful excuse is verily to carry the Urim
  with its oracular gems into the very sty of sensuality, and to debase your
  religion into &lsquo;a procuress to the lords of hell.&rsquo; I have done;
  but let me say, Hazlet, that your self-justification is, if possible, more
  repulsive than your sin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pushed back his chair from the fire, and turned away, as Hazlet, with
  some incoherent sentences about &ldquo;no business of his,&rdquo; left the
  room, and slammed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>What are words but weak motions of vibrating air? Julian&rsquo;s words
  passed by the warped nature of Hazlet like the idle wind, and left no more
  trace upon him than the snow-flake when it has melted into the purpling sea.
  As the weeks went on, his ill-regulated passions grew more and more free from
  the control of reason or manliness, and he sank downwards, downwards,
  downwards, into the most shameful abysses of an idle, and evil, and
  dissipated life.</p>

  <p>And the germ of that ruin was planted by the hand of the clever, and gay,
  and handsome Vyvyan Bruce.</p>

  <h2>XXII. &mdash; DE VAYNE&rsquo;S TEMPTATION</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;And felt how awful goodness is, and virtue<br>
  In her own shape how lovely.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Milton&rsquo;s <i>Paradise Lost</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">SHALL I confess it? Pitiable and melancholy as was
  Hazlet&rsquo;s course, I liked him so little as to feel for him far less than
  I otherwise should have done. His worst error never caused me half the pain
  of Kennedy&rsquo;s most venial fault. Must I then tell a sad tale of Kennedy
  too&mdash;my brave, bright, beautiful, light-hearted Kennedy, whom I always
  loved so well? May I not throw over the story of his college days the rosy
  colourings of romance and fancy, the warm sunshine of prosperity and hope? I
  wish I might. But I am writing of Camford&mdash;not of a divine Utopia or a
  sunken Atalantis.</p>

  <p>Bruce, so far from being troubled by his own evil deeds, was proud of a
  success which supported a pet theory of his infidel opinions. He made no sort
  of secret of it, and laughed openly at the fool whom he had selected for his
  victim.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; said Brogten, who had plenty of common sense,
  &ldquo;your triumph was very slight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean? I chose the most obtrusively religious man in
  Saint Werner&rsquo;s, and, in the course of a very short time, I had him, of
  his own will, roaring drunk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s the inference?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That what men call religion is half cant, half the accident of
  circumstances.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pardon me, you&rsquo;re out in your conclusion; it only shows that
  Hazlet was a hypocrite, or at the best a weak, vain, ignorant fellow. The
  very obtrusiveness and uncharitableness of his religion proved its unreality.
  Now I could name dozens of men who would see you dead on the floor rather
  than do as you have taught Hazlet to do&mdash;men, in fact, with whom you
  simply <i>daren&rsquo;t</i> try the experiment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Daren&rsquo;t</i>! why not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, simply because they breathe such a higher and better
  atmosphere than either you or I, that you would be abashed by their mere
  presence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pooh! I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Bruce, with an uneasy
  laugh; &ldquo;mention any such man.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Suton for instance, or Lord De Vayne.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suton is an unpleasant fellow, and I shouldn&rsquo;t choose to try
  him, because he&rsquo;s a bore. But I bet you what you like that I make De
  Vayne drunk before a month&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Done! I bet you twenty pounds you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Disgusting that the young, and pure-hearted, and amiable De Vayne should
  be made the butt of the machinations of such men as Bruce and Brogten! But so
  it was. So it was; I could not invent facts like these. They never could
  float across my imagination, or if they did, I should reject them as the
  monstrous chimeras of a heated brain. I can conceive a man&rsquo;s private
  wickedness,&mdash;the wickedness which he confines within his own heart, and
  only brings to bear upon others so far as is demanded by his own fancied
  interests; I can imagine, too, an open and willing partnership in villainy,
  where hand joins in hand, and face answereth to face. But that any knowing
  the plague of their own hearts, should deliberately endeavour to lead others
  into sin, coolly and deliberately, without even the blinding mist of passion
  to hide the path which they are treading,&mdash;this, if I had not known that
  it was so, I could not have conceived. The murderer who, atom by atom,
  continues the slow poisoning of a perishing body for many months, and dies
  amid the yell of a people&rsquo;s execration,&mdash;in sober earnest, before
  God, I believe he is less guilty than he who, drop by drop, pours into the
  soul of another the curdling venom of moral pollution, than he who feeds into
  full-sized fury the dormant monsters of another&rsquo;s evil heart. Surely
  the devil must welcome a human tempter with open arms.</p>

  <p>Of course Bruce had to proceed with Lord De Vayne in a manner totally
  different from that which he had applied to Jedediah Hazlet. He felt himself
  that the task was far more difficult and delicate, especially as it was by no
  means easy to get access to De Vayne&rsquo;s company at all. Julian,
  Lillyston, Kennedy, and a few others, formed the circle of his only friends,
  and although he was constantly with <i>them</i>, he was rarely to be found in
  other society. But this was a difficulty which a man with so large an
  acquaintance as Bruce could easily surmount, and for the rest he trusted to
  the conviction which he had adopted, that there was no such thing as sincere
  godliness, and that men only differed in proportion to the weakness or
  intensity of the temptations which happened to assail them.</p>

  <p>So Bruce managed, without any apparent manoeuvring, to see more of De
  Vayne at various men&rsquo;s rooms, and he generally made a point of sitting
  next to him when he could. He had naturally a most insinuating address and a
  suppleness of manner which enabled him to adapt himself with facility to the
  tastes and temperaments of the men among whom he was thrown. There were few
  who could make themselves more pleasant and plausible when it suited them
  than Vyvyan Bruce.</p>

  <p>De Vayne soon got over the shrinking with which he had at first regarded
  him, and no longer shunned the acquaintance of which he seemed desirous. It
  was not until this stage that Bruce made any serious attempt to take some
  steps towards winning his wager. He asked De Vayne to a dessert, and took
  care that the wines should be of an insidious strength. But the young
  nobleman&rsquo;s abstemiousness wholly defeated and baffled him, as he rarely
  took more than a single glass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You pass the wine, De Vayne; don&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, I&rsquo;ve had enough.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, come; allow me,&rdquo; said Bruce, filling his glass for
  him.</p>

  <p>De Vayne drank it out of politeness, and Bruce repeated the same process
  soon after.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, De Vayne, no heel-taps,&rdquo; he said playfully, as he
  filled his glass for him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, I&rsquo;d really rather not have any more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, you must have been lending your ears to&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;&lsquo;Those budge doctors of the Stoic fur,<br>
  Praising the lean and sallow abstinence;&rsquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;You take nothing. I shall abuse my wine-merchant.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You certainly seem as anxious as Comus that I should drink,
  Bruce,&rdquo; said De Vayne, smiling; &ldquo;but really I <i>mean</i> that I
  wish for no more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bruce saw that he had overstepped the bounds of politeness, and also made
  a mistake by going a little too far. He pressed De Vayne no longer, and the
  conversation passed to other subjects.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anything in the papers to-day?&rdquo; asked Brogten.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, another case of wife-beating and wife-murder. What a dreadful
  increase of those crimes there has been lately,&rdquo; said De Vayne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Another proof,&rdquo; said Bruce, &ldquo;of the gross absurdity of
  the marriage-theory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>De Vayne opened his eyes wide in astonishment. Knowing very little of
  Bruce, he was not aware that this was a very favourite style of remark with
  him,&mdash;indeed, a not uncommon style with other clever young
  undergraduates. He delighted to startle men by something new, and dazzle them
  with a semblance of insight and reasoning. &ldquo;The gross absurdity of the
  marriage-theory,&rdquo; thought De Vayne to himself; &ldquo;I wonder what on
  earth he can mean?&rdquo; Fancying he must have misheard, he said nothing;
  but Bruce, disappointed that his remark had fallen flat, (for the others were
  too much used to the kind of thing to take any notice of it),
  continued&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How curious it is that the <i>whole</i> of the arguments should be
  against marriage, and yet that it should continue to be an institution. You
  never find a person to defend it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>At quis vituperavit</i>?&rsquo; as the man remarked, on
  hearing of a defence of Hercules,&rdquo; said De Vayne. &ldquo;I should have
  thought that marriage, like the Bible, &lsquo;needed no
  apology.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, it surely is an absurdity on the face of it? See
  how badly it succeeds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Without choosing to enter on that question, De Vayne quietly remarked,
  &ldquo;You ask why marriage exists. Don&rsquo;t you believe that it was
  originally appointed by divine providence, and afterwards sanctioned by
  divine lips?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, if you come to that kind of ground, you know, and abandon the
  aspect of the question from the side of pure reason, you&rsquo;ve so many
  preliminaries to prove; <i>e g</i>, the genuineness and authenticity of the
  Pentateuch and the Gospels; the credibility of the narrators; the possibility
  of their being deceived; the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said De Vayne, &ldquo;the evidences of
  Christianity. Well, I trust that I have studied them, and that they satisfy
  alike my reason and my conscience.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! Well, it&rsquo;s no good entering on those questions, you
  know. I shouldn&rsquo;t like to shock your convictions, as I should have to
  do if I discussed with you. It&rsquo;s just as well after all&mdash;even in
  the nineteenth century&mdash;not to expose the exotic flower of men&rsquo;s
  belief to the rude winds of fair criticism. Picciola! it might be blighted,
  poor thing, which would be a pity. Perhaps one does more harm than good by
  exposing antiquated errors.&rdquo; And with a complacent shrug of the
  shoulders, and a slight smile of self-admiration, Bruce leant back in his
  armchair.</p>

  <p>This was Bruce&rsquo;s usual way, and he found it the most successful.
  There were a great many minds on whom it created the impression of immense
  cleverness. &ldquo;That kind of thing, you know, it&rsquo;s all exploded
  now,&rdquo; he would say among the circle of his admirers, and he would give
  a little wave of the hand, which was vastly effective&mdash;as if he
  &ldquo;could an if he would&rdquo; puff away the whole system of Christianity
  with quite a little breath of objection, but refrained from such tyrannous
  use of a giant&rsquo;s strength. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all very well, you know,
  for parsons&mdash;though, by the way, not half of the cleverest believe what
  they preach&mdash;but really for men of the world, and thinkers, and acute
  reasoners&rdquo;&mdash;(oh, how agreeable it was to the Tulks and Boodles to
  be included in such a category)&mdash;&ldquo;why, after such books as
  Frederic of Suabia &lsquo;De Tribus Impostoribus,&rsquo; and Strauss&rsquo;
  &lsquo;Leben Jesu,&rsquo; and De Wette, and Feuerbach, and Van Bohlen, and
  Nork, one can&rsquo;t be expected, you know, to believe such a mass of
  traditionary rubbish.&rdquo; (Bruce always professed acquaintance with German
  writers, and generally quoted the titles of their books in the original; it
  sounded so much better; not that he had read one of them, of course.) And
  they <i>did</i> think him <i>so</i> clever when he talked in this way. Only
  think how wise he must be to know such profound truths!</p>

  <p>But so far from Bruce&rsquo;s hardly-concealed contempt for the things
  which Christians hold sacred producing any effect on Lord De Vayne, he
  regarded it with a silent pity. &ldquo;I hate,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;when
  Vice can bolt her arguments, and Virtue has no tongue to check her
  pride.&rdquo; The annoying impertinence, so frequent in argument, which leads
  a man to speak as though, from the vantage-ground of great intellectual
  superiority to his opponent, the graceful affectation of dropping an argument
  out of respect for prejudices which the arguer despises, or an incapacity
  which the arguer implies&mdash;this merely personal consideration did not
  ruffle for a moment the gentle spirit of De Vayne. But that a young
  man&mdash;conceited, shallow, and ignorant&mdash;should profess to settle
  with a word the controversies which had agitated the profoundest reasons, and
  to settle with a sneer, the mysteries before which the mightiest thinkers had
  veiled their eyes in reverence and awe; that he should profess to set aside
  Christianity as a childish fable not worthy a wise man&rsquo;s acceptance,
  and triumph over it as a defeated and deserted cause; this indeed filled De
  Vayne&rsquo;s mind with sorrow and disgust. So far from being impressed or
  dazzled by Bruce&rsquo;s would-be cleverness, he sincerely grieved over his
  impudence and folly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, Bruce,&rdquo; he said, after a slight pause, and with
  some dignity, &ldquo;thank you for your kind consideration of my mental
  inferiority, and for the pitying regard which you throw, from beside your
  nectar, on my delicate and trembling superstitions. But don&rsquo;t think,
  Bruce, that I admit your&mdash;may I call it?&mdash;impertinent assumption
  that all thinking men have thrown Christianity aside as an exploded error.
  Some shadow of proof, some fragment of reason, would be more satisfactory
  treatment of a truth which has regenerated the world, than foolish assertion
  or insolent contempt. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was something in the manner of De Vayne&rsquo;s reproof which
  effectually quelled Bruce, while it galled him; yet, at the same time, it was
  delivered with such quiet good taste, that to resent it was impossible. He
  saw, too, not without vexation, that it had told powerfully on the little
  knot of auditors. The wine-party soon broke up, for Bruce could neither give
  new life to the conversation, nor recover his chagrin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So-ho!&rdquo; said Brogten, when they were left alone, &ldquo;I
  shall win my bet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hanged if you shall,&rdquo; said Bruce, with an oath of vexation.
  In fact, not only was he determined not to be foiled in proving his wisdom
  and power of reading men&rsquo;s characters, but he was wholly unable to
  afford any payment of the bet. Bruce could get unlimited credit for goods, on
  the reputation of his father&rsquo;s wealth, but money-dealers were very
  sharp-eyed people, and he found it much less easy to get his
  promissory-notes cashed. It was a matter of etiquette to pay at once
  &ldquo;debts of honour,&rdquo; and his impetuous disposition led him to take
  bets so freely that his ready money was generally drained away very soon
  after his return. Not long before he had written to his father for a fresh
  supply, but, to his great surprise, the letter had only produced an angry and
  even indignant reproof. &ldquo;Vyvyan,&rdquo; (his father had
  written&mdash;not even &lsquo;dear Vyvyan&rsquo;), &ldquo;I allow you 500
  pounds a year, a sum totally out of proportion with your wants, and yet you
  are so shamefully extravagant as to write without a blush to ask me for more.
  Don&rsquo;t presume to do it again on pain of my heavy displeasure.&rdquo;
  This letter had so amazed him that he did not even answer it, nor, in spite
  of his mother&rsquo;s earnest, urgent, and almost heart-rending entreaties,
  post by post, would he even condescend to write home for many weeks. It was
  the natural result of the way in which at home they had pampered his vanity,
  and never checked his faults.</p>

  <p>But, for these reasons, it was wholly out of Bruce&rsquo;s power to pay
  Brogten the bet, if he failed in trying to shake the temperance of De Vayne.
  He saw at once that he had mistaken his subject; he took De Vayne for a man
  whose goodness and humility would make him pliant to all designs.</p>

  <p>A dark thought entered Bruce&rsquo;s mind.</p>

  <p>He went alone into a druggist&rsquo;s shop, and said, with a languid air,
  &ldquo;I have been suffering very much from sleeplessness lately, Mr Brent; I
  want you to give me a little laudanum.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, sir. You must be careful how you use it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, of course. How many drops would make one drowsy,
  now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Four or five, sir, I should think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you must give me one of those little bottles full. I want to
  have some by me, to save trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The chemist filled the bottle, and then said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
  I&rsquo;m out of my poison labels, sir. I&rsquo;ll just write a little ticket
  and tie it on.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right;&rdquo; and putting it in his pocket, Bruce strolled
  away.</p>

  <p>But how to see De Vayne again? He thought over their common acquaintances,
  and at last fixed on Kennedy as the likeliest man on whom he could depend to
  secure another meeting. Yet he hardly liked to suggest that Kennedy should
  give a wine-party, and ask De Vayne and himself; so that he was rather
  puzzled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I say, Brogten, how is it that we are always asking Kennedy to our
  rooms, and he so very seldom asks us?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose because he isn&rsquo;t over-partial to our
  company.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said Bruce, who considered himself very
  fascinating, and quite a person whose society was to be courted; &ldquo;and
  if so, why does he come to our rooms?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brogten might, perhaps, have thrown light on the subject had he
  chosen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him a hint.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do; and get him to ask De Vayne.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brogten did so; Kennedy assented to asking Bruce, though he listened to
  Brogten&rsquo;s hints, (which he instantly understood), with a sullenness
  which but a short time before had no existence, not even a prototype, in his
  bright and genial character. But when it came to asking De Vayne, he simply
  replied to Brogten&rsquo;s suggestion flatly:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you? but why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why? because I suspect you and that fellow Bruce of wishing to
  treat him as you treated Hazlet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve no designs against him whatever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t ask him,&mdash;that&rsquo;s flat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whew&mdash;ew&mdash;ew&mdash;ew&mdash;ew!&rdquo; Brogten began to
  whistle, and Kennedy relieved his feelings by digging the poker into the
  fire. And then there was a pause.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want you to ask De Vayne.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I tell you I won&rsquo;t ask him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whew&mdash;w&mdash;w&mdash;w!&rdquo; Another long whistle, during
  which Kennedy mashed and battered the black lumps that smouldered in the
  grate.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whew&mdash;ew&mdash;ew&mdash;ew! Oh, very well.&rdquo; Brogten left
  the room. At hall that day, Brogten took care to sit near Kennedy again, and
  the old scene was nearly re-enacted. He turned the conversation to the
  Christmas examination. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be very high again,
  Kennedy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, curtly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not read, and you
  know that as well as I do.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, but you hadn&rsquo;t read much last time, and you may do some
  particular paper very well, you know. I wish there was an Aeschylus paper;
  you might be first, you know, again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy flung down his knife and fork with a curse, and left the hall. Men
  began to see clearly that there must have been some mystery attached to the
  Aeschylus paper, known to Brogten and Kennedy, and very discomfiting to the
  latter. But as <i>Kennedy</i> was concerned, they did not suspect the
  truth.</p>

  <p>Brogten went straight from hall to Kennedy&rsquo;s rooms. He found the
  door sported, but knew as well as possible that Kennedy was in. He hammered
  and thumped at the door a long time with sundry imprecations, but Kennedy,
  moodily resolute, heard all the noise inside, and would not stir. Then
  Brogten took out a card and wrote on the back, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll
  ask De Vayne,&rdquo; and dropped it into the letter-box.</p>

  <p>That evening he found in his own letter-box a slip of paper. &ldquo;De
  Vayne is coming to wine with me to-morrow. Come, and the foul fiend take you.
  <i>I have filled my decanters half-full of water</i>, and won&rsquo;t bring
  out more than one bottle. E K.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brogten read the note and chuckled,&mdash;partly with the thought of
  Kennedy, partly of Bruce, partly of De Vayne. Yet the chuckle ended in a very
  heavy sigh.</p>

  Ni foi, ni loi,<br>
  Ni jeu, ni lieu,<br>
  Ni roi, ni Dieu.&rdquo;</i><br>

  Iago!&mdash;O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Othello, Act 4, Scene 1.</p><br>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;ARE you going to Kennedy&rsquo;s, Julian?&rdquo;
  asked De Vayne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish he&rsquo;d asked you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian a little wondered why he had not, but remembered, with a sigh, that
  there was <i>something</i>, he knew not what, between him and Kennedy. Yet
  Kennedy was engaged to Violet! The thought carried him back to the beautiful
  memories of Grindelwald and Mrrem,&mdash;perhaps of Eva Kennedy: I will not
  say.</p>

  <p>As De Vayne glanced round at the men assembled at Kennedy&rsquo;s rooms,
  he felt a little vexation, and half wished he had not come. Why on earth did
  Kennedy see so much of these Bruces and Brogtens when he was so thoroughly
  unlike them? But De Vayne consoled himself with the reflection that the
  evening could not fail to be pleasant, as Kennedy was there; for he liked
  Kennedy both for Julian&rsquo;s sake and for his own. Happily for him he did
  not know as yet that Kennedy was affianced to Violet Home.</p>

  <p>Kennedy sat at the end of the table with a gloomy cloud on his brow.
  &ldquo;Here, De Vayne,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so really glad to see
  you at last. Sit by me&mdash;here&rsquo;s a chair.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>De Vayne took the proffered seat, and Bruce immediately seated himself at
  his left hand. At first, as the wine was passed round, there seemed likely to
  be but little conversation, but suddenly some one started the subject of a
  &ldquo;<i>cause clbre</i>&rdquo; which was then filling the papers, and
  Kennedy began at once to discuss it with some interest with De Vayne, who sat
  nearly facing him, almost with his back turned to Bruce, who did not seem
  particularly anxious to attract De Vayne&rsquo;s attention.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What execrable wash,&rdquo; said Brogten, emptying his glass.</p>

  <p>De Vayne, surprised and disgusted at the rudeness of the remark, turned
  hastily round, and, while Bruce as hastily withdrew his hand, raised the
  wine-glass to his lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop, stop, De Vayne,&rdquo; said Bruce eagerly;
  &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a fly in your glass.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see no fly,&rdquo; said De Vayne, glancing at it, and immediately
  draining it, with the intention of saying something to smooth Kennedy&rsquo;s
  feelings, which he supposed would have been hurt by Brogten&rsquo;s want of
  common politeness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think it very&mdash;&rdquo; Why did his words fail, and what was
  the reason of that scared look with which he regarded the blank faces of the
  other undergraduates? And what is the meaning of that gasp, and the rapid
  dropping of the head upon the breast, and the deadly pallor that suddenly put
  out the fair colour in his cheeks? There was no fly&mdash;but, good heavens!
  was there death in the glass?</p>

  <p>The whole party leapt up from their places, and gathered round him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter, De Vayne?&rdquo; said Kennedy tenderly, as he
  knelt down and supported the young man in his arms. But there was no answer.
  &ldquo;Here D&rsquo;Acres, or somebody, for heaven&rsquo;s sake fetch a
  doctor; he must have been seized with a fit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>What have you been doing, Bruce</i>?&rdquo; thundered
  Brogten.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bruce doing!&rdquo; said Kennedy wildly, as he sprang to his feet.
  &ldquo;By the God above us, if I thought this was any of your devilish
  machinations, I would strike you to the earth!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Doing? I?&rdquo; stammered Bruce. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
  He trembled in every limb, and his face was as pale as that of his victim;
  yet, though perhaps De Vayne&rsquo;s life depended on it, the young wretch
  would not say what he had done. He had meant but to put four or five drops
  into his glass, but De Vayne had turned round suddenly and startled him in
  the very act, and in the hurried agitation of the moment, his hand had
  slipped, and he had poured in all the contents of the bottle, with barely
  time to hurry it empty into his pocket, or to prevent the consequences of
  what he had done, when De Vayne lifted the glass to his lips.</p>

  <p>The men all stood round De Vayne and Kennedy in a helpless crowd, and
  Kennedy said, &ldquo;Here, fetch a doctor, somebody, and let all go except
  D&rsquo;Acres; so many are only in the way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The little group dispersed, and two of them ran off to find a doctor; but
  Bruce stood there still with open mouth, and a countenance as pale in its
  horror as that of the fainting viscount. He was anxious to tell the truth
  about the matter in order to avert worse consequences, and yet he dared
  not&mdash;the words died away upon his lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stand like that, Bruce,&rdquo; said Brogten
  indignantly, &ldquo;the least you can do is to make yourself useful. Go and
  get the key of De Vayne&rsquo;s rooms from the porter&rsquo;s lodge. Stop,
  though! it will probably be in his pocket. Yes, here it is. Run and unlock
  his door, while we carry him to bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bruce took the key with trembling hand, and shook so violently with
  nervous agitation that he could hardly make his way across the court. The
  others carried De Vayne to his bedroom as quickly as they could, and
  anxiously awaited the doctor&rsquo;s arrival. The livid face, with the dry
  foam upon the lips, filled them with alarm, but they had not any conception
  what to do, and fancied that De Vayne was in a fit.</p>

  <p>It took Dr Masham a very short time to see that his patient was suffering
  from the influence of some poison, and when he discovered this, he cleared
  the room, and at once applied the proper remedies. But time had been lost
  already, and he was the less able to set to work at first from his complete
  ignorance of what had happened. He sat up all night with his patient, but was
  more than doubtful whether it was not too late to save his life.</p>

  <p>The news that De Vayne had been seized with a fit at Kennedy&rsquo;s rooms
  soon changed into a darker rumour. Men had not forgotten the affair of
  Hazlet, and they suspected that some foul play had been practised on one whom
  all who knew him loved, and whom all, though personally unacquainted with
  him, heartily respected. That this was really the fact soon ceased to be a
  secret; but who was guilty, and what had been the manner or motives of the
  crime remained unknown, and this uncertainty left room for the wildest
  surmises.</p>

  <p>The dons were not slow to hear of what had happened, and they regarded the
  matter in so serious a light, that they summoned a Seniority for its
  immediate investigation. Kennedy was obviously the first person of whom to
  make inquiries, and he told them exactly what had occurred, viz, that De
  Vayne after drinking a single glass of wine, fell back in his chair in the
  condition wherein he still continued. &ldquo;Was anything the matter with the
  wine, Mr Kennedy?&rdquo; asked Mr Norton, who, as one of the tutors, had a
  seat on the board.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir; it was the same which we were all
  drinking.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And without any bad effects?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, Mr Kennedy, there seems strong reason to believe that some one
  drugged Lord De Vayne&rsquo;s wine. Were you privy to any such
  plan?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir&mdash;not exactly,&rdquo; said Kennedy slowly, and with
  hesitation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really, sir,&rdquo; said the Master of Saint Werner&rsquo;s,
  &ldquo;such an answer is grossly to your discredit. Favour us by being more
  explicit; what do you mean by &lsquo;not exactly&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy&rsquo;s passionate and fiery pride, which had recently increased
  with the troubles and self-reprobation of his life, could ill brook such
  questioning as this, and he answered haughtily:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was not aware that anything of <i>this</i> kind was
  intended.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anything of <i>this</i> kind; you <i>did</i> then expect something
  to take place?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought I had taken sufficient precautions against it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Against <i>it</i>; against <i>what</i>?&rdquo; asked Mr Norton.</p>

  <p>Kennedy looked up at his questioner, as though he read in his face the
  decision as to whether he should speak or not. He would hardly have answered
  the Master or any of the others, but Mr Norton was his friend, and there was
  something so manly and noble about his look and character, that Kennedy was
  encouraged to proceed, and he said slowly:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suspected, sir, that there was some intention of attempting to
  make De Vayne drunk.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You suspected that,&rdquo; said Mr Norton with astonishment and
  scorn, &ldquo;and yet you lent <i>your</i> rooms for such a purpose. I am
  ashamed of you, Kennedy; heartily, and utterly ashamed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy&rsquo;s spirit was roused by this bitter and public apostrophe.
  &ldquo;I lent my rooms for no such purpose; on the contrary, if it existed, I
  did my best to defeat it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What made you suspect it?&rdquo; asked Dr Rhodes, the Master.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because a similar attempt was practised on another.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At which it seems that you were present?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was not.&rdquo; Kennedy was too fiercely angry to answer in more
  words than were absolutely required.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say, Mr Kennedy, you have not cleared yourself from
  the great disgrace of giving an invitation, though you supposed that it would
  be made the opportunity for perpetrating an infamous piece of mischief. Can
  you throw no more light on the subject?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you bring the decanter out of which Lord De Vayne
  drank?&rdquo; said one of the seniors after a pause, and with an intense
  belief in the acuteness of the suggestion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what good it will do, but I will order my gyp to
  carry it here if you wish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do so, sir. And let me add,&rdquo; said the Master, &ldquo;that a
  little more respectfulness of manner would be becoming in your present
  position.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy&rsquo;s lip curled, and without answer he left the room to fetch
  the wine, grimly chuckling at the effect which the mixture would produce on
  Mr Norton&rsquo;s fastidious taste. When he reached his rooms, he stumbled
  against the table in his hurry, and upset a little glass dish which held his
  pencils, one of which rolled away under the fender. In lifting the fender to
  pick it up, a piece of paper caught his eye, which the bedmaker in cleaning
  the room had swept out of sight in the morning. He looked at it, and saw in
  legible characters, &ldquo;Laudanum, Poison.&rdquo; It was the label which
  had been loosely tied on Bruce&rsquo;s phial, and which had slipped off as he
  hurried it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>He read it, and as the horrid truth flashed across his mind, stood for a
  moment stupefied and dumb. His plan was instantly formed. Instead of
  returning to the conclave of Seniors he ran straight off to the
  chemist&rsquo;s, which was close by Saint Werner&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know anything of this label?&rdquo; he said, thrusting it
  into the chemist&rsquo;s hands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the man, after looking at it for a moment;
  &ldquo;it is the label of a bottle of laudanum which I sold yesterday morning
  to Mr Bruce of Saint Werner&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Without a word, Kennedy snatched it from him, and rushed back to the
  Seniority, who were already beginning to wonder at his long absence. He threw
  down the piece of paper before. Mr Norton, who handed it to the Master.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I found that, sir, on the floor of my room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you know nothing of it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. It belongs to a bottle purchased yesterday by
  Bruce.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Amazement and horror seemed to struggle in the minds of the old clergymen
  and lecturers as they sat at the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We must send instantly for this young man,&rdquo; said Mr Norton;
  and in ten minutes Bruce entered, pale indeed, but in a faultless costume,
  with a bow of easy grace, and a smile of polite recognition towards such of
  the board as he personally knew. He was totally unaware of what had been
  going on during Kennedy&rsquo;s cross-examination.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr Bruce,&rdquo; said Mr Norton, to whom they all seemed gladly to
  resign the task of discovering the truth, &ldquo;do you know anything of the
  cause of Lord De Vayne&rsquo;s sudden attack of illness last
  night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I, sir? Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He sat next to you, did he not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He did, I believe. Yes. I can&rsquo;t be quite sure&mdash;but I
  think he did.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know he did as well as I do,&rdquo; said Kennedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr Kennedy, let me request you to be silent. Mr Bruce, had you any
  designs against Lord De Vayne?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Designs, sir? Excuse me, but I am at a loss to understand your
  meaning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You had no intention then of making him drunk?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really, sir, you astonish me by such coarse imputations. Is it
  you,&rdquo; he said, turning angrily to Kennedy, &ldquo;who have been saying
  such things of me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy deigned no reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should think the testimony of a man who doesn&rsquo;t scruple
  secretly to read examination-papers before they are set, ought not to stand
  for much.&rdquo; Brogten, as we have already mentioned, had revealed to him
  the secret of Kennedy&rsquo;s dishonour. This remark fell quite dead: Kennedy
  sat unmoved, and Mr Norton replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t introduce your personal altercations here, Mr
  Bruce, on irrelevant topics. Mr Bruce,&rdquo; he continued, suddenly giving
  him the label, &ldquo;have you ever seen that before?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With a cry of agony, Bruce saw the paper, and struck his forehead with his
  hand. The sudden blow of shameful detection with all its train of
  consequences utterly unmanned him, and falling on his knees, he cried
  incoherently&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh! I did it, I did it. I didn&rsquo;t mean to; my hand slipped:
  indeed, indeed it did. For God&rsquo;s sake forgive me, and let this not be
  known. I will give you thousands to hush it up&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A general exclamation of indignation and disgust stopped his prayers, and
  the Master gave orders that he should be removed and watched. He was dragged
  away, tearing his hair and sobbing like a child. Kennedy, too, was ordered to
  retire.</p>

  <p>It took the Seniors but a short time to deliberate, and then Bruce was
  summoned. He would have spoken, but the Master sternly ordered him to be
  silent, and said to him:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vyvyan Bruce, you are convicted by your own confession, extorted
  after deliberate falsehood, of having wished to drug the wine of a fellow-
  student for the purpose of entrapping him into a sin, to which you would
  otherwise have failed to tempt him. What fearful results may follow from your
  wickedness we cannot yet know, and you may have to answer for this crime
  before another tribunal. Be that as it may, it is hardly necessary to tell
  you that your time as a student at Saint Werner&rsquo;s has ended. You are
  expelled, and I now proceed to erase your name from the books.&rdquo; (Here
  the Master ran his pen two or three times through Bruce&rsquo;s signature in
  the college register). &ldquo;Your rooms must be finally vacated to-morrow.
  You need say nothing in self-defence, and may go.&rdquo; As Bruce seemed
  determined to plead his own cause, they ordered the attendant to remove him
  immediately.</p>

  <p>Kennedy was then sent for, and they could not help pitying him, for he was
  a favourite with them all.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr Kennedy,&rdquo; said the senior Dean, &ldquo;the Master desires
  me to admonish you for your very culpable connivance&mdash;for I have no
  other name for it&mdash;in the great folly and wickedness of which Bruce has
  been convicted&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did <i>not</i> connive,&rdquo; said Kennedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silence, sir!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I will <i>not</i> keep silence; you accuse me
  falsely.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We shall be obliged to take further measures, Mr Kennedy, if you
  behave in this refractory way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what measures you take. I cannot listen in
  silence to an accusation which I loathe&mdash;of a crime of which I am wholly
  innocent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, sir, you confessed that you suspected some unfair
  design.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But not this design. Proceed, sir; I will not interrupt you again;
  but let me say that I am totally indifferent to any blame which you throw on
  me for a brutality of which the whole responsibility rests on
  others.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The thread of the Dean&rsquo;s oration was quite broken by Kennedy&rsquo;s
  impetuous interruption, and he merely added&mdash;&ldquo;Well, Mr Kennedy, I
  am sorry to see you so little penitent for the position in which you have
  placed yourself. You have disappointed the expectation of all your friends,
  and however you may brazen it out, your character has contracted a
  stain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can say so, sir, if you choose,&rdquo; said Kennedy; and he
  left the room with a formal bow.</p>

  <p>A few days after, Mr Grayson asked him to what Bruce had alluded in his
  insinuation about an examination-paper.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He alludes, sir, to an event which happened some time
  ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Further questions were useless; nevertheless Kennedy saw that his
  tutor&rsquo;s suspicions were not only aroused, but that they had taken the
  true direction. Mr Grayson despised him, and in Saint Werner&rsquo;s he had
  lost caste.</p>

  <p>That evening Bruce vanished from Camford, with the regrets of few except
  his tailors and his duns. To this day he has not paid his college debts or
  discharged the bill for the gorgeous furniture of his rooms. But we shall
  hear of him again.</p>

  <h2>XXIV. &mdash; DE VAYNE&rsquo;S CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;He that for love hath undergone<br>
  The worst that can befall,<br>
  Is happier thousandfold than one<br>
  Who never loved at all.<br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;A grace within his soul hath reigned,<br>
  Which nothing else can bring;<br>
  Thank God for all that I have gained<br>
  By that high suffering.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Moncton Manes.</p><br>

  <p class="first">FOR many days Lord De Vayne seemed to be hovering between
  life and death. The depression of his spirits weighed upon his frame, and
  greatly retarded his recovery. That he, unconscious as he was of ever having
  made an enemy&mdash;good and gentle to all&mdash;with no desire but to love
  his neighbour as himself, and to devote such talents and such opportunities
  as had been vouchsafed him to God&rsquo;s glory and man&rsquo;s
  benefit;&mdash;that <i>he</i> should have been made the subject of a
  disgraceful wager, and the butt of an infamous experiment; that in
  endeavouring to carry out this nefarious plan, any one should have been so
  wickedly reckless, so criminally thoughtless;&mdash;this knowledge lay on his
  imagination with a depression as of coming death. De Vayne had been but
  little in Saint Werner&rsquo;s society, and had rarely seen any but his few
  chosen friends; and that such a calamity should have happened in the rooms
  and at the table of one of those friends,&mdash;that Kennedy, whom he so much
  loved and admired, should be suspected of being privy to it;&mdash;this fact
  was one which made De Vayne&rsquo;s heart sink within him with anguish and
  horror, and a weariness of life.</p>

  <p>And in those troubled waters of painful thought floated the broken gleams
  of a golden phantasy, the rainbow-coloured memories of a secret love. They
  came like a light upon the darkened waves, yet a light too feeble to
  dissipate the under gloom. Like the phosphorescent flashes in the sea at
  midnight, which the lonely voyager, watching with interest as they glow in
  the white wake of the keel, guesses that they may be the heralds of a
  storm,&mdash;so these bright reminiscences of happier days only gave a weird
  beauty to the tumult of the sick boy&rsquo;s mind; and the mother, as she sat
  by him night and day during the crisis of his suffering, listened with a
  deeper anxiety for future trouble to the delirious revelations of his
  love.</p>

  <p>For Lady De Vayne had come from Other Hall to nurse her sick son. She
  slept on a sofa in his sitting-room, and nursed him with such tenderness as
  only a mother can. There was no immediate possibility of removing him; deep,
  unbroken quiet was his only chance of life. The silence of his sick-room was
  undisturbed save by the softest whispers and the lightest footfalls, and the
  very undergraduates hushed their voices, and checked their hasty steps as
  they passed in the echoing cloisters underneath, and remembered that the
  flame of life was flickering low in the golden vase.</p>

  <p>De Vayne was much beloved, and nothing could exceed the delicacy of the
  attention shown him. Choice conservatory flowers were left almost daily at
  his door, and men procured rare and rich fruits from home or from London, not
  because De Vayne needed any such luxuries, which were easily at his command,
  but that they might show him their sympathy and distress. Several ladies more
  or less connected with Saint Werner&rsquo;s offered their services to Lady De
  Vayne, but she would not leave her son, in whose welfare and recovery her
  whole thoughts were absorbed.</p>

  <p>And so, gloomily for the son and mother, the Christmas holidays came on,
  and Saint Werner&rsquo;s was deserted. Scarcely even a stray undergraduate
  lingered in the courts, and the chapel was closed; no sound of choir or organ
  came sweetly across the lawns at morning or evening; the ceaseless melancholy
  plash of the great fountain was almost the only sound that broke the
  stillness. Julian, Lillyston, and Owen had all gone down for the holidays,
  full of grief at the thought of leaving their friend in such a precarious
  state, but as yet not permitted to see or serve him. Lady De Vayne promised
  to write to Julian regular accounts of Arthur&rsquo;s health, and told him
  how often her son spoke of him, both in his wanderings, and in his clearer
  moments.</p>

  <p>It was touching to see the stately and beautiful lady walking alone at
  evening about the deserted college, to gain a breath of the keen winter air,
  while her son had sunk for a few moments to fitful rest. She was pale with
  long watchings and deep anxiety, and in her whole countenance, and in her
  deep and often uplifted eyes, was that look of prayerfulness and holy
  communion with an unseen world which they acquire whose abode has long been
  in the house of mourning, and removed from the follies and frivolities of
  life.</p>

  <p>Well-loved grounds of Saint Werner&rsquo;s by the quiet waves of the sedgy
  Iscam, with smooth green grass sloping down to the edge, and trim quaint
  gardens, and long avenues of chestnut and ancient limes! Though winter had
  long whirled away the last red and golden leaf, there was pleasure in the air
  of quiet and repose, which is always to be found in those memory-hallowed
  walks; and while Lady De Vayne could pace among them in solitude, she needed
  no other change, nor any rest from thinking over her sick son.</p>

  <p>She was surprised one evening, very soon after the men had gone down, to
  see an undergraduate slowly approaching her down the long and silent avenue.
  He was tall and well made, and his face would have been a pleasant one, but
  for the deep look of sadness which clouded it. He hesitated and took off his
  cap as she came near, and returning his salute, she would have passed him,
  but he stopped her and said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lady De Vayne.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Full of surprise she looked at him, and with his eyes fixed on the ground
  he continued, &ldquo;You do not know my name; if I tell you, I fear you will
  hate me, because I fear you will have heard calumnies about me. But may I
  speak to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are not Mr Bruce?&rdquo; she said with a slight shudder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; my name is Edward Kennedy. Ah, madam! do not look at me so
  reproachfully, I cannot endure it. Believe me, I would have died&mdash;I
  would indeed&mdash;rather than that this should have happened to Lord De
  Vayne.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, Mr Kennedy, I cannot believe that you were more than
  thoughtless. I have very often heard Julian Home speak of you, and I cannot
  believe that his chosen friend could be so vile as some reports would make
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They are false as calumny itself,&rdquo; he said passionately.
  &ldquo;Oh, Lady De Vayne, none could have honoured and loved your son more
  than I did; I cannot explain to you the long story of my exculpation, but I
  implore you to believe my innocence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I forgive you, Mr Kennedy,&rdquo; she said, touched with pity,
  &ldquo;if there be anything to forgive; and so will Arthur. A more forgiving
  spirit than his never filled any one I think. Excuse me, it is time for me to
  return to him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But will you not let me see him, and help you in nursing him? It
  was for this purpose alone that I stayed here when all the others went. Let
  me at least be near him, that I may feel myself to be making such poor
  reparation as my heedlessness requires.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She could hardly resist his earnest entreaty, and besides, she was won by
  compassion for his evident distress.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You may come, Mr Kennedy, as often as you like; whenever Arthur is
  capable of seeing you, you shall visit his sick-room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, and she perceived the tremble of deep
  emotion in his voice.</p>

  <p>He came the next morning, and she allowed him to see De Vayne. He entered
  noiselessly, and gazed for a moment as he stood at the door on the pale
  wasted face, looking still paler in contrast with the long dark hair that
  flowed over the pillow. He was awake, but there was no consciousness in his
  dark dreamy eyes.</p>

  <p>As De Vayne murmured to himself in low sentences, Kennedy heard repeatedly
  the name of Violet, and once of Violet Home. He sat still as death, and soon
  gathered from the young lord&rsquo;s broken words, his love, his deep love
  for Julian&rsquo;s sister.</p>

  <p>And when Kennedy first recognised this fact, which had hitherto been quite
  unknown to him, for a moment a flood of jealousy and bitter envy filled his
  heart. What if Violet should give up her troth in favour of a wealthier,
  perhaps worthier lover? What if her family should think his own poor claims
  no barrier to the hope that Violet should one day wear a coronet? The image
  of Julian and Violet rose in his fancy, and with one more pang of
  self-reproach, he grew ashamed of his unworthy suspicions.</p>

  <p>Yet the thought that De Vayne, too, had fixed his affections on Violet
  filled him with uneasiness and foreboding, and he determined, on some future
  occasion, to save pain to all parties, by getting Julian to break to De Vayne
  the secret of his sister&rsquo;s betrothal.</p>

  <p>For several days he came to the sick-room, and a woman could hardly have
  been more thoughtful and tender than he was to his friend. It was on about
  the fourth evening that De Vayne awoke to complete consciousness. He became
  aware that some one besides his mother was seated in the room, and without
  asking he seemed slowly to recognise that it was Kennedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that Kennedy?&rdquo; he asked, in a weak voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is I,&rdquo; said Kennedy, but the patient did not answer, and
  seemed restless and uneasy and complained of cold.</p>

  <p>When Kennedy went, De Vayne whispered to his mother, &ldquo;Mother, I am
  very weak and foolish, but it troubles me somehow to see Kennedy sitting
  there; it shocks my nerves, and fills me with images of something dreadful
  happening. I had rather not see him, mother, till I am well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well, Arthur. Don&rsquo;t talk so much, love; I alone will
  nurse you. Soon I hope you will be able to return to Other.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And leave this dreadful place,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for
  ever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, my boy; try to sleep again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He soon slept, and then Lady De Vayne wrote to Kennedy a short note, in
  which she explained as kindly and considerately as she could, that Arthur was
  not yet strong enough to allow of any more visits to his sick-room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He shuns me,&rdquo; thought Kennedy, with a sigh, and packing up
  some books and clothes, he prepared to go home.</p>

  <p>Of course he was to spend part of the vacation at Ildown. Violet wondered
  that he did not come at once; she was not exactly jealous of him, but she
  thought that he might have been more eager for her company than he seemed to
  be, and she would have liked it better had he come earlier. Poor Kennedy! his
  very self-denials turned against him for the sole reason why he kept away
  from Ildown was, that he feared to disturb the freedom of Frank and Cyril by
  the presence of a stranger all the time of their holidays, and he hesitated
  to intrude on the united happiness which always characterised the Ildown
  circle.</p>

  <p>Eva, too, was invited, and the brother and sister arrived at Ildown by a
  late train, and drove to the house. What a glowing welcome they received!
  Julian introduced them to Mrs Home, and Kennedy kissed affectionately the
  hand of his future mother. Frank and Cyril had gone to bed, but Frank was so
  determined to see Violet&rsquo;s lover that night, that he made Julian bring
  him into their bedroom, and he was more than satisfied with the first
  glimpse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And where is Violet?&rdquo; asked Kennedy, in a matter-of-fact
  tone, for he well knew that she would not choose to meet him in the presence
  of others.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In her own little room,&rdquo; said Julian, smiling; &ldquo;I will
  show you the way.&rdquo; He led Kennedy up-stairs, and left him at the door;
  he well knew that her heart would be fluttering as much as his.</p>

  <p>A light knock at the door, and a moment after they saw each other
  again.</p>

  <p>She sat on the sofa, and the firelight flickered on the amethyst&mdash;his
  gift&mdash;which she wore on her white neck; and her bright eyes danced with
  tears and laughter, and her bosom heaved and fell as he clasped her to his
  breast and printed a long, long kiss upon her cheek.</p>

  <p>In silence, more exquisite than speech, they gazed on each other; and as
  though her beauty were reflected on his own face, all trace of sorrow and
  shame fled like a cloud from his forehead; and who would not have said,
  looking upon the pair, that he was worthy of her, as she of him?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My own Violet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are beautiful as a vision
  to-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, flatterer!&rdquo; and she placed her little hand upon his
  mouth:&mdash;no wonder that he seized and kissed it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what a thrice-charming dress.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, I <i>meant</i> you to admire it,&rdquo; she said, laughing.</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;&lsquo;And thinking, this will please him best,<br>
  She takes a ribbon or a rose,&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p class="first">he whispered to her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;no ill-omened words, Edward. You
  know the sad context of those lines.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No! no sadness to-night, my own Violet, my beautiful, beautiful
  Violet; you quite dazzle me, my child. I really can&rsquo;t sit by your side;
  come, let me sit on your foot-stool here, and look up in your
  face.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Silly boy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;come along, we shall keep them
  all waiting for supper.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While poor De Vayne languished on the bed of sickness, his sufferings were
  almost the only shadow which chequered the brightness of those weeks at
  Ildown. In the morning, Julian and Kennedy worked steadily; the afternoon and
  evening they devoted to amusement and social life. The Kennedys soon became
  great favourites among the Ildown people, and went out to many cheery
  Christmas parties; but they enjoyed more the quiet evenings at home when they
  all sat and talked after dinner round the dining-room fire, and while the two
  boys played at chess, and Violet and Eva worked or sketched, Julian and
  Kennedy would read aloud to them in turns. How often those evenings recurred
  to all their memories in future days.</p>

  <p>Soon after the Kennedys had come, Julian received from Camford the
  Christmas college-list. He had again won a first class, but Kennedy&rsquo;s
  name, much to his vexation, appeared only in the third.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How is it that Edward is only in the third class?&rdquo; asked
  Violet of Julian&mdash;for, of course, she had seen the list. &ldquo;He is
  very clever&mdash;is he not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very; one of the cleverest fellows in Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then is he idle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, Vi. You must get him to work more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So when he was seated by her on the sofa in her little boudoir, she said,
  &ldquo;You must work more, Edward, at Camford, to please me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ah, do not talk to me of Camford,&rdquo; he said, with a heavy
  sigh. &ldquo;Let me enjoy unbroken happiness for a time, and leave the bitter
  future to itself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bitter, Edward? but why bitter? Julian always seems to me so happy
  at Camford.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>Julian</i> is, and so are all who deserve to be.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you must be happy too, Edward.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His only answer was a sigh. &ldquo;Ah, Violet, pray talk to me of anything
  but Camford.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The visit came to an end, as all things, whether happy or unhappy, must;
  and Julian rejoiced that confidence seemed restored between him and Kennedy
  once more. Of course, he told Violet none of the follies which had cost poor
  Kennedy the loss both of popularity and self-respect. Soon afterwards Lord De
  Vayne was brought back to Other Hall, and Violet and Julian were invited,
  with their mother, to stay there till the Camford term commenced. The boys
  had returned to school, so that they all acceded to Lady De Vayne&rsquo;s
  earnest request that they would come.</p>

  <p>It was astonishing how rapidly the young viscount recovered when once
  Violet had come to Other Hall. Her presence seemed to fill him with fresh
  life, and he soon began to get down-stairs, and even to venture on a short
  walk in the park. His constitution had suffered a serious and permanent
  injury, but he was pronounced convalescent before the Homes finished their
  visit.</p>

  <p>The last evening before their departure, he was seated with Violet on a
  rustic seat on the terrace, looking at the sun as it set behind the distant
  elms of the park, and at the deer as they grazed in lovely groups on the rich
  undulating slopes that swept down from the slight eminence on which his house
  was built. He felt that the time had come to speak his love.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Violet,&rdquo; he said, as he looked earnestly at her, and took her
  hand, &ldquo;you have, doubtless, seen that I love you. Can you ever return
  my love? I am ready to live and die for you, and to give you my whole
  affection.&rdquo; His voice was still low and weak through illness, and he
  could hardly speak the sentences which were to win for him a decision of his
  fate.</p>

  <p>Violet was taken by surprise; she had known Lord De Vayne so long and so
  intimately, and their stations were so different, that the thought of his
  loving her had never entered her head. She regarded him familiarly as her
  brother&rsquo;s friend.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear De Vayne,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shall always love you as a
  friend, as a brother. But did you not know that I have been for some months
  engaged?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Engaged?&rdquo; he said, turning very pale.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am betrothed,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;to Edward Kennedy. Nay,
  Arthur, dear Arthur,&rdquo; she continued, as he nearly fainted at her feet,
  &ldquo;you must not suffer this disappointment to overcome you. Love me still
  as a sister; regard me as though I were married already, and let us enjoy a
  happy friendship for many years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was too weak to bear up, too weak to talk; only the tears coursed each
  other fast down his cheeks as he murmured, &ldquo;Oh, forgive me, forgive me,
  Violet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Forgive you,&rdquo; she said kindly; &ldquo;nay, you honour me too
  much. Marry one of your own high rank, and not the orphan of a poor
  clergyman. I am sure you will not yield to this sorrow, and suffer it to make
  you ill. Bear up, Arthur, for your mother&rsquo;s sake&mdash;for <i>my</i>
  sake; and let us be as if these words had never passed between us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She lent him her arm as he walked faintly to his room, and as he turned
  round and stooped to kiss her hand, she felt it wet with many tears.</p>

  <p>They went home next day, and soon after received a note from Lady De
  Vayne, informing them that Arthur was worse, and that they intended removing
  for some time to a seat of his in Scotland; after which they meant to travel
  on the Continent for another year, if his health permitted it.
  &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I fear he has had a relapse, and his
  state is very precarious. Dear friends, think of us sometimes, and let us
  hope to meet again in happier days.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>XXV. &mdash; MEMORY THE BOOK OF GOD</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;At Trompyngtoun, nat fer fra Cantebrigg,<br>

  Upon the whiche brook then stant a melle;<br>
  And this is verray sothe that I you telle.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Chaucer , <i>The Reeve&rsquo;s Tale</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THERE is little which admits of external record in
  Julian&rsquo;s life at this period of his university career. It was the usual
  uneventful, quiet life of a studious Camford undergraduate. Happy it was
  beyond any other time, except perhaps a few vernal days of boyhood, but it
  was unmarked by any incidents. He read, and rowed, and went to lectures, and
  worked at classics, mathematics, and philosophy, and dropped in sometimes to
  a debate or a private-business squabble at the Union, and played racquets,
  fives, and football, and talked eagerly in hall and men&rsquo;s rooms over
  the exciting topics of the day, and occasionally went to wine or to breakfast
  with a don, and, (absorbed in some grand old poet or historian), lingered by
  his lamp over the lettered page from chapel-time till the grey dawn, when he
  would retire to pure and refreshful sleep, humming a tune out of very
  cheerfulness.</p>

  <p>Happy days, happy friendships, happy study, happy recreation, happy
  exemption from the cares of life! The bright visions of a scholar, the bright
  hilarity of a youth, the bright acquaintanceship with many united by a
  brotherly bond within those grey walls, were so many mingled influences that
  ran together &ldquo;like warp and woof&rdquo; in the web of a singularly
  enviable life. And every day he felt that he was knowing more, and acquiring
  a strength and power which should fit him hereafter for the more toilsome
  business and sterner struggles of common life. Well may old Cowley
  exclaim&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;O pulerae sine luxes aedes, vitaeque decore<br>
  Splendida paupertas ingenuusque pudor!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>All the reading men of his year were now anxiously occupied in working for
  the Saint Werner&rsquo;s scholarships. They were the blue ribbon of the
  place. In value they were not much more than 50 pounds a year, but as the
  scholars had an honourable distinctive seat both in hall and chapel, and as
  from <i>their</i> ranks alone the Fellows were selected, all the most
  intelligent and earnest men used their best efforts to obtain them on the
  earliest possible occasion. At the scholars&rsquo; table were generally to be
  found the most distinguished among the alumni of Saint Werner&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>Julian still moved chiefly among his old friends, although he had a large
  acquaintance, and by no means confined himself to the society of particular
  classes. But De Vayne&rsquo;s illness made a sad gap in the circle of his
  most intimate associates, and he was not yet sufficiently recovered to
  attempt a correspondence. Among the dons, Julian began to like Mr Admer more
  and more, and found that his cynicism of manner was but the result of
  disappointed ambition and unsteady aims, while his heart was sound and
  right.</p>

  <p>Kennedy, as well as Julian, had always hoped to gain a scholarship at his
  first trial, but now, with only one term left him to read in, his chance
  seemed to fade away to nothing. Poor fellow, he had returned with the
  strongest possible intention of working, and of abandoning at once and for
  ever all objectionable acquaintances and all dangerous ways. Hourly the sweet
  face of Violet looked in upon his silent thoughts, and filled him with shame
  as he thought of lost opportunities and wasted hours.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kennedy,&rdquo; said Mr Admer, &ldquo;how can you be so intolerably
  idle? I saw some of your Christmas papers, and they were wholly unworthy of
  your abilities.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know it well. But what could you expect? The Pindar I had read
  once over with a crib; the morality I had not looked at; the mathematics I
  did not touch.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But what excuse have you? I really feel quite angry with you. You
  are wholly throwing away everything. What have you to show for your time and
  money? Only think, my dear fellow, that an opportunity like this comes only
  once in life, and soon your college days will be over with nothing to
  remember.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;True, too true.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I am glad that you see and own it. I began to fear that you
  were one of that contemptible would-be fine gentleman class that affects
  forsooth to despise work as a thing unworthy of their eminence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, Mr Admer,&rdquo; said Kennedy, &ldquo;my idleness springs from
  very different causes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And then these Brogtens and people, whom you are so often seen
  with; which of them do you think understands you, or can teach you anything
  worth knowing? and which of them do you think you will ever care to look back
  to as acquaintances in after days?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not one of them. I hate the whole set.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And then, my dear Kennedy&mdash;for I speak to you out of real
  good-will&mdash;I would say it with the utmost delicacy, but you must know
  that your name has suffered from the company you frequent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can I not see it to be so?&rdquo; he answered moodily; &ldquo;no
  need to tell me that, when I read it in the faces of nearly every man I see.
  The men have not yet forgiven me De Vayne&rsquo;s absence, though really and
  truly that sin does not lie at my door. Except Julian and Lillyston there is
  hardly a man I respect, who does not look at me with averted eyes. Of course
  Grayson and the dons detest me to a man; but I don&rsquo;t care for
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then, you mysterious fellow, seeing all this so clearly, why do you
  suffer it to be so?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy only shook his head; already there had begun to creep over him a
  feeling of despair; already it seemed to him as though the gate of heaven
  were a lion-haunted portal guarded by a fiery sword.</p>

  <p>For he had soon found that his intense resolutions to do right met with
  formidable checks. There are two stern facts&mdash;facts which it does us all
  good to remember&mdash;which generally lie in the path of repentance, and
  look like crouching lions to the remorseful soul. First, the fact that we
  become so entangled by habit and circumstance, so enslaved by association and
  custom, that the very atmosphere around us seems to have become impregnated
  with a poison which we cannot cease to breathe; secondly, the fact that
  &ldquo;<i>in the physical world there is no forgiveness of sins</i>;&rdquo;
  to abandon our evil courses is not to escape the punishment of them, and
  although we may have relinquished them wholly in the present, we cannot
  escape the consequences of the past. Remission of sin is <i>not</i> the
  remission of their results. The very monsters we dread, and the dread of
  which terrifies us into the consideration of our ways, glare upon us out of
  the future darkness, as large, as terrible, as irresistible, whether we
  approach them on the road to ruin, or whether we seem to fly from them
  through the hardly attained and narrow wicket of genuine repentance.</p>

  <p>Both these difficulties acted with their full force on the mind of
  Kennedy. His error was its own punishment, and its heaviest punishment. The
  hours he had lost were lost so utterly, that he could never hope to recover
  them; the undesirable acquaintances he had formed were so far ripe as to
  render it no light task to abandon them; and above all, the fleck on his
  character, the connection of his name with the outrage on De Vayne, had
  injured his reputation in a manner which he never hoped, by future
  endeavours, to obviate or remove.</p>

  <p>For instance, there was at once an objection to his dropping the society
  of the set to which Bruce and Brogten had introduced him. He owed them money,
  which at present he could not pay; his undischarged &ldquo;debts of
  honour&rdquo; hung like a millstone round his neck. To pay these seemed a
  necessary preliminary even to the possibility of commencing a new career.</p>

  <p>But how to get the money? ah me! new temptations seemed springing up
  around like the crop of armed men from the furrows sown with the
  dragon&rsquo;s teeth.</p>

  <p>There was but one way which suggested itself to his mind, by which he
  would be able at once to deliver himself in part by meeting the most exigent
  demands. Let me hurry over the struggle which it cost him, but finally he
  adopted it. It was this.</p>

  <p>Mr Kennedy was most liberal in allowing his son everything which could
  possibly further his university studies, and the most important item in his
  quarterly expenses was the charge for private tuition. This sum was always
  paid by Kennedy himself, and it amounted at least to seven pounds a term.
  Now, what if he should not only ask his father to allow him this term a
  classical and a mathematical tutor, but also request permission to read
  double with them both <i>i e</i>, to go for an hour <i>every day</i> instead
  of every other day? This would at once procure him from his father the sum of
  twenty-eight pounds, and by means of this he could, with great economy, clear
  off all the most pressing of those pecuniary obligations which bound him to
  company, which he longed to shun, and exposed him to dangers which he had
  learnt to fear. Of course he would be obliged to forego all assistance from
  private tutors, and simply to appropriate the money, without his
  father&rsquo;s knowledge, to other ends. In a high point of view, it was
  simple embezzlement; it was little better than a form of swindling. But in
  this gross and repulsive shape, it never suggested itself to poor
  Kennedy&rsquo;s imagination. Somehow one&rsquo;s own sins never look so bad
  in our eyes as the same sins when committed by another. He argued that he
  would really be applying the money as his father intended, viz, to such
  purposes as should most advance the objects of his university career. He was
  committing a sin to save himself from temptation.</p>

  <p>The near approach of the scholarship examination, and Kennedy&rsquo;s
  failure at Christmas, made his father all the more ready to give him every
  possible advantage that money could procure. Ignorant of the fact that to
  &ldquo;read double&rdquo; with a tutor was almost a thing unprecedented at
  Camford, and that to do so, <i>both</i> in classics and mathematics, was a
  thing wholly unknown, and indeed practically impossible, Mr Kennedy was only
  delighted at Edward&rsquo;s letter, as conveying a proof of his extreme and
  laudable eagerness to recover lost ground, and do his best. He very readily
  wrote the cheque for the sum required, and praised his son liberally for
  these indications of effort. How those praises cut Kennedy to the heart.</p>

  <p>But he at once spent the money in the way which he had devised, and added
  thereby a new load of mental bitterness to the heavy weight which already
  oppressed him. The sum thus appropriated greatly lightened, although it did
  not remove, the pecuniary obligations which he had contracted at cards or in
  other ways to his set of &ldquo;fast&rdquo; companions; but it was at the
  cost of his peace of mind.</p>

  <p>Externally he profited by the transaction. He was enabled in great
  measure, without the charge of meanness, to drop the most undesirable of his
  acquaintances, and awaking eagerly to the hope of at once redeeming his
  reputation and lessening his difficulties by gaining a scholarship, he began,
  for the first time since he had entered Saint Werner&rsquo;s, to work
  steadily with all his might.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be living two lives in one, and often asked himself whether
  there was in his character some deeply-rooted hypocrisy. With Julian and
  Owen, and the men who resembled them, he could talk nobly of all that was
  honourable, and he powerfully upheld a chivalrous ideal of duty and virtue.
  And as his face lighted up, and the thoughts flowed in the full stream of
  eloquent language in reprobation of some mean act, or in glowing eulogium of
  some recorded heroism for the performance of what was right, who would have
  fancied, who would have believed, that Kennedy&rsquo;s own life had failed so
  egregiously in the commonest requirements of steadfastness and honesty?</p>

  <p>None rejoiced more in the outward change of life than Julian Home; for
  Violet&rsquo;s sake now, as well as for Kennedy&rsquo;s, he felt a keen and
  brotherly interest in the progress and estimation of his friend. Once more
  they were to be found together as often as they had been in their
  freshman&rsquo;s year, and it was Julian&rsquo;s countenance and affection
  that tended more than anything else to repair Kennedy&rsquo;s damaged
  popularity, and remove the tarnish attaching to his name.</p>

  <p>One evening they were taking the usual two-hours&rsquo;
  constitutional&mdash;which is often the poor substitute for exercise in the
  case of reading men&mdash;and discussing together the chances of the coming
  scholarship examination, when they found themselves near a place called
  Gower&rsquo;s Mill, and heard a sudden cry for help. Pressing forwards they
  saw a boat floating upside down, and whirling about tumultuously in the
  racing and rain-swollen eddies of the mill-dam. A floating straw hat was
  already being sucked in by the gurgling rush of water that roared under the
  mighty circumference of the wheel, and for a moment they saw nothing more.
  But as they ran up, a black spot emerged from the stream, only a few yards
  from the mill, and they saw a man, evidently in the last stage of exhaustion,
  struggling feebly in the white and boiling waves.</p>

  <p>The position was agonising. The man&rsquo;s utmost efforts only served to
  keep him stationary, and it was clear, from the frantic violence of his
  exertion, that he could not last an instant longer. Indeed, as they reached
  the bank, he began to sink and disappear&mdash;disappear as it seemed to the
  certainty of a most horrid death.</p>

  <p>In one instant&mdash;without considering the danger and apparent
  hopelessness of the attempt, without looking at the wild force of the water,
  and the grinding roll of the big wheel, without even waiting to fling off
  their coats&mdash;Julian and Kennedy, actuated by the strong instinct to save
  a fellow-creature&rsquo;s life, had both plunged into the mill-dam, and at
  the same moment struck out for the sinking figure. It was not till then that
  they felt their terrific danger; in the swirl of those spumy and hissing
  waves it was all but impossible for them to make head against the current,
  and they felt it carry them nearer and nearer to the black, dripping mass,
  one blow of which would stun them, and one revolution of it mangle them with
  horrible mutilation. They reached the drowning wretch, and each seizing him
  by the arm, shouted for assistance, and buffeted gallantly with the
  headstrong stream. The senseless burden which they supported clogged their
  efforts, and as they felt themselves gradually swept nearer, nearer, nearer
  to destruction, the passionate desire of self-preservation woke in both of
  them in all its wild agony;&mdash;yet they would not attempt to preserve
  themselves by letting go the man to save whose life they had so terribly
  endangered their own.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile their repeated shouts and those of the swimmer, which had first
  attracted their own attention, had aroused the miller, who instantly, on
  hearing them, ran down with a rope to the water&rsquo;s side. He threw it
  skilfully; with a wild clutch Kennedy caught it, and in another moment, as
  from the very jaws of death, when they were almost touching the fatal wheel,
  they were drawn to shore, still carrying, or rather dragging, with them their
  insensible companion.</p>

  <p>After a word of hurried thanks to the miller for saving their lives, they
  began to turn their whole attention to the half-drowned man, and to apply the
  well-known remedies for restoring extinct animation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good heavens,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;it is Brogten!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Brogten?&rdquo; said Kennedy; he looked on the face, and whispered
  half-aloud, &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They carried him into the mill, put him between the blankets in a warm
  bed, chafed his numb limbs, and sent off for the nearest doctor. Very soon he
  began to revive, and recovered his consciousness; immediately this was the
  case, Julian and Kennedy ran home as quickly as they could to change their
  wet clothes.</p>

  <p>The next day the doctor ordered Brogten to lie in bed till after mid-day,
  and then allowed him, now thoroughly well and rested, to walk home to Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s. He had not yet learnt the names of his deliverers.</p>

  <p>He reached the college in the evening, and after changing his boating
  dress, his first care was to try and learn to whom he was indebted for his
  life. Almost the first man he met told him that the men who had risked their
  safety for his were Home and Kennedy.</p>

  <p>Home and Kennedy! Home, to whom he had caused the bitterest disappointment
  and done the most malicious injury which had ever happened to him in his
  life; Kennedy, whom he had tried but too successfully to corrupt and ruin,
  tempt from duty, and push from his good name!</p>

  <p>Deeply, very deeply, was Brogten humiliated; he felt that his enemies had
  indeed heaped coals of fire upon his head.</p>

  <p>He determined, as his first duty, to go and thank them both&mdash;Kennedy
  first, as the one against whom he had most wilfully sinned.</p>

  <p>He found Kennedy sitting down to tea, and Julian, Owen, and Suton were
  with him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kennedy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have come to thank you and Home
  for a very gallant deed; I need not say how much I feel indebted to you for
  the risk you ran in saving my life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Genuine tears rushed into his dark eyes as he spoke, and cordially grasped
  the hands which, without a word, they proffered. Community of danger,
  consciousness of obligation, blotted out all evil memories; and to have stood
  side by side together on the very brink of the precipice of death was a bond
  of union which could not be ignored or set aside. That night, in spite of
  bygones, the feeling of those three young men for each other was of the
  kindliest cast.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you stay to tea, Brogten?&rdquo; said Kennedy.</p>

  <p>He looked round, as though uncertain whether the others would like his
  company, but as they all seconded Kennedy&rsquo;s request, he gladly stayed.
  It was the first evening that he had regularly spent in the society of
  reading men, and he was both delighted and surprised at the rare pleasure he
  received from the vigour and liveliness of their conversation. These were the
  men whom he had despised as slow, yet what a contrast between their way of
  talking and the inanities of Fitzurse or the shallow flippancy of Bruce. As
  he sat there and listened, his very face became softer in its lines from the
  expression of a real and intelligent interest, and they all thought that he
  was a better fellow, on closer acquaintance, than they had been accustomed to
  suppose. Ah me! how often one remains unaware of the good side of those whom
  we dislike.</p>

  <p>Oh, those Camford conversations&mdash;how impetuous, how interesting, how
  thoroughly hearty and unconventional they were! How utterly presumption and
  ignorance were scouted in them, and how completely they were free from the
  least shadow of insincerity or ennui. If I could but transfer to my page a
  true and vivid picture of one such evening, spent in the society of Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s friends&mdash;if I could write down but one such conversation,
  and at all express its vivacity, its quick flashes of thought and logic, its
  real desire for truth and knowledge, its friendly fearlessness, its
  felicitous illustrations, its unpremeditated wit, such a record, taken fresh
  from the life, would be worth all that I shall ever write. But youth flies,
  and as she flies all the bright colours fade from the wings of thought, and
  the bloom vanishes from the earnest eloquence of speech.</p>

  <p>Yet, as I write, let me call to mind, if but for a moment, the remembrance
  of those happy evenings, when we would meet to read Shakespeare or the Poets
  in each other&rsquo;s rooms, and pleasant sympathies and pleasant differences
  of opinion freely discussed, called into genial life, friendships which we
  once hoped and believed would never have grown cold. Let the image of that
  bright social circle, picturesquely scattered in armchairs round the winter
  fire, rise up before my fancy once more, and let me recall what can never be
  again. Of the honoured and well-loved few who one night recorded their names
  and thoughts in one precious little book, two are dead though it is but five
  years back; C E B&mdash; is dead; and R H P&mdash; is dead; C E B&mdash; the
  chivalrous and gallant-hearted, the champion of the past, the &ldquo;Tory
  whom Liberals loved;&rdquo; and R H P&mdash;, the honest and noble, the
  eloquent speaker, and the brave actor, and the fearless thinker&mdash;he,
  too, is dead, nobly volunteering in works of danger and difficulty during the
  Indian Mutiny; but L&mdash;, and B&mdash;, and M&mdash;, and others are
  living yet, and to them I consecrate this page <i>they</i> will forgive the
  digression, and for their sakes I will venture to let it pass. We are
  scattered now, and our friendship is a silent one, but yet I know that to
  them, at least, changed or unchanged, my words will recall the fading memory
  of glorious days.</p>

  <p>The conversation, (but do not suppose that I shall attempt, after what I
  have said, to reproduce it), happened to turn that evening on the phenomena
  of memory. It started thus:&mdash; They had been discussing some subject of
  the day, when Owen observed to Julian&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, how grave you look, Julian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do I? I was thinking of something odd. While you were
  talking&mdash;without the faintest apparent reason that I can discover, (and
  I was trying to hit upon one when you spoke)&mdash;a fact started up in my
  mind, which had no connection whatever with the subject, and yet which forced
  itself quite strongly and obtrusively on my notice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just as one catches sight suddenly of some stray bit of seaweed
  floating in a great world of waters, which seems to have no business
  there,&rdquo; said Kennedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes. But there <i>must</i> have been <i>some</i> reason for my
  thinking of it just then.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The law of association, depend upon it,&rdquo; said Owen,
  &ldquo;even if the connecting links were so subtle and swiftly moved that you
  failed to detect their presence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you of the Materialist school, Owen, about memory?&rdquo; said
  Julian, &ldquo;<i>i e</i>, do you go with Hobbes and Condillac, and make it a
  decaying sense or a transformed sensation?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a bit; I believe it to be a spiritual faculty, entirely
  independent of mere physical organisation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wo-ho!&rdquo; said Kennedy; &ldquo;the physiologists will join
  issue with you there. How for instance do you account for such stories as
  that of the groom, who, getting a kick on a particular part of the head from
  a vicious horse, suffered no harm except in forgetting everything which had
  happened <i>up to that time</i>?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a bit conclusive. I don&rsquo;t say that the
  conscious exercise of memory mayn&rsquo;t be temporarily dependent on
  organisation, but I do believe that every fact ever imprinted on the memory,
  however long it may be latent, is of its very nature imperishable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Suton. &ldquo;Memory is the book of God. Did you
  see that story of the shipwreck the other day? One of the survivors, while
  floating alone on the dark midnight sea, suddenly heard a voice saying to him
  distinctly, &lsquo;Johnny, did you eat sister&rsquo;s grapes?&rsquo; It was
  the revived memory of a long-forgotten childish theft. What have the
  Pineal-Gland-olaters to say to that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a profound touch that was of Themistocles,&rdquo; said
  Kennedy, &ldquo;who rejected the offer of a Memoria Technicha, with the
  aspiration that some one could <i>teach him to forget</i>. Lethe is the
  grandest of rivers after all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can illustrate what you are saying,&rdquo; said Brogten,
  &ldquo;and I believe it to be true that <i>nothing can be utterly
  forgotten</i>. Yesterday when you saw me I had sunk twice, and when you
  rescued me I was insensible. Strange things happened to my memory
  then!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell us,&rdquo; said all of them eagerly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I believe it&rsquo;s an old story, but I&rsquo;ll tell you.
  When the first agony of fear, and the sort of gulp of asphyxia was over, I
  felt as if I was sinking into a pleasant sleep, surrounded by the light of
  green fields&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because the veins of the eye were bloodshot, and green is the
  complementary colour,&rdquo; interpolated Kennedy, whereat Owen gave a little
  incredulous guffaw; and Brogten continued&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, <i>then</i>, it was that all my past life flashed before me,
  from the least forgotten venial fault of infancy to the worst passion of
  youth,&mdash;only they came to me clear and vivid, in <i>retrograde</i>
  order. The lies I told when I was a little boy, the wicked words I spoke, the
  cruel things I did, the first taint that polluted my mind, the faces of
  school-fellows whom I had irreparably injured, the stolen waters of
  manhood&mdash;all were dashed into my remorseful recollection; they started
  up like buried, menacing ghosts, without, or even against my will. I felt
  convinced that they were <i>indestructible</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That strain I heard was of a higher mood!&rdquo; thought the
  auditors, for it was quite a new thing to hear Brogten talk like this, and in
  such a solemn, manly, sober voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fancy,&rdquo; said Kennedy, sighing, &ldquo;<i>an everlasting
  memory</i>!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The others went away, but Brogten still lingered in Kennedy&rsquo;s rooms,
  and, rising, took him by the hand. They both remembered another scene in
  these rooms, when they two were together,&mdash;the torturer and the
  tortured; but it was different now.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The worst thing that haunted me, Kennedy, when you were saving my
  life, was the thought of my wickedness to you. I fear it can never be
  repaired; yet believe me, that from this day forth I have vowed before God to
  turn over a new leaf, and my whole effort will be to do all for you that ever
  may be in my power! Do you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As I hope to be forgiven,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

  <p>Yet it was part of Brogten&rsquo;s punishment in after days to remember
  that <i>his</i> hand had set the stone moving on the steep hill-side, which
  afterwards he had no power to stay. It would not come back to him for a wish,
  but leapt, and rushed, and bounded forward, splintering and splintered by the
  obstacles in its course, till at last&mdash; Could it be saved from being
  dashed to shivers among the smooth rocks of the valley and the brook?</p>

  <h2>XXVI. &mdash; HAZLET&rsquo;S VISION</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;And ride on his breast, and trouble his rest<br>
  In the shape of his deadliest sin.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Anon.</p><br>

  <p class="first">BEFORE the scholarship, came the Little-go, so called in the
  language of men, but known to the gods as the Previous Examination. As it is
  an examination which all must pass, the standard required is of course very
  low, and the subjects are merely Paley&rsquo;s Evidences, a little Greek
  Testament, some easy classic, Scripture History, and a sprinkling of
  arithmetic and algebra.</p>

  <p>The reading men simply regard it as a nuisance, interrupting their reading
  and wasting their time, <i>i e</i>, until the wisdom of maturer years shows
  them its necessity and use. But to the idle and the stupid, the name
  Little-go is fraught with terror. It begins to loom upon them from the
  commencement of their second year, and all their efforts must be concentrated
  to avoid the disgrace and hindrance of a pluck. There are regular tutors to
  cram Poll men for this necessary ordeal, and the processes applied to
  introduce the smallest possible modicum of information into the heads of the
  victims, the surgical operations necessary to inculcate into them the
  simplest facts, would, if narrated, form a curious chapter in morbid
  psychology. I suggest this merely as a pregnant hint for the future historian
  of Camford; personally I am only acquainted by report with the system
  resorted to.</p>

  <p>Hazlet began to be in a fright about the Little-go from the very
  commencement of his second October. His mother well knew that the examination
  was approaching, and thought it quite impossible that her ingenuous and
  right-minded son could fall a victim to the malice of examiners. Hazlet was
  not so sure of this himself, and as the days had passed by when he could
  speak of the classics with a holy indignation against their vices and
  idolatry, he was wrought up by dread of the coming papers into a high state
  of nervous excitement.</p>

  <p>I will not betray the mistakes he made, or dish up in this place the
  &ldquo;crambe reptita&rdquo; of those Little-go anecdotes, which at this
  period of the year awaken the laughter of combination-rooms, and dissipate
  the dulness of Camford life. Suffice it to say that Hazlet displayed an
  ignorance at once egregious and astounding; the ingenious perversity of his
  mistakes, the fatuous absurdity of his confusions, would be inconceivable to
  any who do not know by experience the extraordinary combinations of ignorance
  and conceit. The examiners were very lenient and forbearing, but Hazlet was
  plucked; plucked too in Scripture History, which astonished everybody, until
  it became known that he had attributed John the Baptist&rsquo;s death to his
  having &ldquo;danced with Herodias&rsquo;s daughter&rdquo;&mdash;traced a
  connection between the Old and New Testaments in the fact of Saint
  Peter&rsquo;s having cut off the ear of Malachi the last of the
  prophets&mdash;and stated that the substance of Saint Paul&rsquo;s sermon at
  Athens, was &ldquo;crying vehemently about the space of two hours, Great is
  Diana of the Ephesians!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It is a sad pity that such ludicrous associations should centre round the
  word &ldquo;pluck.&rdquo; It is anything but a laughing matter to those who
  undergo the process; they have tried hard and worked diligently perhaps to
  pass the examination, and if they fail they see before them another long
  period of weary and dissatisfied effort, with the same probability of failure
  again and again repeated: for until the barrier of the Little-go is passed
  they can advance no further, and must simply stay at Camford until in some
  way or other they can succeed in getting up the requisite minimum of
  information. I have seen a strong man in the senate-house turn as white as a
  sheet, when a paper which he was unable to answer was placed before him. I
  fancy I see him now, and distinctly remember my strong feeling of compassion
  for his distress, and my earnest hope that he would not be
  &ldquo;floored.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a general laugh in Saint Werner&rsquo;s when it was announced
  that Hazlet was plucked; and in Scripture History too! His follies and
  inconsistencies had unhappily made him a butt, but men little knew how
  heavily the misfortune would weigh upon him.</p>

  <p>He happened at this time to be living on the same stair-case with
  Lillyston, and Lillyston, who was in the rooms below him, was quite amazed at
  the sounds which he heard proceeding from his rooms. For a long time there
  was a series of boo-hoos, long, loud, and wailing as of some animal in
  distress, and then there was an uproar as of some one running violently
  about, and throwing the furniture out of his way. Lillyston was just on the
  point of going to see what was the matter when the breathless bedmaker
  appeared at the door, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, Mr Lillyston, sir, do go and
  look at Mr Hazlet, sir; he&rsquo;s took very bad, he is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Took very bad&mdash;how do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, sir, it&rsquo;s the Little-go, sir, as done it. He&rsquo;s
  plucked, sir, and it&rsquo;s upset him like. So, when I asked him if
  he&rsquo;d a-tea&rsquo;d, and if I should take away the things, he begins a
  banging his chairs about, you see, sir, quite uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Lillyston immediately ran up-stairs. The violent fit seemed to have
  subsided, for Hazlet, peering out of a corner, with wandering, spectacled
  eyes, quite cowered when he saw him. Lillyston was shocked at the spectacle
  he presented. Hazlet was but half dressed, his hands kept up an uneasy and
  vague motion, his face was blank, and his whole appearance resembled that of
  an idiot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, Hazlet, my man, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; said
  Lillyston, cheerily.</p>

  <p>Hazlet trembled, and muttered something about a dog. It happened that just
  before coming back from the senate-house, a large Newfoundland had run
  against him, and his excited imagination had mingled this most recent
  impression with the vagaries of a temporary madness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The dog, my dear fellow; why, there&rsquo;s no dog here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hazlet only cowered farther into the corner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here, won&rsquo;t you have some tea?&rdquo; said Lillyston;
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it for you. Come and help me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He began to busy himself about setting the tea-things, and cutting the
  bread, while he occupied Hazlet in pouring out the water and attending to the
  kettle. Hazlet started violently every now and then, and looked with a
  terrified side-glance at Lillyston, as though apprehensive of some wrong.</p>

  <p>At last Lillyston got him to sit down quietly, and gave him a cup of tea
  and some bread. He ate it in silence, except that every now and then he
  uttered a sort of wail, and looked up at Lillyston. The look didn&rsquo;t
  seem to satisfy him, for, after a few minutes, he seized his knife, and said,
  &ldquo;I shall cut off your whiskers.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What put the grotesque fancy into his head, Lillyston did not know;
  probably some faint reminiscence of having been forced to shave after the
  trick which Bruce had played on him by painting his face with lamp-black and
  ochre.</p>

  <p>Lillyston decidedly declined the proposition, and they both started up
  from their seats&mdash;Hazlet brandishing his knife with determined purpose,
  and looking at his companion with a strange savage glare under his
  spectacles.</p>

  <p>After darting round the room once or twice to escape his attack, Lillyston
  managed with wonderful skill to clutch the wrist of Hazlet&rsquo;s right
  hand, and, being very strong, he held him with the grasp of a vice, while
  with his left hand he forced the knife out of his clutch, and dropped it on
  the floor. He held him tight for a minute or two, although Hazlet struggled
  so fiercely that it was no easy task, and then quietly forced him into a
  chair, and spoke to him in a firm authoritative voice&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No mischief, Hazlet; we shan&rsquo;t allow it. Now listen to me:
  you must go to bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The tone of voice and the strength of will which characterised
  Lillyston&rsquo;s proceedings, awed Hazlet into submission. He cried a
  little, and then suffered Lillyston to see him into his rooms, and to put him
  into a fair way towards going to bed. Taking the precaution to remove his
  razor, Lillyston locked the door upon him, and determined at once to get
  medical advice. The doctor, however, could give very little help; it was, he
  said, a short fit of temporary madness, for which quiet and change of air
  were the only effectual remedies. He did not anticipate that there would be
  any other outbreak of violence, or anything more than a partial
  imbecility.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do come and help me to manage Hazlet,&rdquo; said Lillyston to
  Julian next morning; &ldquo;his head has been turned by being plucked for the
  Little-go, and he&rsquo;s as mad as Hercules Furens.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian went, and they stayed in Hazlet&rsquo;s room till he had quietly
  breakfasted. He then appeared to be so calm that Lillyston agreed to leave
  Julian there for the morning, and to take the charge of Hazlet for the
  afternoon and evening. It seemed absolutely necessary that someone should
  take charge of him, and they thought it best to divide the labour.</p>

  <p>Julian sorely felt the loss of time. He had a great deal to get through
  before the all-important scholarship examination, and the loss of every
  available hour fretted him, for since he had failed in the Clerkland, he was
  doubly anxious to gain a Saint Werner&rsquo;s scholarship at his first time
  of trial. Still he never wavered for a moment in the determination to fulfil
  the duty of taking care of his Ildown acquaintance, and he spent the whole
  tedious morning in trying to amuse him.</p>

  <p>Hazlet&rsquo;s ceaseless allusions to &ldquo;the dog,&rdquo; and the
  feeble terror which it seemed to cause him, made it necessary to talk to him
  incessantly, and to turn his attention, as far as possible, to other things.
  He had to be managed like a very wilful and stupid child, and when one of the
  five hours which Julian had to spend with him was finished, he was worn out
  with anxiety and fatigue. It is a dreadful thing to be alone in charge of a
  human being&mdash;a being in human shape, who is, either by accident or
  constitution, incapable alike of responsibility and thought. Hazlet had been
  able to play draughts pretty well, so Julian got out a board and challenged
  him to a game, but instead of playing, Hazlet only scrabbled on the board,
  and pushed the pieces about in a meaningless confusion, while every now and
  then the sullen glare came into his eye which showed Julian the necessity of
  being on his guard if self-defence should be needed. Then Julian tried to get
  him to draw, and showing him a picture, sketched a few strokes of outline,
  and said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, Hazlet, finish copying this picture for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hazlet took the pencil between his unsteady fingers, and let it make
  futile scratches on the paper, and, when Julian repeated his words, wrote
  down in a slow painful hand&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Finish copying pict&mdash;ure pict&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>What was to be done in such a case as this? Julian suggested a turn in the
  grounds, but Hazlet betrayed such dread at the thought of leaving his rooms,
  and encountering &ldquo;the dog,&rdquo; that Julian was afraid, if he
  persisted, of driving him into a fit.</p>

  <p>Just as the dilemma was becoming seriously unpleasant, Brogten came up to
  the rooms, and begged Julian to intrust Hazlet to his charge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Your</i> time is valuable, Home&mdash;particularly just now.
  Mine is all but worthless. At any rate I have no <i>special</i> work as you
  have, and I can take care of poor Hazlet very well.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t shrink from the
  duty I have undertaken, and besides you&rsquo;ll find it very dull and
  unpleasant work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that. I once had an idiot brother&mdash;dead
  now&mdash;and I understand well how to manage any one in a case like this.
  Besides, Hazlet is one of the many I have injured. Let me stay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I really am afraid you won&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Home; I won&rsquo;t give in, depend upon it. I am quite
  in earnest, and am besides most anxious that you should get a scholarship
  this time. Don&rsquo;t refuse me the privilege of helping you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian could refuse no longer, and went back to his rooms with perfect
  confidence that Brogten would do his work willingly and well. He looked in
  about mid-day to see how things were going on, and found that, after
  thoroughly succeeding in amusing his patient, Brogten had persuaded him to go
  to sleep, in the conviction that by the time he awoke he would be nearly
  well. Nor was he mistaken. The next day Hazlet was sufficiently recovered to
  go home for the Easter vacation.</p>

  <p>It was a very bitter and humiliating trial to him; but misfortune, however
  frequently it causes reformation, is not invariably successful in changing a
  man&rsquo;s heart and life. Hazlet came back after the Easter vacation with
  recovered health, but damaged constitution, and in no respect either better
  or wiser for the misfortune he had undergone.</p>

  <p>One peculiarity of his recent attack was a strong nervous excitability,
  which was induced by very slight causes, and Hazlet had not long returned to
  Saint Werner&rsquo;s when the dissipation of his life began once more to tell
  perniciously upon his state of health. It must not be imagined that because
  he was the easiest possible victim of temptation, he suffered no upbraidings
  of a terrified and remorseful conscience. Many a time they overwhelmed him
  with agony and a dread of the future, mingling with his slavish terrors of a
  material Gehenna, and stirring up his turbid thoughts until they drove him to
  the verge of madness. But the inward chimera of riotous passions was too
  fierce for the weak human reason, and while he hated himself he continued
  still to sin.</p>

  <p>Late one night he was returning to his rooms from the foul haunts of
  squalid dissipation and living death, when the thought of his own intolerable
  condition pressed on him with a heavier than usual weight. It was a very
  cloudy night, and he had long exceeded the usual college hours. The wind
  tossed about his clothes, and dashed in his face a keen impalpable sleet,
  while nothing dispelled the darkness except the occasional gleam of a lamp
  struggling fitfully with the driving mist. Hazlet reached Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s wet and miserable; in returning he had lost his way, and
  wandered into the most disreputable and poverty-stricken streets, the very
  homes of thievery and dirt, where he seriously feared for his personal
  safety. By the time he got to the college gates he was drenched through and
  through, and while his body shivered with the cold air, the condition of his
  mind was agitated and terrified, and the sudden blaze of light that fell on
  him from the large college lamp, as the gates opened, dazzled his
  unaccustomed eyes.</p>

  <p>Hastily running across the court to his own rooms, he groped his
  way&mdash;giddy and crapulous&mdash;giddy and crapulous&mdash;up the dark and
  narrow stair-case, and after some fumbling with his key opened the door.</p>

  <p>Lillyston, who was just going to bed after a long evening of hard work,
  heard his footstep on the stairs, and thought with sorrow that he had not
  mended his old bad ways. He heard him open the door, and then a long wild
  shriek, followed by the sound of some one falling, rang through the
  buildings.</p>

  <p>In an instant, Lillyston had darted up-stairs, and the other men who
  &ldquo;kept&rdquo; on the stair-case, jumped out of bed hastily, thrust on
  their slippers, and also ran out to see what was the matter. As Lillyston
  reached the threshold of Hazlet&rsquo;s rooms, he stumbled against something,
  and stooping down found that it was the senseless body of Hazlet himself
  stretched at full length upon the floor.</p>

  <p>He looked up, but saw nothing to explain the mystery; the rooms were in
  darkness, except that a dull, blue flame, flickering over the black and red
  relics of the fire, threw fantastic gleams across the furniture and ceiling,
  and gave an odd, wild appearance to the cap and gown that hung beside the
  door.</p>

  <p>Lillyston was filled with surprise, and lit the candle on the table.
  Lifting Hazlet on the sofa, he carefully looked at him to see if he was
  correct in his first surmise, that the unhappy man had swallowed poison, or
  committed suicide in some other way. But there was no trace of anything of
  the kind, and Hazlet merely appeared to have fainted and fallen suddenly.</p>

  <p>Aided by Noel, one of those who had been alarmed by that piercing shriek,
  Lillyston took the proper means to revive Hazlet from his fainting fit, and
  put him to bed. He rapidly recovered his consciousness, but earnestly begged
  them not to press him on the subject of his alarm, respecting which he was
  unable or unwilling to give them any information.</p>

  <p>The next morning he was very ill; excitement and anxiety brought on a
  brain fever, which kept him for many weary weeks in his sick-room, and from
  which he had not fully recovered until after a long stay at Ildown. As he
  lost, in consequence of this attack, the whole of the ensuing term, he was
  obliged to degrade, as it is called, <i>i e</i> to place his name on the list
  of the year below; and he did not return to Camford till the following
  October, where his somewhat insignificant individuality had been almost
  forgotten.</p>

  <p>Let us anticipate a little to throw light on what we have narrated.</p>

  <p>When Hazlet <i>did</i> come back to undergraduate life, he at once sought
  the alienated friends from whom he had been separated ever since the
  disastrous period of his acquaintanceship with Bruce. He came back to them
  penitent and humble, with those convictions now existing in his mind in their
  reality and genuineness, which before he had only simulated so successfully
  as to deceive himself. I will not say that he did not continue ignorant and
  bigoted, but he was no longer conceited and malicious. I will not say that he
  never showed himself dogmatic and ill-informed, but he was no longer
  obtrusive and uncharitable. His life was better than his dogmas, and the
  sincerity of his good intentions counteracted and nullified the ill effects
  of a narrow and unwholesome creed. There were no farther inconsistencies in
  his conduct, and he showed firmly, yet modestly, the line he meant to follow,
  and the side he meant to take. As his conscience had become scrupulous, and
  his life irreproachable, it mattered comparatively little that his
  intellectual character was tainted with fanaticism and gloom.</p>

  <p>I would not be mistaken to mean that he found his penitence easy, or that
  he was, like Saint Paul, transformed as it were by a lightning
  flash&mdash;&ldquo;a fusile Christian.&rdquo; I say, there were&mdash;after
  his two sicknesses and long suffering, and experiences bitter as
  wormwood&mdash;there were, I say, no more <i>outward</i> inconsistencies in
  his life; but I do not say that <i>within</i> there were no fierce, fearful
  struggles, so wearisome at times that it almost seemed better to yield than
  to feel the continued anguish of such mighty temptations. All this the man
  must always go through who has warmed in his bosom the viper whose poisoned
  fang has sent infection into his blood. But through God&rsquo;s grace Hazlet
  was victorious: and as, when the civilisation of some infant colony is
  advancing on the confines of a desert, the wild beasts retire before it,
  until they become rare, and their howling is only heard in the lonely night,
  and then even that sign of their fury is but a strange occurrence, until it
  is heard no more; so in Hazlet, the many-headed monsters, which breed in the
  slime of a fallen human heart, were one by one slain or driven backwards by
  watchfulness, and shame, and prayer.</p>

  <p>Julian and Lillyston had never shunned his society, either when he
  breathed the odour of sanctity, or when he sank into the slough of
  wretchlessness. Both of them were sufficiently conscious of the heart&rsquo;s
  weakness to prevent them from the cold and melancholy presumption which leads
  weak and sinful men to desert and denounce those whom the good spirits have
  not yet deserted, and whom the good God has not finally condemned. As long as
  he sought their society, they were always open to his company, however
  distasteful; and the advice they gave him was tendered in simple good-
  will&mdash;not as though from the haughty vantage-ground of a superior
  excellence. Even when Hazlet was at the worst&mdash;when to be seen with him,
  after the publicity of his vices, involved something like a slur on a
  man&rsquo;s fair name&mdash;even in these his worst days neither Julian nor
  Lillyston would have refused, had he so desired it, to walk with him under
  the lime-tree avenue, or up and down the cloisters of Warwick&rsquo;s
  Court.</p>

  <p>But they naturally met him more often when his manner of life was changed
  for the better, and were both glad to see that he had found the jewel which
  adversity possessed. It happened that he was with them one evening when the
  conversation turned on supernatural appearances, the possibility of which was
  maintained by Julian and Owen, while Lillyston in his genial way was pooh-
  poohing them altogether. Hazlet alone sat silent, but at last he
  said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have never yet mentioned to any living soul what once happened to
  me, but I will do so now. Lillyston, you remember the night when I aroused
  you with a scream?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Lillyston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That night I was returning in all the bitterness of remorse from
  places where, but for God&rsquo;s blessing, I might have perished
  utterly&rdquo;&mdash;and Hazlet shuddered&mdash;&ldquo;when from out of the
  storm and darkness I reached my room door. You know that a beam ran right
  across my ceiling. When I threw open the door to enter, I saw on that beam as
  clearly as I now see you&mdash;no, <i>more clearly, far</i> more clearly than
  I now see you, for your presence makes no special impression on me, and this
  was burnt into my very brain&mdash;I saw there written in letters of
  fire&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i><b>AND THIS IS HELL</b></i>.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Struck dumb with horror, I stared at it; there could be no doubt
  about it, the letters burned and glared and reddened before my very eyes, and
  seemed to wave like the northern lights, and bicker into angrier flame as I
  looked at them. They fascinated me as I stood there dumb and stupefied, when
  suddenly I saw the dark and massive form of a hand, over which hung the skirt
  of a black robe, moving slowly away from the last letter. What more I
  <i>might</i> have seen I cannot tell;&mdash;it was then that I fell and
  fainted, and my shriek startled all the men on the stair-case.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Hazlet told his story with such deep solemnity, and such hollow pauses of
  emotion, that the listeners sat silent for a while.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But yet,&rdquo; said Lillyston, &ldquo;if you come to analyse this,
  it resolves itself into nothing. You were confessedly agitated, and almost
  hysterical that night; your body was unstrung; you were wet through, and it
  was doubtless the sudden passage from the darkness outside to the dim and
  uncertain glimmer of your own room, which acted so powerfully on your excited
  imagination, as to project your inward thoughts into a shape which you
  mistook for an external appearance. I remember noticing the aspect of your
  rooms myself that evening; the mysterious shadows, and the mingled effects of
  dull red firelight with black objects, together with the rustle of the red
  curtain in front of your window which you had left open, and the weird waving
  of your black gown in the draught, made such an impression even on me merely
  in consequence of the alarm your shriek had excited, that I could have
  fancied <i>anything</i> myself, if I wasn&rsquo;t pretty strong-headed, and
  rather prosaic. As it was, I did half fancy an unknown Presence in the
  room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but you say <i>inward</i> thoughts,&rdquo; replied Hazlet
  eagerly. &ldquo;Now these <i>weren&rsquo;t</i> my inward thoughts; on the
  contrary they flashed on me like a revelation, and the strange word,
  &lsquo;And,&rsquo; (for I read distinctly, &lsquo;<i>And</i> this
  is&mdash;&rsquo;) was to me like an awful copula connecting time and eternity
  for ever. I had always thought of quite another, quite a different hell; but
  this showed me for the first time that the state of sinfulness is <i>the</i>
  hell of sin. It was only the other day that I came across those lines of
  Milton&mdash;oh, how true they are&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Which way I fly is hell, <i>myself am hell</i>,<br>
  And in the lowest deep a lower deep<br>
  Still gaping to devour me opens wide,<br>
  To which the hell I suffer seems a heaven.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;It was the truth conveyed in those lines which I then first
  discovered, and discovered, it seems to me, from without. I know very very
  little&mdash;I am shamefully ignorant, but I do think that the vision of that
  night taught me more than a thousand volumes of scholastic theology. And let
  me say too,&rdquo; he continued humbly, &ldquo;that by it I was plucked like
  a brand from the burning; by it my conversion was brought about.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>None of the others were in a mood to criticise the phraseology of
  Hazlet&rsquo;s religious convictions, and he clearly desired that the subject
  of his own immediate experiences, as being one full of awfulness for him,
  might be dropped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Apropos of your argument, I care very little, Hugh,&rdquo; said
  Julian, &ldquo;whether you make supernatural appearances objective or
  subjective. I mean I don&rsquo;t care whether you regard the appearance as a
  mere deception of the eye, wrought by the disordered workings of the brain,
  or as the actual presence of a supernatural phenomenon. The result, the
  effect, the <i>reality</i> of the appearance is just the same in either case.
  Whether the end is produced by an illusion of the senses, or an appeal to
  them, the end <i>is</i> produced, and the senses <i>are</i> impressed by
  something which is not in the ordinary course of human events, just as
  powerfully as if the ghost had flesh and blood, or the voice were a veritable
  pulsation of articulated air. The only thing that annoys me is a contemptuous
  and supercilious denial of the <i>facts</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hold with you, Julian,&rdquo; said Owen. &ldquo;Take for instance
  the innumerable recorded instances where intimation has been given of a
  friend&rsquo;s or relative&rsquo;s death by the simultaneous appearance of
  his image to some one far absent, and unconscious even of his illness. There
  are four ways of treating such stories&mdash;the first is to deny their
  truth, which is, to say the least, not only grossly uncharitable, but an
  absurd and impertinent caprice adopted in order to reject unpleasant
  evidence; the second is to account for them by an optical delusion,
  accidentally synchronising with the event, which seems to me a most monstrous
  ignoring of the law of chances; a third is to account for them by the
  existence of some exquisite faculty, (existing in different degrees of
  intensity, and in some people not existing at all), whereby physical
  impressions are invisibly conveyed by some mysterious sympathy of
  organisation a faculty of which it seems to me there are the most abundant
  traces, however much it may be sneered and jeered at by those shallow
  philosophers who believe nothing but what they can grasp with both hands: and
  a fourth is to suppose that spirits can, of their own will, or by superior
  permission, make themselves sometimes visible to human eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; said Julian, &ldquo;so affect the senses <i>as to
  produce the impression</i> that they are present to human eyes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And to show you, Lillyston,&rdquo; said Owen, &ldquo;how little I
  fear any natural explanations, and how much I think them beside the point,
  I&rsquo;ll tell you what happened to me only the other night, and which yet
  does not make me at all inclined to rationalise Hazlet&rsquo;s story. I had
  just put out the candle in my bedroom, when over my head I saw a handwriting
  on the wall in characters of light. I started out of bed, and for a moment
  fancied that I could read the words, and that somebody had been playing me a
  trick with phosphorus. But the next minute, I saw how it was; the moonlight
  was shining in through the little muslin folds of the lower blind, and as the
  folds were very symmetrical, the chequered reflection on the wall looked
  exactly like a series of words.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, now, that would have made a capital ghost story,&rdquo; said
  Lillyston, &ldquo;if you had been a little more imaginative and nervous. And
  still more if the illusion had only been partially optical, and partly the
  result of excited feelings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It matters nothing to me,&rdquo; said Hazlet, rising,
  &ldquo;whether the characters I saw were written by the finger of a
  man&rsquo;s hand, or limned by spirits on the sensorium of the brain. All I
  know is that&mdash;thank God&mdash;<i>they were there</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>XXVII. &mdash; JULIAN AND KENNEDY</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;But there where I have garnered up my heart,<br>
  Where either I must live, or bear no life;<br>
  The fountain from the which my current runs<br>
  Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!<br>
  Patience, thou young and rose-lipped cherubim!<br>
  Aye there, look grim as hell!&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Othello, Act 4, scene 2.</p><br>

  <p class="first">SAINT WERNER&rsquo;S clock, with &ldquo;its male and female
  voice,&rdquo; has just told the university that it is nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>

  <p>A little crowd of Saint Wernerians is standing before the chapel door, and
  even the grass of the lawn in front of it is hardly sacred to-day from common
  feet. The throng composed of undergraduates, dons, bedmakers, and gyps, is
  broken into knots of people, who are chatting together according to their
  several kinds; but they are so quiet and expectant that the very pigeons
  hardly notice them, but flutter about and coo and peck up the scattered
  bread-crumbs, just as if nobody was there. If you look attentively round the
  court, you will see, too, that many of the windows are open, and you may
  detect faces half concealed among the window curtains. Clearly everybody is
  on the look out for something, though it is yet vacation time, and only a
  small section of the men are up.</p>

  <p>The door opens, and out sail the Seniors, more than ever conscious of
  pride and power; they stream away in silk gowns, carrying on their faces the
  smile of knowledge even into their isolation, where no one can see it. For
  some reason or other they always meet in chapel, or, for all I know, it may
  be in the ante-chapel, to elect the Saint Werner&rsquo;s scholars.</p>

  <p>And now the much talked of, much thought of, anxiously expected list,
  which is to make so many happy or miserable, is to be announced. On that
  little bit of paper, which the chapel-clerk holds in his hands as he stands
  on the chapel steps, are the names which everybody has been longing to
  conjecture. He comes out and reads. There are nine scholarships vacant, of
  which five will be given to the Third-year men, and four to Julian&rsquo;s
  year.</p>

  <p>The five Third-year men are read first, and as each name is announced, off
  darts some messenger from the crowd to carry the happy intelligence to some
  expectant senior soph. The heads of listeners lean farther and farther out of
  the window, for the clerk speaks so loud as to make his voice heard right
  across the court; and the wires of the telegraph are instantly put into
  requisition to flash the news to many homes, which it will fill either with
  rejoicing or with sorrow.</p>

  <p>And now for the four Second-year scholars, who have gained the honour of a
  scholarship their first time of trial, and whose success excites a still
  keener interest. They are read out in the accidental order of the first
  entering of their names in the college books.</p>

  <p>Silence! the Second-year scholars are&mdash;<i><b>Dudley Charles
  Owen</b></i>, (for the names are always read out at full length, Christian
  names and all); <i><b>Julian Home</b></i>; <i><b>Albert Henry Suton</b></i>;
  and it is a very astonishing fact, but the fourth is Hugh James
  Lillyston.</p>

  <p>Who would have believed it? Everybody expected Owen and Home to get
  scholarships their first time, and Suton was considered fairly safe of one;
  but that Kennedy should <i>not</i> have got one, and that Lillyston should,
  were facts perfectly amazing to all who heard them. Saint Werner&rsquo;s was
  full of surprise. But after all they might have expected it; Kennedy had been
  grossly idle, and Lillyston, who had been exceedingly industrious, was not
  only well-grounded at Harton in classics, but had recently developed a real
  and promising proficiency in mathematics; and it was this knowledge, joined
  to great good fortune in the examination, which had won for him the
  much-envied success.</p>

  <p>But not Kennedy?</p>

  <p>No. This result was enough most seriously to damp the intense delight
  which Julian otherwise felt in his own success, and that of his three
  friends.</p>

  <p>Julian, half-expecting that he would be successful, had come up with Owen
  early in the day, and received the news from the porter as he entered the
  college. Kennedy and Lillyston were not yet arrived, and Julian went to meet
  the coach from Roysley, hoping to see one of them at least for he was almost
  as anxious to break the disappointment gently to Kennedy, as he was to be the
  first to bear to his oldest school friend the surprising and delightful news
  of his success.</p>

  <p>They were <i>both</i> in the coach, and Julian was quite puzzled how to
  meet them. His vexation and delight alternated so rapidly as he looked from
  one to the other, that he felt exceedingly awkward, and would very much have
  preferred seeing either of them alone. Lillyston was incredulous; he insisted
  that there must be some mistake, until he actually saw the list with his own
  eyes. It was quite by accident, and not with any view of being sworn in as a
  scholar the next morning, that he had returned to Saint Werner&rsquo;s on
  that day at all. Kennedy bore the bitter, but not unexpected disappointment
  with silent stoicism, and showed an unaffected joy at the happy result which
  had crowned the honest exertions of his best-loved friends.</p>

  <p>He bore it in stoical silence, until he reached his own rooms; and then,
  do not blame him&mdash;my poor Kennedy&mdash;if he bowed his head upon his
  hands, and cried like a little child. There are times when the bravest man
  feels quite like a boy&mdash;feels as if he were unchanged since the day when
  he sorrowed for boyish trespasses, and was chidden for boyish faults. Kennedy
  was very young, and he was eating the fruits of folly and idleness in painful
  failure and hope deferred. In public he never showed the faintest signs of
  vexation, but in the loneliness of his closet do not blame him if he
  wept&mdash;for Violet&rsquo;s sake as well as for his own.</p>

  <p>So once more he was separated from Julian and Lillyston in hall and
  chapel, for they now sat at the scholars&rsquo; table and in the
  scholars&rsquo; seats.</p>

  <p>He was beginning to get over his feeling of sorrow when he received a
  letter, which did not need the coronet on the seal to show him that his
  correspondent was De Vayne. He opened it with eagerness and curiosity, and
  read&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;<i>Eaglestower, April</i> 30, 18&mdash;,
  <i>Argyllshire</i>.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;My Dear Kennedy&mdash;How long it is since we saw or
  heard of each other! I am getting well now, slowly but surely, and as I am
  amusing my leisure by reviving my old correspondence with my friends, let me
  write to you whom I reckon and shall ever reckon among that honoured
  number.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;I am afraid that you consider me to have been
  slightly alienated from you by the sad scene which your rooms witnessed when
  last we met in health, and by the connection into which your name was
  dragged, by popular rumour, with that unhappy affair. If such a thought has
  ever troubled you, let me pray that you will banish it. I have long since
  been sure that you would have been ready to suffer any calamity rather than
  expose me to the foreseen possibility of such an outrage.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;No, believe me, dear Kennedy, I am as much now as I
  always have been since I knew you, your sincere and affectionate friend. Nor
  will I conceal how deep an interest another circumstance has given me in your
  welfare. You perhaps did not know that I too loved your affianced Violet; how
  long, how deeply I can never utter to any living soul. I did not know that
  you had won her affections, and the information that such was the case, came
  on me like the death-knell of all my cherished hopes. But I have schooled
  myself now to the calm contemplation of my failure, and I can rejoice without
  envy in the knowledge, that in you she has won a lover richly endowed with
  all the qualities on which future happiness can depend.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;I write to you partly to say good-bye. In a
  fortnight I am going abroad, and shall not return until I feel that I have
  conquered a hopeless passion, and regained a shattered health. Farewell to
  dear Old Camford! I little thought that my career there would terminate as it
  did, but I trust in the full persuasion that God worketh all things for good
  to them who love Him.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Once more good-bye. When I return, I hope that I
  shall see leaning on your arm, a fair, a divine young bride.&mdash;Ever
  affectionately yours, De Vayne.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Kennedy had written home to announce that his name was <i>not</i> to be
  found in the list of Saint Werner&rsquo;s scholars. The information had
  disgusted his father exceedingly. Mr Kennedy, himself an old Wernerian, loved
  that royal foundation with an unchanging regard, and ever since that day
  Edward had been playing in his hall a pretty boy, he determined that he
  should be a Saint Werner&rsquo;s scholar at his first trial. He knew his
  son&rsquo;s abilities, and felt convinced that there must be some radical
  fault in his Camford life to produce such a disastrous series of failures and
  disgraces. Unable to gain any real information on the subject from
  Edward&rsquo;s letters, he determined to write up at once, and ask the
  classical and mathematical tutors the points in which his son was most
  deficient, and the reason of his continued want of success.</p>

  <p>The classical tutor, Mr Dalton, wrote back that Kennedy&rsquo;s failure
  was due solely to idleness; that his abilities were acknowledged to be
  brilliant, but that at Camford as everywhere else, the notion of success
  without industry, was a chimera invented by boastfulness and conceit.
  &ldquo;Le Gnie c&rsquo;est la Patience.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You seem, however,&rdquo; continued Mr Dalton, &ldquo;to be under
  the mistaken impression that your son read with me last term, and even
  &lsquo;read double.&rsquo; This is not the case, as he has ceased to read
  with me since the end of the Christmas term: I was sorry that he did so; for
  if economy was an object, I would gladly, merely for the sake of the interest
  I take in him, have afforded gratuitous assistance to so clever and promising
  a pupil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The letter of Mr Baer, the mathematical tutor, was precisely to the same
  effect. &ldquo;I can only speak,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;from what I observed
  of your son previous to last Christmas; since then I have not had the
  pleasure of numbering him among my pupils.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When Mr Dalton&rsquo;s letter came, Mr Kennedy was exceedingly perplexed
  to understand what it meant, and assumed that there must be some
  unaccountable mistake. He simply could not believe that his son could have
  asked him for the money on false pretences. But when Mr Baer&rsquo;s letter
  confirmed the fact that Kennedy had not been reading with a tutor either in
  classics or mathematics during the previous quarter, it seemed impossible for
  any one any longer to shut his eyes to the truth.</p>

  <p>When the real state of the case forced itself on Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s
  conviction, his affliction was so deep that no language can adequately
  describe what he suffered. In a few days his countenance became sensibly
  older-looking, and his hair more grey. His favourite and only surviving son
  had proved unworthy and base. Not only had he wasted time in frivolous
  company, but clearly he must have sunk very low to be guilty of a crime so
  heinous in itself, and so peculiarly wounding to a father&rsquo;s heart, as
  the one which it was plain that he had committed.</p>

  <p>At first Mr Kennedy could not trust himself to write, lest the anger and
  indignation which usurped the place of sorrow should lead him into a violence
  which might produce irreparable harm. Meanwhile, he bore in silence the blows
  which had fallen. Not even to his daughter Eva did he reveal the overwhelming
  secret of her brother&rsquo;s shame, but brooded in loneliness over the fair
  promise of the past, blighted utterly in the disgrace of the present. Often
  when he had looked at his young son, and seen how glorious and how happy his
  life might be, he had determined to shelter him from all evil, and endow him
  with means and opportunities for every success. He had looked to him as a
  pride and stay in declining manhood, and a comfort in old age. Edward Kennedy
  had been &ldquo;a child whom every eye that looked on loved,&rdquo; and now
  he was&mdash;; Mr Kennedy <i>could</i> not apply to him the only name which
  at once sprang up to his lips. He wrote&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Dear Edward,&mdash;When I tell you that it costs me
  an <i>effort</i>, a <i>strong</i> effort to call you &lsquo;dear,&rsquo; you
  may judge of the depth of my anger. I cannot trust myself, nor will I
  condescend to say much to you. Suffice it for you to know that your shameful
  transactions are detected, and that I am now aware of the means, the
  treacherous dishonest means you have adopted to procure money, which, since I
  give you an ample and liberal allowance, can only be wanted to pander to
  vice, idleness, and I know not what other forms of sin.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;I tell you that I do not know what to say; if you
  can act as you have acted, you must be quite deaf to expostulation, and dead
  to shame. You have done all you can to cover me and yourself with dishonour,
  and to bring down my grey hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Oh Edward, Edward! if I could have foreseen this in
  the days when you were yet a young and innocent and happy boy, I would have
  chosen rather that you should die.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;It must be a long time before you see my face again.
  I will not see you in the coming holidays, and I at once reduce your
  allowance to half of what it was. I cannot, and will not supply money to be
  wasted in extravagance and folly, nor shall I again be deceived into granting
  it to you on false pretences&mdash;Your indignant, deeply-sorrowing
  father,</p>

  <p class="letter">T. Kennedy.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Kennedy read the letter, and re-read it, and laid it down on the table
  beside his untouched breakfast. There was but one expression in his face, and
  that was misery, and in his soul no other feeling than that of hopeless
  shame.</p>

  <p>He did not, and could not write to his father. What was to be said? He
  must bear his burden&mdash;the <i>burden of detection and of
  punishment</i>&mdash;alone.</p>

  <p>And the thought of Violet added keener poignancy to all his grief. For
  Kennedy could not but observe that her letters were not so fondly,
  passionately loving as they once had been, and he knew that the fault was
  his, because his own letters reflected, like a broken mirror, the troubled
  images of his wandering heart.</p>

  <h2>XXVIII. &mdash; KENNEDY&rsquo;S DESPAIR</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;When all the blandishments from life are gone,<br>
  The coward slinks to death;&mdash;the brave live on!&rdquo;</i></p><br>

  <p class="first">OF all the sicknesses that can happen to the human soul, the
  deadliest and the most incurable is the feeling of despair&mdash;and this was
  the malady which now infected every vein of Kennedy&rsquo;s moral and
  intellectual life.</p>

  <p>Could he but have conquered his pride so far as to take but one person
  into his confidence, all might have been well. But Violet&mdash;could he ever
  tell Violet of sins which her noble heart must render so inconceivable as
  almost to make it impossible for her to sympathise with one who committed
  them? And Eva; could he ever wound the tender affection of his sweet sister,
  by revealing to her the disgrace of the brother whom, from her childhood, she
  had idolised? He sometimes thought that he would confess to Julian or
  Lillyston; but his courage failed him when the time came, and he fed on his
  own heart in solitude, avoiding the society of men.</p>

  <p>The sore burden of a self-reproaching spirit wore him down. He had fallen
  so often now, and swerved so often from the path of temperance, rectitude,
  and honour, that he began to regard himself as a hopeless reprobate&mdash;as
  one who had been weighed and found wanting&mdash;tested of God, and
  deliberately set aside.</p>

  <p>And so step by step the devil thrust him into desperation, and strove
  thereby to clinch the hopelessness of his estate. With wild fierce passion,
  Kennedy flung himself into sins he had never known before; angrily he laid
  waste the beauty and glory of the vineyard whose hedge had been broken down;
  a little entrance to the sanctuary had been opened to evil thoughts, and
  they, when once admitted, soon flung back wider and wider the golden gates,
  till the revelling band of worse wickednesses rushed in and defiled the
  altar, and trampled on the virgin floors, and defaced the cedarn walls with
  images of idolatry and picturings of sin. Because he had sunk into the slough
  of despond, he would be heedless of the mud that gathered on his garments.
  Was he not ruined already? Could anything much worse befall him than had
  befallen him already? No; he would sin on now and take his fill.</p>

  <p>It was a short period of his life; but in no other period did he suffer so
  much, or shake more fatally the foundations of all future happiness. It was
  emphatically a sin against his own soul, and as such it affected his very
  look. Those blue laughing eyes were clouded over, and the bloom died away
  from his cheeks, and the ingenuous beauty from his countenance, as the light
  of the Shechinah grew pale and dim in the inmost sanctuary. Kennedy was not
  mastered by impulse, but driven by despair.</p>

  <p>Nor did he take any precaution to shield himself from punishment&mdash;the
  punishment of outward circumstance and natural consequence&mdash;as his moral
  abasement proceeded. His acquaintances shunned him, his friends dropped away
  from him, and the guiltiness of the present received a tinge of deeper horror
  from the gloom of the future.</p>

  <p>All that could be done, Julian did. He warned, he expostulated, he
  reminded of purer and happier&mdash;of pure and happy days. But he did not
  know the bitter fountain of despondency whence flowed those naphthaline
  streams of passion. At last he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kennedy, I have not often spoken to you of my dear sister; it is
  time to speak of her now. Your conduct proves to me that you do not and
  cannot love her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy listened in silence; his face bowed down upon his hands.
  &ldquo;You <i>could</i> not go on as you are doing if you loved her, for love
  allows no meaner, no unhallowed fires to pollute her vestal flame. Your love
  must be a pretence&mdash;a thing of the past. It was only possible, Kennedy,
  when you were worthier than now you are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He groaned deeply, but still said nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Kennedy,&rdquo; continued Julian, &ldquo;I have loved you as a
  friend, as a brother; I love you still most earnestly, and you must not be
  too much pained at what I say; but I have come to a determination which I
  must tell you, and by which I must abide. Your engagement with Violet must
  cease.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does <i><b>she</b></i> say so?&rdquo; he asked in a hollow
  voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, she does not know, Kennedy, what I know of you; but she will
  trust my deep affection, and know that I act solely for her good. The blow
  may almost kill her, but better that she should die than that her life should
  be ever connected&mdash;oh, that you should have driven me to say
  it&mdash;with one so stained as yours!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aye!&rdquo; said Kennedy bitterly, &ldquo;stab hard, for the knife
  is in your hand. Fling dust on those who are down already&mdash;it is the
  world&rsquo;s way. I see through it all, Julian Home; you would gladly get
  rid of me, that Violet may wear a coronet. No comparison between a penniless
  and ruined undergraduate, and a handsome, rich young viscount.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Unjust! ungenerous!&rdquo; answered Julian, with indignation;
  &ldquo;you have poisoned your own true heart, Kennedy, or you would not utter
  the lie which you must disbelieve. Edward Kennedy, I will not attempt to
  rebut your unworthy suspicions; you know neither my character nor
  Violet&rsquo;s, or you would not have dared to utter them. No&mdash;it is
  clearer to me than ever that you are no fit suitor for my sister. Passion and
  weakness have dragged you very low. I trust and pray that you may recover
  yourself again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A sudden rush of tears came to his eyes as he turned away to leave his
  earliest and best-loved college friend. But Kennedy stopped him, and said
  wildly&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stop, Julian Home, you shall hear me speak. I can hardly believe
  that you do this of your own responsibility&mdash;without
  Violet&rsquo;s&mdash;nay, nay, I must not call her so&mdash;without your
  sister&rsquo;s consent. And if this be so, hear me. Tell her that I scorn the
  heart which would thus fling away its plighted love: tell her that she has
  committed a great sin in thus rejecting me: tell her that <i>she</i> is now
  responsible for all my future,&mdash;that whatever errors I may fall into,
  whatever sins I may commit, whatever disgrace or ruin I may incur, <i>she</i>
  is the author of them. Tell her that if I ever live to do ungenerous acts, or
  ever yield to bursts of foolish passion, the acts are hers, not mine;
  <i>she</i> will have caused them; my life lies at her feet. Tell her this
  before it is too late. What? you still wish to hurry away? Go, then.&rdquo;
  He almost pushed Julian out, and banged the door after him.</p>

  <p>Amazed at this paroxysm of wrath and madness, Julian went down-stairs with
  a slow step and a heavy, heavy heart; above all, he dreaded the necessity of
  breaking to Violet the heart-rending intelligence of his decision, and the
  circumstances which caused it. He trembled to do it, for he knew not how
  crushing the weight might prove. At last he determined to write to his
  mother, and to beg her to bear for him the pain of telling that which her
  womanly tact and maternal sympathy might make less overwhelming to be
  borne.</p>

  <p>But Kennedy, after Julian&rsquo;s words, rushed out of his rooms, and it
  was night. He left the college, and wandered into the fields&mdash;he knew
  not whither, nor with what intent.</p>

  <p>His brain was on fire. The last gleam that lent brightness to his life had
  been extinguished; the friend whom he loved best had cast him off; his name
  was sullied; his love rejected. It was not <i>thought</i> which kept him in a
  tumult, but only a physical consciousness of dreadful, irremediable calamity;
  and but for the wind which blew so coldly and savagely in his face, and the
  rain that soaked his clothes and cooled the fever of his forehead, he feared
  that he might go mad.</p>

  <p>He did not return to the college till long past midnight; and the old
  porter, as he got out of bed to open the gate, could not help saying to him
  in a tone of reproach&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr Kennedy, sir&mdash;excuse me, sir&mdash;but these are bad
  ways.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The words were lost upon him: he went up to his room, and threw himself,
  without taking off his clothes, upon his bed. No sleep came to him, and in
  the morning&mdash;damp, weary, and feverish as he had been&mdash;his look was
  inexpressibly pitiable and haggard.</p>

  <p>The imperious demands of health forced him to take some notice of his
  condition; and he was about to put on clean clothes, and take some warm tea
  about ten in the morning, when the Master&rsquo;s servant came to tell him
  that the Seniority desired his presence.</p>

  <p>He at once knew that it must be for his irregularity of the previous
  night, which, in the agitation of other thoughts, had not occurred to him
  before. He remembered, too, that the Senior Dean had only recently threatened
  him that, in consequence of his late misdoings, the next offence would be
  visited with summary and final punishment.</p>

  <p>Kennedy received rather hard treatment at the hand of the Senior Dean, who
  was a very worthy and excellent man, but so firm and punctilious that he
  could neither conceive nor tolerate the existence of beings less precise in
  their nature than himself. Kind and well-intentioned, he was utterly unfit
  for the guidance of young men, because he was totally deficient in those
  invaluable qualities&mdash;sympathy and tact. He had early taken a dislike to
  Kennedy, in consequence of some very harmless frivolities of his
  freshman&rsquo;s year. Kennedy, in his frolicsome and happy moods, had, in
  ways, childish, perhaps, but completely harmless, offended the sensitive
  dignity of the college official, and these trivial eccentricities the Dean
  regarded as heinous faults&mdash;the symptoms of a reckless and irreverent
  character. There was one particular transaction which gave him more than
  usual offence, in which Kennedy, hearing a very absurd story at a don&rsquo;s
  party, while the Dean was present, parodied it with such exquisite humour and
  such complete command of countenance, that all the other men, in spite of the
  official presence, had indecorously broken into fits of laughter. It is a
  great pity when rulers and teachers take such terrible fright at little
  outbreaks of mere animal and boyish spirits.</p>

  <p>The Dean was inclined therefore from the first to take the most serious
  view of Kennedy&rsquo;s proceedings, even when they were not as questionable
  as recently they had been. Instead of trying to enter into a young
  man&rsquo;s feelings and temptations with consideration and forbearance, the
  Dean regarded them from a moral watchtower of unapproachable altitude, and
  hence to him the errors which he was sometimes obliged to punish were not
  regarded as human failings, but as monstrous and inexplicable phenomena. He
  could not in the least understand Kennedy; he only looked at him as a wild,
  and objectionable, and irregular young man; while Kennedy reciprocated his
  pity by a hardly-concealed contempt.</p>

  <p>So, as Kennedy took cap and gown, and walked across the court to the
  combination-room, he became pretty well aware that a very heavy sentence was
  hanging over his head. He cared little for it; nothing that Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s or its authorities could do, would wound him half so deeply as
  what he was already suffering, or cause the iron to rankle more painfully in
  his soul. He felt as a man who is in a dream.</p>

  <p>He stood before them with a look of utter vacancy and listlessness, the
  result partly of physical weariness, partly of complete indifference. He was
  aware that the Dean, undisturbed this time, was haranguing him to his
  heart&rsquo;s content, but he had very little notion of what he was saying.
  At last his ear caught the question&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you any explanation to offer of your conduct, Mr
  Kennedy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He betrayed how little he had been attending by the reply&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What conduct, sir?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Dean ruffled his plumage, and said with asperity&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your conduct last night, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was wandering in the fields, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wandering in the fields!&rdquo; In the Dean&rsquo;s formal and
  regular mind such a proceeding was wholly unintelligible; fancy a sensible
  member of a college wandering in the fields on a wet stormy night past twelve
  o&rsquo;clock! &ldquo;Really, Mr Kennedy, you must excuse us, but we can
  hardy accept so fantastic an explanation; we can hardly believe that you had
  no ulterior designs.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy was bothered and fretful; he was not thinking of Deans or Seniors
  just then; his thoughts were reverting to his father&rsquo;s implacable
  anger, and to Julian&rsquo;s forbidding him to hope for the love of Violet
  Home. Weary of the talking, and careless of explaining anything to them, and
  with a short return of his old contempt, he wished to cut short the
  discussion, and merely said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help what you accept or what you believe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Seniors had a little discussion among themselves, in which the opinion
  of Mr Norton appeared to be over-borne by the majority of votes, and then the
  Senior Dean said shortly&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr Kennedy, we have come to the decision that it is undesirable for
  you to remain at Saint Werner&rsquo;s at present, until you have mended your
  ways, and taken a different view of the duties and responsibilities of
  college life. You are rusticated for a year. You must leave to-
  morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Kennedy bowed and left the room. He, too, had been coming to a decision,
  and one that rendered all minor ones a matter of no consequence to him.
  During all the wet, and feverish, and sleepless night he had been determining
  what to do, and the event of this morning confirmed him still further. He was
  rusticated for a year; where could he go? Not to his father and his home,
  where every eye would look on him as a disgraced and characterless man; not
  to any of his relations or friends, who would regard him perhaps as a shame
  and burden;&mdash;no, there was but one home for him, and that was the long
  home, undisturbed beneath the covering of the grave.</p>

  <p>The burden and mystery of life lay heavily on him&mdash;its lasting
  calamities and vanishing joys, its trials and disappointments. He would try
  whether, in a new state of life, the same distorted individuality was a
  necessary possession. Would it be necessary there also to live two lives in
  one, to have a soul, within whose precincts curse wrestled with blessing,
  good with evil, and life with death? As life went with him then, he would
  rather escape from it even into annihilation; he groaned under it, and in
  spite of all he had heard or read, he had no fear whatever of the
  after-death. If he had <i>any</i> feeling about <i>that</i>, it was a feeling
  of curiosity alone. He could not wholly condemn himself: he felt that however
  much evil might have mastered him good was the truest and most distinctive
  element of his being. He loved it even when he abandoned it, and yielded
  himself to sin. He could not believe that for these frailties, he would be
  driven into an existence of unmitigated pain.</p>

  <p>He had no fear, no shadow of fear of the state of death, for he forgot
  that he would carry himself, his unchanged being&mdash;Conscience, Habit and
  Memory&mdash;into the other world. What he dreaded was the spasm of
  dying&mdash;the convulsion that was to snap the thousand silver strings in
  the harp of life. This he shuddered at, but he consoled himself that it would
  be over in a moment.</p>

  <p>He took no food that day, but wrote to his father, to Eva, to Julian,
  Violet, and De Vayne. He told them his purpose, and prayed their forgiveness
  for all the wrongs he had done them. And then there seemed no more to do.
  With weak unsteady steps he paced his room, and looked at the old Swiss
  chamois-gun above the door. He took it down and handled it. It was a coarse
  clumsy weapon, and he could not trust it to effect his purpose. Shunning
  observation, he walked by back streets and passages until he came to a
  gunsmith&rsquo;s shop, where he bought a large pistol, under pretence of
  wanting it for the purposes of travel.</p>

  <p>He carried it home himself, but instead of returning straight to his
  rooms, he was tempted to stroll for a last time about the grounds. The
  delightful softness of the darkening air on that spring evening, and the
  cheerful gleam of lamps leaping up here and there between the trees, and
  flickering on the quiet river, enticed him up the glorious old entwined
  avenue into the shadow of the great oaks beyond, until he found himself
  leaning between the weeping willows over the bridge of Merham Hall, looking
  on the still grey poetic towers, and the three motionless reposing swans, and
  the gloaming of the west. And so, still thinking, thinking, thinking, he
  slowly wandered home.</p>

  <p>As he had determined to commit suicide that night, it mattered little to
  him at what hour it was done, and opening the first book on the table, he
  tried to kill time until it grew later and darker. The book happened to be a
  Bible, and conscious how much it jarred with his present frame of mind, and
  his guilty purpose, he threw it down again; <i>but not until his eye had
  caught the words</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i><b>AND HE SAW THE ANGEL OF THE LORD STANDING IN THE
  WAY</b></i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The verse haunted him against his will, till he half shuddered at the dim
  light which the moon made, as it struggled through the curtains only
  partially drawn, into the quaint old room. He would delay no longer, and
  loaded the pistol with a dreadful charge, which should not fail of carrying
  death.</p>

  <p>Some fancy seized him to put out the lights, and then with a violent
  throbbing at the heart, and a wild prayer for God&rsquo;s mercy at that
  terrible hour, he took the pistol in his hand.</p>

  <p>At that very instant,&mdash;when there was hardly the motion of a
  hair&rsquo;s breadth between him and fate,&mdash;what was it that startled
  his attention, and caused his hand to drop, and fixed him there with open
  mouth and wild gaze, and caused him to shiver like the leaves of the acacia
  in a summer wind?</p>

  <p>Right before him,&mdash;half hidden by the window curtains, and half
  drawing them back,&mdash;clear and distinct he saw the spirit of his dead
  mother with uplifted finger and sad reproachful eyes fixed upon her son. The
  countenance so sorrowfully beautiful, the long bright gleaming of the white
  robe, the tresses floating down over the shoulders like a golden veil, for
  one instant he saw them, not dim and shadowy like the fading outlines of a
  dream, but with all the marked full character of living vision.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh mother, mother!&rdquo; he whispered, as he stretched out his
  hands, and sank trembling upon his knees, and bowed his head; but as he
  raised his head again, there was nothing there; only the glimmer of lamps
  about the court, and the pale moonlight streaming through the curtains,
  partly drawn, into the quaint old room.</p>

  <p>Unable to trust himself with the murderous weapon in his hand even for a
  moment, yet swept from his evil purpose by the violent reflux of new and
  better thoughts, he fired the pistol into the air. The barrel, enormously
  overloaded, burst in the discharge, and uttering a cry, he fell fainting,
  with his right hand shattered, to the ground.</p>

  <p>His cry and the loud report of the explosion raised the alarm, and as the
  men rushed up and forced open the door of his room, they found him weltering
  in his blood upon the floor.</p>

  <h2>XXIX. &mdash; EVA ENTERS THE CHAPEL</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;I took it for a fary vision<br>
  Of some bright creatures of the element,<br>
  That in the colours of the rainbow live<br>
  And play i&rsquo; the plighted clouds; I was awe-struck,<br>
  And, as I passed, I worshipped.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Comus.</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE long, long illness that followed, and the weary time
  which it took to heal the mutilated hand, proved the greatest blessings that
  could have befallen the weak and erring heart of Edward Kennedy. They spared
  him the necessity of that heart-rending meeting with those whom he best
  loved, the dread of which had been the most powerful incitement to urge upon
  him the thought of suicide. They gave him time to look before and
  after&mdash;they relieved the painful tension of his overwrought
  mind&mdash;they calmed him with the necessity for quiet thought and deep rest
  after the anguish and turmoil of the bygone months.</p>

  <p>When he awoke to consciousness, Eva was sitting by his bedside in the
  sick-room. Slowly the well-remembered objects and the beloved face broke
  upon his recollection, but at first he could remember nothing more, nor
  connect the strange present with the excited past. Still more slowly&mdash;as
  when one breaks the azure sleep of some unruffled mountain mere by the
  skimming of a stone, and for a long time the clear images of blue sky, and
  wreathing cloud, and green mountain-top, are shaken and confused on the
  tremulous and twinkling wave, but unite together into the old picture when
  the water has recovered its glassy smoothness&mdash;so still more slowly did
  Kennedy&rsquo;s troubled memory reflect the incidents, (alas! unbeautiful and
  threatening incidents), of the preceding days. They came back to him as he
  lay there quite still; and then he groaned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush! dearest Edward,&rdquo; said Eva, who had watched his face,
  and guessed from its expressive workings the progress of his thoughts;
  &ldquo;hush, we are with you, and all is going on well. Your hand is
  healing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He found that his right hand was tightly and firmly bandaged, and kept
  still by a splint.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was it much hurt? Shall I recover the use of it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, almost certainly, Dr Leesby says. I will tell papa that you
  are awake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he very, very angry?&rdquo; asked poor Kennedy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has forgiven all, dear,&rdquo; she said, kissing his forehead.
  &ldquo;It was all very dreadful,&rdquo;&mdash;and a cold shiver ran over
  her&mdash;&ldquo;but none of us will ever allude to it again. Banish it from
  your thoughts, Eddy; we will leave Camford as soon as you can be
  moved.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She went to fetch her father, and as he came in and leant fondly over his
  son&rsquo;s sick-bed, and grasped warmly his unwounded hand, tears of
  afflicting memory coursed each other fast down the old man&rsquo;s cheeks. He
  had been hard, too hard upon Edward; perhaps his severity had driven him of
  late into such bad courses, and to the brink of such an awful and disgraceful
  end; perhaps if he had been kinder, gentler, more sympathising for this first
  offence, he might have been saved the anguish of driving his poor boy to
  lower and wilder depths of sin and sorrow. It was all over now; and amid the
  apparent wreck of all his hopes, even after the death-blows which recent
  events had dealt to his old pride in his noble child, he yet regarded him as
  he lay there&mdash;wounded and in such a way&mdash;with all the pity of a
  Christian&rsquo;s forgiveness, with all the fondness of a father&rsquo;s
  love.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, father, I have suffered unspeakably. If God ever raises me to
  health and strength again, I vow with all my heart to serve Him as I have
  never done before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Edward, I trust and believe it; think no more of the past; let
  the dead bury their dead. The golden present is before you, and you will have
  two friends who never desert the brave man&mdash;your Maker and
  yourself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A silence followed, and then Eva said, &ldquo;I have just seen Dr Leesby,
  Eddy, and he says that if you are now quite yourself, and the light-
  headedness has ceased, you may be moved on Monday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And to-day is?&mdash;I have lost all count of time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To-day is Saturday. Won&rsquo;t it be charming, dear, to find
  ourselves once more at home; quietly at home, with no one but ourselves, and
  our own love to make us happy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And what am I to do, Eva?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Eddy; sufficient for the day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does she know, Eva? Do you ever hear from her now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, often&mdash;but do not think too much of those things just
  yet.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And Julian?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has often come to ask after you,&rdquo; she said blushing,
  &ldquo;but he is afraid to see you, lest it should do you harm just
  now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is right. We are not all enemies, then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Enemies with Julian and Violet? <i>Oh no</i>.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Though the engagement of Kennedy with Violet had been broken off by the
  common desire of Julian and Mr Kennedy, the two families still continued
  their affectionate intercourse, and bewailed the sad necessity which drove
  them to a step so painful, yet so unavoidably required by the welfare of all
  concerned. And from the first they hoped that all might yet be well, while
  some among them began to fancy that if Kennedy and Violet should ever be
  united, it would not be the only close bond between hearts already full of
  mutual affection.</p>

  <p>So Julian still came daily during Kennedy&rsquo;s illness to see Eva and
  Mr Kennedy, and to inquire after the sufferer&rsquo;s health. And sometimes
  he took them for a walk in the grounds or the immediate neighbourhood of
  Camford, a place which they had never visited before, and which to them was
  full of interest.</p>

  <p>Eva had often heard of the glories of Saint Werner&rsquo;s chapel, and on
  the Sunday she asked Julian if it would be possible for her to go with her
  father to the evening service there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;certainly. I will get one of the
  Fellows to take you in. It is a remarkable sight, and I think you ought to
  go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Sunday evening came, and Julian escorted them to the ante-chapel, and
  showed them the various sculptures and memorials of mighty names. They then
  waited by the door till some Fellow whom Julian knew should pass into the
  chapel to escort them to a vacant place in the Fellows&rsquo; seats.</p>

  <p>Saint Werner&rsquo;s Chapel consists of a single aisle, along the floor of
  which are placed rows of benches for the undergraduates; raised above these
  to a height of three steps are the long seats appropriated to the scholars
  and the Bachelors of Arts; and again, two steps above these are the seats of
  the Fellows and Masters of Arts, together with room for such casual strangers
  as may chance to be admitted. In the centre of these long rows, on either
  side, are the places for the choristers, men and boys, and the lofty thrones
  whence the Deans &ldquo;look down with sleepless eyes upon the world.&rdquo;
  By the door on either side are the red-curtained and velvet-cushioned seats
  of the Master and Vice-master, beyond whom sit the noblemen and
  fellow-commoners. By the lectern and reading-desk is a step of black and
  white marble, which extends to the altar, on which are two candlesticks of
  massive silver; and over them some beautiful carved oaken work covers a great
  painting, flanked on either side by old gilded pictures of the Saviour and
  the Madonna. Imagine this space all lighted from wall to wall by wax candles,
  and at the end by large lamps which shed a brighter and softer light, and
  imagine it filled, if you can, by five hundred men in snowy surplices, and
  you have a faint fancy of the scene which broke on the eyes of Mr Kennedy and
  Eva, as they passed between the statues of the ante-chapel, and under the
  pealing organ into the inner sanctuary of Saint Werner&rsquo;s chapel.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Could they behold&mdash;<br>
  Who, less insensible than sodden clay<br>
  In a sea river&rsquo;s bed at ebb of tide&mdash;<br>
  Could have beheld with undelighted heart<br>
  So many happy youths, so wide and fair<br>
  A congregation in its budding-time<br>
  Of health, and hope, and beauty, all at once<br>
  So many divers samples from the growth<br>
  Of life&rsquo;s sweet season&mdash;could have seen unmoved<br>
  That miscellaneous garland of wild flowers,<br>
  Decking the matron temples of a place,<br>
  So famous through the world?&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>It was Mr Norton whom Julian caught hold of as an escort for his friends
  into the chapel. I well remember, (who that saw it does not?) that entrance.
  It was rather late; the organ was playing a grand overture, the men were all
  in their seats, and the service just going to begin, when Eva entered leaning
  on Mr Norton&rsquo;s arm, and followed by her father and Julian. Many of the
  Saint Werner&rsquo;s men had seen her walking in the grounds the last day or
  two, and as Kennedy&rsquo;s sister a peculiar interest attached to her just
  then. But she needed no such accidental source of interest to attract the
  liveliest attention of such keen and warm enthusiasts for beauty as the
  Camford undergraduates. Ladies are comparatively rare apparitions in that
  semi-monastic body of scholars; and ladies both young and lovely are rare
  indeed. So as Eva entered, so young and so fair, the bright and graceful and
  beautiful Eva&mdash;with that exquisite rose-tinge which the air of
  Orton-on-the-Sea had given her, and the folded softness of the tresses which
  flowed down beside her perfect face, and the light of beaming eyes seen like
  jewels under her long eyelashes as she bent her glance upon the
  ground&mdash;as Eva entered, I say, leaning on Mr Norton&rsquo;s arm, and
  touched, with the floating of her pale silk dress, the surplices of the Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s men as they sat on either side down the narrow passage, it was
  no wonder that every single eye from that of the Senior Dean (Pace Decani
  dixerim!) to that of the little chorister boy was turned upon her for an
  instant, as she passed up to the only vacant seats, and Mr Norton caused room
  to be made for her beside the tutor&rsquo;s cushion by the chaplain&rsquo;s
  desk. She was happily unconscious of the admiration, and the perfect
  simplicity of her sweet girlish unconsciousness added a fresh charm to the
  whole grace of her manner and appearance. Only by the slightest possible
  blush did she show her sense of her unusual position as the cynosure for the
  admiring gaze of five hundred English youths; and that too though the dark
  and handsome countenance of Mr Norton glowed visibly with a brighter colour,
  (as though he were conscious of the thought respecting him, which darted
  across many an undergraduate&rsquo;s mind), and even the face of Julian, as
  he walked to the scholars&rsquo; seats among the familiar ranks of his
  compeers, was flushed with the crimson of a sensitiveness which he would fain
  have hidden.</p>

  <p>And I cannot help it, if even during the noble service&mdash;even amid the
  sound &ldquo;Of solemn psalms and silver litanies,&rdquo; the eyes of many
  men wandered towards a sweet face, and gazed upon it as they might have gazed
  upon a flower, and if the thoughts of many men were absorbed unwontedly in
  other emotions than those of prayer; nor can I help it if Julian was one of
  those whose eyes and thoughts were so employed.</p>

  <p>What an evening star she was! And how her very presence filled all hearts
  with a livelier sense of happiness and hope, and sweet pure yearnings for
  wedded calm and bridal love! But she&mdash;innocent young Eva&mdash;little
  knew of the sensation she had caused by the rare beauty of her blossoming
  womanhood. <i>Her</i> whole heart was in the act of worship, except when it
  wandered for a moment to her poor sick Eddy, whom they had left alone, or for
  another moment to one whom she could not but see before her in the
  scholars&rsquo; seats. She did not know that men were looking at her, as she
  raised her clear warbling voice amid the silvery trebles of the choir, and
  uttered with all the expressiveness of genuine emotion those strains of
  poetry and passion which thrilled from the heart to the harp of the
  warrior-prophet and poet-king. And never did truer prayers come from a
  woman&rsquo;s lips than those which her heart offered as her head was bowed
  that night.</p>

  <p>The service was over, and the congregation streamed out. That evening the
  ante-chapel was fuller than usual of men, who stayed nominally to hear the
  organ; but besides those musical souls, who always linger to hear the
  voluntary, or to talk in little groups, there were others who, on that
  pretence, waited to catch another glimpse&mdash;a last glimpse of eyes whose
  deep and lovely colour had flowed into their souls. They were disappointed
  though, for Eva dropped her veil. With a graceful bow to Mr Norton, which he
  returned with courteous dignity, she took Julian&rsquo;s proffered arm, and
  walked out into the court, her father following. A proud man was Julian that
  evening, and the subject of kindly envy to not a few.</p>

  <p>But that little incident&mdash;the many eyes that had seen his
  treasure&mdash;determined Julian to take the step which he had long decided
  upon in his secret heart. He was half-jealous of the open, unconcealed
  admiration which Eva had excited, and it made him fear lest another should
  approach the object of his love, and occupy a place in the heart which he had
  not even demanded as his own. He was positively in a hurry. What if some
  undergraduate should get an introduction to Eva&mdash;some gay and handsome
  Adonis&mdash;and should suddenly carry away her heart?</p>

  <p>So when Mr Kennedy went into the sick-room to read to Edward the lessons
  for the day, and Julian stayed with Eva in the sitting-room, he drew his
  chair beside hers, and they began to talk about Saint Werner&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think you shall ever be a Fellow, Julian? I should so like
  you to be?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And if I am, I shall hope very soon to exchange it for a happier
  fellowship, Eva.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She wouldn&rsquo;t see what he meant, so he said, &ldquo;Eva, shall I read
  to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I should like it so much; I used to
  enjoy so much the poetry we read at Grindelwald.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took down Coleridge&rsquo;s poems from the shelf, and read&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;All thoughts, all passions, all delights,<br>
  Whatever stirs this mortal frame,<br>
  Are all but ministers of love,<br>
  And feed his sacred flame.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>He went on, watching her colour change with the musical variations of his
  voice, until he came to the verse&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;I told her how he pined,&mdash;and ah<br>
  The deep, the low, the pleading tone<br>
  In which I sang another&rsquo;s love<br>
  Interpreted my own.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>He saw her breast heaving with agitation, and throwing away the book, he
  bent down beside her, and looked up into her deep eyes, and said, &ldquo;Oh,
  Eva, what need of concealment? You have read it long ago, have you not? I
  love you, Eva, love you so passionately&mdash;you cannot tell the depth of my
  love. Do you return it, Eva?&rdquo; he said as he gained possession of her
  hand.</p>

  <p>She had won him then&mdash;the dream of her latter life. This was the
  noble Julian kneeling at her side. She trembled for very joy, and
  whispered&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, Julian, Julian, do you not see that I loved you
  from the first day we met?&rdquo; She regretted the speech the next moment,
  as though it had been wanting in maidenly reserve, but it was the first warm
  natural utterance of her heart; and Julian sprang up in an ecstasy of joy,
  and as she rose he claimed as his due a lover&rsquo;s kiss.</p>

  <p>She blushed crimson, but suffered him to sit down beside her; and they
  sat, hardly knowing anything but the great fact that they loved each other,
  till Mr Kennedy&rsquo;s voice had ceased in the adjoining room, and he came
  in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, there you are,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Edward is sinking to
  sleep. How good of you to be so quiet!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They rose up, and Julian led her to him with her hand in his, and his arm
  supporting her. &ldquo;Mr Kennedy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am going to ask
  you for the most priceless jewel you possess.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What? Is it indeed so? Ah, you wicked Julian, do not rob me of Eva
  yet. She is too young; and now that Edward seems likely to be ill so
  long&mdash;ah, me! I am bereaved of my children. Well, well, I suppose it
  must be so. Come here, darling, to the old father you are going to desert; I
  daresay Julian won&rsquo;t grudge me one kiss.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He kissed her tenderly, and she clung about his neck as she whispered,
  &ldquo;But it will not be yet for a long long time, papa.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What youth calls long, my Eva; but not long for those who are
  walking into the shadow down the hill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>O happy, happy lovers! how gloriously that night did the stars shine out
  for you in the deep, unfathomable galaxies of heaven, and the dew fall, and
  the moon dawn into a sky yet flushed with the long-unfading purple of the
  fading day! Yet there was sadness mixed with their happiness as they heard,
  until they parted, the plaintive murmurs of Kennedy&rsquo;s fitful sleep, and
  thought of all the sufferings of their brother, and how nearly, how very
  nearly, he had been hurried from the midst of them by self-inflicted
  death.</p>

  <h2>XXX. &mdash; REPENTANCE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;This world will not believe a man repents,<br>
  And this wise world of ours is mainly right<br>
  For seldom does a man repent, and use<br>
  Both grace and will to pick the vicious quitch<br>
  Of blood and nature wholly out of him,<br>
  And make all clean, and plant himself afresh.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Tennyson&rsquo;s <i>Idylls</i>.</p><br>

  <p class="first">BEAUTIFUL Orton-on-the-Sea! Who that has been there does not
  long to return there again and again, and gaze on the green and purple of its
  broad bay, and its one little islet, and the golden sands that stretch along
  its winding shore, and its glens clothed with fir trees and musical with the
  voice of many rills?</p>

  <p>It was there that Kennedy had lived from childhood, and it was there that
  he now returned to spend at home the year of his rustication. They arrived at
  home on the Monday evening, and from that time forward Kennedy rapidly gained
  health and strength, and was able to move about again, though his hand healed
  but slowly, and it took months to enable him to use it without pain.</p>

  <p>On that little islet of the bay was Kennedy&rsquo;s favourite haunt. It
  was a place where the top of a low cliff was sheltered by a clump of trees
  which formed a natural bower, from whence he would gaze untired for hours on
  the rising and falling of the tide. A little orphan cousin whom Mr Kennedy
  had adopted, used to row him over to this retirement, and while the boy
  stayed in their little boat, and fished, or hunted for seabirds&rsquo; nests
  in the undisturbed creeks and inlets, Kennedy with some volume of the poets
  in his hand, would rest under the waving branches, and gaze upon the glancing
  waves.</p>

  <p>And at times, when, like a great glowing globe, the sun sank, after the
  fiery heat of some burning summer day, into the crimsoned waters, and filled
  the earth, and the heavens, and the sea with silent splendours, a deep
  feeling of solemnity, such as he had never before experienced, would steal
  over Kennedy&rsquo;s mind. He could not but remember, that, but for
  God&rsquo;s special grace thwarting the nearly-accomplished purpose of his
  sin, the eyes which were filled with such indescribable visions of glory,
  would have been closed in death, and the brow on which the sea-wind was
  beating in such cool and refreshful perfume would have been crumbling under
  the clammy sod. Surely it must be for some great thing that his life had been
  saved: it was his own no longer; it must be devoted to mighty purposes of
  love and toil. Kennedy began to long for some work of danger and suffering as
  his portion upon earth: he longed ambitiously for the wanderings of the
  apostle and the crown of the martyr. The good deeds of a conventional piety,
  the quiet routine of a commonplace benevolence seemed no meet or adequate
  employment for his highly-wrought mind. No, he would sail to another world;
  there he would join a new colony in clearing away the primeval depths of some
  virgin forest, and tilling the glebes of a rich and untried soil; and, living
  among them, he would make that place a centre for wide
  evangelisation&mdash;the home of religious enthusiasms and equal laws; or he
  would go as a missionary to the savage and the cannibal, and, sailing from
  reef to reef, where the coral-islands of the Pacific mirror in the deep
  waters of their calm lagoon the reed-huts of the savage, and the feathery
  coronal of tropic trees, he would devote his life to reclaiming from
  ignorance and barbarism the waste places of a degraded humanity.</p>

  <p>Such were the visions and purposes that floated through his
  mind&mdash;partly the fantastic fancies of dreamy hours, partly the
  unconscious desire to fly from a land which reminded him too painfully of
  vanished hopes, and from a scene which had been the witness of his error and
  disgrace. Perhaps, most of all, he was influenced by the desire to escape
  from a house which constantly recalled the image of a lost love&mdash;a lost
  love that he never hoped to regain; for Kennedy thought&mdash;though but
  little had been said about it&mdash;that Violet had deliberately and finally
  rejected him in scorn for the courses he had followed.</p>

  <p>But he wished, before he quite made up his mind as to his future career,
  to see Violet once more, and bid her a last farewell. Not daring to write and
  announce his intention lest she should refuse to meet him again, and
  unwilling to trust his secret to any of her family, he determined to see her
  by surprise, and enjoy for one last hour the unspeakable happiness of sitting
  by her side.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am well now, or nearly well will
  you let me go on a little journey?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A journey?&mdash;where? We will all go together, Edward, if you
  want any change of air and scene.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head. &ldquo;You can guess,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;where I
  wish to go for the last time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But do you think you can travel alone, Eddy, with your poor wounded
  hand?&rdquo; asked Eva.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes; the splints keep it safe, and I shall only be two days or
  so away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They suffered him to fulfil his whim, although they felt that if he saw
  Violet, the meeting could hardly fail to be full of pain.</p>

  <p>It was deep in autumn when he started, and arriving at Ildown, took up his
  abode in the little village inn. He kept himself as free from observation as
  he could, and begged the landlady, who recognised him, not to mention his
  arrival to any one. She had seen him on his former visit, and remembered
  favourably his genial good-humour and affable bearing. He told her frankly
  that he had come to say good-bye to Miss Home, whom he might not see again;
  but he did not wish to go to the house&mdash;could the landlady tell him
  anything about their movements?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes; I do happen to know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I
  suppose there can&rsquo;t be no harm in telling you, for I heard Master Cyril
  say as how they were all a-going a-gipseying to-morrow in the wood near the
  King&rsquo;s Oak.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And when do you think they will start?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll start at ten, sir, in the morning, for I&rsquo;m
  a-going to lend &rsquo;em my little trap to carry the perwisions in, and
  that.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This would suit Kennedy capitally, and musing on the meeting of the
  morrow, he sank into a doze in the armchair. A whispering awoke him, and he
  was far from reassured by overhearing the following colloquy:&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who be that in the parlour?&rdquo; asked a rustic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the young gentleman as wer&rsquo; Miss
  Violet&rsquo;s sweetheart,&rdquo; said the barmaid confidentially;
  &ldquo;nobody don&rsquo;t know of it, but I heard the Missus a-saying
  so.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why bean&rsquo;t he at the house then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, ye know, he ain&rsquo;t her sweetheart no longer; there&rsquo;s
  been a muddle somehow, and they do say as how he shot hisself, but he
  don&rsquo;t seem to be shot much now, to look at &rsquo;im. He&rsquo;s as
  likely and proper a young gentleman as I&rsquo;ve seen for a long
  time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Taking his candle wearily, Kennedy listened to no more of the
  conversation, and went to bed. His bedroom window looked towards the pleasant
  house and garden of Mrs Home, and he did not lie down till he had seen the
  light extinguished in the embowered window of Violet&rsquo;s room. Next
  morning he got up betimes, and after dressing himself with the utmost pain
  and difficulty, for he did not like to ask for the assistance which he always
  had at home since his illness, he went down to breakfast. Hardly touching the
  dainties which the hospitable old landlady had provided, he strolled off to
  the wood, almost before Ildown was a-stir, and sat down in a place, not far
  from the King&rsquo;s Oak, in a green hollow, where he was sheltered from
  sight by the broad tree trunks, and the tall and graceful ferns.</p>

  <p>He had not long to wait, and the time so spent would have been happy if
  agitation had not prevented him from enjoying the glories of the scene.
  Nowhere was &ldquo;the gorgeous and melancholy beauty of the sunlit autumnal
  landscape more bounteously displayed.&rdquo; The grand old trees all round
  him were burning themselves away in many-coloured flames, and the green
  leaves that still lingered amid the rich hues of beautiful decay, suggested,
  in their contrasting harmony with their withered brethren, many a deep moral
  to the thoughtful mind: and everything that the thoughts could shape received
  a deeper emphasis from the unbroken silence of the wood.</p>

  <p>The occupation of his mind made the time pass quickly, and it seemed but a
  few minutes when he saw the Homes approaching the King&rsquo;s Oak. The boys
  laid on the greensward the materials for the picnic, and then, while Violet
  and Mrs Home seated themselves on a fallen trunk and took out their work,
  Julian read to them, and Cyril and Frank walked through the wood in search of
  exercise and amusement.</p>

  <p>As they passed near the spot where Kennedy was seated, they caught sight
  of a squirrel&rsquo;s nest, and Frank was instantly on the alert to reach the
  spoil. While he was scrambling with difficulty up the tall fir, Cyril stayed
  at the foot, and Kennedy determined to call him. Cyril had grown into a tall
  handsome boy of seventeen, and Kennedy knew that he could be trusted to help
  him, for he had won the boy&rsquo;s affection thoroughly when they were
  together in Switzerland.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Cyril!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sound of a voice in that quiet place, out of earshot of his friends,
  startled Cyril, and he turned hastily round.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Edward Kennedy. Come here, Cyril, and let me speak to you; Frank
  does not notice us.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Edward&mdash;you here?&rdquo; said Cyril. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
  you come and see mother?&rdquo;&mdash;he was going to say Violet, but he
  checked himself.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want to see, not Mrs Home, but Violet,&rdquo; said Kennedy;
  &ldquo;you know our engagement is broken off, Cyril; I have only come to say
  farewell, before I leave England, perhaps for ever. Call Violet here
  alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cyril, who had heard of Kennedy&rsquo;s wild ways at college, and of the
  dreadful story that had raised against him the suspicion of intended suicide,
  hesitated a moment, as though he were half-afraid or unwilling to fulfil the
  commission. But Kennedy said to him sorrowfully&mdash;&ldquo;You need not
  fear, Cyril, that you will be doing wrong. Tell Frank first, and then you can
  stay near, while I speak for a few minutes to your sister.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Cyril called down his brother from the tree, and told him that Kennedy was
  there. &ldquo;Stay here, Frankie, while I fetch Violet; Edward wants to bid
  her good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He ran off, and said&mdash;&ldquo;Come here, Vi; Frank and I have
  something to show you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it anything very particular?&rdquo; said Violet, &ldquo;for I
  shall disturb Julian&rsquo;s reading if I go away.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, something very particular.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell me what?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, a squirrel&rsquo;s nest for one thing, which Frank has found.
  Do come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You imperious boys, at home for your holidays!&rdquo; she said,
  smiling; &ldquo;Punch hasn&rsquo;t half cured you of your tyranny to us poor
  sisters.&rdquo; She rose to follow him, and when they had gone a few steps,
  he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Vi, Edward Kennedy is in that little dell there, behind the trees;
  he has come, he says, to bid you good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The sudden announcement startled her, but she only leaned on Cyril&rsquo;s
  shoulder, and walked on, while he almost heard the beating of her heart.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We will stay here, Violet; you see him there.&rdquo; Cyril pointed
  to a tree, against whose trunk Kennedy was leaning, with his eyes bent upon
  the ground, looking at the red splashes on the withered leaves, and the
  golden buds embroidered on &ldquo;elf-needled mat of moss.&rdquo; Hearing the
  sound of footsteps he raised his head, and a moment after he was by
  Violet&rsquo;s side.</p>

  <p>Taking her hand without a word, while her bosom shook with deep sobs as
  she saw his pale face and maimed hand, he led her to the gnarled and
  serpentine roots of a great oak, and seated her there, while he sat lowly at
  her feet upon the red ground, &ldquo;With beddings of the pining umbrage
  tinged.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>How was it that she did not shrink from him? How was it that she seemed
  content to rest close beside him, and suffered her hand to rest upon his
  shoulder as he stooped? Did she love him still after all? Had Julian deceived
  him with the assertion of her acquiescence in the termination of their
  engagement? A strange rush of new hope filled his heart. He would test the
  true state of her affections.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; he said, in that tone of voice which was so
  dear to her remembrance&mdash;&ldquo;I have come, Violet, to bid you farewell
  for ever. Since you have rejected me, I have neither heart nor hope, and I
  shall leave England as soon as I may go.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The tears were falling fast from her blue eyes. &ldquo;Oh, Edward,&rdquo;
  she said, &ldquo;why do you bid me farewell? Do you not think that I love you
  still?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Still, Violet? You love <i>me</i>, the ruined, dishonourable,
  disgraced&mdash;the&mdash;&rdquo; She would not hear the dreadful word, but
  laid her finger on his lip.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, hush, Edward! Those words are not for you. You may have sinned;
  they tell me you <i>have</i> sinned. But have you not repented too, Edward?
  Have the lessons of sickness and anguish taught you nothing? I am sure they
  have. I could not wed one who was living an evil life, but now I see your
  true self once more.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you love me still?&rdquo; The words were uttered in
  astonishment, and the emotions of unexpected joy almost overpowered him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never ceased to love you, Edward. Do you think that I am one to
  trifle with your heart, or to use it as a plaything for me to triumph by?
  Never, never. Had you died, or worse still, had you continued in sinful ways,
  I could not even then have ceased to love you, though we might have been
  separated until death. But now I read other things in your face, Edward, and
  I will be yours&mdash;your betrothed&mdash;again. Come, let us join the rest.
  There is not one of us but will welcome you with joy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, let us stay here for a moment,&rdquo; he cried, as she
  rose up; &ldquo;let me realise the joyful sensation which your words have
  given me; let me sit here, Violet, a few moments at your feet, and feel the
  touch of your hand in mine, and look at your face, that I may recover
  strength again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They sat there in silence, and the thoughts of both recurred to that other
  scene where they had sat on the great boulder under the shadow of the Alps,
  and watched the rose-film steal over their white summits on the golden summer
  eve. It was the same love that still filled their souls&mdash;the same love,
  but more sober, more quiet, more like the love of maturer years, less like
  the passionate love of boy and girl. It was more of an autumnal love than of
  old; and if the departing summer had flung new hues over the forest and the
  glen, they were the duller hues that recalled to mind the greater glory of
  the past. It was round a dying year that Autumn was &ldquo;folding his
  jewelled arms.&rdquo; Yet they were happy&mdash;very happy, and they felt
  that, come what might, nothing on earth could part them now.</p>

  <p>When Kennedy had grown more calm, Violet called for Cyril, and bade him
  break the fact of Edward&rsquo;s presence to her mother and Julian. The boy
  bounded off to do her bidding, and in a few moments Kennedy was seated among
  the Homes as one of them. They received him with no simulated affection;
  Frank and Cyril helped to take away all awkwardness from the meeting by their
  high spirits, and when they all sat down on the velvet mosses to their rural
  meal, every one of them had banished the painful hauntings of the past. Of
  course Kennedy accompanied them home; they drove back in the quiet evening,
  and Kennedy sat by Violet&rsquo;s side.</p>

  <p>He stayed at Ildown till Julian returned to Saint Werner&rsquo;s, and, as
  was natural, he revolved in his mind continually his future course. At last
  he determined to talk it over with Violet, and told her of all his heroic
  longings for a life of toil and endeavour, if need were, even of banishment
  and death&mdash;all the high thoughts that had filled his heart as he sat
  alone in the island by Orton-on-the-Sea.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let us wait,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Edward. God will decide all
  this for us in time, and if duty seems to call you to the hard life of
  missionary or colonist, I am ready to go with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you feel yourself, Violet, a kind of commonplace-
  ness about English life; a silver-slippered religion, a pettiness that does
  not satisfy, a sense of comfort incompatible with the strong desire to do the
  work which others will not do in the neglected corners of the
  vineyard?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered, smiling, &ldquo;I am content:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;&lsquo;The trivial round, the common task<br>
  Should furnish all we ought to ask;<br>
  Room to deny ourselves&mdash;a road<br>
  To bring us daily nearer God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;well, I must try not to carry ambition
  into my religion.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course you return to Saint Werner&rsquo;s next
  autumn?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He mused long. &ldquo;Ah, Violet, you cannot conceive how awful to my
  imagination that place has grown. And to return after rustication, and live
  among men who will regard me with galling curiosity, and dons who will look
  at me sideways with suspicion&mdash;can I ever bear it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not, Edward? They cannot affect <i>you</i> by their opinion. I
  heard you say the other day that your heart was becoming an island, and the
  waters round it broadening every day. If the island itself be beautiful and
  happy, it need not reck of the outer world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are right, Violet. I will return if need be, and bear all
  meekly which I have deserved to bear. The one sorrow will be gone,&rdquo; he
  said, as he drew her nearer to his side, &ldquo;that drove me into&mdash;
  Yes, you are right. I will go away home to-morrow, when Julian starts, and
  begin from the very first day to read with all my might. Hitherto I have had
  only the bitter lessons of Camford; let us see if I cannot gain some of her
  honours too.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>XXXI. &mdash; BRUCE IN TROUBLE</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;Nuda nec arva placent, umbrasque negantia
  molles,<br>
  Nec dudum vetiti me laris augit amor.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Milton.</p><br>

  <p class="first">BRUCE, when expelled from Saint Werner&rsquo;s, thought very
  little of his disgrace. It hardly ruffled the calm stream of his
  self-complacency, and, for some reasons, he was rather glad that it had
  happened. He did not like Camford; he had never taken to reading, and being
  thus debarred from all intellectual pleasures, he had grown thoroughly tired
  of late breakfasts, boating on the muddy Iscam, noisy wines, and interminable
  whist parties. Moreover, he had made far less sensation at Camford than he
  had expected. Somehow or other he had a dim consciousness that men saw
  through him; that his cleverness did not conceal his superficiality, nor his
  easy manners blind men&rsquo;s eyes to his ungenerous and selfish heart. Even
  his late phase of popular scepticism was less successful at Camford than it
  would have been at places of less steady diligence and less sound
  acquirements. In fact, Bruce imagined that he was by no mean appreciated. The
  sphere was too narrow for him; he was quite sure that in the arena of London
  society and political life he was qualified to play a far more conspicuous
  part.</p>

  <p>Nor did he believe that Sir Rollo Bruce would care for his expulsion any
  more than he did himself; he fancied that his father was quite above the
  middle-class prejudices of respect and reverence for pedantry and
  pedagogues, and was too much a man of the world to be disturbed by a slight
  contretemps like this. He wrote home a careless note to mention the fact that
  his Saint Werner&rsquo;s career was ended, and attributed this result to a
  mere escapade at a wine-party, which had been distorted by rumour, and
  exaggerated by malice into a serious offence.</p>

  <p>So when Vyvyan gaily entered his father&rsquo;s house, he felt rather
  light-hearted than otherwise. He expected that very likely some party would
  be going on, and quite looked forward to an agreeable dance. When he arrived,
  however, Vyvyan House was quite silent; a dim light came from a single
  window, but that was all.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Rollo and my mother not at home, I suppose,&rdquo; he said to
  the plushed and powdered footman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, they&rsquo;re in the library.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He entered; they were sitting on opposite sides of the fire, with a single
  lamp between them. They were not doing anything, and Lady Bruce appeared to
  have been crying; but neither of them took any notice of his entrance beyond
  turning their heads.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; he said, advancing gracefully; but not a
  little surprised at so silent and moody a greeting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; was his father&rsquo;s cold reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear me&mdash;I quite expected to find a party going on, but you
  seem quite gloomy. Is anything the matter?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Matter, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir Rollo, starting up vehemently
  from his chair, and angrily pacing the room. &ldquo;Matter! Upon my word,
  Vyvyan, your impudence is sublime.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You surprise me. What have I done?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; retorted his father, with intense scorn. &ldquo;You
  have been expelled from College; you have wasted your whole opportunities of
  education; you have thrown away the boundless sums which I have spent in your
  interest; you have lived the life of a puppy and a fool, and now you come
  back in the uttermost disgrace, with your name involved in I know not what
  infamy, and are as cool about it as if you returned to announce a
  triumph.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Not deigning a word more, Sir Rollo turned indignantly on his heel and
  left Bruce as much astounded by so unexpected a reception as if he had
  suddenly trodden on a snake. He relapsed into uncommon sheepishness, and
  hardly knew how to address his mother, who sat sobbing in her armchair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear mother,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;what can be the
  matter that I am met by such tornados as my welcome on returning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, Vyvyan. Your father is naturally angry at your
  expulsion, and you have grieved us both. But, dear Vyvyan, do not put on such
  an impertinent and indifferent manner; it annoys Sir Rollo exceedingly. Do
  submit yourself, my dear boy, and he will soon recover his usual
  suavity.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I never saw him like this before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; these violent fits of temper have only come over him of late,
  and I am afraid that there must be some cause for them of which I am
  unaware.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bruce sat silent and unhappy. Expelled from college, and insulted, (as he
  called it), at home, he felt truly alone and miserable. He went up to his own
  room, supped there, and coming down next morning to the awkward meeting with
  his parents, spoke a few words of regret about his position. Sir Rollo barely
  listened to them, breakfasted in silence, and immediately afterwards set out
  for his office. He did not return till late in the evening, and continued for
  some time to spend the days in this manner, seeing next to nothing of his
  wife and son, but sternly forbidding any festivities or balls.</p>

  <p>One morning he called Vyvyan into his study before starting. Bruce laid
  aside his novel, yawned, and followed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pray, sir, do you intend to spend <i>all</i> your time in reading
  novels?&rdquo; said Sir Rollo.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing else for me to do that I see.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very well. If you suppose that you are going to spend your days in
  idleness, you are mistaken. I give you a week to choose some occupation that
  will not involve me in further outlay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bruce took out his embroidered pocket-handkerchief, redolent with scent,
  and blew his nose affectedly. On doing so, an unopened envelope dropped on
  the floor, out of his pocket; picking it up, he glanced at it, tore it
  across, and flung it into the fire. Sir Rollo immediately picked up the
  pieces with the tongs and opened it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I see that this is a bill, and I shall proceed to look at
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, if you like,&rdquo; said Bruce, in an indifferent
  tone&mdash;&ldquo;it&rsquo;s from a dun.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was a tailor&rsquo;s bill which had been sent after him, and it
  amounted to 150 pounds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you suppose,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;that I am going to
  pay these debts for you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose so, certainly&mdash;some day. Let the dogs
  wait.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Sir Rollo seemed on the point of a great burst of wrath; his lips
  positively quivered and his eye flashed with passion. He seemed, however, to
  control himself,&mdash;darted at his son a look of wrath and scorn, and left
  the room. A note that evening informed Lady Bruce that business detained him
  from home, and that he might not return for some days.</p>

  <p>A week after Bruce received a letter with foreign post-marks, to the
  following effect:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter"><i><b>Dear Vyvyan</b></i>&mdash;By the time you receive
  this, I shall be on the Continent, far beyond the reach of the law.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;I have been living for the last ten years on the
  money I embezzled from the company whose affairs I managed. The fraud cannot
  fail of being detected almost immediately.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;I feel acutely the position in which I am forced to
  leave your mother. I do <i>not</i> pity <i>you</i> in the least. I gave you
  the amplest opportunity to save yourself from this ruin, if you had not been
  a fool. You cared for nothing and for nobody but yourself. You never worked
  hard, though you knew it to be my wish; you assumed an air of spurious
  independence, and affected the fine gentleman. Your conceit and idleness will
  be their own punishment. You have made your own bed; now you will have to lie
  in it.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Rollo Bruce.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>The truth was soon known to the world. Numberless executions were put into
  Vyvyan House. Every available fragment of property was seized by Sir
  Rollo&rsquo;s creditors; and as Lady Bruce&rsquo;s private fortune had long
  been spent, she and her son were left all but penniless. The gay and gilded
  friends of their summer hours were the first to desert them, and Sir
  Rollo&rsquo;s wickedness had created such a gust of indignation, that few
  came forward to lend his family the slightest assistance.</p>

  <p>When Bruce found himself in this most distressing position&mdash;when he
  sat with his mother in shame and retirement in obscure lodgings, which had
  been taken for them by one of their former servants, and with no immediate
  means of livelihood&mdash;then first the folly of his past career revealed
  itself to his mind in its full proportions. Lady Bruce&rsquo;s health was
  dreadfully affected by the mental anguish through which she had passed, and
  it became a positive necessity that Bruce should work with his head or hands
  to earn their daily bread.</p>

  <p>He found no difficulty in procuring a temporary post in a lawyer&rsquo;s
  office as a clerk. The drudgery was terrible. Daily, from nine in the morning
  to six in the evening, he found himself chained to the desk, and obliged to
  go through the dullest and most mechanical routine, the only respite being
  half an hour in the middle of the day, which he spent in dining at an
  eating-house. Nursed on the lap of luxury, habituated to the choicest viands,
  and accustomed to find every whim fulfilled, this kind of life was
  intolerable to him. The steaming recesses of a squalid eating-house gave him
  a sensation of loathing and sickness, and the want of exercise made him look
  haggard and wan. In vain he appealed to men who had called themselves his
  father&rsquo;s friends; he found to his cost that the son of a detected
  swindler has no friends, and more especially if his own life have been
  tainted with suspicion or dishonour. Poor Bruce was driven to the very verge
  of despair.</p>

  <p>He applied for a situation in a bank, but he was informed that it could
  not be granted him unless he could obtain a certificate of good character
  from his college, which, of course, was out of the question. He tried writing
  for the press, but his shallow intellectual resources soon ran dry. The
  pittance he could thus earn did not remunerate him for the toil and wasted
  health, and even this pittance was too often cruelly held back. He made
  applications in answer to all sorts of advertisements, but one after another
  the replies were unfavourable, until his whole heart died within him. No
  intelligence could be obtained of his father&rsquo;s hiding-place, and before
  a year had elapsed since Sir Rollo&rsquo;s bankruptcy and felony had been
  made known, Lady Bruce died at her son&rsquo;s lodgings, worn out with misery
  and shame.</p>

  <p>This climax of the young man&rsquo;s misfortunes awoke at last the long
  dormant sympathy in his favour. An effort was made by his few remaining and
  unalienated friends to provide for him the means of emigration, which seemed
  the only course likely to give him once more a fair start in life. But to pay
  his passage, and provide him with the means of settling in New Zealand
  required a considerable sum, and Bruce had to suffer for weeks the agonies of
  hope deferred. And when he glanced over his past life, he found nothing to
  help him. He could not look back with any comfort; the past was haunted by
  the phantoms of regret. His violent and wilful infancy, his proud, passionate
  boyhood, his wandering and wicked youth, afforded him few green spots whereon
  the eye of retrospect could rest with calm. As the wayworn traveller who on
  some bright day sat down by the fringed bank of clear fountain or silver
  lake, and while he leant to look into its waters, was suddenly dazzled into
  madness by the flashing upwards upon him, from the unknown depths, of some
  startling image; so Bruce, as he rested by the dusty wayside of life, and
  gazed into the dark abysses of recollection, was startled and horrified, with
  a more fearful nympholepsy, by the crowding images and sullen glare of
  unforgotten and half-forgotten sins.</p>

  <p>But in dwelling on his past life, Bruce bethought him that he might still
  find friends at school; and not long after his mother&rsquo;s funeral, he
  determined to call on his old masters, and get such pecuniary aid as he could
  from them and his schoolboy friends. To come to such a resolution was the
  very bitterness of humiliation; but Bruce was now all eagerness to escape
  from England, and recommence a new life in other lands.</p>

  <p>He took a third class ticket to Harton, and when he arrived there, was so
  overcome with shame that he well-nigh determined to return by the next train,
  and leave the town unvisited, at whatever cost; but on inquiry he found that
  the next train would not start for some hours, and meanwhile he fully
  expected to be seen and recognised by those whom he had known before. And yet
  it was not easy, in that stooping figure, with the pale cheek and dimmed eye,
  to recognise the bright and audacious Vyvyan Bruce, who had been captain of
  Harton barely three years before. Poverty, ruin, disappointment, confinement,
  guilt, and sorrow had done their work with marvellous quickness.</p>

  <p>Nerving himself to the effort, he turned his face towards Harton, and
  walked slowly up the hill. The reminiscences which the walk recalled were not
  happy&mdash;rather, far from happy. It was not because formerly when he was a
  flattered, and rich, and handsome, and popular Harton boy, all the prospects
  of his life had looked as bright as now they seemed full of gloom; it was not
  that then both his parents were living, and now one was dead, the other
  disgraced; it was not that then he was full of health and vigour, and now was
  feeble and wearied; it was not that then he seemed to have many friends, and
  now he hardly knew of one; no, it was none of these things that affected him
  most deeply as he caught sight of the well-known chapel, and strolled up the
  familiar hill; but it was the thought, the bitter thought, the cursed thought
  that there, as at Camford, <i>the voice of his brother&rsquo;s blood was
  crying against htm from the ground</i>.</p>

  <p>By the time he reached the school buildings, it happened to be just one
  o&rsquo;clock, and from the various school-rooms, the boys were pouring out
  in gay and noisy throngs. The faces were new to him for the most part, and at
  first he began to fancy that he should recognise no one. But at last he
  observed a boy looking hard at him, who at length came up and shook him
  warmly by the hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do you do, Bruce? Ah, I see you don&rsquo;t remember me; true,
  I was only in the Shell when you left, but you ought at least to remember
  your old fags.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The change of countenance between fifteen and eighteen is however very
  great, and it was not without an effort that Bruce recalled in the tall
  strong fellow who was talking to him his quondam fag, little Walter Thornley,
  now in his turn captain of the eleven, and Head of the school, whose
  admiration of Bruce we have already recorded in the first chapter of this
  eventful history.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where are you off to now?&rdquo; said Thornley.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To the Doctor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll come and see me afterwards?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bruce promised and then walked to see the Doctor, and his old tutor. To
  both he opened his piteous tale, and both of them gave him the most generous
  and liberal assistance; they promised also to procure him such other aid as
  might lie in their power. A little lighter in heart, he went to pay his visit
  to Thornley, whom he found occupying his old rooms. As Bruce recrossed the
  familiar threshold, the contrasts of past and present were almost too much
  for him, and he found it difficult to restrain his tears. He stayed but a
  short time, and then returned to London to his poor and lonely lodgings.</p>

  <p>Walter Thornley heard his story from the tutor, and besides getting a
  large subscription for him among his own friends, wrote to ask if Julian
  could procure for the emigrant any assistance in Camford. Julian received the
  letter about the middle of the October term in his third year, and it ran
  thus:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Dear Home&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">Beyond knowing by rumour that I am head of the school, you
  will, I suppose, hardly remember a boy who was so low in the school as I was
  when you were monitor. But though you will perhaps have forgotten me, I have
  not forgotten you, or the many kinds acts I experienced from you and
  Lillyston when I was a little new fellow. Remembering these, I am emboldened
  to write, and ask if you or any of the old Hartonians are willing to assist
  poor Bruce to settle in New Zealand, now that he has no chance of succeeding
  well in England? I am sure that <i>you</i> personally will be glad of any
  opportunity to help an old school-fellow in his distress and difficulty, for
  report tells me that Julian Home is as kind-hearted and generous as he was
  when he won the Newry scholarship at Harton.&mdash;Believe me to be, my dear
  Home, yours very truly,</p>

  <p class="letter">Walter Thornley.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Julian had almost forgotten the very existence of Thornley when this
  letter recalled him to his mind; but it was one of the pleasures of
  Julian&rsquo;s life constantly to receive letters of this kind from former
  school-fellows, thanking him for past kindnesses of which he was wholly
  unconscious from the simple and natural manner in which they had been done.
  It need hardly be said that he at once complied with the request which the
  letter contained, and that, (next to De Vayne&rsquo;s), his own was the
  largest contribution towards the handsome sum which the Hartonians and other
  Saint Werner&rsquo;s men cheerfully subscribed to assist their former comrade
  in his hour of need.</p>

  <p>To avoid all unnecessary wounding of Bruce&rsquo;s feelings, the money
  thus collected was transmitted to the Doctor to be placed at Bruce&rsquo;s
  disposal. It completed the sum requisite for his outfit, and there was no
  longer any obstacle in the way of his immediate departure from England. He at
  once booked his passage by an emigrant ship, and sailed from England. The day
  after his departure, Julian received from him the following
  letter:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Dear Julian&mdash;Although you are one of those who
  would &lsquo;do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame,&rsquo; I am not
  ignorant of the debt of gratitude which I owe to you for providing me with
  the means of recovering my fortunes, and beginning life afresh in another
  hemisphere.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Our lots in life, since at Harton we ran a neck and
  neck race, have been widely different, and while the happy months have been
  rolling for <i>you</i> on silver wheels, and the happy hours speeding by you
  with white feet, to me Time has been:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;&lsquo;A maniac scattering dust,<br>
  And Life a Fury slinging flame.&rsquo;</p><br>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;How much I have gone through in the last
  year&mdash;the accumulated agony of remorse, bereavement, and ruin&mdash;no
  human soul can tell. No wonder my bark was wrecked after such mad and
  careless navigation; but, thank God, the blow of the tempest that staggered
  and shattered it, and drove it on the reefs, has not sunk it utterly, and
  now, like a waif or stray, it is being carried to be refitted across a
  thousand leagues of sea.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;I am not the Bruce you knew, but a wiser, sadder,
  and better man. I have not yet lost all hope. The old book of my life was so
  smutched and begrimed&mdash;torn, dogs-eared, and scrawled over&mdash;that it
  was scarcely worth while to turn over a new leaf. I have rather began a new
  volume altogether, and trust, by God&rsquo;s blessing, that when
  &lsquo;Finis&rsquo; comes to be written in it, some few of the pages will
  bear re-perusal.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;&lsquo;De Vayne!&rsquo; how that name haunts me; how
  full it is of horror&mdash;De Vayne and Hazlet; and yet I hear that both have
  contributed to my help. It gives me new life to know that human hearts can be
  so full of forgiveness and of love.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Starting almost for another world&mdash;without
  fortune, without friends, with nothing but head and heart, the wreck of what
  I was&mdash;I sometimes feel so sad that I could wish myself out of the world
  altogether. Forgive me, then, for once more bringing before you a name which
  you can only connect with the most unpleasant and sombre thoughts, and pray
  for me that my efforts, (this time they are genuine and sincere), to improve
  my life, my talents, and my fortune, may be crowned with success.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;We sail in an hour or sooner, for I hear them
  weighing anchor now. Good-bye. Accept my warmest thanks for all your
  kindnesses, and my wishes, (ah! that they were worthier!) for your happiness
  in life, and believe me, my dear Julian, your sincere and grateful
  friend&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;Vyvyan Bruce.</p>

  <p class="letter">&ldquo;<i>P S</i>&mdash;I am positively alone; not one soul
  is here even to bid me good-bye. Eheu! jam serus vitam ingemo
  relictam!&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>Julian read the letter many times; he was touched by its delicate and
  eloquent sorrow&mdash;its fine and chastened thoughtfulness. He was no longer
  in a mood to work, but closed his books, and watched the faces in the fire.
  One thought filled him with joy and thankfulness; it was the thought that,
  though of his friends and acquaintances so many had gone wrong, yet God was
  leading them back again, by rough and thorny roads it might be, but still by
  sure roads to the right path once more. Hazlet, Bruce, Brogten&mdash;above
  all, his friend and brother Kennedy&mdash;were returning to the fold they had
  deserted, were learning that for him who has sinned and suffered, REPENTANCE
  IS THE WORK OF LIFE. And as these thoughts floated through Julian&rsquo;s
  mind, the words of an old prayer came back upon his lips&mdash;&ldquo;That it
  may please Thee to strengthen such as do stand; and to <i>comfort and help
  the weak-hearted, and to raise up them that fall</i>; and finally, to beat
  down Satan under our feet.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2>XXXII. &mdash; A QUIET PROSPECT</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;Patet omnibus veritas; nondum est prorsus
  occupata.&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Seneca, Epistolae 33.</p><br>

  <p class="first">JULIAN&rsquo;S third year at Camford was by no means the
  happiest period of his life there, because the sad absence of Kennedy and De
  Vayne made a gap in his circle of friends which could not easily be filled
  up; but this was the <i>annus mirabilis</i> of his university career. He
  gained prize after prize; he was always first class in the college
  examinations; he won the chancellor&rsquo;s medals for Latin and English
  verse, and, indeed, almost divided with Owen the honours of the place. To
  crown all, he gained the Ireford University scholarship, which Owen had won
  the year before.</p>

  <p>Of all the men of his year, he was the most honoured and respected; he
  wore the weight both of his honours and his learning &ldquo;lightly like a
  flower,&rdquo; and there was a graceful humility, joined with his self-
  dependence, which won every heart, and prevented that jealousy which
  sometimes accompanies success.</p>

  <p>The most important event in his intellectual progress was the attention
  which he began to turn at this time to biblical and theological studies. He
  was thankful in later years that he had deferred such inquiries to a time
  when he was capacitated for them by a calm and sound judgment, and a solid
  basis of linguistic and historical knowledge. He had always looked forward to
  holy orders, and regarding the life of a clergyman as his appointed work, he
  considered that an honest, a critical, and an impartial study of the Bible
  was his first duty. In setting about it, he came to it as a little child; all
  he sought for was the simple truth, uncrushed by human traditions, unmingled
  with human dogmas, untrammelled by human interpretations, unadulterated by
  human systems. He found that he had a vast amount to unlearn, and saw clearly
  that if he fearlessly pursued his inquiries they would lead him so far from
  the belief of popular ignorance, as very probably to bar all worldly success
  in the sacred profession which he had chosen. But he knew that the profession
  <i>was</i> sacred, and, fearless by nature, he determined to seek for truth
  and truth only, honestly following the prayerful conclusions of his clearest
  and most deliberate judgment. Even in these early days the freedom and
  honesty of his research drew on him slight sibilations of those whose
  religion was shallow and sectarian; in after years they were destined to
  bring on him open and positive persecution.</p>

  <p>Not that Julian was ever in the least degree obtrusive in stating his
  beliefs when they widely and materially differed from the expressed opinions
  of the majority; except, indeed, in the cases when such opinions appeared to
  him dishonest or dangerous. He was scrupulously careful not to wound the
  conscience of those who would have been unable to understand the ground of
  his arguments, even when they could not resist their logical statement; and
  in whom long custom was so inveterate that the weed of system could not be
  torn out of their hearts without endangering the flower of belief. With men
  like Hazlet&mdash;I mean the reformed and now sincere Hazlet&mdash;he either
  confined himself wholly to subjects on which differences were impossible, or,
  if questioned, stated his views with caution and consideration. It was only
  with the noisy and violent upholders of long-grounded error&mdash;error which
  they were too feeble to maintain except by mean invective or ignorant
  declamation&mdash;that Julian used the keen edge of his sarcasm, or the
  weighty sword of his moral indignation. He was not the man to bow down before
  the fool&rsquo;s-cap of tyrannous and blatant ignorance. If he could have
  chosen one utterance from the holy Scriptures, which to him was more precious
  in its full meaning than another, it was that promise, rich with
  inexhaustible blessing, &ldquo;And ye shall know the truth, and the truth
  shall make you free.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Perhaps there is no greater want in this age than a full, fair,
  <i>fearless</i> religio clerici; the men who <i>could</i> write it, dare not;
  and the men who dare write it, cannot. They say the age is not ripe for it;
  and if they mean that it would cause violent offence to the potent rulers of
  fashionable religious dogmatism, they are right. But I wander from my theme,
  and meddle with the subjects which this is not the place to touch upon.</p>

  <p>The close of Julian&rsquo;s undergraduate life was as honourable as its
  promise had been. He obtained a brilliant first class, and was bracketed with
  Owen as the best classic of his year. Lillyston also distinguished himself,
  and all three determined to read for Fellowships, which, before a year was
  over, they had the honour to obtain.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile a circumstance had happened which changed the course of
  Kennedy&rsquo;s intentions. After his conversation with Violet, he had often
  thought of his plans for the future, and written to her about them.
  Reconciled to the plan, of returning to Camford after the year of his
  rustication, he was now trying to settle his future profession. His way
  seemed by no means clear; he had never thought of being a clergyman, and now,
  more than ever, deemed himself unfitted for such a life. The long tedious
  delay of the bar to a man without any special interest; the sickness of hope
  deferred during the prime years of life the weariness of a distasteful study,
  and the heavy trial of dusky chambers in a city to a man who loved the sea
  and the country with a passionate love, deterred him from choosing the law.
  He had no liking for the army, except in time of war; the life of the
  officers whom he knew was not altogether to his mind, and he was neither
  inclined to gaiety nor fond of an occupation which offered so many
  temptations to listlessness and indolence. There was no immediate necessity
  to decide finally, because in any case he meant to take his degree, and
  looked forward with some hope, after his year of unswerving diligence in the
  retirement of Orton, to honours in the Tripos and the pleasant aid of a Saint
  Werner&rsquo;s Fellowship as the crown of his career. But on the whole, he
  began to think that he might be both useful and successful as a physician. He
  had a deep reverence for this earthly tabernacle of the immortal soul, and a
  hallowed and reverend curiosity about that &ldquo;harp of a thousand
  strings,&rdquo; which, if it be untuned by sickness, mars every other melody
  of life. Violet entered into all his views, and they determined to leave the
  matter thus until Kennedy should have donned his B A gown.</p>

  <p>But about this period that public step was taken of throwing open to
  competition the Indian civil service appointments, which has been of such
  enormous advantage to the &ldquo;middle-classes&rdquo; of England by offering
  to them, as the reward of industry, the opportunity of a new and honourable
  profession, and which seems likely to be prolific of good results to the
  future of our Empire in the East. Directly Kennedy saw the announcement of
  the examination, he grasped with avidity the chance of a provision for life
  which it afforded, and easily obtained the assent both of his own and of
  Julian&rsquo;s family to offer himself as a candidate. Of course they
  contemplated with sorrow the prospect of so long a separation as the plan
  involved, but they saw that he himself was strongly desirous to win their
  approval of his proposition, and of course his wishes were Violet&rsquo;s
  too.</p>

  <p>So Kennedy went in for the civil service examination, and acquitted
  himself so admirably that his name headed the list of successful competitors,
  and he was told that he must prepare himself to leave England in a year for
  the post to which they appointed him.</p>

  <p>This happened about the time that Julian took his degree, and before the
  year was over Julian had been elected a Fellow, and the living of Elstan was
  offered to him. Being of small value&mdash;200 pounds a year&mdash;it had
  been rejected by all the Fellows of older standing, and had &ldquo;come
  down&rdquo; to Julian, who, to the surprise of his friends, left Camford and
  accepted it without hesitation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said Mr Admer, &ldquo;how in the world can
  you be so insane as to bury yourself alive, at the age of twenty-two, in so
  obscure a place as the vicarage of Elstan?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Elstan is a charming place,&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;I
  visited it before accepting it, and found it to be one of those dear little
  English villages in the greenest fields of Wiltshire. The house is a very
  pretty one, and the parish is in perfect order. My predecessor was an
  excellent man: his population, of one thousand souls, were perhaps as well
  attended to as any in all England.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Mr Admer, impatiently, &ldquo;I know all
  that; but who will ever hear of you again if you go and become what Sydney
  Smith calls &lsquo;a kind of holy vegetable&rsquo; in the cabbage-gardens of
  a Wiltshire hamlet?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, what would you have me do, Mr Admer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know; stay up here, edit a Greek play, or one of
  the epistles; bestir yourself for some rising university member in a
  contested election; set yourself to get a bishopric or a deanery; you could
  easily do it if you tried. I&rsquo;ll give you a receipt for it any day you
  like. Or go to some London church; with such sermons as you could preach you
  might have London at your heels in no time, and as you would superadd
  learning to effectiveness, your fortune would be made.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Julian was sorry to hear him talk like this; it was the language of a
  disappointed and half-believing man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for such aims,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A
  <i>mere</i> popular preacher I would not be, and as for preferment it
  doesn&rsquo;t depend much on me, but for the most part on purely accidental
  causes. All I care for at present is to be useful and happy. Obscurity is no
  trial to me; neither success nor failure can make me different from what I
  am.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well then, at least, write a book or something to keep yourself in
  men&rsquo;s memory.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel inclined. There are too many books in the world,
  and I have nothing particular to say. Besides, the annoyance and spite to
  which an author subjects himself are endless&mdash;to hear ignorant and often
  malicious criticisms, to see his views misrepresented, his motives
  calumniated, and his name aspersed. No, for the present, I prefer the peace
  and the dignity of silence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What on earth will you find to do, then, if you have no
  ambition?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, I don&rsquo;t want you to think that I&rsquo;m so virtuous or
  so phlegmatic as to have no ambition. I <i>have</i> a passionate ambition,
  whether known or unknown, so to live as to lead on the coming golden age, and
  prepare the next generation to be truer and wiser than ours. If it be my
  destiny never to be called to a wider sphere of work than Elstan, I shall be
  content to do it there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And how will you occupy your time?&rdquo; asked Mr Admer, who had
  long loved Julian too well even to smile at what were to himself mere
  unintelligible enthusiasms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no fear on that score. My profession will give me plenty of
  work; besides, what is the use of education, if it be not to render it
  <i>impossible</i> for a man to know the meaning of the word ennui? Put me
  alone in the waiting-room of some little wayside station to wait three hours
  for a train, and I should still be perfectly happy, even if there were no
  such thing as a book to be got for miles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, well, if you must vanish to Elstan, do. At any rate, remember
  your old Camford friends, and let us hear of you sometimes? I suppose
  you&rsquo;ll keep on your Fellowship at least for a year?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Insidious questioner!&rdquo; said Julian; &ldquo;no, I hope to be
  married very soon. You shall come down and see love in a cottage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aha, I see it all now,&rdquo; said Mr Admer, with a sigh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nay, you mustn&rsquo;t sigh. I expect to be congratulated, not
  pitied,&rdquo; said Julian, gaily. &ldquo;A wife will sweeten all the cares
  and sorrows of life, and instead of withering away my prime in selfish
  isolation, and spending these still half-youthful years in loneliness, and
  without a real home, I shall feel myself complete in the materials of
  happiness. After all, ambition such as yours is a loveless bride.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So Julian accepted Elstan, and Lillyston went with him to London to help
  him in selecting furniture for the vicarage which was so soon to receive a
  bride.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you really going to venture on matrimony with only 200 pounds a
  year?&rdquo; asked Lillyston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have some more of my own, you know, Hugh; Mr Carden&rsquo;s
  legacy, you remember; but even if I hadn&rsquo;t, I would still marry even on
  a hundred a year if I wished and the lady consented.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And repent at leisure.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it. If I were a man to whom lavender-coloured kid
  gloves and unlimited eau-de-cologne were necessaries of life, it might be
  folly to think of it. But if a man be brave, and manly, and fearless of
  convention, let him marry by all means, and not make his life bitter and his
  love cold by long delay.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But how about his children?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, it may be fanaticism, but I believe that God never sends a
  soul into the world without providing ample means for its sustenance. Of
  course, such an assertion will set the tongues of our would-be philosophers
  waggling in scornful cachinnation; but, in spite of that, I do believe that
  if a man have faith, and a strong heart, and common sense, he may depend upon
  it his children will not starve. Some of the very happiest people I know are
  to be found among the large families of country clergymen. Besides, very
  often the children succeed in life, and improve their father&rsquo;s
  position. I haven&rsquo;t the shadow of a doubt that I am doing the right
  thing. I only wish, Hugh, that you would follow my example.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps I shall, some day,&rdquo; said Lillyston.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And meanwhile you will be my bridegroom&rsquo;s man, will you
  not?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Joyfully&mdash;if it be only to see Miss Kennedy&rsquo;s face
  again.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And do you know that Kennedy is to be married to Violet the same
  day?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he? happy fellow! As for me, I am going to resign my fellowship,
  and to make myself useful at Lillyston Court. When is the wedding to
  be?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Both</i> weddings, you mean, Hugh. On the tenth of next June at
  Orton-on-the-Sea&mdash;the loveliest spot in the world, I think.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So in due time Julian packed up all his books and prizes, and bade
  farewell to his friends, and turned his back on Camford. It is as impossible
  to leave one&rsquo;s college without emotion as it is to enter it, and the
  tears often started to Julian&rsquo;s eyes as the train whirled him off to
  Elstan. He had cause, if any man ever had, to look back to Camford with
  regret and love. His course had been singularly successful, singularly happy.
  He had entered Saint Werner&rsquo;s as a sizar, he left it as a Fellow, and
  not &ldquo;With academic laurels unbestowed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had grown in calmness, in strength, in wisdom; he had learnt many
  practical lessons of life; he had gained new friends, without losing the old.
  He had learnt to honour all men, and to be fearless for the truth. His mind
  had become a well-managed instrument, which he could apply to all purposes of
  discovery, research, and thought; he was wiser, better, braver, nearer the
  light. In a word, he had learnt the great purpose of life&mdash;sympathy and
  love to further man&rsquo;s interest&mdash;faith and prayer to live ever for
  God&rsquo;s glory. And not a few of these lessons he owed to his college, to
  its directing influence, its ennobling associations, its studies&mdash;all
  bent towards that which is permanent and eternal, not to the transitory and
  superficial. To the latest day of his life, the name of Saint Werner&rsquo;s
  remained to Julian Home an incentive to all that is noble and manly in human
  effort. He felt the same duty with regard to it as the generous scion of an
  illustrious house feels towards the ancient name which he has inherited, and
  the noble lineage whence he has sprung.</p>

  <p>The few months which were to elapse before his marriage, Julian spent in
  preparing the vicarage for his young betrothed, and he stored it with
  everything which could delight a simple yet refined and educated taste. There
  was an indefinable charm about it&mdash;the charm of home. You felt on
  entering it that its owner destined it as the place around which his fondest
  affections were to centre, and his work in life was to be done. Julian had
  not the restless mind which sighs for continual change; happy in himself and
  his own resources, and the honest endeavour to do good, the glory of the
  green fields, the changes of the varying year supplied him with a wealth of
  beauty which was sufficient for all his needs, and when&mdash;after some long
  day&rsquo;s work amid the cottages, reading to the sick at their lonely
  bedsides, listening to the prattle of the children in the infant schools,
  talking to the labourers as they rested at their work&mdash;he refreshed
  himself by a gallop across the free fresh downs, or a quiet stroll under the
  rosy apple-blossoms of his orchard or garden, Julian might have said with
  more truth than most men can, that he was a happy and a contented man.</p>

  <h2>XXXIII. &mdash; FARWEWELL</h2>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;Hear the mellow wedding bells,<br>
  Golden bells!<br>
  What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!<br>
  Oh, from out the sounding cells,<br>
  What a gush of euphony voluminously swells!&rdquo;</i><br>
  &mdash;Edgar Poe.</p><br>

  <p class="first">MERRILY, merrily, rang out the sweet bells of Orton-on-the-
  Sea; more merrily than they ever rang before; so merrily that it seemed as if
  they would concentrate into every single clash and clang of their joyous peal
  a tumult of inexpressible happiness greater than they would ever be able to
  enjoy again. If you look up at the belfry, you will see them swing and dance
  in a very delirium of ecstasy, such as made everybody laugh while he
  listened, and chased away the possibility of sorrow, and thrilled the very
  atmosphere with an impression of hilarity and triumph.</p>

  <p>All Orton is a-stir. Mr Kennedy is the squire of the parish, and the
  villagers may well love him as they do. The son and daughter of the squire
  are not often married on the same day; and besides the double wedding with
  its promise of an evening banquet, and dance on the hall lawn to all the
  people of Orton, Eva and Edward are known well to every cottager, and loved
  as well as known.</p>

  <p>The hall is quite full, and the village inn is quite full, and all the
  neighbouring gentry who are invited, are hospitably entertaining such members
  of the two families as can find room nowhere else. Never had Orton seen such
  grand doings; the very stables and coach-houses are insufficient to receive
  the multitude of carriages.</p>

  <p>Several Saint Wernerians are invited; and, (as both Julian and Kennedy
  prefer to be alone on that morning), Lillyston, who has visited the place
  before, is lionising them in the neighbourhood, and with Willie,
  Kennedy&rsquo;s orphan cousin, rows them over to the little islet in the bay.
  As they come back, the hour for the wedding approaches, and Lillyston says to
  Owen&mdash;&ldquo;How I wish De Vayne were here!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But he is in Florence, is he not?&rdquo; says Owen.</p>

  <p>They have hardly spoken when a carriage with a coronet on the panels
  dashes up to the Lion Inn; a young man alights, hands out a lady, and enters
  the inn.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Surely that must be De Vayne himself,&rdquo; says Suton running
  forward. Meanwhile the young man, after taking the lady into a private room,
  asks if he may see Mr Home or Mr Kennedy, and is showed up to the parlour in
  which they are sitting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;De Vayne!&rdquo; they both exclaim in surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Julian!&rdquo; he answered cheerily; &ldquo;I only returned
  from Florence two days ago, heard of your marriage from the Ildown people,
  and determined to come with my mother a self-invited guest.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fear for my feelings,&rdquo; he continued, turning to
  Kennedy. &ldquo;Nothing is so useless or dangerous as to nurse a hopeless
  love, like the flame burning in the hearts of the banqueters, at the feast of
  Eblis. No, Kennedy, I love Violet, but only as a sister now, and you must not
  be afraid if I claim one kiss after the marriage from the bride. You shall
  have the same privilege some day soon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your coming is the completion of my happiness,&rdquo; said Kennedy,
  cordially shaking his hand. &ldquo;I will run and tell Violet at once, lest
  she should be alarmed by seeing you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, and to show her why we may continue to have communion as
  friends, tell her that there is a gentle Florentine girl, with dark eyes, and
  dark hair, and a sweet voice, who, as my mother will bear witness, has
  promised in a year&rsquo;s time to leave her Casa d&rsquo;oro for Other
  Hall,&rdquo; he said smiling.</p>

  <p>They took him down to see the others, who rejoiced to see him nearly as
  much as they did, and the time sped on for the wedding to be performed. The
  carriages had already started to convey the bridegrooms and their friends to
  church, when another carriage drove rapidly along the street, carrying
  another most unexpected guest.</p>

  <p>It had been arranged that Cyril and Frank should come down to Orton on the
  morning of the ceremony, as there was a difficulty in finding room for them.
  It was very late, and they were beginning to be afraid that the boys had
  missed a train, and would not arrive till after the ceremony, when they made
  their triumphant entry into Orton in a carriage by the side of&mdash;Lady
  Vinsear!</p>

  <p>Only imagine! Being left almost alone at Ildown while the others had gone
  to Orton to make arrangements for the marriage, Cyril had audaciously
  proposed to his brother that, as it was through them that Lady
  Vinsear&rsquo;s wrath had been kindled against Julian, they should go over
  and see whether the old lady would admit them into her presence or in any way
  suffer herself to be pacified. The proposal was quite a sudden one, and the
  thought had only come into Cyril&rsquo;s head because he had nothing else to
  do. But he had no sooner thought of it than he determined to carry it out. He
  felt certain that Lady Vinsear could not be so totally unlike his late father
  as to have become wholly ill-natured and implacable, and he was sure that no
  harm could result from his visit even if no good were done.</p>

  <p>So the boys drove over in a pony-chaise to Lonstead Abbey, and knocking at
  the door, asked if Lady Vinsear was at home.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old servant, opening his eyes in astonishment
  at the apparition of the two boys, whom he had only seen as children four
  years before.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then, ask if she will see Mr Cyril and Master Frank Home. Stop,
  though; is Miss Sprong at home?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Master Cyril; bless you, Miss Sprong, sir, has gone and
  married Farmer Jones this year gone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has she indeed? Oh, then, take my message, please,
  James.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They had come at the right moment. In the large drawing-room of Lonstead
  Abbey, Lady Vinsear was sitting with no companion but the orphan girl of a
  villager, to whom she gave a home, and who was amusing herself with a
  picture-book on a low stool by the fire; for though it was summer, the fire
  was lighted to give cheerfulness to the room. When Miss Sprong married a
  neighbouring farmer, Lady Vinsear had given her a handsome dowry, and refused
  ever to see her again, being in fact heartily tired of her malice and
  sycophancy, and above all, resenting the new breach which she had caused
  between herself and her brother&rsquo;s family. Ever since her quarrel with
  Julian, Lady Vinsear had bitterly regretted the violence which had cut off
  from her that natural affection to which she had looked as the stay of her
  declining years. She had grown sadder as she grew older, and the loneliness
  of her life weighed heavily on her heart, yet in her obstinate pride she made
  an unutterable resolve never to take the initiative in restoring Julian to
  her favour.</p>

  <p>And as she sat there by the fire, longing in her secret soul for the
  society and love of some young hearts of her own kith and kin, she glanced
  away from the uninteresting little girl whom she had taken as a protge to
  the likeness of Julian&rsquo;s bright and thoughtful boyish features, (which
  still, in spite of Miss Sprong, had retained a place over the mantel-piece),
  and remembered the foolish little incident which had led to her rejection of
  him as her heir. The tears started to her eyes as she thought of it, and
  wished with all her heart that the two gay and merry boys whose frolic had
  caused the <i>fracas</i> were with her once more. How much she should now
  enjoy the pleasant sound of their young voices, and how gladly she would join
  in their unrestrained and innocent laughter.</p>

  <p>So when the bewildered James asked in his never-varying voice,
  &ldquo;whether Master Cyril and Frank Home might see her,&rdquo; Lady Vinsear
  fancied that she was seeing in a dream the fulfilment of her unexpressed
  wishes, and rubbed her eyes to see if she could really be wide awake.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this, James?&mdash;are you James, or am I in a
  dream?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;James, your ladyship.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And do you really mean to tell me that my nephews are
  outside?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, please your ladyship.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, don&rsquo;t keep them there a minute longer, James. Run
  along, Annie,&rdquo; she said to the little girl, &ldquo;it is time for you
  to be in bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Annie had hardly retired, when&mdash;a little shyly&mdash;the boys
  entered, uncertain of their reception. But Lady Vinsear started from her
  seat, and embraced them with the utmost affection.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear Cyril,&rdquo; she said, kissing him again; &ldquo;how tall
  and handsome you have grown; and Frankie, too, you are the image of Julian
  when he was your age.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The boys were amazed at the heartiness with which she welcomed them, as
  though nothing had happened, and after she had given them a capital supper,
  she said to them, &ldquo;Now, boys, I see you are rather puzzled at me. Never
  mind that; don&rsquo;t think of what has happened. We mean all to be friends
  now. And now tell me all about Julian.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They found, however, that Lady Vinsear knew a good deal about his college
  career from her neighbour Lord De Vayne, who had kept her acquainted with all
  his successes and honours up to the period when De Vayne left Other Hall.
  Since then she had not been able to gain much information about him, and had
  not heard the news either of his fellowship, his approaching marriage, or his
  acceptance of a college living.</p>

  <p>She listened eagerly to the intelligence, and finally asked if he knew of
  their visit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cyril, laughing; &ldquo;neither he nor any of them.
  Now, Aunt Vinsear, you really must do me a favour. You know Vi is to be
  married at Orton on the same day as Julian; won&rsquo;t you come with us to
  the wedding, and surprise them all? If you were to start by an early train,
  and take the carriage with you, we should drive up in time for the ceremony,
  and it would be such a happy joke for all concerned.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The old lady was delighted with the plan. Meeting on such an occasion,
  when the minds of all were so much occupied, would avert the necessity of
  anything approaching to a scene, which of all things she most dreaded. She
  felt a flood of new interests, occupations, and hopes; she made the boys stay
  with her until the appointed day, and looked forward to Cyril&rsquo;s triumph
  with a delight which made her happier than she had been for many a long
  year.</p>

  <p>And thus it was that Cyril and Frank drove into the town in gallant style,
  accompanied by Lady Vinsear! They stopped at the door of the Lion, and
  hearing that Julian had started, got white favours placed at the
  horses&rsquo; heads, and dashed on to the church. The brides had not arrived,
  but they were expected every moment; and Mr Vere, (who had most kindly come
  to perform the ceremony), was putting on his surplice in the vestry, while
  Julian and Kennedy, with Owen, Lillyston, and De Vayne, were strolling up and
  down a pretty, retired laurel walk behind the church. Hearing where they
  were, the boys, accompanied by their aunt, boldly invaded their privacy, and
  reached the end of the walk just as the gentlemen were approaching to enter
  the church.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good gracious! Lady Vinsear!&rdquo; said De Vayne.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come here, Julian, and kiss
  your old aunt, and welcome her on your wedding-day, and don&rsquo;t think of
  bygones. I am proud to see you, my boy;&rdquo; and he felt a tear on his
  cheek as the old lady drew down his head to kiss him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t tell any of the rest
  that I have come till after the marriage. I hear the sound of wheels. Put me
  in some pew near the altar, Julian, that I may have a good long look at your
  bride, and Violet&rsquo;s bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They had just time to fulfil her wish when the carriages drove up, and the
  bridal procession formed, and, followed by their bride&rsquo;s-maids, Violet
  and Eva passed up the aisle, in all their loveliness, with wreaths of myrtle
  and orange-flower round their fair foreheads, and long, graceful veils, and
  simple ornaments of pearl.</p>

  <p>Beautiful to see! A bride always looks beautiful, but these two were
  radiant and exquisite in their loveliness. Which was the fairest? I cannot
  tell. Most men would have given the golden apple to Eva, with the sweet,
  tender grace that played about her young features, almost infantile in their
  delicacy, and with those bright, beaming, laughter-loving eyes, of which the
  light could not be hid though she bent her face downwards to hide the bridal
  blush that tinged it; but yet they would have doubted about the decision when
  they turned from her to the full flower of Violet&rsquo;s beauty, and gazed
  on her perfect face, so enchanting in its meekness, and on that one tress of
  golden hair that played upon her neck.</p>

  <p>De Vayne, as he looked on the perfect scene, took out a piece of paper,
  and wrote on it Spenser&rsquo;s lines:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Behold, while she before the altar stands,<br>
  Hearing the holy priest that to her speaks<br>
  And blesses her with his two happy hands,<br>
  How the red roses flush up in her cheeks<br>
  And the pure snow with golden vermeil stain,<br>
  Like crimson dyed in grain.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>He handed the lines to Lillyston and Owen, and they saw from the happy
  smile upon his face that no touch of regret or envy marred his present
  meditations.</p>

  <p>Has life any pleasure&mdash;any deep, unspoken happiness&mdash;comparable
  to that which fills a young&rsquo;s man whole soul when he stands beside the
  altar with such a bride as Violet or Eva was?&mdash;when he thinks that the
  fair, blushing girl, whose white hand trembles in his own, is to be the star
  of his home, the mother of his children, the sunbeam shining steadily on all
  his life? Verily he who hath experienced such a joy has found a jewel
  richer:</p>

  <p class="verse">&ldquo;Than twenty seas though all their sands were
  pearl,<br>
  Their waters crystal, and their rocks pure gold.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>The service was over, and in those few moments, four young souls had
  passed over the marble threshold of married life. Violet felt that the
  presence of De Vayne removed the only alloy to that deep happiness that spoke
  in the eloquent lustre of her eye, and she told him so as he bent to kiss her
  hand, and as Lady De Vayne clasped her to her heart with an affectionate
  embrace. All the people of the village awaited them at the porch, and as they
  passed along the path, the village children, lining the way, and standing
  heedless on the green mounds that covered the crumbling relics of mortality,
  scattered under their happy feet a thousand flowers. One passing thought,
  perhaps, about the lesson which those green mounds told, flitted through the
  minds of the bridal party as they left the trodden blossoms to wither on the
  churchyard path, but if so, it was but as the shadow of a summer cloud, and
  it vanished, as with a sudden clash the bells rang out again, thrilling the
  tremulous air with their enthusiasm of happy auguries, and the sailor boys of
  Orton gave cheer on cheer while brides and bridegrooms entered their
  carriages, and drove from under the umbrage of the churchyard yews to the
  elms and oaks and lime-tree avenues of the hall.</p>

  <p>Oh that happy day! The wedding breakfast had been laid in a large tent on
  the lawn, whence you could catch bright glimpses of the blue sea, and the
  islet, and the passing ships, while on all sides around it the garden glowed
  a paradise of blossom, and the fragrance of sweet flowers floated to them
  through the golden air. Rich fruits and gorgeous bouquets covered the table,
  and the whole tent was gay with wreaths and anadems. And then, what ringing
  laughter, what merry jests, what earnest happy talk! Let us not linger there
  too long, and from this scene I bid avaunt to the coarse cynical reader; who
  is too strong-minded to believe in love.</p>

  <p>Only let the <i>gentle</i> reader fancy for himself how beautiful were the
  few words with which Mr Vere proposed the health of the brides, and how long
  they remembered his earnest wish, that though the truest love is often that
  which has been sanctified by sorrow, yet that they might be spared the
  sorrow, and enjoy the truest love. And he will fancy how admirably Julian and
  Kennedy replied&mdash;Julian in words of poetic feeling and thoughtful power,
  Kennedy with quick flashes of picturesque expression, both with the eloquence
  of sincere and deep emotion; and how gracefully De Vayne proposed the health
  of the bridesmaids, for whom Cyril and Lillyston replied. Then, too quickly,
  came the hour of separation; the old shoe was flung after the carriages, the
  bridal couples departed for a tour among the lakes, and the villagers danced
  and feasted till twilight on the lawn.</p>

  <p>Six weeks are over since the marriage day, and there, in Southampton
  harbour, lies the <i>Valleyfield</i>, which is to convey Kennedy and Violet
  to Calcutta. They have just spoken the last, long, lingering farewell to Eva
  and Julian, who are standing in deep tearful silence on the pier, and are
  watching the little boat which is conveying their only brother and only
  sister to the ship. The boat is but a few moments in reaching the
  <i>Valleyfield</i>, and, when they are on board, the vessel weighs anchor,
  and ruffles her white plumage, and flings her pennons to the breeze, and
  begins to dash the blue water into foam about her prow. Violet and her
  husband are standing at the stern, and as long as the vessel is in sight they
  wave their hands in token of farewell. It is but a short time, and then the
  <i>Valleyfield</i> grows into a mere dot on the horizon, and Eva and Julian,
  heedless of the crowds around them, do not check the tears as they flow, and
  speak to each other in voices broken by sorrow as they slowly turn away.</p>

  <p>That evening Violet and Kennedy knelt side by side in their little cabin
  to join in common prayer, and Julian led his Eva over the threshold of their
  quiet and holy home.</p>

  <p>And their path thenceforth was &ldquo;as the shining light, shining more
  and more to the perfect day.&rdquo;</p>
