  <h3>First published in <i>The Novel Magazine</i>, July 1921</h3>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p class="first">MISS JANE IDA MEAGH was prepared to brain the first
  misguided person who addressed her by either of her given names, and had
  accepted with gratitude at a very early age the appellation suggested by the
  combination of her initials&mdash;Jim. And from &ldquo;Jim&rdquo; to
  &ldquo;Jimmy&rdquo; is but a short step.</p>

  <p>In the census return Jimmy described herself as a
  &ldquo;stenographer.&rdquo; So might Edison have marked himself
  &ldquo;electrician&rdquo; or Napoleon &ldquo;soldier.&rdquo; For there was no
  stenographer like Jimmy. She was at the very head of her profession, and was
  booked ahead like a film-star or a Harley Street specialist.</p>

  <p>If there was one person in the world whom Jimmy hated and loathed with all
  her soul, that person was Henry Obbings. Henry was a limp youth who gave you
  the impression that he had shaved in a bad light. He was famous in the social
  circle in which he moved for his ready wit and a gift of repartee. He
  invariably recounted with a wealth of detail his encounters with Jimmy, and
  repeated with great effect the things he had said to Jimmy on these
  occasions.</p>

  <p>It is true that the majority of his pert replies were those he remembered
  long after he had left Jimmy, and it is also a fact that he never quite gave
  a faithful account of what Jimmy had said to him. There were some things
  which Henry could never bring himself to repeat.</p>

  <p>Henry Obbings was the pet speedster of the Rat-a-plan Typewriter Co. Ltd.,
  and from time to time there were issued by him or on his behalf challenges to
  the whole of civilised mankind, man or woman, to meet him in a speed contest,
  the only conditions being that Mr. Obbings should operate on a Number 6
  Silent Rat-a-plan, &ldquo;the writer that writes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For the purpose of this challenge Jimmy regarded herself as inhuman; she
  steadfastly and resolutely declined to beat Mr. Obbings privately or
  publicly, and sneered openly at Mr. Obbings&rsquo;s portrait in the
  newspapers. These appeared from time to time, for the Rat-a-plan had an
  excellent Press agent, and they revealed Mr. Obbings working at his machine,
  a sycophantic attendant standing by with an oil-can. It was a legend that he
  worked so fast that after half-an-hour&rsquo;s use the bearings of the
  machine became so hot that it was necessary to open the door and windows of
  the room in which he worked, to let the temperature cool down.</p>

  <p>There were also pictures of Mr. Obbings in his moments of leisure and
  recreation, sitting at a table, with his head upon his clenched fists,
  looking at a book with a studious, even sad expression.</p>

  <p>One morning there came to Jimmy a further challenge by Mr. Henry Obbings.
  There was an annual exhibition at which business appliances of all kinds were
  shown, and it was a feature of this event that a diploma and a gold medal
  were competed for by stenographers. So far it had resulted in a walk-over for
  Henry.</p>

  <p>Jimmy had turned down every such artful move and invitation, and she now
  dropped the letter into her waste-paper basket with an exaggerated gesture of
  disgust. Nor did the information that the Rat-a-plan Typewriter Co. offered
  an additional money prize of substantial value to anyone who could exceed the
  speed of Mr. Obbings produce a trace of irresolution to her decision.</p>

  <p>She got up from her breakfast-table briskly and looked at her engagement-
  book. Jimmy was booked ahead, as has been remarked before, like a fashionable
  physician. Her amazing quickness, her accuracy, her unquestionable integrity
  justified the big fees she received, and incidentally confirmed her wisdom
  when she set out to be a specialist stenographer.</p>

  <p>Her first call that day was on Dr. John Phillips, who was also a
  specialist in his way; and Dr. John, who looked a little tired under the
  eyes, as well he might be, for he had been up all night with a dying patient,
  received her at his morning meal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, no, doctor,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just
  breakfasted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is my supper,&rdquo; growled the doctor. &ldquo;Jimmy,
  I&rsquo;ve the details of fourteen cases to dictate to you, and I hope you
  feel fitter for the job than I. By the way,&rdquo; he said curiously,
  &ldquo;where did you get your extraordinary knowledge from? You&rsquo;ve
  never yet spelt a medical term wrongly.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I got them out of a book, the same as you,&rdquo; said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>The doctor looked at her admiringly.</p>

  <p>For the next hour and a quarter she was absorbed in the gruesome and
  sorrowful business of recording the histories of cases, every other one of
  which ended: &ldquo;The patient died at 11.45,&rdquo; or whatever the hour
  might have been.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t any of your patients get well?&rdquo; asked Jimmy as
  she snapped the band round her note-book.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just a few,&rdquo; said Phillips. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget,
  I&rsquo;m only called in at the very end in lots of cases. I think some of
  them expect me to bring my trumpet, under the impression that I am the
  Archangel Gabriel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A rotten life!&rdquo; said Jimmy thoughtfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
  sooner have my job.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The doctor looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must hurry. I&rsquo;ve got to go to Greenwich,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, and in spite of his hurry, he sat down again at his desk and
  lit a cigarette, offering one to Jimmy, who shared a common match.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jimmy, do you think that a young man with brilliant prospects, but
  no money, should marry a very nice girl and start family life
  on&mdash;that!&rdquo; He snapped his fingers to indicate a microscopic
  income.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It all depends upon the prospects,&rdquo; said Jimmy cautiously.
  &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s only a prospect of raising a largo family, I should
  say no.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I said no, too,&rdquo; said the specialist with a sigh.</p>

  <p>He was a youngish man, remembering the position he occupied in the medical
  world, and that he could still sigh over the follies of his fellow-men was a
  wholesome tribute to his youth.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a pal of mine. We were at University together,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>Jimmy guessed that the unknown He was the patient at Greenwich. Dr. John
  was looking at the ceiling thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was talking to him about you yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About me?&rdquo; said Jimmy in surprise.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, about you. I don&rsquo;t think he has a great deal of
  money&mdash;in fact I know he hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Phillips frankly,
  &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s hard luck that at a time when he&rsquo;s really
  ill&mdash;he&rsquo;s had a bad nervous breakdown&mdash;he should have had a
  good offer from one of the technical journals for a series of
  articles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He paused and blew a ring of smoke to the rafters.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Jimmy, I know your fees, and they are beautifully exorbitant. God
  bless you for keeping the specialist beyond the reach of common people. But
  if he asks you to go down&mdash;for I think he could dictate these articles;
  he certainly could not write them&mdash;I wish you&rsquo;d charge him a sum
  which is not ridiculously low, but which is not your ordinary rate. One
  minute,&rdquo; he said as she was going to speak. &ldquo;I want you to put
  the rest of your fee on my bill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind, doctor,&rdquo; said Jimmy
  quietly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do this job for nothing, but I suppose he
  wouldn&rsquo;t like that. Anyhow, I&rsquo;ll do it at an ordinary
  typist&rsquo;s fee, and as to putting the rest of the charge on your account,
  that&rsquo;s ridiculous, unless you send me a bill for doctoring my throat
  last spring and for giving me several helpful pieces of advice about my
  heart, lungs, and other important parts of me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He laughed as he rose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must go, Jimmy. I&rsquo;ll let you know about
  Fennell.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p class="first">THAT morning Miss Jane Ida Meagh was the victim of a trick.
  She had been engaged by a firm of manufacturer&rsquo;s agents to copy a long
  document dealing with the cork harvest of Spain. She had to do the work at
  the agent&rsquo;s office, and it was urged upon her that it was vital, was
  indeed a matter of life and death that she should get to the last word of
  that report in the briefest possible space of time.</p>

  <p>It was a brand new typewriter, of a brand new make, at which she sat. The
  keyboard was, of course, universal, and most of the gadgets were of a type
  with which she was unfamiliar, though their manipulation was very easily
  learnt.</p>

  <p>She had fixed the tension to her liking, and then&mdash;the machine grew
  eloquent under her lightning fingers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s your report,&rdquo; she said, and observed that the
  agent had a stop watch in his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five thousand words in forty-two minutes 15.2 seconds,&rdquo; he
  said breathlessly but exactly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I dare say,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;Shall I send you a bill or
  are you one of those never-owe-nobody people?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The agent for this occasion was of the latter variety. Jimmy collected her
  cheque and left, and there the incident appeared to have closed.</p>

  <p>But the next day she passed a shop window in which was a typewriter. And
  beneath the typewriter was a large sign:</p><br>

  <p class="sign">THE PLATEN TYPEWRITER<br>
  on which<br>
  MISS JANE IDA MEAGH<br>
  (the world&rsquo;s champion stenographer)<br>
  wrote 5,347 words in 42 min. 15.2 secs.<br>
  A Record For The World.<br>
  Come Inside and Look at This<br>
  New Marvel of Engineering Science:<br>
  &ldquo;THE MACHINE WITH A MIND.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;God bless my soul!&rdquo; said Jimmy, and despite this pious
  invocation went red with wrath.</p>

  <p>She swept into the shop and demanded to see the manager.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take my name out of your window,&rdquo; she said peremptorily when
  that gentleman made his appearance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But, my dear young lady&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Take it out or I&rsquo;ll sue you for libel,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;Anyway, it&rsquo;s a lie. I took an hour and a quarter to do the work,
  on the worst brand of machine that I&rsquo;ve ever handled. And what&rsquo;s
  more, I shall make an affidavit to that effect.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good machine,&rdquo; he protested; &ldquo;there are
  only three in existence; they&rsquo;re show samples,
  and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Three too many!&rdquo; snapped Jimmy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Brown said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If Brown is the <i>nom-de-guerre</i> of the Armenian who engaged me
  to copy the cork serial,&rdquo; said Jimmy, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hear
  what he said. Now, do you take out that placard, or do I tell the Press all
  my troubles?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it out,&rdquo; growled the manager. &ldquo;I must
  say, though, that you&rsquo;re not very considerate. You&rsquo;ll remember
  that I gave you a lot of work last summer&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can give it to somebody else next summer,&rdquo; retorted Jimmy
  promptly. &ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;ll do it on &lsquo;The Platen.&rsquo;
  It&rsquo;s a fairly good machine for two-finger typists. Try &rsquo;em with
  &lsquo;Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the
  party&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She fired this invitation as she left him, and there was a sting in it
  which only a real typist will understand.</p>

  <p>The placard was removed, and there the matter would have ended, for Jimmy
  was discretion itself, and she was in no mood to advertise the trick that had
  been played upon her. What annoyed her most was that the machine was really
  good and a distinct improvement on any she had ever used.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, the manager was not so discreet, and the news came to a
  wandering reporter. The reporter, who was a clever young reporter, wrote a
  most amusing story that covered the Platen Typewriter, without mentioning its
  title, with shame and ignominy, so that in every office where girls groped
  for keys and dreamt dreams of making Miss Jane Ida Meagh look like a pickled
  walnut, the Platen Typewriter became synonymous with foolishness.</p>

  <p>The publicity had the effect of spurring Mr. Henry Obbings to a further
  challenge, to whom Jimmy was stung to a reply:</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">Dear Sir,</p>

  <p class="typewriter">You ask me whether I will make on exhibition of myself,
  and urge as a reason the fact that you intend making an exhibition of
  <u>yourself</u>. The only inducement I can see for me so far forgetting
  myself is the paragraph in which you tell me that I should work at one end of
  the building and you at the other. The knowledge that we were as far apart as
  possible would be an inducement were it not for the fact that the certainty
  that I was under the same roof as yourself would make me sick.</p>

  <p class="typewriter">Yours sincerely,</p>

  <p class="typewriter">J. I. Meagh.</p><br>

  <p>It was a very rude letter, such a letter as Mr. Obbings explained to his
  friends, no lady would write. Possibly he was justified.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo; said Mr. Obbings... &ldquo;no, Percy, I
  won&rsquo;t show you the letter, it&rsquo;s too disgraceful for
  words&mdash;the fact is she knows jolly well I could lick the stuffing out of
  her in spite of her vaunted speed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Yes, Mr. Obbings used the words &ldquo;vaunted speed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;ll enter at the last minute?&rdquo; suggested the
  friend.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not.&rdquo; Mr. Obbings shook his head with the
  sad smile of a tiger deprived of a meal.</p><br>

  <p class="first">A FEW days later Jimmy was rung up on the &rsquo;phone. It
  was Dr. Phillips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can you go down there to-day, Jimmy?&rdquo; he asked.
  &ldquo;Fennell thinks he could dictate the article, and he has got together
  most of the data.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m free this afternoon,&rdquo; said Jimmy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wire that you&rsquo;re coming then. Be there at
  half-past two,&rdquo; said the doctor, and gave her the address.</p>

  <p>That morning Jimmy had a great idea. Here was an invalid. She did not know
  much about invalids except that they lay in bed and refused delicate food.
  Sometimes they nibbled at a grape or swallowed a mouthful of chocolates, but
  now and again by a miracle they could be tempted to negotiate some
  particularly appetising dish, whereafter they put on weight and recovered
  with the greatest rapidity.</p>

  <p>That morning Jimmy stood in her private kitchen, her sleeves rolled up, a
  cookery-book propped against a milk-bottle, and the light of battle in her
  eye.</p>

  <p>No man or woman knew her ghastly secret. Even Mr. Obbings in his wildest
  moments never dreamt that her vice was the mangling and cremation of flour
  and fruit. Her lips moved as she followed the directions in the book.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Flour, two spoonfuls.... Fresh butter... put in a dry, warm
  place... bake in a slow oven....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She drew a long sigh and switched on her electric oven. She ate a hurried
  lunch, dashing backward and forward to the kitchen to examine the little
  thermostat which regulated the heat of the oven, and to compare the watch
  which lay open on the dresser with a note of the minute and the second that
  her work had gone to a warmer climate, written in pencil on the edge of the
  cookery-book.</p>

  <p>She opened the oven, and with a cloth drew out the steel plate on which
  four beautiful confections lay, and the fragrance of them was as incense to
  her nostrils.</p>

  <p>She looked at her work, then opened the cookery-book and examined the
  coloured plates, on which was a life-like representation of the little cakes
  she was baking. They were exact! If anything her creations were an
  improvement upon the book. She bore them to her room, and on her face was a
  look of holy exaltation. Each one she wrapped in white tissue and packed them
  into a small box and put the box into her <i>attaché</i> case.</p>

  <p>She arrived at Greenwich in the afternoon. The Fennell&rsquo;s house was a
  small one and poorly furnished, she saw at a glance.</p>

  <p>A girl met her at the door, a smiling bright-eyed girl who had laughed at
  poverty so long that it had become a habit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Miss Meagh, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;It is very good of you to come so far.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jimmy, who was somewhat at sea on occasions like this, smiled and was glad
  to get an awkward situation over. She found her client lying on a sofa in a
  somewhat bare parlour. He was a man of thirty, and he looked terribly ill,
  Jimmy thought. A low table near by was piled high with books, newspaper
  cuttings, and blue-covered reports.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My husband has been ill,&rdquo; explained Mrs. Fennell. &ldquo;But
  he&rsquo;s much better now, aren&rsquo;t you, Frank?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, much! I&rsquo;m just loafing now,&rdquo; said the man with a
  grin. &ldquo;I think I can dictate the best part of the article this
  afternoon, Miss Meagh.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fire away,&rdquo; said Jimmy, and produced her book.</p>

  <p>Fennell&rsquo;s estimate of his strength had erred on the optimistic side.
  After three-quarters of an hour of dictation he was exhausted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he said ruefully. &ldquo;I thought I was
  stronger.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve dictated
  quite a lot. Anyway, I can come down to-morrow afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long way out of town,&rdquo; he said doubtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo; said Jimmy, and that settled the matter.</p>

  <p>They pressed her to stay to tea, and she needed very little pressing. She
  had not had the opportunity she had sought, and as tea was to be served in
  the drawing-room she thought that this was a chance not to be missed. In the
  interval of waiting she was introduced to the Fennell baby, and as usual,
  when babies swam into her ken, she became incoherent and foolish.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I always get maudlin over babies,&rdquo; she said apologetically.
  &ldquo;Of course, it is every girl&rsquo;s pose that she loves them, but
  I&rsquo;m honest. I admit it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The maid brought in the tea, a plate of bread and butter, some jam
  sandwiches, and a large sponge-cake. Jimmy waited breathlessly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, thanks, dear, I won&rsquo;t eat anything,&rdquo; said Mr.
  Fennell with a little shiver as he ran his eyes over the meal. &ldquo;No,
  thank you,&rdquo; he said again as though he had asked himself and
  refused.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really, you ought to eat something, Frank,&rdquo; said his pretty
  wife, looking concerned.</p>

  <p>Jimmy coughed. &ldquo;A friend of mine makes rather good pastries,&rdquo;
  she said carelessly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s rather a good cook, and curiously
  enough she sent me...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She opened her <i>attaché</i> case and took out the box with fingers which
  shook a little.</p>

  <p>Would they have retained their beautiful shape and appearance? Before now
  Jimmy had known the most remarkable changes to occur between oven and eating.
  She removed the wrappings from one with a reverent touch. It was as it had
  been! Fennell&rsquo;s eyes fastened upon it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That does look good!&rdquo; He reached out his hand. &ldquo;Have
  you one to spare?&rdquo; He took the pastry between his finger and thumb and
  bit into it.</p>

  <p>Jimmy held her breath and half closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is the most wonderful thing
  I&rsquo;ve had for years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you like one, Mrs. Fennell?&rdquo; asked Jimmy in a hollow
  voice. Her heart was thumping. She could have wept at that moment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really, it&rsquo;s so extraordinary to see Frank eat that I can
  hardly take my eyes from him,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Fennell.</p>

  <p>She nibbled at the cake.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really delicious. Your friend must be very
  clever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, very!&rdquo; said Jimmy huskily. &ldquo;Perhaps she will send
  me some more to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you eating any yourself?&rdquo; asked Fennell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jimmy eagerly, and fumbled for the other two.
  &ldquo;Would you like them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Fennell not only liked them, but he ate them. He, an invalid, who had
  refused the choicest productions of the O.K. Cake Company (or the label about
  the sponge-cake lied), was eating with every evidence of relish the creature
  of her brain and hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can come to-morrow, can you?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Fennell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can come,&rdquo; said Jimmy, speaking under stress of great
  emotion, &ldquo;if&mdash;if you want me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was a lame conclusion. The conversation drifted away from cakes, and
  Mrs. Fennell took the girl into her confidence.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a lot of bad luck, haven&rsquo;t we,
  Frank?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just a little,&rdquo; ho said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know that a week ago I thought we were going to be quite
  wealthy,&rdquo; the girl went on. &ldquo;Frank is an inventor, and he has
  invented one of the best typewriters that has ever been put on the market,
  and just fancy, because some stupid girl refused to work it, the
  manufacturers turned it down!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think she was right,&rdquo; said Fennell. &ldquo;Apparently they
  got her to do a speed test by means of a trick, and they rather over-reached
  themselves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They were going to give Frank a big sum of money on account of
  royalties, but now we hear that a lot of orders, which had been booked, have
  been cancelled.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Jane Ida Meagh did not swoon. She sat up straight and stared at the
  girl-wife.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What was the name of that machine?&rdquo; she asked faintly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I called it &lsquo;The Platen,&rsquo; because the . . .&rdquo; He
  explained why it was called &ldquo;The Platen,&rdquo; but Jimmy did not
  hear.</p>

  <p>She had ruined them&mdash;these lovely people of taste and refinement!
  This poor man stretched upon a bed of sickness! Jimmy&rsquo;s eyes filled
  with tears, and she gulped at the extravagant picture of misery she drew. She
  had done it! And from sheer caprice and femininity. Jimmy had always hated
  femininity, and now it seemed the most loathsome of weaknesses.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come to-morrow, and don&rsquo;t forget those
  cakes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Fennell.</p><br>

  <p class="first">JIMMY went on the next day, and the cakes she took were even
  more delicious than the last, for she had mercifully refrained from improving
  upon the recipe&mdash;which was occasionally Jimmy&rsquo;s
  super-weakness.</p>

  <p>That evening on her return to town she went into the shop where the
  &ldquo;Platen&rdquo; had been exhibited, and the manager, standing with his
  hands behind him in the middle of the floor space, greeted her with a grave
  but reserved nod.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Miss Meagh,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon, Mr. Salter,&rdquo; for that was the manager&rsquo;s
  name.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How is the trade in &lsquo;Platens&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Jimmy
  briskly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you smashed that for us,&rdquo; said Mr. Salter bitterly.
  &ldquo;But, still, I don&rsquo;t mind so much, because I am thinking of
  taking over the Rat-a-plan agency for their improved portable
  machine.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; said Jimmy. &ldquo;What are you charging
  for the &lsquo;Platen&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He named the price, and she produced her cheque-book.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to buy a machine?&rdquo; he cried in
  amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There are two other ways I can get one,&rdquo; said Jimmy.
  &ldquo;One is by stealing it, and the other by accepting it as a
  gift&mdash;both of which methods are objectionable to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get that flat-footed boy of yours to carry this to my cab, will
  you? I&rsquo;m not so strong as I was twenty years ago.&rdquo; Which was
  true, for Jimmy&rsquo;s age was twenty-four.</p>

  <p>The flat-footed boy, who was now a scowling flat-footed boy, carried the
  instrument to the waiting taxi, and Jimmy placed it on her table that night
  with determination in the set of her jaw, and the light of battle in her
  eye.</p><br>

  <p class="first">MR. HENRY OBBINGS sat in a gaily-decorated stand, surrounded
  by a large crowd of admiring stenographers, and demonstrated, what time a
  smooth and silky-voiced lecturer dilated upon the staggering qualities of the
  Rat-a-plan.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Un-for-tun-ate-ly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we have not the
  op-por-tun-ity of test-ing the rela-tive speed of the Rat-a-plan with any of
  its com-pet-i-tors.&rdquo; He spoke as though each syllable was separated
  from its fellow. &ldquo;Our challenge extended to the whole of the civilised
  world has not been accepted by any of our rivals, for reasons which I think
  need no explanation. Tonight, we had hoped there would be a competition for
  the Inter-Trades Diploma and Medal, together with the money prize offered by
  my company, but you are deprived of that interesting demonstration. As you
  will see, we are the only entrants in the competition.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pointed to a large bulletin board where the name of &ldquo;Mr. Henry
  Obbings, The Rat-a-plan Typewriter,&rdquo; was visible.</p>

  <p>It was at that moment that the secretary of the exhibition pinned beneath
  the notice:</p><br>

  <p class="cp">&ldquo;J. I. Meagh, The Platen Typewriter.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p class="first">THE contest will remain in the minds of all interested in
  the delicate art of stenography. The two competitors sat, not at either end
  of the building, but at the same bench, each with the matter to be copied
  neatly stacked on their left and a pile of virgin white paper as neatly
  stacked on their right, and at the word &ldquo;Go!&rdquo; both struck
  simultaneously at the keys.</p>

  <p>The test was for half-an-hour&rsquo;s continuous work, and in that thirty
  minutes Jimmy wrote 4,630 words without a mistake, beating the baffled Henry
  Obbings by exactly twelve hundred words.</p>

  <p>Incidentally, she established the name of the Platen Typewriter, so that
  to-day there is scarcely an office in the City where the peculiar
  <i>tick-tick</i> of its keys cannot be heard.</p>
