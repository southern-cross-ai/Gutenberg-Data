  <h2><a id="chap01"
     name="chap01">CHAPTER I. &mdash; PETER'S PARENTAGE</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">EARLY one summer morning in England, in the year 1893 in the
  reign&mdash;which seemed in those days to have been going on for ever and to
  be likely to go on for evermore&mdash;of Queen Victoria, there was born a
  little boy named Peter. Peter was a novel name then; he was before the great
  crop of Peters who derived their name from Peter Pan. He was born with some
  difficulty. His father, who had not been to bed all night, for the trouble of
  the birth had begun overnight at about nine o'clock, was walking about in the
  garden in a dewy dawn, thinking the world very dreadful and beautiful, when
  he first heard Peter cry. Peter, he thought, made a noise like a little
  frightened hen that something big had caught.... Peter's mother had been
  moaning but now she moaned no more, and Peter's father stood outside and
  whispered "Oh, God! Oh! Damn them and damn them! why don't they tell met"</p>

  <p>Then the nurse put her head out of the window; it was a casement window
  with white roses about it; said "Everything's all right. I'll tell you when
  to come in," and vanished again.</p>

  <p>Peter's father turned about very sharply so that she should not see he was
  fool enough to weep, and went along the flagged path to the end of the
  garden, where was the little summer-house that looked over the Weald. But he
  could not see the Weald because his tears blinded him. All night Peter's
  father had been thinking what an imperfect husband he had always been and how
  he had never really-told his wife how much he loved her, and how indeed until
  now he had never understood how very much he loved her, and he had been
  making good resolutions for the future in great abundance, in enormous
  abundance, the most remarkable good resolutions, and one waking nightmare
  after another had been chasing across his mind nightmares of a dreadful
  dark-grey world in which there would be no Dolly, no Dolly at all anywhere,
  even if you went out into the garden and whistled your utmost, and he would
  be a widower with only one little lonely child to console him. He could not
  imagine any other woman for him but Dolly.</p>

  <p>The last trailing vestige of those twilight distresses vanished when
  presently he saw Dolly looking tired indeed but pink and healthy, with her
  hair almost roguishly astray, and the room full of warm daylight from the
  dawn-flushed sky, full of fresh south-west air from the Sussex downs, full of
  the sense of invincible life, and young master Peter, very puckered and ugly
  and red and pitiful, in a blanket in the nurse's arms, and Dr. Fremisson
  smirking behind her, entirely satisfied with himself and the universe and
  every detail of it.</p>

  <p>When Dolly had been kissed and whispered to they gave Peter to his father
  to hold.</p>

  <p>Peter's father had never understood before that a baby is an exquisite
  thing.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">The parents of Peter were modern young people, and Peter was
  no accidental intruder. Their heads were full of new ideas, new that is in
  the days when Queen Victoria seemed immortal and the world settled for ever.
  They put Peter in their two sunniest rooms; rarely were the windows shut; his
  nursery was white and green, bright with pretty pictures and never without
  flowers. It had a cork carpet and a rug displaying amusing black cats on
  pink, and he was weighed carefully first once a week and then once a month
  until he was four years old.</p>

  <p>His father, whom everybody called Stubbo, came of an old Quaker stock.
  Quakerism in its beginnings was a very fine and wonderful religion indeed, a
  real research for the Kingdom of Heaven on earth, a new way of thinking and
  living, but weaknesses of the mind and spirit brought it back very soon to a
  commoner texture. The Stubland family was among those which had been most
  influenced by the evangelical wave of the Wesleyan time. Peter's great-
  grandfather, old Stubland, the West-of-England cloth manufacturer, was an
  emotional person with pietistic inclinations that nearly carried him over at
  different times to the Plymouth Brethren, to the Wesleyan Methodists, and to
  the Countess of Huntingdon's connexion. Religion was his only social
  recreation, most other things he held to be sinful, and his surplus energies
  went all into the business. He had an aptitude for mechanical organization
  and started the Yorkshire factory; his son, still more evangelical and still
  more successful, left a business worth well over two hundred thousand pounds
  among thirteen children, of whom Peter's father was the youngest. "Stublands"
  became a limited company with uncles Rigby and John as directors, and the
  rest of the family was let loose, each one with a nice little secure six
  hundred a year or thereabouts from Stubland debentures and Stubland ordinary
  shares, to do what it liked in the world.</p>

  <p>It wasn't, of course, told that it could do what it liked in the world.
  That it found out for itself&mdash;in the teeth of much early teaching to the
  contrary. That early teaching had been predominantly prohibitive, there had
  been no end of "thou shalt not" and very little of "thou shalt," an irksome
  teaching for young people destined to leisure. Mankind was presented waiting
  about for the Judgment Day, with Satan as busy as a pickpocket in a crowd.
  Also he offered roundabouts and coconut-shies.... This family doctrine
  tallied so little with the manifest circumstances and natural activity of the
  young Stublands that it just fell off their young minds. The keynote of
  Stubbo's upbringing had been a persistent unanswered "Why not?" to all the
  things he was told not to do. "Why not dance? Why not go to theatres and
  music-halls? Why not make love? Why not read and quote this exciting new
  poetry of Swinburne's?"...</p>

  <p>The early 'nineties were a period of careless diastole in British affairs.
  There seemed to be enough and to spare for every one, given only a little
  generosity. Peace dwelt on the earth for ever. It was difficult to prove the
  proprietorship of Satan in the roundabouts and the coconut-shies. There was a
  general belief that one's parents and grandparents had taken life far too
  grimly and suspiciously, a belief which, indeed, took possession of Stubbo
  before he was in trousers.</p>

  <p>His emancipation was greatly aided by his elder sister Phyllis, a girl
  with an abnormal sense of humour. It was Phyllis who brightened the Sunday
  afternoons, when she and her sister Phoebe and her brothers were supposed to
  be committing passages of scripture to memory in the attic, by the invention
  of increasingly irreligious Limericks. Phoebe would sometimes be dreadfully
  shocked and sometimes join in with great vigour and glory. Phyllis was also
  an artist in misquotation. She began by taking a facetious view of the ark
  and Jonah's whale, and as her courage grew she went on to the Resurrection.
  She had a genius for asking seemingly respectful but really destructive
  questions about religious matters, that made her parents shy of instruction.
  The Stubland parents had learnt their faith with more reverence than
  intelligence from their parents, who had had it in a similar spirit from
  their parents, who had had it from their parents; so that nobody had looked
  into it closely for some generations, and something vital had evaporated
  unsuspected. It had evaporated so completely that when Peter's father and
  Peter's aunts and uncles came in their turn as children to examine the
  precious casket, they not only perceived that there was nothing in it, but
  they could very readily jump to the rash conclusion that there never had been
  anything in it. It seemed just an odd blend of empty resonant phrases and
  comical and sometimes slightly improper stories, that lent themselves very
  pleasantly to facetious illustration.</p>

  <p>Stubbo, as he grew up under these circumstances, had not so much taken on
  the burthen of life as thrown it off. He decided he would not go into
  business&mdash;business struck him as a purely avaricious
  occupation&mdash;and after a pleasant year at Cambridge he became quite clear
  that the need of the world and his temperament was Art. The world was not
  beautiful enough. This was more particularly true of the human contribution.
  So he went into Art to make the world more beautiful, and came up to London
  to study and to wear a highly decorative blue linen blouse in private and to
  collect posters&mdash;people then were just beginning to collect posters.</p>

  <p>From the last stage of Quakerism to the last extremity of decoration is
  but a step. Quite an important section of the art world in Britain owes
  itself to the Quakers and Plymouth Brethren, and to the drab and grey
  disposition of the sterner evangelicals. It is as if that elect strain in the
  race had shut its eyes for a generation or so, merely in order to open them
  again and see brighter. The reaction of the revolting generation has always
  been toward colour; the pyrotechnic display of the Omega workshops in London
  is but the last violent outbreak of the Quaker spirit. Young Stubland, a
  quarter of a century before the Omega enterprise, was already slaking a
  thirst for chromatic richness behind the lead of William Morris and the
  Pre-Raphaelites. It took a year or so and several teachers and much friendly
  frankness to persuade him he could neither draw nor paint, and then he
  relapsed into decoration and craftsmanship. He beat out copper into great
  weals of pattern and he bound books grossly. He spent some time upon
  lettering, and learnt how to make the simplest inscription beautifully
  illegible. He decided to be an architect. In the meantime he made the
  acquaintance of a large circle of artistic and literary people, became a
  Fabian socialist, abandoned Stubland tweeds for fluffy artistically dyed
  garments, bicycled about a lot&mdash;those were the early days of the
  bicycle, before the automobile robbed it of its glory&mdash;talked endlessly,
  and had a very good time. He met his wife and married her, and he built his
  own house as a sample of what he could do as an architect.</p>

  <p>It was, with one exception, the only house he ever built. It was quite
  original in design and almost indistinguishable from the houses of a round
  dozen contemporaries of Mr. Charles Voysey. It was a little low-browed, white
  house, with an enormous and very expensive roof of green slates; it had wide,
  low mullioned casement windows, its rooms were eight feet high and its doors
  five foot seven, and all about it were enormous buttresses fit to sustain a
  castle. It had sun-traps and verandahs and a terrace, and it snuggled into
  the ruddy hillside and stared fatly out across the Weald from beyond
  Limpsfield, and it was quite a jolly little house to live in when you had
  learnt to be shorter than five feet seven inches and to dodge the low bits of
  ceiling and the beam over the ingle-nook.</p>

  <p>And therein, to crown the work of the builder, Peter was born.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Peter's mother came from quite a different strand in the
  complicated web of British life. Her "people"&mdash;she was brought up to
  call them that&mdash;were county people, but old-fashioned and prolific, and
  her father had been the sixth son of a third son and very lucky to get a
  living. He was the Vicar of Long Downport and an early widower; his two sons
  had gone to Oxford with scholarships, and Dolly had stayed at home, a leggy,
  dark-eyed girl with a sceptical manner, much given to reading history. One of
  her brothers passed from Oxford into the higher division of the Civil Service
  and went to India; the other took to scornful, reactionary journalism,
  dramatic criticism, musical comedy lyrics, parody, and drink&mdash;which
  indeed is almost a necessity if a man is to stick to reactionary journalism;
  this story will presently inherit Joan from him; she had a galaxy of cousins
  who were parsons, missionaries, schoolmasters, and soldiers; one was an
  explorer; not one was in business. Her father was a bookish inattentive man
  who had just missed a fellowship because of a general discursiveness; if he
  could have afforded it he would have been very liberal indeed in his
  theology; and, like grains of pepper amidst milder nourishment, there were
  all sorts of sceptical books about the house: Renan's <i>Life of Christ</i>
  Strauss's <i>Life of Christy Gibbon</i>, various eighteenth century memoirs,
  Huxley's Essays, much Victor Hugo, and a "collected" Shelley, books that his
  daughter read with a resolute frown, sitting for the most part with one leg
  tucked up under her in the chair, her chin on her fists, and her elbows on
  either side of the volume undergoing assimilation.</p>

  <p>Her reading was historical, and her tendency romantic. Her private
  daydream through some years of girlhood was that she was Caesar's wife. She
  was present at all his battles, and sometimes, when he had had another of his
  never altogether fatal wounds, she led the army. Also, which was a happy
  thought, she stabbed Brutus first, and so her Caesar, contrariwise to
  history, reigned happily with her for many, many years. She would go to sleep
  of a night dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Imperator driving in triumph through the
  gates of Rome after some little warlike jaunt. Sometimes she drove. And also
  they came to Britain to drive out the Picts and Scots, and were quartered
  with her father in Long Downport, conquering Picts, Scots, Danes, and the
  most terrific anachronisms with an equal stoutness and courage. The private
  title she bestowed upon herself (and never told to any human being) was "The
  Imperatrix."</p>

  <p>As she grew up she became desirous of more freedom and education. After
  much argument with her father she came up to an aunt in London, and went to
  study science in the Huxley days as a free student at the Royal College of
  Science. She saw her future husband at an art students' soirée, he looked
  tall and bright and masterful; he had a fine profile, and his blond hair
  poured nobly off his forehead; she did not dream that Peter's impatience for
  incarnation put ideas into her head, she forgot her duty to Caesar and
  imagined a devotion to art and beauty. They made a pretty couple, and she
  married amidst universal approval&mdash;after a slight dispute whether it was
  to be a religious or a civil marriage. She was married in her father's
  church.</p>

  <p>In the excitement of meeting, appreciating and marrying Stubbo, she forgot
  that she had had a great pity and tenderness and admiration for her shy and
  impulsive cousin, Oswald Sydenham, with the glass eye and cruelly scarred
  face, who had won the V.C. before he was twenty at the bombardment of
  Alexandria, and who had since done the most remarkable things in Nyasaland.
  It had been quite typical heroism that had won him the V.C. He had thrown a
  shell overboard, and it had burst in the air as he threw it and pulped one
  side of his face. But when she married, she had temporarily forgotten Cousin
  Oswald. She was just carried away by Arthur Stubland's profile, and the wave
  in his hair, and&mdash;life.</p>

  <p>Arthur was Stubbo's Christian name because he had been born under the
  spell of "The Idylls of the King."</p>

  <p>Afterwards when Oswald came home again, she thought the good side of his
  face, the side of his face that hadn't been so seriously damaged by the
  Egyptian shell, looked at her rather queerly. But the wounded side remained a
  Sphinx-like mask.</p>

  <p>"Congratulations!" said Oswald, fumbling with the word. "Congratulations!
  I hope you'll be happy, Dolly."...</p>

  <p>She was far gone in rationalism before she met Arthur, and he completed
  her emancipation. Their ideas ran closely together. They projected some years
  of travel before they settled down. He wanted to see mediaeval Italy
  "thoroughly," and she longed for Imperial Rome. They took just a couple of
  rooms in South Kensington and spent all the rest of their income in long
  stretches of holiday. They honeymooned in pleasant inns in South Germany;
  they did some climbing in the Tyrol and the Dolomites&mdash;she had a good
  head&mdash;they had a summer holiday on the Adriatic coast, and she learnt to
  swim and dive well, and they did one long knapsack tramp round and along the
  Swiss Italian frontier and then another through the Apennines to
  Florence.</p>

  <p>It was a perfectly lovely time. Everything was bright and happy, and they
  got on wonderfully together, except that There was a shadow for her. She
  found it difficult to say exactly what the shadow was, and it is still more
  difficult for the historian to define it. She dismissed the idea that it had
  anything to do with Cousin Oswald's one reproachful eye. She sometimes had a
  faint suspicion that it was her jilted Caesar asking for at least a Rubicon
  to cross, but it is doubtful if she ever had any suspicion of Peter, waiting
  outside the doors of life. Yet the feeling of something forgotten, of
  something left out, grew throughout those sunny days. It was in some sweet
  meadows high up on the great hill above Fiesole, that she tried to tell
  Arthur of this vexatious feeling of deficiency.</p>

  <p>Manifestly she puzzled him, which was not to be wondered at since the
  feeling puzzled her. But it also had a queer effect of irritating him.</p>

  <p>"Arthur, if you always say I don't love you," she said, "when I tell you
  anything, then how can I tell you anything at all!"</p>

  <p>"Aren't we having the loveliest times!" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said without complete conviction. "It isn't that."</p>

  <p>"You admit you love me. You admit you're having the loveliest time!"</p>

  <p>She sat up with her elbows on her knees and her knuckles pressing her
  round, firm chin.</p>

  <p>"It's just all one holiday," she said.</p>

  <p>"I did some work last month."</p>

  <p>He had planned three impossible houses and made a most amusing cardboard
  model of one of them. She disregarded this plea.</p>

  <p>"When we came up here people were working in the fields. Even that pretty
  little girl among the bushes was looking after sheep."</p>

  <p>"By Jove! I wish I could paint her&mdash;and those Holman Hunt-faced sheep
  of hers. It's tantalizing to be able to see&mdash;and yet not to have
  the&mdash;the expressive gift...."</p>

  <p>"Things are going on now, Arthur. Down there in the valley along that
  white road, people are going and coming.... There is a busy little train
  now.... Things are happening. Things are going to happen. And the work that
  goes on! The hard work! Today&mdash;there are thousands and thousands of men
  in mines. Out of this sunshine...."</p>

  <p>There was an interval. Arthur rolled over on his face to look at the
  minute railway and road and river bed far below at the bottom of a deep lake
  of pellucid blue air.</p>

  <p>"I don't agree with you," he said at last.</p>

  <p>"Too much is happening," he said. "Noisy, vulgar fuss. Commercialism,
  competition, factory production. Does it make people happy f Look at that
  horrid little railway disturbing all this beautiful simple Tuscan
  life...."</p>

  <p>Another long pause.</p>

  <p>She made a further step. "But if something beautiful is being destroyed,"
  she tried, "we ought not to be here."</p>

  <p>That also took a little time to soak in.</p>

  <p>Then he stirred impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Don't we," he asked, "protest? By the mere act of living our own lives?
  Don't I, in my small way, try to do my share in the Restoration of
  Craftsmanship? Aren't people of our sort doing something&mdash;something a
  little too unpretending to be obvious&mdash;to develop the conception of a
  fairer and better, a less hurried, less greedy life?"</p>

  <p>He raised an appealing face to her.</p>

  <p>She sat with knitted brows. She did not assent, but it was difficult to
  argue her disaccord.</p>

  <p>He took advantage of her pause.</p>

  <p>"Confess," he said, "you would like to have me a business manager&mdash;of
  some big concern. Or a politician. You want me to be in the scrimmage.
  No!&mdash;lording it over the scrimmage. The real things aren't done like
  that, Dolly. The real things aren't done like that!"</p>

  <p>She put her next thought out in its stark simplicity.</p>

  <p>"Are we doing any real thing in the world at all?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer for some seconds.</p>

  <p>Then he astonished her by losing his temper. It was exactly as if her
  question had probed down to some secret soreness deep within him. "Oh, damn!"
  he shouted. "And on this lovely morning! It's too bad of you, Dolly!" It was
  as if he had bit upon a tender tooth. Perhaps a fragment of the stopping had
  come out of his Nonconformist conscience.</p>

  <p>He knelt up and stared at her. "You don't love this, anyhow&mdash;whether
  you love me or not."</p>

  <p>He tried to alter his tone from a note of sheer quarrelsomeness to
  badinage. "You Blue Conscience, you! You Gnawing Question! Are we doing
  anything real at all, you say. Is no one, then, to stand up and meet the
  sunlight for its own sake, when God sends it to us? No! You can't unsay it
  now." (Though she was not unsaying it. She was only trying for some more
  acceptable way of saying it over again.) "My day is spoilt! You've stuck a
  fever into me!"</p>

  <p>He looked about him. He wanted some vivid gesture. "Oh, come on!" he
  cried.</p>

  <p>He sprang up. He gesticulated over her. He banished the view with a sweep
  of rejection. "Let us go back to the inn. Let us take our traps back to
  stuffy old Florence. Let us see three churches and two picture-galleries
  before sunset! And take our tickets for home. We aren't rushing and we ought
  to rush. Life is rush. This holiday has lasted too long, Dolly,"</p>

  <p class="quote">"'Life is real! Life is earnest!'<br>
  Simple joys are not its goal."</p>

  <p>"Own, my Dolly! If only this afternoon we could find some solid serious
  lecture down there! Or an election. You'd love an election.... And anyhow,
  it's nearly lunch time."</p>

  <p>She knelt, took his hand, and stood up.</p>

  <p>You mock," she said. "But you know that what I want to say&mdash;isn't
  that...."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">He did know. But all the way back to England he was a man
  with an irritating dart sticking in his mind. And the discussion she had
  released that day worried him for months.</p>

  <p>He wanted it to be clear that their .lives were on a very high level
  indeed. No mere idlers were they. Hitherto he said they had been keeping
  honeymoon, but that was only before they began life in earnest. Now they were
  really going to begin. They were going to take hold of life.</p>

  <p>House and Peter followed quite logically upon that.</p>

  <p>How easy was life in those days&mdash;at least, for countless thousands of
  independent people! It was the age of freedom&mdash;for the independent. They
  went where they listed; the world was full of good hotels, and every country
  had its <i>Baedeker</i> well up to date. Every cultivated home had its little
  corner of weather-worn guide books, a nest of memories, an <i>Orario</i>, an
  <i>Indicateur</i>, or a Continental <i>Bradshaw</i>. The happy multitude of
  the free travelled out to beautiful places and returned to comfortable homes.
  The chief anxiety in life was to get good servants&mdash;and there were
  plenty of good servants. Politics went on, at home and abroad, a traditional
  game between the Ins and Outs. The world was like a spinning top that seems
  to be quite still and stable.... Yet youth was apt to feel as Dolly felt,
  that there was something lacking.</p>

  <p>Arthur was quite ready to fall in with this idea that something was
  lacking. He was inclined to think that one got to the root of it by
  recognizing that there was not enough Craftsmanship and too much cheap
  material, too much machine production, and, more especially, too much aniline
  dye. He was particularly strong against aniline dyes. All Britain was strong
  against aniline dyes,&mdash;and so that trade went to Germany. He reached
  socialism by way of aesthetic criticism. Individual competition was making
  the world hideous. It was destroying individuality. What the world needed was
  a non-competitive communism for the collective discouragement of machinery.
  (Meanwhile he bought a bicycle.) He decided that his modest six hundred a
  year was all that he and Dolly needed to live upon; he would never work for
  money&mdash;that would be "sordid"&mdash;but for the joy of work, and on his
  income they would lead a simple working-man's existence, free from the
  vulgarities of competition, politics and commercialism.</p>

  <p>Dolly was fascinated, delighted, terrified and assuaged by Peter, and
  Peter and a simple house free also from the vulgarities of modern mechanism
  kept her so busy with only one servant to help her, that it was only in odd
  times, in the late evening when the sky grew solemn or after some book had
  stirred her mind, that she recalled that once oppressive feeling of something
  wanting, something that was still wanting....</p>

     name="chap02">CHAPTER II. &mdash; STUBLANDS IN COUNCIL</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">BUT although Dolly did not pursue her husband with any
  sustained criticism, he seemed now to feel always that her attitude was
  critical and needed an answer. The feeling made him something of a thinker
  and something of a talker. Sometimes the thinker was uppermost, and then he
  would sit silent and rather in profile (his profile, it has already been
  stated, was a good one, and much enhanced by a romantic bang of warm golden
  hair that hung down over one eye), very picturesque in his beautiful blue
  linen blouse, listening to whatever was said; and sometimes he would turn
  upon the company and talk with a sort of experimental dogmatism, as is the
  way with men a little insecure in their convictions, but quite good talk. He
  would talk of education, and work, and Peter, and of love and beauty, and the
  finer purposes of life, and things like that. A lot of talk came the way of
  Peter's father. Along the Limpsfield ridge and away east and west and north,
  there was a scattered community of congenial intellectuals. It spread along
  the ridge beyond Dorking, and resumed again at Haslemere and Hindhead, where
  Grant Allen and Richard Le Gallienne were established. They were mostly
  people of the same detached and independent class as the Stublands; they were
  the children of careful people who had created considerable businesses, or
  the children of the more successful of middle Victorian celebrities, or dons,
  or writers themselves, or they came from Hampstead, which was in those days a
  nest of considerable people's children, inheritors of reputations and writers
  of memoirs, an hour's 'bus drive from London and outside the cab radius.</p>

  <p>A thin flavour of Hampstead spread out, indeed, over all Surrey. Some of
  these newcomers lived in old adapted cottages; some of them had built little
  houses after the fashion of the Stublands; some had got into the real old
  houses that already existed. There was much Sunday walking and "dropping in"
  and long evenings and suppers. Safety bicycles were coming into use and
  greatly increasing intercourse. And there was a coming and going of Stubland
  aunts and uncles and of Sydenhams and Dolly's "people." Nearly all were
  youngish folk; it was a new generation and a new sort of population for the
  countryside. They were dotted among the farms and the estates and preserves
  and "places" of the old county family pattern. The "county" wondered a little
  at them, kept busy with horse and dog and gun, and, except for an occasional
  stiff call, left them alone. The church lamented their neglected Sabbaths.
  The doctors were not unfriendly.</p>

  <p>One of the frequent visitors, indeed, at The Ingle-Nook&mdash;that was the
  name of Peter's birthplace&mdash;was Doctor Fremisson, the local general
  practitioner. He was a man, he said, who liked "Ideas." The aborigines lacked
  Ideas, it seemed; but Stubland was a continual feast of them. The doctor's
  diagnosis of the difference between these new English and the older English
  of the country rested entirely on the presence or absence of Ideas. But there
  he was wrong. The established people were people of fixed ideas; the
  immigrants had abandoned fixed ideas for discussion. So far from their having
  no ideas, those occasional callers who came dropping in so soon as the
  Stublands were settled in The Ingle-Nook before Peter was born, struck the
  Stublands as having ideas like monstrous and insurmountable cliffs. To fling
  your own ideas at them was like trying to lob stones into Zermatt from
  Macugnana.</p>

  <p>One day when Mrs. Darcy, old Lady Darcy's daughter-in-law, had driven
  over, some devil prompted Arthur to shock her. He talked his extremest
  Fabianism. He would have the government control all railways, land, natural
  products; nobody should have a wage of less than two pounds a week; the whole
  country should be administered for the universal benefit; everybody should be
  educated.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure the dear old Queen does all she can," said Mrs. Darcy.</p>

  <p>"I'm a democratic republican," said Arthur.</p>

  <p>He might as well have called himself a Christadelphian for any idea he
  conveyed.</p>

  <p>Presently, seized by a gust of unreasonable irritation, he went out of the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Stubland talks," said Mrs. Darcy; "<i>really</i>-She paused. She
  hesitated. She spoke with a little disarming titter lest what she said should
  seem too dreadful. "He says such things. I really believe he's more than half
  a Liberal. <i>There</i>! You mustn't mind what I say, Mrs. Stubland..."</p>

  <p>Dolly, by virtue of her vicarage training, understood these people better
  than Peter's father. She had read herself out of the great Anglican culture,
  but she remembered things from the inside. She was still in close touch with
  numerous relations who were quite completely inside. Before the little green
  gate had clicked behind their departing backs, Arthur would protest to her
  and heaven that these visitors were impossible, that such visitors could not
  be, they were phantoms or bad practical jokes, undergraduates dressed up to
  pull his leg.</p>

  <p>"They know nothing," he said.</p>

  <p>"They know all sorts of things you don't know," she corrected.</p>

  <p>"What do they know? There isn't a topic one can start on which they are
  not just blank."</p>

  <p>"You start the wrong topics. They can tell you all sorts of things about
  the dear Queen's grandchildren. They know things about horses. And about
  regiments and barracks. Tell me, Arthur, how is the charming young Prince of
  Bulgaria, who is just getting married, related to the late Prince
  Consort."</p>

  <p>"Damn their Royal Marriages!"</p>

  <p>"If you say that, then they have an equal right to say, 'damn your Wildes
  and Beardsleys and William Morrises and Swinburnes."</p>

  <p>"They read nothing."</p>

  <p>"They read Mrs. Henry Wood. They read lots of authors you have never heard
  of, nice authors. They read so many of them that for the most part they
  forget their names. The bold ones read Quida&mdash;who isn't half bad. They
  read every scrap they can find about the marriage of the Princess Marie to
  the Crown Prince of Roumania. Mrs. Bagshot-Fawcett talked about it yesterday.
  It seems he's really a rarer and better sort of Hohenzollern than the young
  German Emperor, our sailor grandson that is. She isn't very clear about it,
  but she seems to think that the Prince of Hohenzollern ought rightfully to be
  German Emperor."</p>

  <p>"Oh, what <i>rot</i>!"</p>

  <p>"But perhaps she's right. How do you know? / don't. She takes an almost
  voluptuous delight in the two marriage ceremonies. You know, I suppose, dear,
  that there were two ceremonies, a Protestant one and a Catholic one, because
  the Roumanian Hohenzollerns are Catholic Hohenzollerns. Of course, the dear
  princess would become a Catholic&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>don't</i>!" cried Peter's father; "don't!"</p>

  <p>"I had to listen to three-quarters of an hour of it yesterday. Such a
  happy and convenient occurrence, the princess's conversion,
  but&mdash;archly&mdash;of course, my dear, I suppose there's sometimes just a
  little <i>persuasion</i> in these cases."</p>

  <p>"Dolly, you go too far!"</p>

  <p>"But that isn't, of course, the great interest just at present. The great
  interest just at present is George and May. You know they're going to be
  married."</p>

  <p>Arthur lifted a protesting profile. "My dear! Who is May?" he tenored.</p>

  <p>"Affected ignorance! She is the Princess May who was engaged to the late
  Duke of Clarence, the Princess Mary of Teck. And now he's dead, she's going
  to marry the Duke of York. Surely you understand about that. He is your
  Future Sovereign. Mrs. Bagshot-Fawcett gets positively lush about him. It was
  George she always loved, Mrs. Bagshot-Fawcett says, but she accepted his
  brother for Reasons of State. So after all it's rather nice and romantic that
  the elder brother&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Arthur roared and tore his hair and walked up and down the low room. "What
  are these people to me?" he shouted. "What are these people to me?"</p>

  <p>"But there is twenty times as much about that sort of thing in the papers
  as there is about our sort of things."</p>

  <p>There was no disputing it.</p>

  <p>"We're in a foreign country," cried Arthur, going off at a tangent. "We're
  in a foreign country. We English are a subject people.... Talk of Home Rule
  for Ireland!... Why are there no <i>English</i> Nationalists? One of these
  days I will hoist the cross of St. George outside this cottage. But I doubt
  if any one on this countryside will know it for the English flag."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Whatever is seems right, and it is only now, after five and
  twenty years of change, that we do begin to see as a remarkable thing the
  detached life that great masses of the English were leading beneath the
  canopy of the Hanoverian monarchy. For in those days the court thought in
  German: Teutonized Anglicans, sentimental, materialistic and resolutely
  "loyal," dominated society; Gladstone was notoriously disliked by them for
  his anti-German policy and his Irish and Russian sympathies, and the old
  Queen's selection of bishops guided feeling in the way it ought to go. But
  there was a leakage none the less. More and more people were drifting out of
  relationship to church and state, exactly as Peter's parents had drifted out.
  The Court dominated, but it did not dominate intelligently; it controlled the
  church to no effect, its influence upon universities and schools and art and
  literature was merely deadening; it responded to flattery but it failed to
  direct; it was the court of an alien-spirited old lady, making much of the
  pathos of her widowhood and trading still on the gallantry and generosity
  that had welcomed her as a "girl queen." The real England separated itself
  more and more from that superficial England of the genteel that looked to
  Osborne and Balmoral. To the real England, dissentient England, court taste
  was a joke, court art was a scandal; of English literature and science
  notoriously the court knew nothing. In the huge pacific industrial
  individualism of Great Britain it did not seem a serious matter that the army
  and navy and the Indian administration were orientated to the court. Peter's
  parents and the large class of detached people to which they belonged, were
  out of politics, out of the system, scornful, or facetious and aloof. Just as
  they were out of religion. These things did not concern them.</p>

  <p>The great form of the empire contained these indifferents, the great roof
  of church and state hung over them. Royal visits, diplomatic exchanges and
  the like passed to and fro, alien, uninteresting proceedings; Heligoland was
  given to the young Emperor William the Second by Lord Salisbury, the old
  Queen's favourite prime minister, English politicians jostled the French in
  Africa as roughly as possible to "larn them to be" republicans, and resisted
  the Home Rule aspirations and the ill-concealed republicanism of the "Keltic
  fringe"; one's Anglican neighbours of the "ruling class" went off to rule
  India and the empire with manners that would have maddened Job; they stood
  for Parliament and played the game of politics upon factitious issues. Sir
  Charles Dilke, the last of the English Republicans, and Charles Stewart
  Parnell, the uncrowned King of Ireland, had both been extinguished by
  opportune divorce cases. (Liberal opinion, it was felt, must choose between
  the private and the public life. You could not have it both ways.) It did not
  seem to be a state of affairs to make a fuss about. The general life went on
  comfortably enough. We built our pretty rough-cast houses, taught Shirley
  poppies to spring artlessly between the paving-stones in our garden paths,
  begot the happy children who were to grow up under that roof of a dynastic
  system that was never going to fall in. (Because it never had fallen in.)</p>

  <p>Never before had nurseries been so pretty as they were in that glowing
  pause at the end of the nineteenth century.</p>

  <p>Peter's nursery was a perfect room in which to hatch the soul of a little
  boy. Its walls were done in a warm cream-coloured paint, and upon them
  Peter's father had put the most lovely pattern of trotting and jumping horses
  and dancing cats and dogs and leaping lambs, a carnival of beasts. He had
  copied these figures from books, enlarging them as he did so; he had cut them
  out in paper, stuck them on the wall, and then flicked bright blue paint at
  them until they were all outlined in a penumbra of stippled blue. Then he
  unpinned the paper and took it on to another part of the wall and so made his
  pattern. There was a big brass fireguard in Peter's nursery that hooked on to
  the jambs of the fireplace, and all the tables had smoothly rounded corners
  against the days when Peter would run about. The floor was of cork carpet on
  which Peter would put his toys, and there was a crimson hearthrug on which
  Peter was destined to crawl. And a number of stuffed dogs and elephants,
  whose bead eyes had been carefully removed by Dolly and replaced with eyes of
  black cloth that Peter would be less likely to worry off and swallow, awaited
  his maturing clutch. (But there were no Teddy Bears yet; Teddy Bears had
  still to come into the world. America had still to discover the charm of its
  Teddy.) There were scales in Peter's nursery to weigh Peter every week, and
  tables to show how much he ought to weigh and when one should begin to feel
  anxious. There was nothing casual about the early years of Peter.</p>

  <p>Peter began well, a remarkably fine child, Dr. Fremisson said, of nine
  pounds. Although he was born in warm summer weather we never went back upon
  that. He favoured his mother perhaps more than an impartial child should, but
  that was at any rate a source of satisfaction to Cousin Oswald (of the
  artificial eye).</p>

  <p>Cousin Oswald was doing his best to behave nicely and persuade himself
  that all this show had been got up by Dolly and was Dolly's show&mdash;and
  that Arthur just happened to be about.</p>

  <p>"Look at him," said Cousin Oswald as Peter regarded the world with
  unwinking intelligence from behind an appreciated bottle; "the Luck of him.
  He's the Heir of the Ages. Look at this room and this house and every one
  about him."</p>

  <p>Dolly remarked foolishly that Peter was a "nittle darum. 'E
  dizzerves-i-tall. Nevything."</p>

  <p>"The very sunshine on the wall looks as though it had been got for him
  specially," said Cousin Oswald.</p>

  <p>"It was got for him specially," said Dolly, with a light of amusement in
  her eyes that reminded him of former times.</p>

  <p>This visit was a great occasion. It was the first time Cousin Oswald had
  seen either Arthur or Peter. Almost directly after he had learnt about
  Dolly's engagement and jerked out his congratulations, he had cut short his
  holiday in England and gone back to Central Africa. Now he was in England
  again, looked baked and hard, and his hair, which had always been stubby,
  more stubby than ever. The scarred half of him had lost its harsh redness and
  become brown. He was staying with his aunt, Dolly's second cousin by
  marriage, Lady Charlotte Sydenham, not ten miles away towards Tonbridge, and
  he took to bicycling over to The Ingle-Nook every other day or so and
  gossiping.</p>

  <p>"These bicycles," he said," are most useful things. Wonderful things. As
  soon as they get cheap&mdash;bound to get cheap&mdash;they will play a
  wonderful part in Central Africa."</p>

  <p>"But there are no roads in Central Africa!" said Arthur.</p>

  <p>"Better. Foot tracks padded by bare feet for generations. You could ride
  for hundreds of miles without dismounting&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Compared with our little black babies," said Cousin Oswald, "Peter seems
  immobile. He's like a baby on a lotus flower meditating existence. Those
  others are like young black indiarubber kittens&mdash;all acrawl. But then
  they've got to look sharp and run for themselves as soon as possible, and he
  hasn't.... Things happen there."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Arthur in his lifting tenor, "how far all this opening up
  of Africa to civilization and gin and Bibles is justifiable."</p>

  <p>The one living eye glared at him. "It isn't exactly like that," said
  Oswald stiffly, and offered no occasion for further controversy at the
  moment.</p>

  <p>The conversation hung for a little while. Dolly wanted to say to her
  cousin: "He isn't thinking of you. It's just his way of generalizing about
  things...."</p>

  <p>Anyhow this young man has a tremendous future," said Oswald, going back to
  the original topic. "Think of what lies before him. Never has the world been
  so safe and settled&mdash;most of it that is&mdash;as it is now. I suppose
  really the world's hardly begun to touch education. In this house everything
  seems educational&mdash;pictures, toys, everything. When one sees how small
  niggers can be moulded and changed even in a missionary school, it makes one
  think. I wish I knew more about education. I lie awake at nights thinking of
  the man I might be, if I knew all I don't know, and of all I could do if I
  did. And it's the same with others. Every one who seems worth anything seems
  regretting his education wasn't better. Hitherto of course there's always
  been wars, interruptions, religious rows; the world's been confused and poor,
  a* thorough muddle; there's never been a real planned education for people.
  Just scraps and hints. But we're changing all that. Here's a big safe world
  at last. No wars in Europe since "71 and no likelihood in our time of any
  more big wars. Things settle down. And he comes in for it all."</p>

  <p>"I hope all this settling down won't make the world too monotonous," said
  Arthur.</p>

  <p>"You artists and writers have got to see to that. No, I don't see it
  getting monotonous. There's always differences of climate and colour.
  Temperament. All sorts of differences."</p>

  <p>"And Nature," said Arthur profoundly. "Old Mother Nature."</p>

  <p>"Have you christened Peter yet?" Oswald asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"He's not going to be christened," said Dolly. "Not until he asks to be.
  We've just registered him. He's a registered baby."</p>

  <p>"So he won't have two godfathers and a godmother to be damned for
  him."</p>

  <p>"We've weighed the risk," said Arthur.</p>

  <p>"He might have a godfather just&mdash;<i>pour rire</i>," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"That's different," Dolly encouraged promptly. "We must get him one."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to be Peter's godfather," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"I will deny him no advantage," said Arthur. "The ceremony The ceremony
  shall be a simple one. Godfather,</p>

  <p>Peter; Peter, godfather. Peter, my son, salute your godfather."</p>

  <p>Oswald seemed trying to remember a formula. "I promise and vow three
  things in his name; first a beautiful mug; secondly that he shall be duly
  instructed in chemistry, biology, mathematics, the French and German tongues
  and all that sort of thing; and thirdly, that&mdash;what is thirdly? That he
  shall renounce the devil and all his works, there isn't a devil
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>Peter having consumed his bottle to the dregs and dreamt over it for a
  space, now thrust it from him and turning towards Oswald,
  regurgitated&mdash;but within the limits of nursery good manners. Then he
  smiled a toothless, slightly derisive smile.</p>

  <p>"Intelligent 'e is!" crooned Dolly. "Unstand evlyflmg 'e does...."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">This conversation about Peter's future, once it had been
  started, rambled on for the next three weeks, and then Oswald very abruptly
  saw fit to be called away to Africa again....</p>

  <p>Various interlocutors dropped in while that talk was in progress. Arthur
  felt his way to his real opinions through a series of experimental
  dogmas.</p>

  <p>Arthur's disposition was towards an extreme Rousseauism. It is the
  tendency of the interrogative class in all settled communities. He thought
  that a boy or girl ought to run wild until twelve and not be bothered by
  lessons, ought to eat little else but fruit and nuts, go bareheaded and
  barefooted. Why not? Oswald's disposition would have been to oppose Arthur
  anyhow, but against these views all his circle of ideas fought by necessity.
  If Arthur was Ruskinite and Morrisite, Oswald was as completely Huxleyite. If
  Arthur thought the world perishing for need of Art and Nature, Oswald stood
  as strongly for the saving power of Science. In this matter of bare
  feet&mdash;</p>

  <p>"There's thorns, pins, snakes, tetanus," reflected Oswald.</p>

  <p>"The foot hardens."</p>

  <p>"Only the sole," said Oswald. "And not enough."</p>

  <p>"Shielded from all the corruptions of town and society," said Arthur
  presently.</p>

  <p>"There's no such corruptor as that old Mother Nature of yours. You daren't
  leave that bottle of milk to her for half an hour but what she turns it sour
  or poisons it with one of her beastly germs."</p>

  <p>"I never approved of the bottle," said Arthur, bringing a flash of hot
  resentment into Dolly's eyes....</p>

  <p>Oswald regretted his illustration.</p>

  <p>"Old Mother Nature is a half-wit," he said. "She's distraught. You
  overrate the jade. She's thinking of everything at once. All her affairs got
  into a hopeless mess from the very start. Most of her world is desert with
  water running to waste. A tropical forest is three-quarters death and decay,
  and what is alive is either murdering or being murdered. It's only when you
  come to artificial things, such as a ploughed field, for example, that you
  get space and health and every blade doing its best."</p>

  <p>"I don't call a ploughed field an artificial thing," said Arthur.</p>

  <p>"But it is," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>Dr. Fremisson was dragged into this dispute. "A ploughed field," he
  maintained, "is part of the natural life of man."</p>

  <p>"Like boots and reading."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that," said Dr. Fremisson warily. He had the usual general
  practitioner's belief that any education whatever is a terrible strain on the
  young, and he was quite on the side of Rousseau and Arthur in that matter.
  Moreover, as a result of his professional endeavours he had been forced to a
  belief that Nature's remedies are the best.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know just what does belong to the natural life of man and
  what is artificial," said Oswald. " If a ploughed field belongs then a plough
  belongs. And if a plough belongs a foundry belongs&mdash;and a coal mine. And
  you wouldn't plough in bare feet&mdash;not in those Weald Clays down there!
  You want good stout boots for those. And you'd let your ploughman read at
  least a calendar? Boots and books come in, you see."</p>

  <p>"You're a perfect lawyer, Mr. Sydenham," said the doctor, and pretended
  the discussion had become fanciful....</p>

  <p>"But you'll not leave him to go unlettered until he is half grown up!"
  said Oswald to Dolly in real distress. "It's so easy to teach 'em to read
  early and so hard later. I remember my little brother...."</p>

  <p>"I am the mother and a muth," said Dolly. "When Peter displays the
  slightest interest in the alphabet, the alphabet it shall be."</p>

  <p>Oswald felt reassured. He had a curious confidence that Dolly could be
  trusted to protect his godchild.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">One day Aunt Phyllis and Aunt Phoebe came down. Both sisters
  participated in the Stubland break back to colour, but while Aunt Phyllis was
  a wit and her hats a spree Aunt Phoebe was fantastically serious and her hats
  went beyond a joke. They got their stuffs apparently from the shop of William
  Morris and Co., they had their dresses built upon Pre-Raphaelite lines, they
  did their hair plainly and simply but very carelessly, and their hats were
  noble brimmers or extravagant toques. Their profiles were as fine almost as
  Arthur's, a type of profile not so suitable for young women as for golden
  youth. They were bright-eyed and a little convulsive in their movements.
  Beneath these extravagances and a certain conversational wildness they lived
  nervously austere lives. They were greatly delighted with Peter, but they did
  not know what to do with him. Phyllis held him rather better than Phoebe, but
  Phoebe with her chatelaine amused him rather more than Phyllis.</p>

  <p>"How happy a tinker's baby must be," said Aunt Phoebe, rattling her
  trinkets: "Or a tin-smith's."</p>

  <p>"I begin to see some use in a Hindoo woman's bangles," said Aunt Phyllis,
  "or in that clatter machine of yours, Phoebe. Every young mother should
  rattle. Make a note of it, Phoebe dear, for your book...."</p>

  <p>"Whatever you do with him, Dolly," said Aunt Phoebe, "teach him anyhow to
  respect women and treat them as his equals. From the Very First."</p>

  <p>"Meaning votes," said Aunt Phyllis. "Didums <i>want</i> give um's mummy a
  Vote den."</p>

  <p>"Never let him touch butcher's meat in any shape or form," said Aunt
  Phoebe. "Once a human child tastes blood the mischief is done."</p>

  <p>"Avoid patriotic songs and symbols," prompted Aunt Phyllis, who had heard
  these ideas already in the train coming down.</p>

  <p>"And never buy him toy soldiers drums, guns, trumpets. These things soak
  deeper into the mind than people suppose. They make wickedness domestic....
  Surround him with beautiful things. Accustom him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She winced that Arthur should hear her, but she spoke as one having a duty
  to perform.</p>

  <p>"Accustom him to the nude, Dolly, from his early years. Associate it with
  innocent amusements. Retrieve the fall. Never let him wear a hat upon his
  head nor boots upon his feet. As soon tie him up into a papoose. As soon
  tight-lace. A child's first years should be one long dream of loveliness and
  spontaneous activity."</p>

  <p>But at this point Peter betrayed signs that he found his aunts
  overstimulating. He released his grip upon the thimble-case of the
  chatelaine. His face puckered, ridges and waves and puckers of pink fatness
  ran distractedly over it, and he threw his head back and opened a large
  square toothless mouth.</p>

  <p>"Mary," cried Dolly, and a comfortable presence that had been hovering
  mistrustfully outside the door ever since the aunts appeared, entered with
  alacrity and bore Peter protectingly away.</p>

  <p>"He must be almost entirely lungs," said Aunt Phoebe, when her voice could
  be heard through the receding bawl. "Other internal organs no doubt develop
  later."</p>

  <p>"Come out to the stone table under the roses," said Dolly. "We argue there
  about Peter's upbringing almost every afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Argue, I grant you," said Aunt Phoebe, following her hostess and dangling
  her chatelaine from one hand as if to illustrate her remarks, "but argue
  rightly."</p>

  <p>When Oswald came over in the afternoon he was disposed to regard the two
  aunts as serious reinforcements to Arthur's educational heresies. Phyllis and
  Phoebe were a little inclined to be shy with him as a strange man and he and
  I Arthur did most of the talking, but they made their positions plain by
  occasional interpolations. Arthur, supported by their presence, was all for
  letting Peter grow up a wild untrammelled child of nature. Oswald became
  genuinely distressed.</p>

  <p>"But education," he protested, "is as natural to a human being as nests to
  birds."</p>

  <p>"Then why force it?" said Phyllis with dexterity.</p>

  <p>"Even a cat boxes its kittens' ears!"</p>

  <p>"A domesticated cat," said Phoebe. "A <i>civilized</i> cat."</p>

  <p>"But I've seen a wild lioness&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are we to learn how to manage our young from lions and hyenas!" cried
  Phoebe.</p>

  <p>They were too good for Oswald. He saw Peter already ruined, a fat,
  foolish, undisciplined cub.</p>

  <p>Dolly with sympathetic amusement watched his distress, which his living
  half face betrayed in the oddest contrast to his left hand calm.</p>

  <p>Arthur had been thinking gracefully while his sisters tackled their
  adversary. Now he decided to sum up the discussion. His authoritative manner
  on these occasions was always slightly irritating to Oswald. Like so many who
  read only occasionally and take thought as a special exercise, Arthur had a
  fixed persuasion that nobody else ever read or thought at all. So that he did
  not so much discuss as adjudicate.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said, "we have to be reasonable in these things. For men a
  certain artificiality is undoubtedly natural. That is, so to speak, the human
  paradox. But artificiality is the last resort. Instinct is our basis. For the
  larger part the boy has just to grow. But We watch his growth. Education is
  really watching&mdash;keeping the course. The human error is to do too much,
  to distrust instinct too much, to over-teach, over-legislate, over-manage,
  over-decorate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, you don't, my gentleman," came the voice of Mary from the shadow
  under the old pear tree.</p>

  <p>"Now I wonder " said Arthur, craning his neck to look over the rose
  bushes.</p>

  <p>"Diddums then," said Mary. "Woun't they lettim put'tt in's mouf?
  <i>Oooh</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Trust her instinct," said Dolly, and Arthur was restrained.</p>

  <p>Oswald took advantage of the interruption to take the word from
  Arthur.</p>

  <p>"We joke and sharpen our wits in this sort of talk," he said, "but
  education, you know, isn't a joke. It might be the greatest power in the
  world. If I didn't think I was a sort of school-master in Africa.... That's
  the only decent excuse a white man has for going there.... I'm getting to be
  a fanatic about education. Give me the schools of the world and I would make
  a Millennium in half a century.... You don't mean to let Peter drift. You say
  it, but you can't mean it. Drift is waste. We don't make half of what we
  could make of our children. We don't make a quarter&mdash;not a tenth. They
  could know ever so much more, think ever so much better. We're all at sixes
  and sevens."</p>

  <p>He realized he wasn't good at expressing his ideas. He had intended
  something very clear and compelling, a sort of ultimatum about Peter.</p>

  <p>"I believe in Sir Francis Galton," Aunt Phoebe remarked in this pause,
  saying with stern resolution things that she felt had to be said. They made
  her a little breathless, and she fixed her eye on the view until they were
  said. "Eugenics. It is a new idea. A revival. Plato had it. Men ought to be
  bred like horses. No marriage or any nonsense of that kind. Just a simple
  scientific blending of points. Then Everything would be different."</p>

  <p>"Almost too different," Arthur reflected....</p>

  <p>"When I consider Peter and think of all one could do for him," said
  Oswald, still floundering for some clenching way of putting it....</p>

  <p><i>§ 5</i></p>

  <p>One evening Dolly caught her cousin looking at her husband with an
  expression that stuck in her memory. It was Oswald's habit to sit if he could
  in such a position that he could rest the obliterated cheek of his face upon
  a shadowing hand, his fingers on his forehead Then one saw what; a
  pleasant-faced man he would have been if only he had left that Egyptian shell
  alone. So he was sitting on this occasion, his elbow on the arm of the
  settle. His brow was knit, his one eye keen and steady. He was listening to
  his host discoursing upon the many superiorities of the artisan in the middle
  ages to his successor of today And he seemed to be weighing and estimating
  Arthur with some little difficulty.</p>

  <p>Then, as if it was a part of the calculation he was making, he turned to
  look at Dolly. Their eyes met; for a moment he could not mask himself.</p>

  <p>Then he turned to Arthur again with his expression restored to polite
  interest.</p>

  <p>It was the most trivial of incidents, but it stayed, a mental
  burr.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">A little accident which happened a few weeks after Oswald's
  departure put the idea of making a will into Arthur's head. Dolly had wanted
  to ride a bicycle, but he had some theory that she would not need to ride
  alone or that it would over-exert her to ride alone, and so he had got a
  tandem bicycle instead, on which they could ride together. Those were the
  days when all England echoed to the strains of:</p>

  <p class="poem">"<i>Disy</i>, <i>Disy</i>, tell me your answer true; I'm arf
  <i>crizy</i> All fer the love of you-oo...</p>

  <p class="poem">Yew'd look sweet Upon the seat Of a bicycle mide fer
  two."</p>

  <p>A wandering thrush of a cockney whistled it on their first expedition.
  Dolly went out a little resentfully with Arthur's broad back obscuring most
  of her landscape, and her third ride ended in a destructive spill down
  Ipinghanger Hill. The bicycle brake was still in a primitive stage in those
  days; one steadied one's progress down a hill by the art, since lost to
  mankind again, of "back-pedalling," and Dolly's feet were carried over and
  thrown off the pedals and the machine got away. Arthur's nerve was a good
  one. He fought the gathering pace and steered with skill down to the very
  last bend of that downland descent. The last corner got them. They took the
  bank and hedge sideways and the crumpled tandem remained on one side of the
  bank and Arthur and Dolly found themselves torn and sprained but essentially
  unbroken in a hollow of wet moss and marsh-mallows beyond the hedge.</p>

  <p>The sense of adventure helped them through an afternoon of toilsome
  return....</p>

  <p>"But we might both have been killed that time, said Arthur with a certain
  gusto.</p>

  <p>"If we had," said Arthur presently, expanding that idea, "what would have
  become of Peter?"...</p>

  <p>They had both made simple wills copied out of <i>Whitaker's Almanack</i>,
  leaving everything to each other; it had not occurred to them before that two
  young parents who cross glaciers together, go cycling together, travel in the
  same is, cross the seas in the same boats, might very easily get into the
  same smash. In that case the law, it appeared, presumed that the wife, being
  the weaker vessel, would expire first, and so Uncle Rigby, who had relapsed
  more and more stuffily into evangelical narrowness since his marriage, would
  extend a dark protection over Peter's life. "Lucy wouldn't even feed him
  properly," said Dolly. She s so close and childlessly inhuman. I can't bear
  to think of it.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, if by any chance Dolly should show a flicker of life
  after the extinction of Arthur, Peter and all his possessions would fall
  under the hand of Dolly s shady brother, the failure of the family, a being
  of incalculable misdemeanours, a gross, white-faced literary man, an artist
  in parody (itself a vice), who smelt of tobacco always, and already at
  thirty-eight, it was but too evident, preferred port and old brandy to his
  self-respect.</p>

  <p>"We ought to remake our wills and each appoint the same guardian," said
  Arthur.</p>

  <p>It was not very easy to find the perfect guardian. Then as Arthur sat at
  lunch one day the sunshine made a glory of the little silver tankard that
  adorned the Welsh, dresser at the end of the room.</p>

  <p>"Dolly," he said, "old Oswald would like this job."</p>

  <p>She'd known that by instinct from the first, but she had never expected
  Arthur to discover it.</p>

  <p>"He's got a sort of fancy for Peter," he said.</p>

  <p>"I think we could trust him," said Dolly temperately.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Oswald," said Arthur; "he's a tragic figure. That mask of his
  cuts him off from so much. He idolizes you and Peter, Dolly. You don't
  suspect it, but he does. He's our man."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap03"
     name="chap03">CHAPTER III. &mdash; ARTHUR OR OSWALD?</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">DESTINY is at times a slashing sculptor. At first Destiny
  seemed to have intended Oswald Sydenham to be a specimen of the school-boy
  hero; he made record scores in the school matches, climbed trees higher than
  any one else did, and was moreover a good all-round boy at his work; he was
  healthy, very tall but strong, dark, pleasant-looking, and popular with men
  and women and&mdash;he was quite aware of these facts. He shone with equal
  brightness as a midshipman; he dared, he could lead. Several women of thirty
  or thereabouts adored him&mdash;before it is good for youth to be adored. He
  had a knack of success, he achieved a number of things; he judged himself and
  found that this he had done "pretty decently", and that "passing well." Then
  Destiny decided apparently that he was not thinking as freshly or as
  abundantly as he ought to do&mdash;a healthy, successful life does not leave
  much time for original thinking&mdash;and smashed off the right side of his
  face. In a manner indeed quite creditable to him. It was given to few men in
  those pacific days to get the V.C. before the age of twenty-one.</p>

  <p>He lay in hospital for a long spell, painful but self-satisfied. The
  nature of his injuries was not yet clear to him. Presently he would get all
  right again. "V.C.," he whispered. "At twenty. Pretty decent."</p>

  <p>He saw himself in the looking-glass with half his face bandaged, and there
  was nothing very shocking in that. Then one day came his first glimpse of his
  unbandaged self....</p>

  <p>"One must take it decently," he said to himself again and again through a
  night of bottomless dismay.</p>

  <p>And, "How can I look a woman in the face again?"</p>

  <p>He stuck to his bandages as long as possible.</p>

  <p>He learnt soon enough that some women could not look him in the face
  anyhow, and among them was one who should have hidden her inability from him
  at any cost.</p>

  <p>And he was not only disfigured; he was crippled and unserviceable; so the
  Navy decided. Something had gone out of his eyesight; he could no longer jump
  safely nor hit a ball with certainty. He could not play tennis at all; he had
  ten minutes of humiliation with one of the nurses, protesting all the time.
  "Give me another chance and I'll begin to get into it. Let me get my eye
  in&mdash;my only eye in. Oh, the devil! give a chap a chance!... Sorry,
  nurse. Now!... Damn! It's no good. Oh God! it's no good. What shall I do?"
  Even his walk had now a little flavour of precaution. But he could still
  shoot straight up to two or three hundred yards.... These facts formed the
  basis for much thinking on the part of a young man who had taken it for
  granted that he was destined to a bright and leading role in the world.</p>

  <p>When first he realized that he was crippled and disabled for life, he
  thought of suicide. But in an entirely detached and theoretical spirit.
  Suicide had no real attraction for him. He meant to live anyhow. The only
  question therefore was the question of what he was to do. He would lie awake
  at nights sketching out careers that did not require athleticism or a good
  presence. "I suppose it's got to be chiefly using my brains," he decided.
  "The great trouble will be not to get fat and stuffy. I've never liked
  indoors...."</p>

  <p>He did his best to ignore the fact that an honourable life before him
  meant a life of celibacy. But he could not do so. For many reasons arising
  out of his temperament and the experiences those women friendships had thrust
  upon him, that limitation had an effect of dismaying cruelty upon his mind.
  "Perhaps some day I shall find a blind girl," he said, and felt his face
  doubtfully. "Oh, damn!" He perceived that the sewing up of his face was a
  mere prelude to the sewing up of his life. It distressed him beyond measure.
  It was the persuasion that the deprivation was final that obsessed him with
  erotic imaginations. For a time he was obsessed almost to the verge of
  madness.</p>

  <p>He had moods of raving anger on account of this extravagant and
  uncontrollable preoccupation. He would indulge secretly in storms of cursing,
  torrents of foulness and foul blasphemies that left him strangely relieved.
  But he had an unquenchable sense of the need of a fight.</p>

  <p>"I'll get square with this damned world somehow," he said. "I won't be
  beaten."</p>

  <p>There were some ugly and dismal aspects in his attempt not to be beaten,
  plunges into strange mires with remorse at the far side. They need not
  deflect our present story.</p>

  <p>"What's the whole beastly game about anyhow?" he asked. "Why are we made
  like this?"</p>

  <p>Meanwhile his pride kept up a valiant front. No one should suspect he was
  not cheerful. No one should suspect he felt himself to be a thing apart. He
  hid his vicious strain&mdash;or made a jest of it. He developed a style of
  humour that turned largely on his disfigurement. His internal stresses
  reflected a dry bitterness upon the world.</p>

  <p>It was a great comfort presently to get hints that here and there other
  souls had had to learn lessons as hard as his own. One day he chanced upon
  the paralyzed Heine's farewell to beauty. "Perhaps," he said, "I've only got
  by a short cut to where a lot of people must come out sooner or later. Every
  one who lives on must get bald and old&mdash;anyhow." He took a hint from an
  article he found in some monthly review upon Richard Crookback. "A crippled
  body makes a crippled mind," he read. "Is that going to happen to me?"</p>

  <p>Thence he got to: "If I think about myself now," he asked, "what else can
  happen? I'll go bitter."</p>

  <p>"Something I can do well, but something in which I can forget myself."
  That, he realized, was his recipe.</p>

  <p>"Let's find out what the whole beastly game is about," he decided&mdash;a
  large proposition. "And stop thinking of my personal set-back
  altogether."</p>

  <p>But that is easier said than done.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">HE would, he decided, "go in for science."</p>

  <p>He had read about science in the magazines, and about its remorseless way
  with things. Science had always had a temperamental call upon his mind. The
  idea of a pitiless acceptance of fact had now a greater fascination than ever
  for him. Art was always getting sentimental and sensuous&mdash;this was in
  the early 'eighties; religion was mystical and puritanical; science just
  looked at facts squarely, and would see a cancer or a liver fluke or a
  healing scar as beautiful as Venus. Moreover it told you coldly and correctly
  of the skin glands of Venus. It neither stimulated nor condemned. It would
  steady the mind. He had an income of four hundred a year, and fairly good
  expectations of another twelve hundred. There was nothing to prevent him
  going in altogether for scientific work.</p>

  <p>Those were the great days when Huxley lectured on zoology at South
  Kensington, and to him Oswald went. Oswald did indeed find science consoling
  and inspiring. Scientific studies were at once rarer and more touched by
  enthusiasm a quarter of a century ago than they are now, and he was soon a
  passionate naturalist, consumed by the insatiable craving to know how. That
  little, long upper laboratory in the Normal School of Science, as the place
  was then called, with the preparations and diagrams along one side, the sinks
  and windows along the other, the row of small tables down the windows, and
  the ever-present vague mixed smell of methylated spirit, Canada balsam, and a
  sweetish decay, opened vast new horizons to him. To the world of the
  eighteen-eighties the story of life, of the origin and branching out of
  species, of the making of continents, was still the most inspiring of new
  romances. Comparative anatomy in particular was then a great and
  philosophical "new learning," a mighty training of the mind; the drift of
  biological teaching towards specialization was still to come.</p>

  <p>For a time Oswald thought of giving his life to biology. But biology
  unhappily had little need of Oswald. He was a clumsy dissector because of his
  injury, and unhandy at most of the practical work, he had to work with his
  head on one side and rather close to what he was doing, but it dawned upon
  him one day as a remarkable discovery that neither personal beauty nor great
  agility are demanded from an explorer or collector. It was a picture he saw
  in an illustrated paper of H. M. Stanley traversing an African forest in a
  litter, with a great retinue of porters, that first put this precious idea
  into his head. "One wants pluck and a certain toughness," he said. "I'm tough
  enough. And then I shall be out of reach of&mdash;Piccadilly."</p>

  <p>He had excellent reasons for disliking the West End. It lured him, it
  exasperated him, it demoralized him and made him ashamed. He got and read
  every book of African travel he could hear of. In 1885 he snatched at an
  opportunity and went with an expedition through Portuguese East Africa to
  Nyasa and Tanganyika. He found fatigue and illness and hardship
  there&mdash;and peace of nerve and imagination. He remained in that region of
  Africa for three years.</p>

  <p>But biology and Africa were merely the fields of human interest in which
  Oswald's mind was most active in those days. Such inquiries were only a part
  of his valiant all-round struggle to reconstruct the life that it had become
  impossible to carry on as a drama of the noble and picturesque loves and
  adventures of Oswald Sydenham. His questions led him into philosophy; he
  tried over religion, which had hitherto in his romantic phase simply
  furnished suitable church scenery for meetings and repentances. He read many
  books, listened to preachers, hunted out any teacher who seemed to promise
  help in the mending of his life, considered this "movement" and that
  "question." His resolve to find what "the whole beastly game was about," was
  no passing ejaculation. He followed the trend of his time towards a religious
  scepticism and an entire neglect of current politics. Religion was then at
  the nadir of formalism; current politics was an outwardly idiotic, inwardly
  dishonest, party duel between the followers of Gladstone and Disraeli. Social
  and economic questions he was inclined to leave to the professors. Those were
  the early days of socialist thought in England, the days before Fabianism,
  and he did not take to the new teachings very kindly. He was a moderate man
  in aesthetic matters, William Morris left him tepid, he had no sense of
  grievance against machinery and aniline dyes, he did not grasp the workers 5
  demand because it was outside his traditions and experiences. Science seemed
  to him more and more plainly to be the big regenerative thing in human life,
  and the mission immediately before men of energy was the spreading of
  civilization, that is to say of knowledge, apparatus, clear thought, and
  release from instinct and superstition, about the world.</p>

  <p>In those days science was at its maximum of aggressive hopefulness. With
  the idea of scientific progress there was also bound up in many British minds
  the idea of a racial mission. The long Napoleonic wars had cut off British
  thought from the thought of the continent of Europe, and this separation was
  never completely healed throughout the nineteenth century. In spite of their
  world-empire the British remained remarkably self-centred and self-satisfied.
  They were a world-people, and no other people were. They were at once insular
  and world-wide. During the nineteenth century until its last quarter there
  was no real challenge to their extra-European ascendancy. A man like Sydenham
  did not so much come to the conclusion that the subjugation and civilization
  of the world by science and the Anglican culture was the mission of the
  British Empire, as find that conclusion ready-made by tradition and
  circumstances in his mind. He did not even trouble to express it; it seemed
  to him self-evident. When Kipling wrote of the White Man's Burthen, Briton
  was understood. Everywhere the British went about the world, working often
  very disinterestedly and ably, quite unaware of the amazement and
  exasperation created in French and German and American minds by the discovery
  of these tranquil assumptions.</p>

  <p>So it was with Oswald Sydenham for many years. For three years he was in
  the district between Bangweolo and Lake Nyasa, making his headquarters at
  Blantyre, collecting specimens and learning much about mankind and womankind
  in that chaos of Arab slavers, Scotch missionaries, traders, prospectors,
  native tribes, Zulu raiders Indian store-keepers, and black "Portuguese";
  then, discovering that Blantyre had picked up a nick-name from the natives of
  "Half Face" for him, he took a temporary dislike to Blantyre, and decided to
  go by way of Tanganyika either to Uganda or Zanzibar, first sending home a
  considerable collection of specimens by way of Mozambique. He got through at
  last to Uganda, after some ugly days and hours, only to learn of a very good
  reason why he should return at once to the southern lakes. He heard that a
  new British consul was going up the Zambesi to Nyasaland with a British
  protectorate up his sleeve, and he became passionately anxious to secure a
  position near the ear of this official. There were many things the man ought
  to know at once that neither traders nor mission men would tell him.</p>

  <p>To get any official position it was necessary for Oswald to return to
  London and use the influence of various allied Sydenhams. He winced at the
  thought of coming back to England and meeting the eyes of people who had
  known him before his disfigurement, but the need to have some sort of
  official recognition if he was to explain himself properly in Nyasaland made
  it necessary that he should come. That was in the summer of 1889.</p>

  <p>He went down to visit his uncle at Long Downport while the "influences"
  brewed, and here it was he first met Dolly. He did not know it, but now his
  face was no longer a shock to the observer. The injured side which had been
  at first mostly a harsh, reddish blank scar with a glass eye, had not only
  been baked and weatherworn by Africa, but it had in some indefinable way been
  assimilated by the unmutilated half. It had been taken up into his
  individuality; his renascent character possessed it now; it had been
  humanized and become a part of him; it had acquired dignity. Muscles and
  nerves had reconstructed some of their relations and partially resumed
  abandoned duties. If only he had known it, there was nothing repulsive about
  him to Dolly. Though he was not a pretty man, he had the look of a strong
  one. The touch of imagination in her composition made her see behind this
  half vizor of immobilized countenance the young hero who had risked giving
  his life for his fellows; his disfigurement did but witness the price he had
  paid. In those days at home in England one forgot that most men were brave.
  No one had much occasion nor excuse for bravery. A brave man seemed a
  wonderful man.</p>

  <p>He loved Dolly with a love in which a passion of gratitude was added to
  the commoner ingredients. Her smiling eyes restored his self-respect. He felt
  he was no longer a horror to women. But could it be love she felt for him?
  Was not that to presume too far? She gave him friendliness. He guessed she
  gave him pity. She gave him the infinite reassurance of her frank eyes. Would
  it not be an ill return to demand more than these gracious gifts?</p>

  <p>The possibility of humiliation&mdash;and of humiliating
  Dolly&mdash;touched a vein of abject cowardice in his composition. He could
  not bring himself to the test. He tried some vague signalling that she
  did,not seem to understand. His time ran out and he went&mdash;awkwardly.
  When he returned for a second time, he returned to find that Arthur's fine
  profile had eclipsed his memory.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">AFTER the visit that made him a godfather, Oswald did not
  return again to England until his godson had attained the ripe age of four
  years. And when Oswald came again he had changed very greatly. He was now
  almost completely his new self; the original good-looking midshipman, that
  sunny "type," was buried deep in a highly individualized person, who had in
  England something of the effect of a block of seasoned ship's timber among
  new-cut blocks of white deal. He had been used and tested. He had been
  scarred, and survived. His obsession had lifted. He had got himself well
  under control.</p>

  <p>He was now acquiring a considerable knowledge of things African, and more
  particularly of those mysterious processes of change and adventure that were
  presented to the British consciousness in those days as "empire
  building."</p>

  <p>He had seen this part of Africa change dramatically under his eyes. When
  first he had gone out it was but a dozen years from the death of Livingstone,
  who had been the first white man in this land. In Livingstone's wake had come
  rifles, missionaries, and the big game hunter. The people of the Shire
  Highlands were now mostly under the rule of chiefs who had come into the
  country with Livingstone as Basuto porters, and whom he had armed with
  rifles. The town of Blantyre had been established by Scotch missionaries to
  preserve Livingstone's memory and his work. Things had gone badly for a time.
  A certain number of lay helpers to the Church of Scotland Mission had set up
  as quasi-independent sovereigns, with powers of life and death, about their
  mission stations; many of them had got completely out of hand and were guilty
  of much extortion and cruelty. One of them, Fennick, murdered a chief in a
  drunken bout, got himself killed, and nearly provoked a native war only a
  year or so before Oswald's arrival. Arab adventurers from Zanzibar and black
  Portuguese from the Zambesi were also pushing into this country. The Yao to
  the north and the Angoni-Zulus to the south, tribes of a highly militant
  spirit, added their quota to a kaleidoscope of murder, rape, robbery and
  incalculable chances, which were further complicated by the annexational
  propaganda of more or less vaguely accredited German, Belgian, Portuguese and
  British agents.</p>

  <p>Oswald reached Tanganyika in the company of a steamboat (in portable
  pieces) which had been sent by the Scotch missionaries by way of the Zambesi
  and Lake Nyasa; he helped with its reconstruction, and took a considerable
  share in fighting the Arab slavers between Nyasa and Tanganyika. One of his
  earliest impressions of African warfare was the figure of a blistered and
  wounded negro standing painfully to tell his story of the fight from which he
  had escaped. "You see," the Scotch trader who was translating, explained,
  "he's saying they had just spears and the Arabs had guns, and they got driven
  back on the lagoon into the reeds. The reeds were dry, and the Arabs set them
  on fire. That's how he's got his arm and leg burns, he says. Nasty places.
  But they'll heal all right; he's a vegetarian and a
  teetotaller&mdash;usually. Those reeds burn like thatch, and if the poor
  devils ran out they got stabbed or shot, and if they went into the water the
  crocodiles would be getting them. I know that end of the lake. It's fairly
  alive with crocodiles. A perfect bank holiday for the crocodiles. Poor
  devils! Poor devils!"</p>

  <p>The whole of Africa, seen in those days from the viewpoint of Blantyre,
  was the most desolating spectacle of human indiscipline it is possible to
  conceive. Everywhere was the adventurer and violence and cruelty and fever,
  nowhere law and discipline. The mission men turned robbers, the traders
  became drunkards, the porters betrayed their masters. Mission intrigued
  against mission, disobeyed the consuls, and got at hopeless loggerheads with
  the traders and early planters. Where there is no control, there is no self-
  control. Thirst and lust racked every human being; even some of the
  missionaries deemed it better to marry native women than to burn. In his own
  person Oswald played microcosm to human society. He had his falls and bitter
  moments, but his faith in science and civilization, human will and self-
  control, stumbled to its feet again. "We'll get things straight here
  presently," he said. Of himself as of Nyasaland. "Never say damned till
  you're dead."</p>

  <p>His first return to England not only gave him a futile dream of Dolly to
  keep him clean and fastidious in Africa, but restored his waning belief in an
  orderly world. Seen from that distant point, the conflicts in Africa fell
  into a proper perspective as the froth and confusion before the launching of
  a new and unprecedented peace. Africa had been a black stew of lust,
  bloodshed and disease since the beginnings of history. These latter days were
  but the last flare-up of an ancient disorder before the net of the law and
  the roads and railways, the net of the hospitals and microscopes and
  anthropologists, caught and tamed and studied and mastered the black
  continent. He got his official recognition and went back to join this new
  British agent, Mr. Harry Johnston, in Nyasaland and see a kind of order
  establish itself and grow more orderly and secure, over the human confusion
  round and about the Shire Highlands. He found in his chief, who presently
  became Commissioner and Administrator (with a uniform rather like an
  Admiral's for state occasions), a man after his own heart, with the same
  unquenchable faith in the new learning of science and the same belief in the
  better future that opened before mankind. The Commissioner, a little
  animated, talkative man of tireless interest and countless interests,
  reciprocated Oswald's liking. In Central Africa one is either too busy or too
  tired and ill to do much talking, but there were one or two evenings when
  Oswald was alone with his chief and they could exchange views. Johnston had a
  modern religious philosophy that saw God chiefly through the valiant hearts
  of men; he made Oswald read Winwood Reade's <i>Martyrdom Of Man</i>, which
  had become, so to speak, his own theological point of departure. It was a
  book of sombre optimism productive of a kind of dark
  hopefulness&mdash;"provided we stick it"&mdash;that accorded well with the
  midday twilight of the Congo forests into which Oswald was presently sent. It
  marched with much that Oswald had been thinking out for himself. It did not
  so much tell him new things as crystallize his own thoughts.</p>

  <p>Two ideas were becoming the guiding lights of Oswald Sydenham's thought
  and life. One was the idea of self-devotion to British Imperial expansion.
  The British Empire was to be the instrument of world civilization, the
  protectress and vehicle of science; the critical examination of Imperialism
  in the light of these pretensions had still to come. He had still to discover
  that science could be talked in other languages than English, and thought go
  on behind brown and yellow foreheads. His second idea was that the civilizing
  process was essentially an educational process, a training in toleration and
  devotion, the tempering of egotism by wide ideas. Thereby "we shall get
  things straighter presently. We shall get them very straight in the long
  run."...</p>

  <p>Directly after Oswald's second visit to England, the one in which he
  became Peter's godfather, a series of campaigns against the slave-raiding
  Arab chiefs, who still remained practically independent in the Protectorate,
  began. Oswald commanded in a very "near thing" in the Highlands, during which
  he held a small stockade against the Yao with six Sikhs and a few Atonga for
  three days, and was finally rescued when his ammunition had almost given out;
  and after that he was entrusted with a force of over three hundred men in the
  expedition that ended in the capture and hanging of old Mlozi. He fought in
  steamy heat and pouring rain, his head aching and his body shivering, and he
  ended his campaigning with a first experience of blackwater fever. It struck
  him as an unutterably beastly experience, although the doctor assured him he
  had been let down lightly. However, this was almost the end of the
  clearing-up fighting in the Protectorate, and Oswald could take things easily
  for a time. Thereafter the work of pacification, road-making, and postal and
  telegraphic organization went on swiftly and steadily.</p>

  <p>But these days of peaceful organization were ended by a disagreeable
  emotional situation. Oswald found himself amused and attracted by a pretty
  woman he despised thoroughly and disliked a good deal. She was the wife of a
  planter near Blantyre. So far from thinking him an ugly and disfigured being,
  she made it plain to him that his ugliness was an unprecedented excitement
  for her. Always imprisoned in his mind was the desire to have a woman of his
  very own; at times he envied even the Yao warriors their black slave
  mistresses; and he was more than half disposed to snatch this craving
  creature in spite of the lies and tricks and an incessant chattering vanity
  that disfigured her soul, and end all his work in Africa, to gratify, if only
  for some lurid months, his hunger for a human possession. The situation took
  him by surprise in a negligent phase; he pulled up sharply when he was
  already looking down a slippery slope of indignity and dishonour. If he had
  as yet done no foolish things he had thought and said them. The memory of
  Dolly came to him in the night. He declared to himself, and he tried to
  declare it without reservation, that it was better to sit for a time within a
  yard of Dolly's inaccessible goodness than paint a Protectorate already
  British enough to be scandal-loving, with the very brightest hues of
  passion's flame-colour. He ran away from this woman.</p>

  <p>So he came back&mdash;by no means single-mindedly. There were lapses
  indeed on the slow steamer journey to Egypt into almost unendurable torments
  of regret. Of which, however, no traces appeared when he came into the
  presence of Dolly and his godson at The Ingle-Nook.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">Peter took to Oswald and Oswald took to Peter from the
  beginning.</p>

  <p>Peter, by this time, had Joan for a foster-sister. And also he had Nobby.
  Nobby was a beloved Dutch doll, armless and legless, but adored and trusted
  as no other doll has ever been in the whole history of dolls since the world
  began. He had been Peter's first doll. One day when he was playing tunes with
  Nobby on the nursery fender, one exceptionally accented note splintered off a
  side of Nobby's smooth but already much obliterated countenance. Peter was
  not so much grieved as dismayed, and Arthur was very sympathetic and did his
  best to put things right with a fine brush and some black paint. But when
  Peter saw Oswald he met him with a cry of delight and recognition.</p>

  <p>"It's Nobby!" he cried.</p>

  <p>"But who's Nobby?" asked Oswald.</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i>&mdash;Nobby," Peter insisted with a squeak, and turned about
  just in time to prevent Arthur from hiding the fetish away. "Gimme my Nobby!"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"Nobby is his private god," Dolly hastened to explain. "It is his dearest
  possession. It is the most beautiful thing in the world to him. Every night
  he must have Nobby under his pillow...."</p>

  <p>Oswald stood with his wooden double in his hand for a moment, recognized
  himself at a glance, thought it over, and smiled his grim, one-sided
  smile.</p>

  <p>"I'm Nobby right enough," he said. "Big Nobby, Peter. He takes you off to
  Dreamland. Some day I'll take you to the Mountains of the Moon."</p>

  <p>So far Joan, a black-headed, black-eyed doll, had been coyly on the edge
  of the conversation, a little disposed to take refuge in the skirts of Mary.
  Now she made a great effort on her own account. "Nobby," she screamed; "big,
  <i>Big</i> Nobby!" And, realizing she had made a success, hid her face.</p>

  <p>"Nobby to you," said Oswald. "Does <i>that</i> want a godfather too? It's
  my role...."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">THE changes in the Stubland nursery, though they were the
  most apparent, were certainly not the greatest in the little home that looked
  over the Weald. Arthur had been unfaithful to Dolly&mdash;on principle it
  would seem. That did not reach Oswald's perceptions all at once, though even
  on his first visit he felt a difference between them.</p>

  <p>The later 'nineties were the "Sex Problem" period in Great Britain. Not
  that sex has been anything else than a perplexity in all ages, but it was
  just about this time that that unanswerable "Why not?"&mdash;that bacterium
  of social decay, spreading out from the dark corners of unventilated
  religious dogmas into a moribund system of morals, reached, in the case of
  the children of the serious middle-classes of Great Britain, this important
  field of conduct. The manner of the question and the answer remained still
  serious. Those were the days of "The Woman Who Did" and the "Keynote Series,"
  of adultery without fun and fornication for conscience' sake. Arthur, with
  ample leisure, a high-grade bicycle, the consciousness of the artistic
  temperament and a gnawing secret realization, which had never left him since
  those early days in Florence, that Dolly did not really consider him as an
  important person in the world's affairs, was all too receptive of the new
  suggestions. After some discursive liberal conversations with various people
  he found the complication he sought in the youngest of three plain but
  passionate sisters, who lived a decorative life in a pretty little modern
  cottage on the edge of a wood beyond Limpsfield. The new gale of emancipation
  sent a fire through her veins. Her soul within her was like a flame. She
  wrote poetry with a peculiar wistful charm, and her decorative methods were
  so similar to Arthur's that it seemed natural to conclude they might be the
  precursors of an entirely new school. They put a new interest and life into
  each other's work. It became a sort of collaboration....</p>

  <p>The affair was not all priggishness on Arthur's part. The woman was
  honestly in love; and for most men love makes love; there is a pride and
  fascination for them in a new love adventure, in the hesitation, the dash,
  the soft capture, the triumph and kindness, that can manage with very poor
  excuses. And such a beautiful absence of mutual criticism always, such a
  kindly accepting blindness in passionate eyes!</p>

  <p>At first Dolly did not realize how Arthur was rounding off his life. She
  was busy now with her niece, her disreputable elder brother's love child, as
  well as Peter; she did not miss Arthur very much during his increasing
  absences. Th«n Arthur, who wished to savour all the aspects of the new
  situation, revealed it to her one August evening in general terms by a
  discourse upon polygamy.</p>

  <p>Dolly's quick mind seized the situation long before Arthur could state
  it.</p>

  <p>She did not guess who her successful rival was. She did not know it was
  the younger Miss Blend, that familiar dark squat figure, quick and almost
  crowded in speech, and with a peculiar avidity about her manner and bearing.
  She assumed it must be some person of transcendant and humiliating merit;
  that much her romantic standards demanded. She was also a little disgusted,
  as though Arthur had discovered himself to be physically unclean. Her
  immediate impulse was to arrest a specific confession.</p>

  <p>"You forget instinct, Arthur dear," she said, colouring brightly. "What
  you say is perfectly reasonable, wonderfully so. Only&mdash;it would make me
  feel sick&mdash;I mean sick&mdash;if, for example, I thought you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She turned away and looked at the view.</p>

  <p>"Are you so sure that is instinct? Or convention?" he asked, after a pause
  of half comprehension.</p>

  <p>"Instinct&mdash;for certain.... Lovers are one. Whither you go, <i>I</i>
  go&mdash;in the spirit. You can't go alone with another woman while
  I&mdash;while I In those things....</p>

  <p>Oh, it's inconceivable I"</p>

  <p>"That's a primitive point of view."</p>

  <p>"Love&mdash;lust for the matter of that.... They are primitive things,"
  said Dolly, undisguisedly wretched.</p>

  <p>"There's reason in the control of them."</p>

  <p>"Polygamy!" she cried scornfully.</p>

  <p>Arthur was immensely disconcerted.</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette, and his movements were slow and clumsy.</p>

  <p>"Ideas may differ," he said lamely....</p>

  <p>He did not make his personal confession after all.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the night Arthur was lying awake thinking with unusual
  violence, and for the first time for a long while seeing a question from a
  standpoint other than his own. Also he fancied he had heard a sound of great
  significance at bedtime. That uncertain memory worried him more and more. He
  got up now with excessive precautions against noise and crept with extreme
  slowness and care to the little door between his room and Dolly's. It was
  locked.</p>

  <p>Then she had understood!</p>

  <p>A solemn, an almost awe-stricken Arthur paddled back to his own bed
  through a pool of moonlight on the floor. A pair of pallid, blue-veined feet
  and bright pyjama legs and a perplexed, vague continuation upward was all the
  moon could see.</p><br>

  <h3>§6</h3>

  <p class="first">It was, it seemed to Arthur, a very hard, resolute and
  unapproachable Dolly who met him at the breakfast-table on the brick terrace
  outside the little kitchen window. He reflected that the ultimate injury a
  wife can do to a husband is ruthless humiliation, and she was certainly
  making him feel most abominably ashamed of himself. She had always, he
  reflected, made him feel that she didn't very greatly believe in him. There
  was just a touch of the spitfire in Dolly....</p>

  <p>But, indeed, within Dolly was a stormy cavern of dismay and indignation
  and bitter understanding. She had wept a great deal in the night and thought
  interminably; she knew already that there was much more in this thing than a
  simple romantic issue.</p>

  <p>Her first impulses had been quite in the romantic tradition: "Never
  again!" and "Now we part!" and "Henceforth we are as strangers!"</p>

  <p>She had already got ten thousand miles beyond that. She did not even know
  whether she hated him or loved him. She doubted if she had ever known.</p>

  <p>Her state of mind was an extraordinary patchwork. Every possibility in her
  being was in a state of intense excitement. She was swayed by a violently
  excited passion for him that was only restrained by a still more violent
  resolve to punish and prevail over him. He had never seemed so good-looking,
  so pleasant-faced, so much "old Arthur"&mdash;or such a fatuous being. And he
  was watching her, watching her, watching her, obliquely, furtively, while he
  pretended awkwardly to be at his ease. What a scared comic thing Arthur could
  be! There were moments when she could have screamed with laughter at his
  solicitous face.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile some serviceable part of her mind devoted itself to the table
  needs of Joan and Peter.</p>

  <p>Peter was disposed to incite Joan to a porridge-eating race. You just
  looked at Joan and began to eat fast very quietly, and then Joan would catch
  on and begin to eat fast too. Her spoon would go quicker and quicker, and
  make a noise&mdash;whack, whack, whack! And as it was necessary that she
  should keep her wicked black eyes fixed on your plate all the time to see how
  you were getting on, she would sometimes get an empty spoon up, sometimes
  miss her mouth, sometimes splash. But Mummy took a strong hand that morning.
  'P &gt;T ( . was an argument, but Mummy was unusually firm. She turned
  breakfast into a drill. "Fill spoon. Tention! Mouf. Withdraw spoon." Not bad
  fun, really, though Mummy looked much too stern for any liberties. And Daddy
  wasn't game for a diversion. Wouldn't look at a little boy....</p>

  <p>After breakfast Arthur decided that he was not going to be bullied. He got
  out his bicycle and announced in a dry, off-hand tone that he was going out
  for the day.</p>

  <p>"So long, Guv'nor," said Dolly, as off-handedly, and stood at the door in
  an expressionless way until he was beyond the green road gate.</p>

  <p>Then she strolled back through the house into the garden, and stood for a
  time considering the situation.</p>

  <p>"So I am to bring up two babies&mdash;and grow old, while this goes on!"
  she whispered.</p>

  <p>She went to clear the things off the breakfast-table, and stood motionless
  again.</p>

  <p>"My God!" she said; "why wasn't I born a man?"</p>

  <p>And that, or some image that followed it, let her thoughts out to Africa
  and a sturdy, teak-complexioned figure with a one-sided face under its big
  sun-helmet....</p>

  <p>"Why didn't I marry a man?" she said. "Why didn't I get me a
  mate?"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">THESE were the primary factors of the situation that Oswald,
  arriving six weeks later, was slowly to discover and comprehend. As he did so
  he felt the self-imposed restraints of his relations to Arthur and Dolly slip
  from him. Arthur was now abundantly absent. Never before had Oswald and Dolly
  been so much alone together. Peter and Joan m the foreground were a small
  restraint upon speech and understanding.</p>

  <p>But now this story falls away from romance. Romance requires that a woman
  should love a man or not love a man; that she should love one man only and go
  with the man of her choice, that no other consideration, unless it be duty or
  virtue, should matter. But Dolly found with infinite dismay that she was
  divided.</p>

  <p>She loved certain things in Oswald and certain things in Arthur. The
  romantic tradition which ruled in these matters, provided no instructions in
  such a case. The two men were not sufficiently contrasted. One was not black
  enough; the other not white enough. Oswald was a strong man and brave, but
  Arthur, though he lived a tame and indolent life, seemed almost insensible to
  danger. She had never seen him afraid or rattled. He was a magnificent rock
  climber, for example; his physical nerve was perfect. Everything would have
  been so much simpler if he had been a "soft." She was sensitive to physical
  quality. It was good to watch Arthur move; Oswald's injuries made him clumsy
  and a little cautious in his movements. But Oswald was growing into a
  politician; he had already taken great responsibilities in Africa; he talked
  like a prince and like a lover about his Atonga and his Sikhs, and about the
  whiteclad kingdom of Uganda and about the fantastic gallant Masai, who must
  be saved from extermination. That princely way of thinking was the fine thing
  about him; there he outshone Arthur. He was wonderful to her when he talked
  of those Central African kingdoms that were rotting into chaos under the
  influence of the Arab and European invasions, chaos from, which a few honest
  Englishmen might yet rescue a group of splendid peoples.</p>

  <p>He could be loyal all through; it was his nature. And he loved
  her&mdash;as Arthur had never loved her. With a gleam of fierceness. As
  though there was a streak of anger in his love.</p>

  <p>"Why do you endure it?" he fretted. "Why do you endure it?"</p>

  <p>But he was irritable, absurd about many little things. He could lose his
  temper over games; particularly if Arthur played too.</p>

  <p>Yet there was a power about Oswald. It was a quality that made her fear
  him and herself. She feared for the freedom of her spirit. If ever she became
  Oswald's she would become his much more than she had ever been Arthur's.
  There was something about him that was real and commanding, in a sense in
  which nothing was real about Arthur.</p>

  <p>She had a dread, which made her very wary, that one day Oswald would seize
  upon her, that he would take her in his arms and kiss her. This possibility
  accumulated. She had a feeling that it would be something very dreadful,
  painful and enormous; that it would be like being branded, that therewith
  Arthur would be abolished for her.... At the thought she realized that she
  did not want Arthur to be abolished. She had an enormous kindliness for
  Arthur that would have been impossible without a little streak of humorous
  superiority. If Oswald threatened her with his latent mastery, Arthur had the
  appeal of much dependence.</p>

  <p>And apart from Oswald or Arthur, something else in her protested, an
  instinct or a deeply-rooted tradition. The thought of a second man was like
  thinking of the dislocation of her soul. It involved a nightmare of
  overlapping, of partial obliteration, of contrast and replacement, in things
  that she felt could have no honour or dignity unless they are as simple and
  natural as inadvertent actions....</p>

  <p>The thing that swayed her most towards Oswald, oddly enough, was his
  mutilated face. That held her back from any decision against him. "If I do
  not go with him," she thought, "he will think it is that." She could not
  endure that he should be so wounded.</p>

  <p>Then, least personal and selfish thought of all, was the question of Joan
  and Peter. What would happen to them? In any case, Dolly knew they would come
  to her. There was no bitter vindictiveness in Arthur, and he shirked every
  responsibility he could. She could leave him and go to Uganda and return to
  them. She knew there would be no attempt to deprive her of Peter. Oswald
  would be as good a father as Arthur. The children weighed on neither
  side.</p>

  <p>Dolly's mind had become discontinuous as it had never been discontinuous
  before. None of these things were in her mind all the time; sometimes one
  aspect was uppermost and sometimes another. Sometimes she was ruled by
  nothing but vindictive pride which urged her to put herself on a level with
  Arthur. At times again her pride was white and tight-lipped, exhorting her
  above all things not to put herself on a level with Arthur. When Oswald
  pressed her, her every impulse was to resist; when he was away and she felt
  her loneliness&mdash;and his&mdash;her heart went out to him.</p>

  <p>She had given herself to Arthur, that seemed conclusive. But Arthur had
  dishonoured the gift. She had a great sense of obligation to Oswald. She had
  loved Oswald before she had ever seen Arthur; years ago she had given her
  cousin the hope and claim that burnt accusingly in his eye today.</p>

  <p>"Come with me, Dolly," he said. "Come with me. Share my life. This isn't
  life here."</p>

  <p>"But could I come with you?"</p>

  <p>"If you dared. Not to Blantyre, perhaps. That's&mdash;respectable. Church
  and women and chatter. Blantyre's over. But there's Uganda. Baker took a wife
  there. It's still a land of wild romance. And I must go soon. I must get to
  Uganda. So much is happening. Muir says this Soudanese trouble won't wait....
  But I hang on here, day after day. I can't leave you to it, Dolly. I can't
  endure that."</p>

  <p>"You <i>have</i> to leave me," she said.</p>

  <p>"No. Come with me. This soft grey-green countryside is no place for you. I
  want you in a royal leopard skin with a rifle in your hand. You are pale for
  want of the sun.</p>

  <p>And while we were out there he could divorce you. He would divorce
  you&mdash;and marry some other copper puncher. Some Craftswoman. And stencil
  like hell. Then we could marry."</p>

  <p>He gripped her wrists across the stone table. "Dolly, my darling!" he
  said; "don't let me go back alone."</p>

  <p>"But what of Peter and Joan?"</p>

  <p>"Leave them to nurses for a year or so and then bring them out to the sun.
  If the boy stays here, he will grow up&mdash;some sort of fiddling artist. He
  will punch copper and play about with book-binding."</p>

  <p>She struggled suddenly to free her wrists, and he gripped them tighter
  until he saw that she was looking towards the house. At last he realized that
  Arthur approached.</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>damn</i>!" said Oswald....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">DOLLY cut this knot she could not untie, and as soon as she
  had cut it she began to repent.</p>

  <p>Indecision may become an unendurable torment. On the one hand that dark
  strong life in the African sunblaze with this man she feared in spite of his
  unconcealed worship, called to a long-suppressed vein of courage in her
  being; on the other hand was her sense of duty, her fastidious cleanness,
  this English home with its thousand gentle associations and Arthur, Arthur
  who had suddenly abandoned neglect, become attentive, mutely apologetic, but
  who had said not a word, since he had put himself out of court, about
  Oswald.</p>

  <p>He had said nothing, but he had become grave in his manner. Once or twice
  she had watched him when he had not known she watched him, and she had tried
  to fathom what was now in his mind. Did he want her!</p>

  <p>This and that pulled her.</p>

  <p>One night in the middle of the night she lay awake, unable to sleep,
  unable to decide. She went to her window and pressed her forehead against the
  pane and stared at the garden in a mist of moonlight. "I must end it," she
  said. "I must end it."</p>

  <p>She went to the door that separated her room from Arthur's, and unlocked
  it noisily. She walked across the room and stood by the window. Arthur was
  awake too. He leant up upon his elbow and regarded her without a word.
  "Arthur," she said, "am I to go to Africa or am I to stay with you?"</p>

  <p>Arthur answered after a little while. "I want you to stay with me."</p>

  <p>"On my conditions?"</p>

  <p>"I have been a fool, Dolly. It's over...."</p>

  <p>They were both trembling, and their voices were unsteady.</p>

  <p>"Can I believe you, Arthur?" she asked weakly....</p>

  <p>He came across the moonlight to her, and as he spoke his tears came. Old,
  tender, well-remembered phrases were on his lips. "Dolly! Little sweet
  Dolly," he said, and took her hungrily into his arms....</p>

  <p>There remained nothing now of the knot but to tell Oswald that she had
  made her irrevocable decision.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">ARTHUR was eloquent about their reconciliation. What became
  of her rival Dolly never learnt, nor greatly cared; she was turned out of
  Arthur's heart, it would seem, rather as one turns a superfluous cat out of
  doors. Arthur alluded to the emotional situation generally as "this mess."
  "If I'd had proper work to do and some outlet for my energy this mess
  wouldn't have happened," he said. He announced in phrases only too obviously
  derivative that he must find something real to do. "Something that will take
  me and use me."</p>

  <p>But Dolly was manifestly unhappy. He decided that the crisis had overtaxed
  her. Oswald must have worried her tremendously. (He thought it was splendid
  of her that she never blamed Oswald.) The garden, the place, was full now of
  painful associations&mdash;and moreover the rejected cat was well within the
  range of a chance meeting. Travel among beautiful scenery seemed the remedy
  indicated. Their income happened to be a little overspent, but it only added
  to his sense of rising to a great emotional emergency that he should have to
  draw upon his capital. They started upon a sort of recrudescence of their
  honeymoon, beginning with Rome.</p>

  <p>Aunt Phyllis and Aunt Phoebe came to mind the house and Joan and Peter.
  Aunt Phoebe was writing a little wise poetical book about education, mostly
  out of her inner consciousness, and she seized the opportunity of this
  experience very gladly....</p>

  <p>Dolly was a thing of moods for all that journey.</p>

  <p>At times she was extravagantly hilarious, she was wild, as she had never
  been before. She would start out to scamper about a twilit town after a long
  day's travel, so that it was hard for Arthur to keep pace with her flitting
  energy; she would pretend to be Tarantula-bitten in some chestnut grove and
  dance love dances and flee like a dryad to be pursued and caught. And at
  other times she sat white and still as though she had a broken heart. Never
  did an entirely virtuous decision give a woman so much heartache. They went
  up Vesuvius by night on mules from Pompeii, and as they stood on the black
  edge of the crater, the guide called her attention to the vast steely extent
  of the moonlit southward sea.</p>

  <p>She heard herself whisper "Africa," and wondered if Arthur too had
  heard.</p>

  <p>And at Capri Arthur had a dispute with a boatman. The boat was taken at
  the Marina Grande. The boatman proposed the tour of the island and all the
  grottos, and from the Marina Grande the project seemed reasonable enough. The
  sea, though not glassy smooth, was quite a practicable sea. But a point had
  to be explained very carefully. The boatman put it in slow and simple Italian
  with much helpful gesture. If the wind rose to a storm so that they would
  have to return before completing this "giro," they would still pay the same
  fee.</p>

  <p>"Oh quite," said Arthur carelessly in English, and the bargain was
  made.</p>

  <p>They worked round the corner of the island, under the Salto di Tiberio,
  that towering cliff down which the legend says Tiberius flung his victims,
  and as soon as they came out from under the lee of the island Arthur
  discovered a cheat. The gathering wind beyond the shelter of the cliffs was
  cutting up the blue water into a disorderly system of tumbling white-capped
  waves. The boat headed straight into a storm. It lifted and fell and swayed
  and staggered; the boatman at his oar dramatically exaggerated his
  difficulties. "He knew of this," said Arthur savagely. "He thinks we shall
  want to give in. Well, let's see who gives in first. Let's put him through
  his program and see how he likes it."</p>

  <p>Arthur had taken off his hat, and clutched it to save it from the wind. He
  looked very fine with his hair blowing back. "Buona aria," he said, grinning
  cheerfully to the boatman. "Bellissima!"</p>

  <p>The boatman was understood to say that the wind was rising and that it was
  going to be worse presently.</p>

  <p>"Bellissima!" said Arthur, patting Dolly's back.</p>

  <p>The boatman was seized with solicitude for the lady.</p>

  <p>Dolly surveyed the great cliffs that towered overhead and the frothy
  crests against which the boat smacked and lifted. "Bellissima," she agreed,
  smiling at the boatman's consternation. "Avanti!"</p>

  <p>The boat plunged and ploughed its way for a little while in silence. The
  boatman suggested that things were getting dangerous. Could the signora
  swim?</p>

  <p>Arthur assured him that she could swim like a fish.</p>

  <p>And the capitano?</p>

  <p>Arthur accepted his promotion cheerfully and assured the boatman that his
  swimming was only second to Dolly's.</p>

  <p>The boatman informed them that he himself could scarcely swim at all. He
  was not properly a seafaring man. He had come to Capri for his health; his
  lungs were weak. He had been a stonemason at Alessandria, but the dust had
  been bad for his lungs. He could not swim. He could not manage a boat very
  well in stormy weather. And he was an orphan.</p>

  <p>"<i>Io</i> Orfano!" cried Arthur, greatly delighted, and stabbing himself
  with an elucidatory forefinger. "Io Orfano anche."</p>

  <p>The boatman lapsed into gloom. In a little while they had beaten round the
  headland into view of the Faraglione, that big outstanding rock which is
  pierced by a great arch, upon the south-eastern side of the island. The
  passage through this Arco Naturale was in the boatman's agreement. They could
  see the swirl of the waters now through that natural gateway, rising, pouring
  almost to the top of the arch and then swirling down to the trough of the
  wave. The west wind whipped the orphan's blue-black curls about his ears. He
  began to cry off his bargain.</p>

  <p>"We go through that arch," said Arthur, "or my name is not Stubland."</p>

  <p>The boatman argued his case. The wind was rising; the further they went
  the more they came into the weather. He had not the skill of a man born to
  the sea.</p>

  <p>"You made the bargain," said Arthur.</p>

  <p>"Let us return while we are still safe," the boatman protested.</p>

  <p>"Go through the arch," said Arthur. The boatman looked at the arch, the
  sky, the endless onslaught of advancing waves to seaward and Arthur, and then
  with a gesture of despair turned the boat towards the arch.</p>

  <p>"He's frightened, Arthur," said Dolly.</p>

  <p>"Serve him right. He won't try this game again in a hurry," said Arthur,
  and then relenting: "Go through the arch and we will return...."</p>

  <p>The boatman baulked at the arch twice. It was evident they must go through
  just behind the crest of a wave. He headed in just a moment or so too soon,
  got through on the very crest, bent double to save his head, made a clumsy
  lunge with his oar that struck the rock and threw him sideways. Then they
  were rushing with incredible swiftness out of the arch down a blue-green
  slope of water, and the Faraglione rose again before Dolly's eyes like a
  thing relieved after a moment of intense concentration. But suddenly
  everything was sideways. Everything was askew. The boat was half overturned
  and the boatman was sitting unsteadily on the gunwale, clutching at the
  opposite side which was rising, rising. The man, she realized, was going
  overboard, and Arthur's swift grab at him did but complete the capsize. The
  side of the boat was below her where the floor should be, and that gave way
  to streaming bubbling water into which one man plunged on the top of the
  other....</p>

  <p>Dolly leapt clear of the overturned boat, went under and came up....</p>

  <p>She tossed the wet hair from her head and looked about her. The Faraglione
  was already thirty yards or more away and receding fast. The boat was keel
  upward and rolling away towards the cliff. There were no signs of Arthur or
  the boatman.</p>

  <p>What must she do? Just before the accident she had noted the Piccola
  Marina away to the north-west. That would mean a hard swim against the waves,
  but it would be the best thing to do. It could not be half a mile away. And
  Arthur? Arthur would look after himself. He would do that all right. She
  would only encumber him by swimming around. Perhaps he would get the man on
  to the boat. Perhaps people had seen them from the Piccola Marina. If so
  boats would come out to them.</p>

  <p>She struck out shoreward.</p>

  <p>How light one's clothes made one feel! But presently they would drag.
  (Never meet trouble half-way.) It was going to be a long swim. Even if there
  should be no current....</p>

  <p>She swam....</p>

  <p>Then she had doubts. Ought she to go back and look for Arthur? She could
  not be much good to him even if she found him. It was her first duty to save
  herself. Peter was not old enough to be left. No one would care for Joan and
  him as she could care for them. It was a long enough swim without looking for
  Arthur. It was going to be a very long swim....</p>

  <p>She wished she could get a glimpse of Arthur. She looked this way and
  that. It would be easier to swim side by side. But in this choppy sea he
  might be quite close and still be hidden.... Best not to bother about
  things&mdash;just swim.</p>

  <p>For a long time she swam like a machine....</p>

  <p>After a time she began to think of her clothes again. The waves now seemed
  to be trying to get them off. She was being tugged back by her clothes. Could
  she get some of them off? Not in this rough water. It would be more
  exhausting than helpful. Clothes ought to be easier to get off; not so much
  tying and pinning....</p>

  <p>The waves were coming faster now. The wind must be freshening. They were
  more numerous and less regular.</p>

  <p>Splash! That last wave was a trencherous beast&mdash;no!&mdash;treacherous
  beast.... Phew, ugh! Salt in the mouth. Salt in the eyes. And here was
  another, too soon! ... Oh <i>fight</i>!</p>

  <p>It was hard to see the Piccola Marina. Wait for the lift of the next
  wave.... She was going too much to the left, ever so much too much to the
  left....</p>

  <p>One must exert oneself for Peter's sake.</p>

  <p>What was Arthur doing?</p>

  <p>It seemed a long time now since she had got into the water, and the shore
  was still a long way off. There was nobody there at all that she could
  see.... Boats drawn high and dry. Plenty of boats. Extraordinary people these
  Italians &mdash;they let stonemasons take charge of boats. Extortionate
  stonemasons.... She was horribly tired. Not in good fettle.... She looked at
  the Faraglione over her shoulder. It was still disgustingly near and big. She
  had hardly swum a third of the way yet. Or else there was a current. Better
  not think of currents. She had to stick to it. Perhaps it was the worst third
  of the way she had done. But what infinite joy and relief it would be just to
  stop swimming and spread one's arms and feet!</p>

  <p>She had to stick to it for little Peter's sake. For little Peter's sake.
  Peter too young to be left....</p>

  <p>Arthur? Best not to think about Arthur just yet. It had been silly to
  insist on the Arco Naturale....</p>

  <p>What a burthen and bother dress was to a woman! What a leaden
  burthen!...</p>

  <p>She must not think. She must not think. She must swim like a machine. Like
  a machine. One.... Two.... One.... Two.... Slow and even.</p>

  <p>She fell asleep. For some moments she was fast asleep. She woke up with
  the water rising over her head and struck out again.</p>

  <p>There was a sound of many waters in her ears and an enormous indolence in
  her limbs against which she struggled in vain. She did struggle, and the
  thought that spurred her to struggle was still the thought of Peter.</p>

  <p>"Peter is too young to be left yet," sang like a refrain in her head as
  she roused herself for her last fight with the water. Peter was too young to
  be left yet. Peter, her little son. But the salt blinded her now; she was
  altogether out of step with the slow and resolute rhythm of the waves. They
  broke foaming upon her and beat upon her, and presently turned her about and
  over like a leaf in an eddy.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap04"
     name="chap04">CHAPTER IV. &mdash; FIRST IMPRESSIONS OF THE
     UNIVERSE</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">PETER could not remember a time when Joan was not in his
  world, and from the beginning it seemed to him that the chief fact was Mary.
  "Nanny," you called her, or "Mare-<i>wi</i>," or you simply howled and she
  came. She was omnipresent; if she was not visible then she was just round the
  corner, by night or day. Other figures were more intermittent, "Daddy," a
  large, loud, exciting, almost terrific thing; "Mummy," who was soft and made
  gentle noises but was, in comparison with Mary, rather a fool about one's
  bottle; "Pussy," and then the transitory smiling propitiatory human stuff
  that was difficult to remember and name correctly. "Aunties," "Nannies" and
  suchlike. But also there were inanimate persons. There were the brass-headed
  sentinels about one's cot and the great brown round-headed newel post. His
  name was Bungo-Peter; he was a king and knew everything, he watched the
  stairs, but you did not tell people this because they would not understand.
  Also there was the brass-eyed monster with the triple belly who was called
  Chester-Drawers; he shammed dead and watched you, and in the night he creaked
  about the room. And there was Gope the stove, imprisoned in the fender with
  hell burning inside him, and there was Nobby. Nobby was the protector of
  little boys against Chester-Drawers, stray bears, the Thing on the Landing,
  spider scratchings and many such discomforts of nursery life. Of course you
  could also draw a deep breath and yell for "Mare-<i>wi</i>" but she was apt
  not to understand one's explanation and to scold. It was better to hold tight
  to Nobby. And also Nobby was lovely and went whack.</p>

  <p>Moreover if you called "Mare-<i>wi</i>" then when the lights came Joan
  would sit up in her cot and stare sleepily while you were being scolded. She
  would say that she knew there weren't such things. And you would be filled
  with an indefinable sense of foolishness. Behind an impenetrable veil of
  darkness with an intervening floor space acrawl with bears and "burdlars" she
  could say such things with impunity. In the morning one forgot. Joan in the
  daytime was a fairly amusing companion, except that she sometimes tried to
  touch Nobby. Once Peter caught her playing with Nobby and pretending that
  Nobby was a baby. One hand took Nobby by the head, and the other took Joan by
  the hair. That was the time when Peter had his first spanking, but Joan was
  careful not to touch Nobby again.</p>

  <p>Generally Joan was passable. Of course she was an intrusion and in the
  way, but if one wanted to march round and round shouting "Tara-ra-ra, ra-ra,
  ra-ra, Tara boom de ay," banging something, a pan or a drum, with Nobby, she
  could be trusted to join in very effectively. She was good for noise-marches
  always, and they would not have been any fun without her. She had the
  processional sense, and knew that her place was second. She talked also in a
  sort of way, but it was not necessary to listen. She could be managed. If,
  for example, she touched Peter's bricks he yelled in a soul-destroying way
  and went for her with a brick in each hand. She was quick to take a hint of
  that sort.</p>

  <p>It was Arthur's theory that little children should not be solitary. Mutual
  aid is the basis of social life, and from their earliest years children must
  be accustomed to co-operation. They had to be trained for the co-operative
  commonwealth as set forth in the writings of Prince Kropotkin. Mary thought
  differently. So Arthur used to go in his beautiful blue blouse and sit in the
  sunny nursery amidst the toys and the children, inciting them to premature
  co-operations.</p>

  <p>"Now Peter put a brick," he used to say.</p>

  <p>"Now Joan put a brick."</p>

  <p>"Now Dadda put a brick."</p>

  <p>Mary used to watch proceedings with a cynical and irritating
  expression.</p>

  <p>"Peter's tower," Peter would propose.</p>

  <p>"Our tower," Arthur used to say.</p>

  <p>"Peter knock it over."</p>

  <p>"No. No one knock it over."</p>

  <p>"Peter put two bricks."</p>

  <p>"Very well."</p>

  <p>"Dadda not put any more bricks. No. Peter finish it."</p>

  <p>"Na-ow!" from Joan in a voice like a little cat. "<i>Me</i> finish
  it."</p>

  <p>Arthur wanted to preserve against this original sin of individualism. He
  got quite cross at last imposing joyful and willing co-operation upon two
  highly resistant minds.</p>

  <p>Mary's way was altogether different. She greatly appreciated the fact that
  Dolly and Arthur had had the floor of the nursery covered with cork carpet,
  and that Arthur at the suggestion of Aunt Pho3be had got a blackboard and
  chalks in order to instil a free gesture in drawing from the earliest years.
  With a piece of chalk Mary would draw a line across the floor of the nursery,
  fairly dividing the warmth of the stove and the light of the window.</p>

  <p>"That's your bit, Peter," she would say, "and that's your bit, Joan.
  Them's your share of bricks and them's yours. Now don't you think of going
  outside your bit, either of you, whatever you do. Nohow. Nor touch so much as
  a brick that isn't yours."</p>

  <p>Whereupon both children would settle down to play with infinite
  contentment.</p>

  <p>Yet these individualists were not indifferent to each other. If Joan
  wanted to draw on the blackboard with chalk, then always Peter wanted to draw
  on the blackboard with chalk at the same time, and here again it was
  necessary for Mary to mark a boundary between them; and if Peter wanted to
  build with bricks then Joan did also. Each was uneasy if the other was not in
  sight. And they would each do the same thing on different sides of their
  chalk boundary, with a wary eye on the other's proceedings and with an
  endless stream of explanation of what they were doing.</p>

  <p>"Peter's building a love-i-lay house."</p>

  <p>"Joan's building, oh!&mdash;a lovelay-er house. Wiv a cross on it."</p>

  <p>"Why not build one lovely house for both of you?" said Arthur, still with
  the Co-operative Commonwealth in mind. Neither child considered that his
  proposal called for argument. It went over their heads and vanished. They
  continued building individually as before, but in silence lest Arthur should
  be tempted to intervene again.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">JOAN was a dancer from the age of three.</p>

  <p>Perhaps she got some hint from Dolly, there is no telling; but anyhow she
  frisked and capered rhythmically by a kind of instinct whenever Dolly played
  the piano. So Dolly showed her steps and then more steps. Peter did not take
  to dancing so readily as Joan and his disposition was towards burlesque. Joan
  danced for the love of dancing, but Peter was inventive and turned his dances
  into expression. He invented the Fat Dance, with a pillow under his pinafore,
  the Thin Dance, with a concave stomach and a meagre expression, the One Leg
  dance and the Bird Dance, this latter like the birds about the crumbs in
  winter time. Also the Tipsy Dance, bacchic, which Arthur thought vulgar and
  discouraged. Dolly taught Joan the Flower Dance, with a very red cap like a
  pistil, and white silk skirt petals upheld by her arms. These she opened
  slowly, and at last dropped and then drooped. This needed a day of
  preparation. Peter produced his first remembered aesthetic judgment on a
  human being on this occasion.</p>

  <p>"<i>Pritty</i> Joan," he said with conviction, as she stood flushed and
  bright-eyed after the dance, and with that he went and kissed her.</p>

  <p>"He's beginning young," said Arthur.</p>

  <p>It is what all parents say, and it is true of all children. But parents
  keep on saying it....</p>

  <p>Before he was fully four Peter was conducting an aesthetic analysis of his
  world. He liked some of the tunes Dolly played and disapproved of others. He
  distributed "pritty" lavishly but by no means indiscriminately over the
  things of the world. "Oh pritty fo'wers," was the primordial form of these
  expanding decisions. But he knew that Nobby was not pretty.</p>

  <p>Arthur did his best to encourage and assist these budding
  appreciations.</p>

  <p>One evening there was a beautiful still sunset. The sun went down, a great
  flattening sphere of reddening gold sinking into vast levels of blue over the
  remoter hills. Joan had already been carried off to bed, but Arthur seized
  upon Peter and stood him in the window seat. "Look," said Arthur. Peter
  looked intently, and both his parents sat beside him, watching his nice
  little round head and the downy edge of his intent profile.</p>

  <p>"Look," said Arthur, "it goes. It goes. It's going... going...
  going...."</p>

  <p>The sun became a crescent, a red scimitar, a streak of fire.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Arthur, "it's gone."</p>

  <p>Came an immense pause.</p>

  <p>"Do it <i>adain</i>. Dadda," said Peter with immense approval. "Do it
  adain...."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">THE theory of Ideals played almost as important a part in
  the early philosophy of Peter as it did in the philosophy of Plato. But Peter
  did not call them "Ideals," he called them "toys." Toys were the simplified
  essences of things, pure, perfect and manageable; Real Things were
  troublesome, uncontrollable, over complicated and largely irrelevant. A Real
  Train, for example, was a poor, big, clumsy, limited thing that was obliged
  to go to Red Hill or Croydon or London, that was full of stuffy unnecessary
  strangers, usually sitting firmly in the window seats, that you could do
  nothing satisfactory with at all. A Toy Train was your very own; it took you
  wherever you wanted, to Fairyland or Russia or anywhere, at whatever pace you
  chose. Then there was a beautiful rag doll named "Pleeceman," who had a
  comic, almost luminous red nose, and smiled perpetually; you could hit Joan
  with him and make her squawk and yet be sure of not hurting her within the
  meaning of the law; how inferior was the great formless lump of a thing, with
  a pale uneventful visitor's sort of face we saw out of the train at
  Caterham!</p>

  <p>Nobody could have lifted him by a leg and waved him about; and if you had
  shied him into a corner, instead of all going just anyhow and still smiling,
  he would probably have been cross and revengeful. How inferior again was the
  Real Cow, with its chewing habits, its threatening stare and moo and its
  essential rudeness, to Suzannah, the cow on the green board. Perhaps the best
  real things in the world were young pigs....</p>

  <p>But this much is simply to explain how it was that Peter was grateful but
  not overwhelmed to find that there was also a real Nobby in existence as well
  as his beloved fetish. And this Nobby was, as real things went, much better
  than one could have expected him to be. Peter's heart went out to him from
  the very first encounter, and never found reason to relinquish him again.</p>

  <p>Nobby wasted a good lot of time that might have been better employed in
  play, by talking to Mummy; and when a little boy set himself to rescue his
  friend from so tepid an occupation, Mary showed a peculiar disposition to
  thwart one. "Oh! leave them alone," she said, with the tart note in her
  voice. "I'm sure they don't want either of you."</p>

  <p>Still Mummy didn't always get Nobby, and a little boy and girl could hear
  him talk and play about with him. When he told really truly things it was
  better than any one else telling stories. He had had all sorts of
  experiences; he had been a sailor; he knew what was inside a ship. That had
  been a growing need in Peter's life. All Peter's ships had been solid
  hitherto. Arid Nobby had been in the same field, practically speaking, with
  lions ever so many times. Lions, of course, are not nearly so dreadful as
  bears in a little boy's world; bears are the most dreadful things in the
  world (especially is this true of the black, under-bed bear, Ursus Pedivorus)
  but lions are dreadful enough. If one saw one in a field one would instantly
  get back over the stile again and go home, Mary or no Mary. But one day near
  Nairobi, Nobby had come upon a lion in broad daylight right in the middle of
  the path. Nobby had nothing but a stick. "I was in a hurry and I felt
  annoyed," said Nobby. "So I just walked towards him and waved my stick at
  him, and shouted to him to get out of my way."</p>

  <p>"<i>Yes?</i>" breathless.</p>

  <p>"And he went. Most lions will get away from a man if they can. Not always
  though."</p>

  <p>A pause. There was evidently another story to that. "Tell us," said Mummy,
  more interested even than the children.</p>

  <p>Big Nobby made model African villages out of twigs and such-like nothings
  in the garden, and he brought down Joan and Peter boxes of Zulu warriors from
  London to inhabit them. Also he bought two boxes of * 'Egyptian camel corps."
  One wet day he "made Africa" on the nursery floor. He made mountains out of
  books and wood blocks, and put a gold-mine of gold paper therein; he got in a
  lot of twigs of box from the garden and made the most lovely forest you can
  imagine; he built villages of bricks for the Zulus; he put out the animals of
  Peter's Noah's ark in the woods. "Here's the lion," he said, propping up the
  lion against the tree because of its broken leg.</p>

  <p>"Gurr Woooooah!" said Joan.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Nobby, encouraging her.</p>

  <p>"Waar-oooh. Waaaa!" said Joan, presuming on it.</p>

  <p>"Bang!" said Peter. "You're <i>dead</i>, Joan," and stopped any more of
  that.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">Then one day an extraordinary thing happened. It was towards
  lunch-time, and Mary was bringing Joan and Peter home from a walk in the
  woods. Joan was tired, but Peter had been enterprising and had run on far
  ahead; he was trotting his fat legs down the rusty lane that ran through the
  bushes close to the garden fence when he saw Nobby's lank form coming towards
  him from the house, walking slowly and as if he couldn't see where he was
  going. Peter was for slipping into the bushes and jumping out at him and
  saying "Boo." Then he saw Nobby stop and stand still and stare back at the
  house, and then, most wonderful and dreadful! this great big grown-up began
  to sob and cry. He said "Ooo-er!" just as Peter did sometimes when he felt
  unendurably ill-used. And he kept raising his clenched fists as if he was
  going to shake them&mdash;and not doing so.</p>

  <p>"I will go to Hell," said Nobby. "I will go to Hell."</p>

  <p>In a passion!</p>

  <p>(Peter was shocked and ashamed for Nobby.)</p>

  <p>Then Nobby turned and saw Peter before Peter could hide away from him. He
  stopped crying at once, but there was his funny face all red and shiny on one
  side.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, old Peter boy," said Nobby. "I'm off. I'm going right away. Been
  fooled."</p>

  <p>So that was it. But hadn't he Africa and lions and elephants and black men
  to go to, a great Real Play Nursery instead of a Nursery of Toys? Why make a
  fuss of it?</p>

  <p>He came to Peter and lifted him up in his arms. "Goodbye, old Peter," he
  said. "Good-bye, Peter. Keep off the copper punching." He kissed his
  godson&mdash;how wet his face was!&mdash;and put him down, and was going off
  along the path and Peter hadn't said a word.</p>

  <p>He wanted to cry too, to think that Nobby was going. He stared and then
  ran a little way after his friend.</p>

  <p>"Nobby," he shouted; "good-bye!"</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, old man," Nobby cried back to him.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye. Gooood-bye-er."</p>

  <p>Then Peter trotted back to the house to be first with the sad but exciting
  news that Nobby had gone. But as he came down from the green wicket to the
  house he looked up and saw his father at the upstairs window, gazing after
  Nobby with an unusual expression that perplexed him, and in the little hall
  he found his mother, and she had been crying too, though she was pretending
  she hadn't. They knew about Nobby. Something strange was in the air,
  perceptible to a little boy but utterly beyond his understanding. Perhaps
  Nobby had been naughty. So he thought it best to change the subject, and
  began talking at once about a wonderful long bicycle with no less than three
  men on it&mdash;not two, Mummy, but three&mdash;that he had seen upon the
  highroad. They had thin white silk shirts without sleeves, and rode furiously
  with their heads down. Their shirts were blown out funnily behind them in the
  middles of their backs. They went like that!</p>

  <p>All through the midday meal nobody said a word about Nobby....</p>

  <p>Nobody ever did say anything about Nobby again. When on a few occasions
  Peter himself talked appreciatively of Nobby nobody, unless it was Joan now
  and then, seemed the least bit interested....</p>

  <p>One side consequence of Oswald's visit had been the dethronement of the
  original Nobby. The real Nobby had somehow thrust the toy Nobby into the
  background. Perhaps he drifted into the recesses of some box or cupboard. At
  any rate when Peter thought of him one day he was nowhere to be found. That
  did not matter so much as it would have done a couple of months before. Now
  if the bears and "burdlars" got busy in the night-nursery Peter used to
  pretend that the pillow was the real Nobby, the Nobby who wasn't even afraid
  of lions and had driven off one with a stick. A prowling bear hadn't much
  chance against a little boy who snuggled up to that Nobby.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Mummy was rather dull in those days, and Daddy seemed always
  to be looking at her. Daddy had a sort of inelasticity in his manner too.
  Suddenly Aunt Phyllis and Aunt Phoebe appeared, and it was announced that
  Daddy and Mummy were going off to Italy. It was too far for them to take
  little boys and girls, they said, and besides there were, oh! horrid spiders.
  And Peter must stay to mind the house and Joan and his aunts; it wasn't right
  not to have some man about. He was to have a sailor suit with trousers also,
  great responsibilities altogether for a boy not much over four. So there was
  a great kissing and going off, and Joan and Peter settled down to the rule of
  the aunts and only missed Mummy and Daddy now and then.</p>

  <p>Then one day something happened over the children's heads. Mary had red
  eyes and wouldn't say why; the aunts had told her not to do so.</p>

  <p>Phyllis and Phoebe decided not to darken the children's lives by wearing
  mourning, but Mary said that anyhow she would go into black. But neither Joan
  nor Peter took much notice of the black dress.</p>

  <p>"Why don't Mummy and Daddy come back?" asked Peter one day of Aunt
  Phoebe.</p>

  <p>"They've travelled to such wonderful places, said Aunt Phoebe with a catch
  in her voice. "They may not be back for ever so long. No. Not till Peter is
  ever so big."</p>

  <p>"Then why don't they send us cull'd poce-cards like they did't first?"
  said Peter.</p>

  <p>Aunt Phoebe was so taken aback she could answer nothing.</p>

  <p>"They just forgotten us," said Peter and reflected. "They gone on and
  on."</p>

  <p>"Isn't Nobby ever coming back either?" he asked, abruptly, displaying a
  devastating acceptance of the new situation.</p>

  <p>"But who's Nobby?"</p>

  <p>"That's Mr. Oswald Sydenham," said Mary.</p>

  <p>"He's coming back quite soon," said Aunt Phoebe. "He's on his way
  now."</p>

  <p>"'Cos he <i>promised</i> me a lion skin," said Peter.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">AUNTS Phyllis and Phoebe found themselves two of the four
  guardians appointed under Arthur's will.</p>

  <p>It had been one of Arthur's occasional lapses into deceit that he
  destroyed the will which made Oswald the sole guardian of Joan&mdash;so far
  as he could dispose of Joan&mdash;and Peter, without saying a word about it
  to Dolly. He had vacillated between various substitutes for Oswald up to the
  very moment when he named the four upon whom he decided finally, to his
  solicitor. Some streak of jealousy or pride, combined with a doubt whether
  Oswald would now consent to act, had first prompted the alteration. Instead
  he had decided to shift the responsibility to his sisters. Then a twinge of
  compunction had made him replace Oswald. Then feeling that Oswald might still
  be out talked or out voted by his sisters, he had stuck in the name of
  Dolly's wealthy and important cousin, Lady Charlotte Sydenham. He had only
  seen her twice, but she had seemed a lady of considerable importance and
  strength of character. Anyhow it made things fairer to the Sydenham side.</p>

  <p>But Phyllis and Phoebe at once assumed, not without secret gladness, that
  the burthen of this responsibility would fall upon them. Oswald Sydenham was
  away in the heart of Africa; Lady Charlotte Sydenham was also abroad. She had
  telegraphed, "Unwell impossible to return to England six weeks continue
  children's life as hitherto." That seemed to promise a second sleeping
  partner in the business.</p>

  <p>The sisters decided to continue The Ingle-Nook as the children's home, and
  made the necessary arrangements with Mr. Sycamore, the family solicitor, to
  that end.</p>

  <p>They discussed their charges very carefully and fully. Phyllis was for a
  meticulous observance of Arthur's known or assumed "wishes," but Phoebe took
  a broader view. Mary too pointed out the dangers of too literal an adhesion
  to precedent.</p>

  <p>"We want everything to go on exactly as it did when they were alive," said
  Phyllis to Mary.</p>

  <p>"Things 'ave got to be different," said Mary.</p>

  <p>"Not if we can help it," said Aunt Phyllis.</p>

  <p>"They'll <i>grow</i>," said Mary after reflection.</p>

  <p>Phoebe became eloquent in the evening.</p>

  <p>"We are to have the advantages of maternity, Phyllis,
  without&mdash;without the degradation. It is a solemn trust. Blessed are we
  among women, Phyllis. I feel a Madonna. We are Madonnas, Phyllis. Modern
  Madonnas. Just Touched by the Wings of the Dove.... These little souls
  dropped from heaven upon our knees.... Poor Arthur! It is our task to guide
  his offspring to that high destiny he might have attained. <i>Look</i>,
  Phyllis!"</p>

  <p>With her flat hand she indicated the long garden path that Dolly had
  planned.</p>

  <p>Phyllis peered forward without intelligence. "What is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Phyllis perceived that Phoebe was flushed with poetical excitement. And
  Phoebe's voice dropped mystically to a deep whisper. "Don't you see? White
  lilies! A coincidence, of course. But&mdash;Beautiful."</p>

  <p>"For a child with a high destiny, I doubt if Peter is careful enough with
  his clothes," said Phyllis, trying to sound a less Pre-Raphaelite note. "He
  was a perfect little Disgrace this afternoon."</p>

  <p>"The darling! But I understand.... Joan too has much before her, Phyllis.
  As yet their minds are blank, tabula rasa; of either of them there is still
  to be made&mdash;anything. Peter&mdash;upon this Rock I set&mdash;a New Age.
  When women shall come to their own. Joan again. Joan of Arc. Coincidences no
  doubt. But leave me my fancies. Fancies if you will. For me they are no
  fancies. Before the worlds, Phyllis, we were made for this."</p>

  <p>She rested her chin on her hand, and stared out into the blue twilight, a
  brooding prophetess.</p>

  <p>"Only a woman can understand a woman," she said presently. "Not a Word of
  this, Phyllis, to Others."</p>

  <p>"I wish we had bought some cigarettes this afternoon," said Phyllis.</p>

  <p>"The little red glow," reflected Phoebe indulgently. "It helps. But I
  don't want to smoke tonight. It would spoil it. Smoke! Let the Flame burn
  clear awhile.... We will get in cigarettes tomorrow."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">JOAN and Peter remained unaware of the great destinies
  before them. More observant persons than they were might have guessed there
  were deep meanings in the way in which Aunt Phoebe smoothed back their hair
  from their foreheads and said "Ah," and bade them "Mark it well" whenever she
  imparted any general statement, but they took these things merely as her
  particular way of manifesting the irrational quality common to all grown-up
  people. Also she would say "Dignity! Your mission!" when they howled or
  fought. It was to the manuscript that grew into a bigger and bigger pile upon
  what had been Arthur's writing-desk in Arthur's workroom, that she restricted
  her most stirring ideas. She wrote there daily, going singing to it as
  healthy young men go singing to their bathrooms. She splashed her mind about
  and refreshed herself greatly. She wrote in a large hand, punctuating chiefly
  with dashes. She had conceived her book rather in the manner of the prophetic
  works of the admired Mr. Ruskin&mdash;with Carlylean lapses. It was to be
  called Hail Bambino and the Grain of Mustard Seed. It was all about the
  tremendousness of children.</p>

  <p>The conscientious valiance of Aunt Phoebe was very manifest in the
  opening. "Caesar," the book began, "and the son of Semele burst strangely
  into this world, but Jesus, Mohammed, Confucius, Newton, Darwin, Robert
  Burns, were born as peacefully as you or I. Nathless they came for such
  ends&mdash;if indeed one can think of any ending thereto!&mdash;as blot out
  the stars. Yesterday a puling babe&mdash;for Jesus puled, Mohammed puled, let
  us not spare ourselves, Newton, a delicate child, puled most
  offensively&mdash;Herod here and bacteria there, infantile colic,
  tuberculosis and what not, searched for each little life, in vain, and so to-
  day behold springing victoriously from each vital granule a tree of Teaching,
  of Consequence, that buds and burgeons and shoots and for ever spreads so
  that the Gates of Hell may not prevail against it! Here it is the Tree of
  Spirituality, here the Tree of Thought, predestined intertwiner with the Tree
  of Asgard, here in our last instance a chanting Beauty, a heartening lyrical
  Yawp and Whirlaboo. And forget it not, whatever else be forgotten, the Word
  of the Wise, '<i>as the twig is bent the tree inclines.</i>' So it is and
  utterly that we realize the importance of education, the pregnant intensity
  of the least urgency, the hint, the gleam, the offering of service, to these
  First Tender Years."</p>

  <p>Here Aunt Phoebe had drawn breath for a moment, before she embarked upon
  her second paragraph; and here we will leave Aunt Phoebe glowing amidst her
  empurpled prose.</p>

  <p>Joan and Peter took the substitution of Aunt Phoebe muttering like a Sibyl
  overhead and Aunt Phyllis, who was really amusing with odd drawings and
  twisted paper toys and much dancing and running about, in the place of Daddy
  and Mummy, with the stoical acceptance of the very young. About Daddy and
  Mummy there hung a faint flavour of departure but no sense of conclusive
  loss. No clear image and expectation of a return had been formed. No day of
  definite disappointment ever came. After all the essential habitual person,
  Mary, was still there, and all the little important routines of child-life
  continued very much as they had always done.</p>

  <p>Yet there was already the dawn of further apprehensions in Peter's mind at
  least. One day Peter picked up a dead bird in the garden, a bird dead with no
  injuries manifest. He tried to make it stand up and peck.</p>

  <p>"It ain't no good, Master Peter; it's dead," said Mary.</p>

  <p>"What's dead?" said Peter.</p>

  <p>"<i>That</i> is."</p>

  <p>"<i>Gone</i> dead,"said Peter.</p>

  <p>"And won't ever go anything else now&mdash;except smell, said Mary.</p>

  <p>Peter reflected. Later he re-visited the dead bird and was seen in
  profound meditation over it. Then he repaired to Aunt Phyllis and confided
  his intention of immortality.</p>

  <p>"Peter," he said, "not go dead&mdash;nohow."</p>

  <p>"Of course not," said Aunt Phyllis. " He's got too much sense. The
  idea!"</p>

  <p>This was reassuring. But alone it was not enough.</p>

  <p>"Joan not go dead," he said. "No."</p>

  <p>"Certainly she shan't," said Aunt Phyllis and awaited further
  decisions.</p>

  <p>"Pussy not go dead."</p>

  <p>"Not until ninety times nine."</p>

  <p>"Aunt Phyllis not go dead. Marewi not go dead."</p>

  <p>He reflected further. He tried, "Mummy and Daddy not go dead...."</p>

  <p>Then after thought, "When are Daddy and Mummy coming back again?"</p>

  <p>Aunt Phyllis told a wise lie. "Some day. Not for a long time. They've
  gone&mdash;oh, ever so far."</p>

  <p>"Farther than ever so," said Peter.</p>

  <p>He reflected. "When they come back Peter will be a Big Boy. Mummy and
  Daddy 'ardly know 'im."</p>

  <p>And from that time, Daddy and Mummy ceased to be thought of further as
  immediate presences, and became hero and heroine in a dream of tomorrow, a
  dream of returning happiness when life was dull, of release and vindication
  when life was hard, a pleasant dream, a hope, a basis for imaginative
  anticipations and pillow fairy tales, sleeping Parents like those sleeping
  Kings who figure in the childhood of nations, like King Arthur or Barbarossa.
  Sometimes it was one parent and sometimes it was the other that dominated the
  thought, "When Mummy comes back.... When Daddy comes back."</p>

  <p>Joan learnt very soon to say it too.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">Death was too big a thing for Peter to comprehend. He had
  hardly begun yet with life. And he had made not even a beginning with
  religion. He had never been baptized; he had learnt no prayers at his
  mother's knee. The priceless Mary had come to the Stublands warranted a
  churchwoman, but as with so many of her class, her orthodoxy had been only a
  professional uniform to cloak a very keen hostility and contempt for the
  clergy, and she dropped quite readily into the ways of a household in which
  religion was entirely ignored. The first Peter heard of religion was at the
  age of four and a half, and that was from a serious friend of Mary's, a
  Particular Baptist, who came for a week's visit to The Ingle-Nook. The
  visitor was really distressed at the spiritual outlook of the two children.
  She borrowed Peter for a "little walk." She thought she would begin with him
  and try Joan afterwards. Then as plainly and impressively as possible she
  imparted the elements of her faith to Peter and taught him a brief, simple
  prayer. "He's a Love," she told Mary, "and so Quick! It's a shime to keep him
  such a little heathen. I didn't say that prayer over twice before he had it
  Pat."</p>

  <p>Mary was rather moved by her friend's feelings. She felt that she was
  going behind the back of the aunts, but nevertheless she saw no great harm in
  what had happened The deaths of Arthur and Dolly had shaken Mary's innate
  scepticism; she had a vague feeling that there might be grave risks, well
  worth consideration, beyond the further edge of life.</p>

  <p>Aunt Phyllis was the first of the responsible people overhead to discover
  what had happened. Peter loved his prayer; it was full of the most beautiful
  phrases; no words had ever so filled his mouth and mind. There was for
  example, "For Jesus Krice sake Amen." Like a song. You could use it anywhere.
  Aunt Phyllis found him playing trains with his bricks in the nursery one
  afternoon. "Hoo! Chuff-Chuff. Chuff-Chuff. Change for Reigate, change for
  London. For Jesus Krice sake Amen."</p>

  <p>Aunt Phyllis sat down in the little chair. Peter, she said, "who is this
  Jesus Krice?"</p>

  <p>Peter was reluctant to give information. I know all about 'im," he said,
  and would at first throw no other light on the matter.</p>

  <p>Then he relented and told a wonder. He turned his bacK on his brick train
  and drew close to Aunt Phyllis. His manner was solemn and impressive exactly
  as Mary's friend's had been; his words were as slow and deliberate. "Jesus
  Krice could go dead and come alive again," he said, "over and over, whenever
  He wanted to."</p>

  <p>And having paused a moment to complete the effect of this marvel, Peter
  turned about again, squatted down like a little brown holland mushroom with a
  busy little knob on the top, and resumed his shouting. "Hoo! Chuff-Chuff.
  Chuff-Chuff. Chuff."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">One day Mary with an unaccustomed urgency in her manner
  hurried Joan and Peter out of the garden and into the nursery, and there
  tidied them up with emphasis. Joan showed fight a bit but not much; Peter was
  thinking of something else and was just limp. Then Mary took them down to the
  living-room, the big low room with the ingle-nook and the dining-table in the
  far bay beside the second fireplace. There they beheld a large female Visitor
  of the worst sort. They approached her with extreme reluctance, impelled by
  Mary's gentle but persistent hand. The Visitor was sitting in the window-seat
  with Aunt Phyllis beside her. And Aunt Phoebe was standing before the little
  fireplace. But these were incidental observations; the great fact was the
  Visitor.</p>

  <p>She was the largest lady that Peter had ever seen; she had a plumed hat
  with black chiffon and large purple bows and a brim of soft black stuff and
  suchlike things, and she wore a large cape in three tiers and a large black
  feather boa that hissed when she moved and disseminated feathers. Her
  shoulders were enormously exaggerated by a kind of vast epaulette, and after
  the custom of all loyal Anglicans in those days her neck was tightly swathed
  about and adorned with a big purple bow. Everything she wore had been
  decorated and sewn upon, and her chequered skirts below were cut out by
  panels and revelations of flounced purple. In the midst of this costume,
  beneath the hat and a pale blonde fuss of hair, was set a large, pale,
  freckled, square-featured face with two hard blue eyes and a fascinating
  little tussock of sandy hair growing out of one cheek that instantly captured
  the eye of the little boy. And out of the face proceeded a harsh voice, slow,
  loud, and pitched in that note of arrogance which was the method of the
  ruling class in those days. "So these are our little Wards," said the voice,
  and as she spoke her lips wrinkled and her teeth showed.</p>

  <p>She turned to Phyllis with a confidential air, but spoke still in the same
  clear tones. "Which is the By-blow, my dear, the Boy or the Gel?"</p>

  <p>"Lady Charlotte!" exclaimed Phyllis, and then spoke in-audibly, explaining
  something.</p>

  <p>But Peter made a note of "By-blow." It was a lovely word.</p>

  <p>"Not even in Black. They ought to wear Black," he heard the big lady
  say.</p>

  <p>Then he found himself being scrutinized.</p>

  <p>"Haugh!" said the big lady, making a noise like the casual sounds emitted
  by large wading birds. "They both take after the Sydenhams, anyhow. They
  might be brother and sister!"</p>

  <p>"Practically they are," said Aunt Phoebe.</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte confuted her with an unreal smile. "Practically
  <i>not</i>," she said decisively.</p>

  <p>There was a little pause. "Well, Master Stubland," said the Visitor
  abruptly and quite terrifyingly. "What have you got to say for yourself?"</p>

  <p>As Peter had not yet learnt to swear freely, he had nothing to say for
  himself just at that moment.</p>

  <p>"Not very Bright yet," said Lady Charlotte goadingly. "I suppose they have
  run wild hitherto."</p>

  <p>"It was poor Arthur's wish&mdash;" began Aunt Phyllis.</p>

  <p>"We must alter all that now," Lady Charlotte interrupted. "Tell me your
  name, little boy."</p>

  <p>"Peter Picktoe," said Peter with invention. "You going to stop here
  long?"</p>

  <p>"So you've found your tongue at last," said Lady Charlotte. "That's only
  your nickname. What's your proper name?"</p>

  <p>"Can we go out in the garden now, Auntie?" said Peter; "and play at By-
  blows?"</p>

  <p>"Garden now," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"He's Brighter than you seem to think," said Aunt Phoebe with gentle
  sarcasm.</p>

  <p>"Commina <i>Garden</i>," said Joan, tugging at Peter's pinafore.</p>

  <p>"But I must ask him his name first," said Lady Charlotte, "and," with
  growing firmness, "he must tell it me. Come! What is your name, my dear?"</p>

  <p>"Peter," prompted Mary.</p>

  <p>"Peter," said Peter, satisfied that it was a silly game and anxious to get
  it over and away from this horror as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>"And who gave you that name?"</p>

  <p>"Nobody; it's mine," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Isn't the poor child even <i>beginning</i> to learn his Catechism?" asked
  Lady Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the garden," said Aunt Phoebe to Mary, and the scene began to close
  upon the children as they moved gardenward. Joan danced ahead. Peter followed
  thoughtfully before Mary's gentle urgency. What was that last word?
  "Cattymism?" Then a fresh thought occurred to him.</p>

  <p>"Mary," said Peter, in an impassioned and all too audible undertone;
  "look. She's got a Whisker. <i>Here</i>! Troof!"</p>

  <p>"It was my brother's wish," Phyllis was explaining as the children
  disappeared through the door....</p>

  <p>"It isn't the modern way to begin so early with rote-learning," said Aunt
  Phoebe; "the little fellow's still not five."</p>

  <p>"He's a pretty good size."</p>

  <p>"Because we haven't worried his mind yet. Milk, light, play, like a happy
  little animal."</p>

  <p>"We must change all that now," said Lady Charlotte Sydenham with
  conviction.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap05"
     name="chap05">CHAPTER V. &mdash; THE CHRISTENING</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">LADY CHARLOTTE SYDENHAM was one of those large, ignorant,
  ruthless, low- church, wealthy, and well-born ladies who did so much to make
  England what it was in the days before the Great War. She was educated with
  the utmost care by totally illiterate governesses who were ladies by birth,
  chiefly on the importance and privileges of her social position, the Anglican
  faith and Mrs. Strickland's "Queens of England"; she had French from a
  guaranteed Protestant teacher and German from a North German instructress
  (Lutheran Protestant), who also taught her to play the piano with the force
  and precision of a crack regiment of cavalry. Subsequently she had improved
  her mind by reading memoirs and biographies of noble and distinguished people
  and by travel amidst obvious scenery and good foreign hotels. She had married
  at two-and-thirty when things were beginning to look rather doubtful for
  her.</p>

  <p>Old Mr. Sydenham, who had made his money and undermined his health in
  India in the John Company days, had been fifty-four, and from the very outset
  she had been ever so much too much for him. At sixty-five he had petered out
  like an exhausted lode. She had already got an abject confidential maid into
  thorough training, and was fully prepared for widowhood. She hung out big
  black bonnets and expensive black clothes upon her projections, so as to look
  larger than ever, and took her place and even more than her place, very
  resolutely, among the leaders of the county Anglicans.</p>

  <p>She had early mastered the simple arts of county family intercourse. Her
  style in contradiction was very good, her insults were frequently witty, she
  could pretend to love horses, there was no need for her to pretend to despise
  and hate tradesmen and working people, and she kept herself well-informed
  upon the domestic details of the large and spreading family of the "Dear
  Queen." She was very good at taking down impertinent people, and most people
  struck her as impertinent; she could make a young man or a plain girl or a
  social inferior "feel small" quicker (and smaller) than almost any one in
  that part of Surrey. She was a woman without vices; her chief pleasure was to
  feel all right and important and the centre of things, and to that her maid
  as a sort of grand Vizieress, her well-disciplined little household and her
  choice of friends ministered. The early fear of "Romanists" in which she had
  been trained had been a little dispelled by the wider charities of maturity,
  but she held secularists and socialists in an ever-deepening abhorrence. They
  planned, she knew, to disturb the minds of the lower classes, upset her
  investments, behead the Dear Queen, and plunge the whole world into vice and
  rapine and Sabbath-breaking. She interested herself in such leisure as the
  care of her own health and comfort left her, in movements designed to
  circumvent and defeat the aims of these enemies of God and (all that was
  worth considering in) Man. She even countenanced quite indulgent charities if
  they seemed designed to take the wind out of the sails of socialism. She
  drove about the district in a one-horse carriage and delivered devastating
  calls.</p>

  <p>Such was the lady whom Arthur had made one of the four guardians of his
  little son and niece. He had seen her twice; he had rather liked a short
  speech of five sentences she made at a Flower Show, and he had heard her
  being extremely rude to a curate. He believed her to be wealthy and
  trustworthy and very well suited to act as a counter influence to any
  extravagant tendencies there might be in Aunt Phoebe. Also she was Dolly's
  cousin, and appointing her had seemed a sort of compensation for altering his
  will without Dolly's knowledge. Besides, it had been very unlikely that she
  would ever act. And he had been in a hurry when he altered his will, and
  could not think of any one else.</p>

  <p>Now Lady Charlotte was not by any means satisfied by her visit to The
  Ingle-Nook. The children looked unusually big for their years and
  disrespectful and out of hand. It was clear they had not taken to her. The
  nurse, too, had a sort of unbroken look in her eye that was unbecoming in a
  menial position. The aunts were odd persons; Phyllis was much too disposed to
  accentuate the father's wishes, and Lady Charlotte had a most extraordinary
  and indecent feeling&mdash;all the time she was talking to her that Aunt
  Phoebe wasn't wearing stays. (Could the woman have forgotten them, or was it
  deliberate? It was like pretending to be clothed when you were really
  naked.)</p>

  <p>Their conversation had been queer, most queer. They did not seem to
  realize that she was by way of being a leader in the county and accustomed to
  being listened to with deference. Nearly everything she said they had quietly
  contradicted or ignored. The way in which the children were whisked away from
  her presence was distinctly disrespectful. She had a right, it was her duty,
  to look at them well and question them clearly about their treatment, to see
  that they had proper treatment, and it was necessary that they should fully
  understand her importance in their lives. But those two oddly-dressed young
  women&mdash;youngish women, rather, for probably they were both over
  thirty&mdash;did not themselves seem to understand that she was naturally the
  Principal Guardian.</p>

  <p>Phyllis had been constantly referring to the wishes of this Stubland
  person who had married George Sydenham's Dolly. Apparently the woman supposed
  that those wishes were to override every rational consideration for the
  children's welfare. After all, the boy was as much Dolly's child as a
  Stubland, and as for the girl, except that the Stublands had been allowed to
  keep her, she wasn't a Stubland at all. She wasn't anything at all. She was
  pure Charity. There was not the slightest obligation upon Any one to do
  Anything for her. Making her out to be an equal with a legitimate child was
  just the subversive, wrong-headed sort of thing these glorified
  shoddy-makers, the Stublands, would do. But like to like. Their own genealogy
  probably wouldn't bear scrutiny for six generations. She ought to be trained
  as a Maid: There were none too many trained Maids nowadays. But Arthur
  Stubland had actually settled money on her.</p>

  <p>There was much to put right in this situation, a great occasion for a
  large, important lady to impress herself tremendously on a little group of
  people insultingly disposed to be unaware of her. The more she thought the
  matter over the more plainly she saw her duty before her. She did not talk to
  servants; no lady talks to servants; but it was her habit to think aloud
  during the ministrations of Unwin, her maid, and often Unwin would overhear
  and reply quite helpfully.</p>

  <p>"It's an odd job I've got with these two new Wards of mine," she said.</p>

  <p>"They put too much on you, m'lady," said Unwin, pinning.</p>

  <p>"I shall do what is Right. I shall see that what is Right is done."</p>

  <p>"You don't spare yourself enough, m'lady."</p>

  <p>"I must go over again and again. Those women don't like me. I disturb
  them. They're up to no good."</p>

  <p>"It won't be the first Dark Place, m'lady, you've thrown light into."</p>

  <p>The lady surveyed her reflection in the glass with a knowing expression.
  She knitted her brows, partly closed one eye, and nodded slowly as she
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"There's something queer about the boy's religious instruction. It's being
  kept back. Now why did they get embarrassed when I asked who were the
  godparents? I ought to have followed that up."</p>

  <p>"My godfathers and godmothers wherein I was made," murmured Unwin, with
  the quiet satisfaction of the well-instructed.</p>

  <p>"Properly it's the business of the godparents. I have a right to
  know."</p>

  <p>"I suppose the poor boy has godparents, m'lady," said Unwin, coming up
  from obscure duties with the skirt.</p>

  <p>"But of course he has godparents!"</p>

  <p>"Pardon me, m'lady, but not of course."</p>

  <p>"But what do you mean, Unwin?"</p>

  <p>"I hardly like to say it, m'lady, of relations, 'owever distant, of ours.
  Still, m'lady&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Don't Chew it about, Unwin."</p>

  <p>"Then I out with it, m'lady. 'Ave they been baptized, mlady, either of
  them? 'Ave they been baptized?"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Before a fortnight was out Lady Charlotte had made two more
  visits to The Ingle-Nook, she had had an acrimonious dispute" upon religious
  questions with Phoebe, and she was well on her way to the terrible
  realization that these two apparently imbecile ladies in the shapeless "arty"
  dresses were really socialists and secularists&mdash;of course, like all
  other socialists and secularists, "of the worst type." It was impossible that
  those two unfortunate children should be left in their aunts' "clutches," and
  she prepared herself with a steadily increasing determination and grandeur to
  seize upon and take over and rescue these two innocent souls from the moral
  and spiritual destruction that threatened them. Once in her hands, Lady
  Charlotte was convinced it would not be too late to teach the little fellow a
  proper respect for those in authority over him and to bring home to the girl
  an adequate sense of that taint upon her life of which she was still so
  shockingly unaware. The boy must be taught not to call attention to people's
  physical peculiarities, and to answer properly when spoken to; a certain
  sharpness would not be lost upon him; and it was but false kindness to the
  girl to let her grow up in ignorance of her disadvantage. Sooner or later it
  would have to be brought home to her, and the later it was the more difficult
  would it be for her to accept her proper position with a becoming humility.
  And a thing of immediate urgency was, of course, the baptism of both these
  little lost souls.</p>

  <p>In pursuit of these entirely praiseworthy aims Lady Charlotte was
  subjected to a series of very irritating rebuffs that did but rouse her to a
  greater firmness. On her fourth visit she was not even allowed to see the
  children; the specious excuse was made that they were "out for a walk," and
  when she passed that over forgivingly and said: "It does not matter very
  much. What I want to arrange today is the business of the Christening," both
  aunts began to answer at once and in almost identical words. Phoebe gave way
  to her sister. "If their parents had wanted them Christened," said Aunt
  Phyllis, "there was ample time for them to have had it done."</p>

  <p>"We are the parents now," said Lady Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"And two of us are quite of the parents' mind."</p>

  <p>"You forget that I also speak for my nephew Oswald," said Lady
  Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"But do you?" said Aunt Phyllis, with almost obtruded incredulity.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," said Lady Charlotte, with a sweeping, triumphant gesture, a
  conclusive waving of the head.</p>

  <p>"You know he is on his way back from Uganda?" Aunt Phyllis remarked with
  an unreal innocence.</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte had not known. But she stood up gallantly to the blow. "I
  know he will support me by insisting upon the proper treatment of these poor
  children."</p>

  <p>"What can a man know about the little souls of children?" cried
  Phoebe.</p>

  <p>But Aunt Phyllis restrained her. "I have no doubt Mr. Sydenham will have
  his own views in the matter," said Phyllis.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt he will," said Lady Charlotte imposingly....</p>

  <p>Even Mary showed the same disposition to insolence. As Lady Charlotte was
  returning along the little path through the bushes that ran up to the high
  road where her carriage with the white horse waited, she saw Mary and the
  children approaching. Peter saw Lady Charlotte first and flew back. "Lady wiv
  de Whisker!" he said earnestly and breathlessly, and dodged off into the
  bushes. Joan hesitated, and fled after him. By a detour the fluttering little
  figures outflanked the great lady and escaped homeward.</p>

  <p>"Come here, children!" she cried. "I want you."</p>

  <p>Spurt on the part of the children.</p>

  <p>"They are really most distressingly Rude," she said to Mary. "It's
  inexcusable. Tell them to come back. I have something to say to them."</p>

  <p>"They won't, Mum," said Mary&mdash;though surely aware of the title.</p>

  <p>"But I tell you to."</p>

  <p>"It's no good, Mum. It's shyness. If they won't come, they won't."</p>

  <p>"But, my good woman, have you <i>no</i> control?"</p>

  <p>"They always race 'ome like that," said Mary.</p>

  <p>"Then you aren't fit to control them. As one of the children's guardians,
  I But we shall see."</p>

  <p>She went her way, a stately figure of passion.</p>

  <p>"Orty old Ag," said Mary, and dismissed the encounter from her
  mind.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">"You got your rights like anybody, m'lady," said Unwin.</p>

  <p>It was that phrase put it into Lady Charlotte's head to consult her
  solicitor. He opened new vistas to her imagination.</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte's solicitor was a lean, long, faded blond of forty-five or
  so. He was the descendant of five generations of Lincoln's Inn solicitors, a
  Low Churchman, a man of notoriously pure life, and very artful indeed. He
  talked in a thin, high tenor voice, and was given to nibbling his thumbnail
  and wincing with his eyes as he talked. His thumbnail produced gaps of
  indistinctness in his speech.</p>

  <p>"Powers of a guardian, m'lady. Defends upon whafower want exercise over
  thinfant."</p>

  <p>"I do wish you'd keep your thumb out of your mouth," said Lady
  Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said Mr. Grimes, wincing and trying painfully to rearrange his
  arm. "Still, I'd like to know&mdash;position."</p>

  <p>"There are three other guardians."</p>

  <p>"Generous allowance," said Mr. Grimes. "Do you all act?"</p>

  <p>"One of us is lost in the Wilds of Africa. The others I want to consult
  you about. They do not seem to me to be fit and proper persons to be
  entrusted with the care of young children, and they do not seem disposed to
  afford me a proper share in the direction of affairs."</p>

  <p>"Ah!" said Mr. Grimes, replacing his thumb. "Sees t'point t'Chacery."</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte disregarded this comment. She wished to describe Aunts
  Phyllis and Phoebe in her own words.</p>

  <p>"They are quite extraordinary young women&mdash;not by any stretch of
  language to be called Ladies. They dress in that way&mdash;like the pictures
  in the Grosvenor Gallery."</p>

  <p>"Aesthetic?"</p>

  <p>"I could find a harsher word for it. They smoke. Not a nice thing for
  children to see. I suspect them strongly of vegetarianism. From something one
  of them said. In which case the children will not be properly nourished. And
  they speak quite openly of socialism in front of their charges. Neither of
  the poor little creatures had been bought a scrap of mourning. Not a scrap. I
  doubt if they have even been made to understand that their parents are dead.
  But that is only the beginning. I am totally unable to ascertain whether
  either of the poor mites has been christened. Apparently they have
  not...."</p>

  <p>Mr. Grimes withdrew his thumb for a moment. "You are perfectly within yer
  rights&mdash;insisting&mdash;knowing"&mdash;thumb replaced&mdash;"all thlese
  things."</p>

  <p>"Exactly. And in having my say in their general upbringing."</p>

  <p>"How far do they prevent that?" "Oh; they get in my way. They send the
  children out whenever they feel I am coming. They do not listen to me and
  accept any suggestions I make. Oh!&mdash;sniff at it!"</p>

  <p>"And you want to make 'em?"</p>

  <p>"I want to do my duty by those two children, Mr. Grimes. It is a charge
  that has been laid upon me."</p>

  <p>Mr. Grimes reflected, rubbing his thumb thoughtfully along the front of
  his teeth.</p>

  <p>"They are getting no religious instruction whatever," said Lady Charlotte.
  "None."</p>

  <p>"Hot was the 'ligion father?" said Mr. Grimes suddenly. Lady Charlotte was
  not to be deterred by a silly and inopportune question. She just paused for
  an instant and reddened. "He was a member of the Church of England," she
  said.</p>

  <p>"Even if he wasn't," said Mr. Grimes understandingly, but with thumb still
  in place, "Ligion necessary t'welfare. Case of Besant Chil'n zample. Thlis is
  Klistian country."</p>

  <p>"I sometimes doubt it," said Lady Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"Legally," said Mr. Grimes.</p>

  <p>"If the law did its duty!"</p>

  <p>"You don't wanner goatallaw fewcan 'void it?" asked Mr. Grimes, grasping
  his job.</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte assumed an expression of pained protest, and lifted one
  black-gloved hand. Mr. Grimes hastily withdrew his thumbnail from his mouth.
  "I am saying, Lady Charlotte, that what you want to do is to assert your
  authority, if possible, without legal proceedings."</p>

  <p>He was trying to get the whole situation clear in his mind before he
  tendered any exact advice. Most children who are quarrelled over in this way
  gravitate very rapidly into the care of the Lord Chancellor; to that no doubt
  these children would come; but Lady Charlotte was a prosperous lady with a
  lot of fight in her and a knack of illegality, and before these children
  became Wards in Chancery she might, under suitable provocation, run up a very
  considerable little bill for expenses and special advice in extracting her
  from such holes as she got herself into. It is an unjust libel upon
  solicitors that they tempt their clients into litigation. So far is this
  unjust that the great majority will spare neither time nor expense in getting
  a case settled out of court.</p>

  <p>Nor did Lady Charlotte want to litigate. Courts are uncertain, irritating
  places. She just wanted to get hold of her two wards, and to deal with them
  in such a way as to inflict the maximum of annoyance and humiliation upon
  those queer Stubland aunts. And to save the children from socialism,
  secularism, Catholicism, and all the wandering wolves of opinion that lie in
  wait for the improperly trained.</p>

  <p>But also she went in fear of Oswald. Oswald was one of the few human
  beings of whom she went in awe. He was always rude and overbearing with her.
  From the very first moment when he had seen her as his uncle's new wife, he
  had realized in a flash of boyish intuition that if he did not get in with an
  insult first, he would be her victim. So his first words to her had been an
  apparently involuntary "0 God!" Then he had pretended to dissemble his
  contempt with a cold politeness. Those were the days of his good looks; he
  was as tall and big as he was ever to be, and she had expected a "little
  midshipmite," whom she would treat like a child, and possibly even send early
  to bed. From the first she was at a disadvantage. He had a material hold on
  her too, now. He was his uncle's heir and her Trustee; and she had the belief
  of all Victorian women in the unlimited power of Trustees to abuse their
  trust unless they are abjectly propitiated. He used to come and stay in her
  house as if it was already his own; the servants would take their orders from
  him. She was assuring Grimes as she had assured the Stubland aunts that he
  was on her side; "The Sydenhams are all sound churchmen." But even as she
  said this she saw his grim, one-sided face and its one hard intent eye
  pinning her. "Acting without authority again, my good aunt," he would say.
  "You 11 get yourself into trouble yet."</p>

  <p>That was one of his invariable stabs whenever he came to see her. Always
  he would ask, sooner or later, in that first meeting:</p>

  <p>"Any one bagged you for libel yet! No! Or insulting behaviour? Some one
  will get you sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"Anything that <i>I</i> say about people," she would reply with dignity,
  "is True, Oswald."</p>

  <p>"They'll double the damages if you stick that out."...</p>

  <p>And she saw him now standing beside the irritating, necessary Grimes,
  sardonically ready to take part against her, prepared even to give those
  abominable aunts an unendurable triumph over her....</p>

  <p>"I want no vulgar litigation," she said. "Everything ought to be done as
  quietly as possible. There is no need to ventilate the family affairs of the
  Sydenhams, and particularly when I tell you that one of the children
  is&mdash;She hesitated. "Irregular."</p>

  <p>The thumb went back, and Mr. Grimes' face assumed a diplomatic innocence.
  "Whascalled a love-shild?"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Lady Charlotte, with a nod that forbade all research for
  paternity. If Joan were assumed to be of Stubland origin, so much the better
  for Lady Charlotte's case. "Everything must be done quietly and privately,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"Sactly," said Mr. Grimes, and was reminded of his thumb by her eye. He
  coughed, put his arm down, and sat up in his chair. "They have possession of
  the children?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Should I be here?" she appealed.</p>

  <p>"Ah! That gives the key of the situation.... Would they litigate?"</p>

  <p>"Why should they?"</p>

  <p>"If by chance you got possession?"</p>

  <p>"That would be difficult."</p>

  <p>"But not impossible? Perhaps something could be managed. With my
  assistance. Once or twice before I have had cases that turned on the custody
  of minors. Custody, like possession, is nine points of the law. Then they
  would have to come into court."</p>

  <p>"We want nobody to come into court."</p>

  <p>"Exactly, m'lady. I am pointing out to you how improbable it is that they
  will do so. I am gauging their disinclination."</p>

  <p>The attitude of Mr. Grimes relaxed unconsciously until once more the teeth
  and thumbnail were at their little play again.</p>

  <p>He continued with thoughtful eyes upon his client's expression. "Possibly
  they wouldn't li'e 'nquiry into character."</p>

  <p>"Oh, do take that thumb away!" cried Lady Charlotte. "And don't
  lounge."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, m'lady," said Mr. Grimes, sitting up. "I was saying,
  practically, do we know of any little irregularities, anything&mdash;I won't
  say actually immoral, but indiscreet, in these two ladies' lives? Anything
  they wouldn't like to have publicly discussed. In the case of most people
  there's a Something. Few people will readily and cheerfully face a discussion
  of Character. Even quite innocent people."</p>

  <p>"They're certainly very lax&mdash;very. They smoke. Inordinately. I saw
  the cigarette stains on their fingers. And unless I am very much mistaken,
  one of them&mdash;well"&mdash;Lady Charlotte leant forward towards him with
  an air of scandalous condescension&mdash;"she wears no stays at all, Mr.
  Grimes&mdash;none at all! No! She's a very queer young woman indeed in my
  opinion."</p>

  <p>"M'm!... No visitors to the house&mdash;no gentlemen, for
  example&mdash;who might seem a little dubious!"</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte did not know. "I will get my maid to make
  enquiries&mdash;discreetly. We certainly ought to know that."</p>

  <p>"The elder one writes poetry," she threw out.</p>

  <p>"We must see to that, too. If we can procure some of that. Nowadays there
  is quite a quantity&mdash;of very indiscreet poetry. Many people do not
  realize the use that might be made of it against them. And even if the poetry
  is not indiscreet, it creates a prejudice...."</p>

  <p>He proceeded to unfold his suggestions. Lady Charlotte must subdue herself
  for a while to a reassuring demeanour towards the aunts at The Ingle-Nook.
  She must gain the confidence of the children. "And of the children's maid!"
  he said acutely. "She's rather an important factor."</p>

  <p>"She's a very impertinent young woman," said Lady Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"But you must reassure her for a time, Lady Charlotte, if the children are
  to come to you&mdash;ultimately."</p>

  <p>"I can make the sacrifice," the lady said; "if you think it is my
  duty."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Mr. Grimes would write a letter, a temperate letter, yet "just a
  little stiff in tone," pointing out the legal and enforceable right of his
  client to see and have free communication with the children, and to be
  consulted about their affairs, and trusting that the Misses Stubland would
  see their way to accord these privileges without further evasion.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">The Stubland aunts were not the ladies to receive a
  solicitor's letter calmly. They were thrown into a state of extreme
  trepidation. A solicitor's letter had for them the powers of an injunction.
  It was clear that Lady Charlotte must be afforded that reasonable access,
  that consultative importance to which she was entitled. Phyllis became
  extremely reasonable. Perhaps they had been a little disposed to monopolize
  the children. They were not the only Madonnas upon the tree. That was
  Phyllis's response to this threat. Phoebe was less disposed to make
  concessions. "Those children are a sacred charge to us," she said. "What can
  a woman of that sort know or care for children? Lapdogs are her children. Let
  us make such concessions as we must, but let us <i>guard essentials</i>,
  Phyllis.... As the apples of our eyes...."</p>

  <p>In the wake of this letter came Lady Charlotte herself, closely supported
  by the faithful Unwin, no longer combative, no longer actively
  self-assertive, but terribly suave. Her movements were accompanied by
  unaccustomed gestures of urbanity, done chiefly by throwing out the open hand
  sideways, and she made large, kind tenor noises as reassuring as anything Mr.
  Grimes could have wished. She astonished Aunt Phyllis with "Ha'ow are the
  dear little things today?"</p>

  <p>Mary was very mistrustful, and Aunt Phyllis had to expostulate with her.
  "You see, Mary, it seems she's the children's guardian just as we are. They
  must see a little of her...."</p>

  <p>"And <i>ha-ow's</i> Peter?" said Lady Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"Very well, thank you, Lady Charlotte," said Mary.</p>

  <p>"Very well, thank you lazy Cha'lot," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"That's right. We shall soon get along Famously. And how's my little
  Joan?"</p>

  <p>Joan took refuge behind Mary.</p>

  <p>"Pee-Bo!" said Lady Charlotte tremendously, and craned her head.</p>

  <p>Peter regarded the lady incredulously. He wanted to ask a question about
  the whisker. But something in Mary's grip upon his wrist warned him not to do
  that. In this world, he remembered suddenly, there are Unspeakable Things.
  Perhaps this was one of them.... That made it all the more fascinating, of
  course.</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte was shown the nursery; she stayed to nursery tea. She
  admired everything loudly.</p>

  <p>"And so these are your Toys, lucky Peter. Do you play with them all?"</p>

  <p>"Joan's toys too," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"Such a Pretty Room!" said Lady Charlotte with gestures of approval. "Such
  a Pretty Outlook. I wonder you didn't make its the Drawing-Room. Isn't it a
  pretty room, Unwin?"</p>

  <p>"Very pritty, m'lady."</p>

  <p>Very skilfully she made her first tentative towards the coup she had in
  mind.</p>

  <p>"One day, Mary, you must bring them over to Tea with <i>me</i>," she
  said....</p>

  <p>"I do so want the dear children to come over to me," she said presently in
  the garden to aunts Phyllis and Phoebe.</p>

  <p>"If the would come over quite informally-with their Mary. Just to Tea and
  scamper about the shrubbery...."</p>

  <p>Mary and Unwin surveyed the garden conversation from the nursery window,
  and talked sourly and distrustfully.</p>

  <p>"Been with 'er long?" asked Mary.</p>

  <p>"Seven years," said Unwin.</p>

  <p>"Purgat'ry?" said Mary.</p>

  <p>"She 'as to be managed," said Unwin.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">The day of the great coup of Lady Charlotte was tragic and
  painful from the beginning. Peter got up wicked. It was his custom, and a
  very bad one, to bang with his spoon on the bottom of his little porringer as
  he ate his porridge.</p>

  <p>It had grown out of his appreciation of the noise the spoon made as it dug
  up his food. Now, as Mary said, he "<i>d'liberately 'ammered.</i>" How
  frequently had Mary not told him he would do it "once too often!" This was
  the once too often. The porridge plate cracked and broke, and the porridge
  and the milk and the sugar escaped in horrid hot gouts and lumps over
  tablecloth and floor and Peter's knees. It s was a fearful mess. It was
  enough to cow the stoutest heart. Peter, a great boy of five, lifted up his
  voice and wept.</p>

  <p>So this dire day began.</p>

  <p>Then there was a new thin summer blouse, a glaring white silk thing, for
  Peter, and in those days all new things meant trouble for him. It was put on
  after a hot fight with Mary; his head came through flushed and crumpled. But
  Joan accepted her new blouse as good as gold. Then for some reason the higher
  powers would not let us go and look at the kittens, the dear little blind
  kittens in the outhouse. There were six of them, all different, for the
  Ingle-Nook cat was a generous, large-minded creature. Only after a dispute in
  which Joan threatened to go the way of Peter was "just a glimpse" conceded.
  And they were softer and squealier and warmer than anything one had ever
  imagined. We wanted to linger. Mary talked of a miracle. "Any time," she
  said, "one of them kitties may eat up all the others. Any time. Kitties often
  do that. But it's always the best one does it."</p>

  <p>We wanted to stay and see if this would happen. No! We were dragged
  reluctantly to our walk.</p>

  <p>Was it Peter's fault that when we got to the edge of the common the fence
  of Master's paddock had been freshly tarred? Must a little boy test the
  freshness of the paint on every fence before he wriggles half under it and
  stares at Wonderland on the other side? If so, this was a new law.</p>

  <p>But anyhow here we were in trouble once more, this beastly new white
  blouse "completely spoilt," Mary said, and Mary in an awful stew. The walk
  was to be given up and we were to go home in dire disgrace and change....</p>

  <p>Even Aunt Phyllis turned against Peter. She looked at him and said, "O
  <i>Peter</i>! <i>What</i> a mess!"</p>

  <p>Then it was that sorrow and the knowledge of death came upon Joan.</p>

  <p>She was left downstairs while Peter was hauled rather than taken upstairs
  to change, and in that atmosphere of unrest and disaster it seemed a sweet
  and comforting thing to do to go and look at the kittens again. But beyond
  the corner of the house she saw old Groombridge, the Occasional Gardener,
  digging a hole, and beside him in a pitiful heap lay five wet little objects
  and close at hand was a pail. Dark apprehension came upon Joan's soul, but
  she went up to him nevertheless. "What you been doing to my kittays?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I drownded five," said old Groombridge in a warm and kindly voice. "But I
  kep' the best un. 'E's a beauty, 'e is."</p>

  <p>"But why you drownded 'em?" asked Joan.</p>

  <p>"Eh! you got to drown kittens, little Missie," said old Groombridge. "Else
  ud be too many of um. But ollays there's one or so kep'. Callum Jubilee I
  reckon. 'Tis all the go this year agin."</p>

  <p>Joan had to tell some one. She turned about towards the house, but long
  before she could find a hearer her sorrowful news burst through her. Aunt
  Phoebe writing Ruskinian about the marvellous purity of childish intuitions
  was suddenly disturbed by the bitter cry of Niobe Joan going past beneath the
  window. Joan had a voluminous voice when she was fully roused.</p>

  <p>"They been 'n dwouwnded my kittays, Petah. They been 'n dwouwnded my
  kittays."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">It seemed to Mary that Lady Charlotte's invitation came as a
  "perfect godsend." It was at once used to its utmost value to distract the
  two little flushed and tearful things from their distresses. Great
  expectations were aroused. That very afternoon they were to go out to tea to
  Chastlands, a lovely place; they were to have a real ride in a real carriage,
  not a cab like the station-cab that smells of straw, but a carriage; and Mary
  was coming too, she was going to wear her best hat with the red flower and
  enjoy herself "no end," and there would be cake and all sorts of things and a
  big shrubbery to play in and a flower garden&mdash;oh! miles bigger than our
  garden. "Only you mustn't go picking the flowers," said Mary. "Lady Charlotte
  won't like that."</p>

  <p>Was Auntie Phyllis coming too?</p>

  <p>No, Auntie wasn't coming too; she'd love to come, but she couldn't....</p>

  <p>It all began very much as Mary had promised. The carriage with the white
  horse was waiting punctually at two o'clock on the high road above the house.
  There was a real carpet, green with a yellow coat-of-arms, on the floor of
  the carriage, and the same coat-of-arms on the panel of the door; the brass
  door-handle was so bright and attractive that Mary had to tell Joan to keep
  her greedy little hands off it or she would fall out. They drove through pine
  woods for a time and then across a great common with geese on it, and then up
  a deep-hedged, winding, uphill road and so to an open road that lay over a
  great cornfield, and then by a snug downland village of thatched white
  cottages very gay with flowers. And so to a real lodge with a garden round it
  and a white-aproned gate-keeper, which impressed Mary very favourably.</p>

  <p>"It's a sort of park she has," said Mary.</p>

  <p>As they drew near the house they were met by a very gay and smiling and
  obviously pretty lady, in a dress of blue cotton stuff and flowers in her
  hat. She had round blue eyes and glowing cheeks and a rejoicing sort of
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Here they are!" she cried. "Hullo, old Peter! Hullo, old Joan! Would you
  like to get out?"</p>

  <p>They would.</p>

  <p>"Would they like to see the garden?"</p>

  <p>They would.</p>

  <p>And a little bit of "chockky" each?</p>

  <p>Glances for approval at Mary and encouraging nods from Mary. They would.
  They got quite big pieces of chocolate and pouched them solemnly, and went on
  with grave, unsymmetrical faces. And the bright lady took them each by a hand
  and began to talk of flowers and birds and all the things they were going to
  see, a summerhouse, a croquet-poky lawn, a little old pony stable, a
  churchy-perchy, and all sorts of things. Particularly the churchy-perchy.</p>

  <p>Mary dropped behind amicably.</p>

  <p>So accompanied it was not very dreadful to meet the great whisker-woman
  herself in a white and mauve patterned dress of innumerable flounces and a
  sunshade with a deep valance to it, to match. She didn't come very near to
  the children, but waved her hand to them and crowed in what was manifestly a
  friendly spirit. And across the lawn they saw a marvel, a lawn-mower pushed
  by a man and drawn by a little piebald pony in boots.</p>

  <p>"He puts on his booty-pootys when little boys have to take them off, to
  walk over the grassy green carpet," said the blue cotton lady.</p>

  <p>Peter was emboldened to address Lady Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"Puts on 'is booty-pootys," he said impressively.</p>

  <p>"Wise little pony," said Lady Charlotte.</p>

  <p>They saw all sorts of things, the stables, the summer-house, a little pond
  with a swan upon it, a lane through dark bushes, and so they came to the
  church.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">Lady Charlotte had decided to christen both the
  children.</p>

  <p>She was not sure whether she wanted to take possession of them altogether,
  in spite of Mr. Grimes' suggestion. Her health was uncertain, at any time she
  might have to go abroad; she was liable to nervous headaches to which the
  proximity of captive and possibly insurgent children would be unhelpful, and
  her two pet dogs were past that first happy fever of youth which makes the
  presence of children acceptable. And also there was Oswald&mdash;that woman
  had said he was coming home. But christened Lady Charlotte was resolved those
  children should be, at whatever cost. It was her duty. It would be an act of
  the completest self-vindication, and the completest vindication of sound
  Anglican ideas. And once it was done it would be done, let the Ingle-Nook
  aunts rage ever so wildly.</p>

  <p>Within a quarter of a mile of Chastlands stood a little church among
  evergreen trees, Otfield Church, so near to Chastlands and so far from
  Otfield that Lady Charlotte used to point out, "It's practically my Chapel of
  Ease." Her outer shrubbery ran to the churchyard wall, and she had a gate of
  her own and went to church through a respectful avenue of her own
  rhododendrons and in by a convenient door. Wiscott, the curate in charge, was
  an agreeable, easily trodden-on young man with a wife of obscure
  origins&mdash;Lady Charlotte suspected a childhood behind some retail
  shop&mdash;and abject social ambitions. It was Wiscott whose bullying Arthur
  had overheard when he conceived his admiration for Lady Charlotte. Lady
  Charlotte had no social prejudices; she liked these neighbours in her own way
  and would entertain them to tea and even occasionally to lunch. The organ in
  Otfield church was played in those days by a terrified National
  schoolmistress, a sound, nice churchwoman of the very lowest educational
  qualifications permissible, and the sexton, a most respectful worthy old
  fellow, eked out his income as an extra hand in Lady Charlotte's garden and
  was the father of one of her housemaids. Moreover he was the husband of a
  richly grateful wife in whose rheumatism Lady Charlotte took quite a kindly
  interest. All these things gave Lady Charlotte a nice homelike feeling in
  God's little house in Otfield; God seemed to come nearer to her there and to
  be more aware of her importance in His world than anywhere else; and it was
  there that she proposed to hold the simple ceremony that should snatch Peter
  and Joan like brands from the burning.</p>

  <p>Her plans were made very carefully. Mrs. "Wiscott had a wide and winning
  way with children, and she was to capture their young hearts from the outset
  and lead them to the church. Mary, whom Lady Charlotte regarded as doubtfully
  friendly, was to be detached by Unwin and got away for a talk. At the church
  would be the curate and the organist and the sexton and his daughter and
  Cashel, the butler, a very fine type of the more serious variety of Anglican
  butlers, slender and very active and earnest and a teetotaler. And to the
  children it would all seem like a little game.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wiscott had been in some doubt about the ceremony. He had baptized
  infants, he had baptized "those of riper years," but he had never yet had to
  deal with children of four or five. The rubric provides that for such the
  form for the Public Baptism of Infants is available with the change of the
  word "infant" to "child" where occasion requires it, but the rubric says
  nothing of the handling of the children concerned. He consulted Lady
  Charlotte. Should he lift up Peter and Joan in succession to the font when
  the moment of the actual sprinkling came, or should he deal with them as if
  they were adults? Lady Charlotte decided that he had better lift. "They are
  only little mites," said Lady Charlotte.</p>

  <p>Now up to that point the ceremony went marvellously according to plan. It
  is true that Mary wasn't quite got out of the way; she was obliged to follow
  at a distance because the children in spite of every hospitality would every
  now and then look round for her to nod reassuringly to them; but when she saw
  the rest of the party going into the little church she shied away with the
  instinctive avoidance of the reluctant church woman, and remained remotely
  visible through the open doorway afar off in the rhododendron walk conversing
  deeply with Unwin. They were conversing about the unreasonableness of Unwin's
  sister-in-law in not minding what she ate in spite of her indigestion.</p>

  <p>The children, poor little heathens! had never been in church before and
  everything was a wonder. They saw a gentleman standing in the midst of the
  church and clad in a manner strange to them, in a surplice and cassock, and
  under it you saw his trousers and boots&mdash;it was as if he wore night
  clothes over his day clothes&mdash;and immediately he began to read very fast
  but yet in a strangely impressive manner out of a book. They had great
  confidence now in Mrs. Wiscott, and accompanied her into a pew and sat up
  neatly on hassocks beside her. The gentleman in the white robe kept on
  reading, and every now and then the others, who had also got hold of books,
  answered him. At first Peter wanted to laugh, then he got very solemn, and
  then he began to want to answer too: "wow wow wow," when the others did. But
  he knew he had best do it very softly. There was reverence in the air. Then
  everybody got up and went and stood, and Mrs. Wiscott made Joan and Peter
  stand, round about the font. She stood close beside Joan and Peter with her
  hands very reassuringly behind them. Prom this point Peter could see the
  curate's Adam's apple moving in a very fascinating way. So things went on
  quite successfully until the fatal moment when Mr. Wiscott took Peter up in
  his arms.</p>

  <p>"Come along," he said very pleasantly&mdash;not realizing that Peter did
  not like his Adam's apple.</p>

  <p>"He's going to show you the pretty water," said Mrs. Wiscott.</p>

  <p>"<i>Naw</i>!" said Peter sharply and backed as the curate gripped his arm,
  and then everything seemed to go wrong.</p>

  <p>Mr. Wiscott had never handled a sturdy little boy of five before. Peter
  would have got away if Mrs. Wiscott, abandoning Joan, had not picked him up
  and handed him neatly to her husband. Then came a breathless struggle on the
  edge of the font, and upon every one, even upon Lady Charlotte, came a
  strange sense as though they were engaged in some deed of darkness. The water
  splashed loudly. It splashed on Peter's face and Peter's abundant voice sent
  out its S.O.S. call: "Mare-<i>wi</i>!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Wiscott compressed his lips and held Peter firmly, hushing resolutely,
  and presently struggled on above a tremendous din towards the sign of the
  cross....</p>

  <p>But Joan had formed her own rash judgments.</p>

  <p>She bolted down the aisle and out through the open door, and her voice
  filled the universe. "They dwounding Petah. They dwounding Petah&mdash;like
  they did the kittays!"</p>

  <p>Far away was Mary, but turning towards her amazed.</p>

  <p>Joan rushed headlong to her for sanctuary, wild with terror.</p>

  <p>"I wanna be <i>kep</i>, Marewi," she bawled. "I wanna be
  <i>kep</i>!"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">But here Mary was to astonish Lady Charlotte. "Why couldn't
  they tell <i>me</i>?" she asked Unwin when she grasped the situation.</p>

  <p>"It's all right, Joan," she said. "Nobody ain't killing Peter. You come
  alongo me and see."</p>

  <p>And it was Mary who stilled the hideous bawling of Peter, and Mary who
  induced Joan to brave the horrors of this great experience and to desist from
  her reiterated assertion: "Done <i>wan'</i> nergenelman t'wash me!"</p>

  <p>And it was Mary who said in the carriage going back:</p>

  <p>"Don't you say nothing about being naughty to yer Aunt Phyllis and I won't
  neether."</p>

  <p>And so she did her best to avoid any further discussion of the matter.</p>

  <p>But in this pacific intention she was thwarted by Lady Charlotte, who
  presently drove over to The Ingle-Nook to see her "two little Christians" and
  how Aunt Phoebe was taking it. She had the pleasure of explaining what had
  happened herself.</p>

  <p>"We had them christened," she said. "It all passed off very well,"</p>

  <p>"It is an outrage," cried Aunt Phoebe, "on my brother's memory. It must be
  undone."</p>

  <p>"That I fear can never be," said Lady Charlotte serenely, folding her
  hands before her and smiling loftily.</p>

  <p>"Their Little White Souls!" exclaimed Aunt Phoebe, and then seizing a
  weapon from the enemy's armoury: "<i>I shall write to our
  solicitor.</i>"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">EVEN Lady Charlotte quailed a little before a strange
  solicitor; she knew that even Grimes held the secret of many tremendous
  powers; and when Mr. Sycamore introduced himself as having "had the pleasure
  of meeting your nephew, Mr. Oswald Sydenham, on one or two occasions," she
  prepared to be civil, wary, and evasive to the best of her ability. Mr.
  Sycamore was a very good-looking, rosy little man with silvery hair,
  twinkling gold spectacles, a soft voice and a manner of imperturbable
  urbanity. "I felt sure your ladyship would be willing to talk about this
  little business," he said. "So often a little explanation between reasonable
  people prevents, oh! the most disagreeable experiences. Nowadays when courts
  are so very prone to stand upon their dignity and inflict quite excessive
  penalties upon infractions&mdash;such as this."</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte said she was quite prepared to defend all that she had
  done&mdash;anywhere.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sycamore hoped she would never be put to that inconvenience. He did
  not wish to discuss the legal aspects of the case at all, still&mdash;there
  was such a thing as Contempt. He thought that Lady Charlotte would understand
  that already she had gone rather far.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sycamore," said Lady Charlotte, heavily and impressively, "at the
  present time I am ill, seriously ill. I ought to have been at Bordighera a
  month ago. But law or no law I could not think of those poor innocent
  children remaining unbaptized. I stayed&mdash;to do my duty."</p>

  <p>"I doubt if any court would sustain the plea that it was your duty,
  single-handed, without authorization, in defiance it is alleged of the
  expressed wishes of the parents."</p>

  <p>"But you, Mr. Sycamore, know that it was my duty."</p>

  <p>"That depends, Lady Charlotte, on one's opinions upon the efficacy of
  infant baptism. Opinions, you know, vary widely. I have read very few books
  upon the subject, and what I have read confused me rather than
  otherwise."</p>

  <p>And Mr. Sycamore put his hands together before him and sat with his head a
  little on one side regarding Lady Charlotte attentively through the
  gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Well, anyhow you wouldn't let children grow up socialists and secularists
  without some attempt to prevent it!"</p>

  <p>"Within the law," said Mr. Sycamore gently, and coughed behind his hand
  and continued to beam through his glasses....</p>

  <p>They talked in this entirely inconsecutive way for some time with a
  tremendous air of discussing things deeply. Lady Charlotte expressed a great
  number of opinions very forcibly, and Mr. Sycamore listened with the manner
  of a man who had at last after many years of intellectual destitution met a
  profoundly interesting talker. Only now and then did he seem to question her
  view. But yet he succeeded in betraying a genuine anxiety about the possible
  penalties that might fall upon Lady Charlotte. Presently, she never knew
  quite how, she found herself accusing Joan of her illegitimacy.</p>

  <p>"But my dear Lady Charlotte, the poor child is scarcely responsible."</p>

  <p>"If we made no penalties on account of illegitimacy the whole world would
  dissolve away in immorality."</p>

  <p>Mr. Sycamore looked quite arch. "My dear lady, surely there would be one
  or two exceptions!"...</p>

  <p>Finally, with a tremendous effect of having really got to the bottom of
  the matter, he said: "Then I conclude, Lady Charlotte, that now that the
  children are baptized and their spiritual welfare is assured, all you wish is
  for things to go on quietly and smoothly without the Miss Stublands annoying
  you further."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Lady Charlotte. "My one desire is to go abroad&mdash;now
  that my task is done."</p>

  <p>"You have every reason to be satisfied, Lady Charlotte, with things as
  they are. I take it that what I have to do now is to talk over the Miss
  Stublands and prevent any vindictive litigation arising out of the
  informality of your proceedings. I think&mdash;yes, I think and hope that I
  can do it."</p>

  <p>And this being agreed upon Mr. Sycamore lunched comfortably and departed
  to The Ingle-Nook, where he showed the same receptive intelligence to Aunt
  Phoebe. There was the same air of taking soundings in the deep places of
  opinion.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said at last, "that your one desire is to be free from
  further raids and invasions from Lady Charlotte. I can quite understand it.
  Practically she will agree to that. I can secure that. I think I can induce
  her to waive what she considers to be her rights. You can't unbaptize the
  children, but I should think that under your care the effect, whatever the
  effect may be, can be trusted to wear off...."</p>

  <p>And having secured a similar promise of inaction from the Miss Stublands,
  Mr. Sycamore returned to London, twinkling pleasantly about the spectacles as
  he speculated exactly what it was that he had so evidently quite
  satisfactorily settled.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap06"
     name="chap06">CHAPTER VI. &mdash; THE FOURTH GUARDIAN</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was just a quarter of a year after the death of Dolly and
  Arthur before Oswald Sydenham heard of the event and of Arthur's will and of
  the disputes of his three fellow guardians in England. For when the
  stonemason boatman staggered and fell and the boat turned over beneath the
  Arco Naturale, Oswald was already marching with a long string of porters and
  armed men beyond the reach of letters and telegrams into the wilderness.</p>

  <p>He was in pursuit of a detachment of the Sudanese mutineers who, with a
  following of wives, children and captives, were making their way round
  through the wet forest country north of Lake Kioga towards the Nile province.
  With Sydenham was an able young subaltern, Muir, the only other white man of
  the party. In that net of rivers, marsh and forest they were destined to
  spend some feverish months. They pushed too far eastward and went too fast,
  and they found themselves presently not the pursuers but the pursued, cut off
  from their supports to the south. They built a stockade near Lake Salisbury,
  and were loosely besieged. For a time both sides in the conflict were
  regarded with an impartial unfriendliness by the naked blacks who then
  cultivated that primitive region, and it was only the looting and violence of
  the Sudanese that finally turned the scale in favour of Sydenham's little
  force. Sydenham was able to attack in his turn with the help of a local levy;
  he took the Sudanese camp, killed twenty or thirty of the mutineers, captured
  most of their women and gear, and made five prisoners with very little loss
  to his own party. He led the attack, a tall, lean, dreadful figure with half
  a face that stared fiercely and half a red, tight-skinned, blind mask. Two
  Sudanese upon whom his one-sided visage came suddenly, yelled with dismay,
  dropped their rifles and started a stampede. Black men they knew and white
  men, but this was a horrible red and white man. A remnant of the enemy got
  away to the north and eluded his pursuit until it became dangerous to push on
  further. They were getting towards the district in which was the rebel chief
  Kabarega, and a union of his forces with the Sudanese fugitives would have
  been more than Sydenham and Muir could have tackled.</p>

  <p>The government force turned southward again. Oswald had been suffering
  from fatigue and a recurrence of black-water fever, a short, sharp spell that
  passed off as suddenly as it came; but it left him weak and nervously shaken;
  for some painful days before he gave in he ruled his force with an iron
  discipline that was at once irrational and terrifying, and afterwards he was
  carried in a litter, and Muir took over the details of command. It was only
  when Oswald was within two days' journey of Luba Fort upon Lake Victoria
  Nyanza that his letters reached him.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">During all this time until he heard of Dolly's death,
  Oswald's heart was bitter against her and womankind. He had left England in a
  fever of thwarted loneliness. He did his best to "go to Hell" even as he had
  vowed in the first ecstasy of rage, humiliation and loss. He found himself
  incapable of a self- destructive depravity. He tried drinking heavily and he
  could never be sure that he was completely drunk; some toughness in his fibre
  defeated this overrated consolation. He attempted other forms of dissipation,
  and he could not even achieve remorse, nothing but exasperation with that
  fiddling pettiness of sexual misbehaviour which we call Vice. He desired a
  gigantic sense of desolation and black damnation, and he got only shame for a
  sort of childish nastiness. "If this is Sin!" cried Oswald at last, "then God
  help the Devil!"</p>

  <p>"There's nothing like Work," said Oswald, "nothing like Work for
  forgetfulness. And getting hurt. And being shot at. I've done with this sort
  of thing for good and all...."</p>

  <p>"What a fool I was to come here!..."</p>

  <p>And he went on his way to Uganda.</p>

  <p>The toil of his expedition kept his mind from any clear thinking about
  Dolly. But if he thought little he felt much. His mind stuck and raged at one
  intolerable thought, and could not get beyond it. Dolly had come towards him
  and then had broken faith with the promise in her eyes, and fled back to
  Arthur's arms. And now she was with Arthur. Arthur was with her, Arthur had
  got her. And it was intolerably stupid of her. And yet she wasn't stupid.
  There she was in that affected little white cottage with its idiotic big
  roof, waiting about while that fool punched copper or tenored about
  aesthetics. (Oswald's objection to copper repousse had long since passed the
  limits of sanity.) Always Dolly was at Arthur's command now. Until the end of
  things. And she might be here beside her mate, with the flash in her eyes,
  with her invincible spirit, sharing danger, fever and achievement; empire
  building, mankind saving....</p>

  <p>Now and then indeed his mind generalized his bitter personal
  disappointment with a fine air of getting beyond it. The Blantyre woman and
  that older woman of his first experiences who had screamed at the sight of
  his disfigured face, were then brought into the case to establish a universal
  misogyny. Women were just things of sex, child-bearers, dressed up to look
  like human beings. They promised companionship as the bait on the hook
  promises food. They were the cheap lures of that reproductive maniac, herself
  feminine, old Mother Nature; sham souls blind to their own worthless quality
  through an inordinate vanity and self-importance. Ruthless they were in their
  distribution of disappointment. Sterile themselves, life nested in them. They
  were the crowning torment in the Martyrdom of Man.</p>

  <p>Thus Oswald in the moments when thought overtook him. And when it came to
  any dispute about women among the men, and particularly to the disposal of
  the women after the defeat of the mutineers near Lake Salisbury, it suited
  his humour to treat them as chattels and to note how ready they were to be
  treated as chattels, how easy in the transfer of their affections and
  services from their defeated masters to their new owners. This, he said, was
  the natural way with women. In Europe life was artificial; women were out of
  hand; we were making an inferior into a superior as the Egyptian made a god
  of the cat. Like cat worship it was a phase in development that would pass in
  its turn.</p>

  <p>The camp at which his letters met him was in the Busoga country, and all
  day long the expedition had been tramping between high banks of big-leaved
  plants, blue flowering salvias, dracenas and the like, and under huge
  flowering trees. Captain Wilkinson from Luba Port had sent runners and
  porters to meet them, and at the halting-place, an open space near the banana
  fields of a village, they found tea already set for them. Oswald was ill and
  tired, and Muir took over the bothers of supervision while Oswald sat in a
  deck chair, drank tea, and opened his letters. The first that came to hand
  was from Sycamore, the Stubland solicitor. Its news astonished him.</p>

  <p><i>Dear Sir,</i> wrote Mr. Sycamore.</p>

  <p class="letter">I regret to have to inform you of the death of my two
  clients, your friends Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Stubland. They were drowned by a
  boat accident at Capri on the third of this month, and they probably died
  within a few minutes of each other. They had been in Italy upon a walking
  tour together. There were no witnesses of the accident-&mdash;the boatman was
  drowned with them&mdash;-and the presumption in such cases is that the
  husband survived the wife. This is important because by the will of Mrs.
  Stubland you are nominated as the sole guardian both of the son and the
  adopted daughter, while by the will of Mr. Stubland you are one of four such
  guardians. In all other respects the wills are in identical terms....</p>

  <p>At this point Oswald ceased to read.</p>

  <p>He was realizing that these words meant that Dolly was dead.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Oswald felt very little grief at the first instant of this
  realization. We grieve acutely for what we have lost, whether it be a reality
  or a dream, but Dolly had become for Oswald neither a possession nor a hope.
  In his mind she was established as an intense quarrel. Whatever he had to
  learn about her further had necessarily to begin in terms of that. The first
  blow of this news made him furious. He could not think of any act or
  happening of Dolly's except in terms of it being aimed at him. And he was
  irrationally angry with her for dying in such a way. That she had gone back
  to Arthur and resumed his embraces was, he felt, bad enough; but that she
  should start out to travel with Arthur alone, to walk by Arthur's side
  exactly as Oswald had desired her to walk by his side&mdash;he had dreamt of
  her radiant companionship, it had seemed within his grasp&mdash;and at last
  to get drowned with Arthur, that was the thing to strike him first. He did
  not read the rest of the letter attentively. He threw it down on the folding
  table before him and hit it with his fist, and gave his soul up to a storm of
  rage and jealousy.</p>

  <p>"To let that fool drown her!" he cried. "She'd do anything for him....</p>

  <p>"And I might go to <i>Hell</i>!...</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>damn</i> all women!..."</p>

  <p>It was not a pretty way of taking this blow. But such are the instinctive
  emotions of the thwarted male. His first reception of the news of Dolly's
  death was to curse her and all her sex....</p>

  <p>And then suddenly he had a gleam of imagination and saw Dolly white and
  wet and pitiful. Without any intermediate stage his mind leapt straight from
  storming anger to that....</p>

  <p>For a time he stared at that vision&mdash;reproached and stunned....</p>

  <p>Something that had darkened his thoughts was dispelled. His mind was
  illuminated by understanding. He saw Dolly again very clearly as she had
  talked to him in the garden. It was as if he had never seen her before. For
  the first time he realized her indecision. He understood now why it was she
  had snatched herself back from him and taken what she knew would be an
  irrevocable step, and he knew now that it was his own jealous pride that had
  made that step irrevocable. The Dolly who had told him of that decision next
  morning was a Dolly already half penitent and altogether dismayed. And if
  indeed he had loved her better than his pride, even then he might have held
  on still and won her. He remembered how she had winced when she made her
  hinting confession to him. No proud, cold-hearted woman had she been when she
  had whispered, "Oswald, now you must certainly go."</p>

  <p>It was as plain as daylight, and never before had he seen it plain.</p>

  <p>He had left her, weak thing that she was, because she was weak, for this
  fellow to waste and drown. And it was over now and irrevocable.</p>

  <p>"Men and women, poor fools together," he said. "Poor fools. Poor fools,"
  and then at the thought of Dolly, broken and shrinking, ashamed of the thing
  she had done, at the thought of the insults he had slashed at her, knowing
  how much she was ashamed and thinking nevertheless only of his own indignity,
  and at the thought of how all this was now stilled forever in death, an
  overwhelming sense of the pitifulness of human pride and hatred, passion and
  desire came upon him. How we hated! how we hurt one another! and how fate
  mocked all our spites and hopes! God sold us a bargain in life. Dolly was
  sold. Arthur the golden-crested victor was sold. He himself was sold. The
  story had ended in this pitiless smacking of every one of the three poor
  tiresome bits of self-assertion who had acted in it. It was a joke,
  <i>really</i>, just a joke. He began to laugh as a dog barks, and then burst
  into bitter weeping....</p>

  <p>He wept noisily for a time. He blubbered with his elbows on the table.</p>

  <p>His Swahili attendant watched him with an undiminished respect, for Africa
  weeps and laughs freely and knows well that great chiefs also may weep.</p>

  <p>Presently his tears gave out; he became very still and controlled, feeling
  as if in all his life he would never weep again.</p>

  <p>He took up Mr. Sycamore's letter and went on reading it.</p>

  <p class="letter">"In all other respects the wills are in identical terms,"
  the letter ran. "In both I am appointed sole executor, a confidence I
  appreciate as a tribute to my lifelong friendship with Mr. Stubland and his
  parents. The other guardians are Miss Phyllis and Miss Phoebe Stubland and
  your aunt-in-law, Lady Charlotte Sydenham."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" cried Oswald wearily, as one hears a hopelessly weak jest.
  "But why?"</p>

  <p class="letter">"I do not know if you will remember me, but I have had the
  pleasure of meeting you on one or two occasions, notably after your admirable
  paper read to the Royal Geographical Society. This fact and the opinion our
  chance meetings have enabled me to form of you, emboldens me to add something
  here that I should not I think have stated to a perfect stranger, and that is
  my impression that Mr. Stubland was particularly anxious that you should
  become a guardian under his will. I knew Mr. Stubland from quite a little
  boy; his character was a curious one, there was a streak of distrust and
  secretiveness in it, due I think to a Keltic strain that came in from his
  mother's side. He altered his will a couple of days before he started for
  Italy, and from his manner and from the fact that Mrs. Stubland's will was
  not also altered, I conclude that he did so without consulting her. He did so
  because for some reason he had taken it into his head that you would not act,
  and he did so for no other reason that I can fathom. Otherwise he would have
  left the former will alone. Under the circumstances I feel bound to tell you
  this because it may materially affect your decision to undertake this
  responsibility. I think it will be greatly to the advantage of the children
  if you do. I may add that I know the two Miss Stublands as well as I knew
  their brother, and that I have a certain knowledge of Lady Charlotte, having
  been consulted on one occasion by a client in relation to her. The Misses
  Stubland were taking care of The Ingle-Nook and children&mdash;there is a
  trustworthy nurse&mdash;in the absence of the parents up to the time of the
  parents' decease, and it will be easy to prolong this convenient arrangement
  for the present. The children are still of tender age and for the next few
  years they could scarcely be better off. I trust that in the children's
  interest you will see your way to accept this duty to your friend. My hope is
  enhanced by the thought that so I may be able later to meet again a man for
  whose courage and abilities and achievements I have a very great admiration
  indeed.</p>

  <p class="letter">I am, dear Sir,</p>

  <p class="letter">Very truly yours,</p>

  <p class="letter">George Sycamore."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Oswald, "but I can't, you know."</p>

  <p>He turned over Sycamore's letter again, and it seemed no longer a jest and
  an insult that Arthur had made him Peter's guardian. Sycamore's phrases did
  somehow convey the hesitating Arthur, penitent of the advantages that had
  restored him Dolly and still fatuously confident of Oswald's good faith.</p>

  <p>"But I can't do it, my man," said Oswald. "It's too much for human nature.
  Your own people must see to your own breed."</p>

  <p>He sat quite still for a long time thinking of another child that now
  could never be born.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't I stick to her," he whispered. "Why didn't I hold out for
  her!"</p>

  <p>He took up Sycamore's letter again.</p>

  <p>"But why the devil did he shove in old Charlotte?" he exclaimed. "The man
  was no better than an idiot. And underhand at that."</p>

  <p>His eye went to a pile of still unopened letters. "Ah! here we are!" he
  said, selecting one in a bulky stone-grey envelope.</p>

  <p>He opened it and extracted a number of sheets of stone-grey paper covered
  with a vast, loose handwriting, for which previous experience had given
  Oswald a strong distaste.</p>

  <p><i>My dear Nephew</i>, her letter began.</p>

  <p class="letter">I suppose you have already heard the unhappy end of that
  Stubland marriage. I have always said that it was bound to end in a
  tragedy....</p>

  <p>"Oh Lord!" said Oswald, and pitched the letter aside and fell into deep
  thought....</p>

  <p>He became aware of Muir standing and staring down at him. One of the boys
  must have gone off to Muir and told him of Oswald's emotion.</p>

  <p>"Hullo," said Muir. "All right?"</p>

  <p>"I've been crying," said Oswald drily. "I've had bad news. This fever
  leaves one rotten."</p>

  <p>"Old Wilkinson has sent us up a bottle of champagne," said Muir. "He's
  thought of everything. The cook's got curry powder again and there's a basket
  of fish. We shall dine tonight. It's what you want."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is," said Oswald.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">After dinner, the best dinner they had had for many weeks, a
  dinner beautifully suggestive to a sick man of getting back once more to a
  world in which there is enough and comfort, Oswald's tongue was loosened and
  he told his story. He was not usually a communicative man but this was a
  brimming occasion; Muir he knew for a model of discretion, Muir had been his
  colleague, his nurse and his intimate friend to the exclusion of all others,
  for three eventful months, and Muir had already made his confidences. So
  Oswald told about Dolly and how his scar and his scruples had come between
  them, and what he thought and felt about Arthur, and so to much experimental
  wisdom about love and the bitterness of life. He mentioned the children, and
  presently Muir, who had the firm conscientiousness of the Scotch, brought him
  back to Peter.</p>

  <p>"He was a decent little chap," said Oswald. "He was tremendously like
  Dolly."</p>

  <p>"And not like that other man?" said Muir sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"No. Not a bit."</p>

  <p>"I'm thinking you ought to stand by him for all you're worth."</p>

  <p>Oswald thought.</p>

  <p>"I will," he said....</p>

  <p>The next morning life did not seem nearly so rounded and kindly as it had
  been after his emotional storm of the evening before; he was angry and
  jealous about Dolly and Arthur again, and again disposed to regard his
  guardianship as an imposition, but he felt he had given his word overnight
  and that he was bound now to stand by Joan and Peter as well as he could.
  Moreover neither Lady Charlotte nor the sisters Stubland were really, he
  thought, people to whom children should be entrusted. His party reached
  Luba's the next evening, and he at once arranged to send a cable to Mr.
  Sycamore accepting his responsibility and adding: 11 Prefer children should
  go on as much as possible mother's ideas until my return."</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap07"
     name="chap07">CHAPTER VII. &mdash; THE SCHOOL OF ST. GEORGE AND THE
     VENERABLE BEDE</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">SO for a time this contest of the newer England of free
  thought, sentimental socialism, and invested profits (so far as it was
  embodied in the Stubland sisters) and the traditional land-owning,
  church-going Tory England (so far that is as Lady Charlotte Sydenham was able
  to represent it), for the upbringing of Joan and Peter was suspended, and the
  Stubland sisters remained in control of these fortunate heirs of the ages.
  The two ladies determined to make the most of their opportunity to train the
  children to be, as Aunt Phoebe put it, "free and simple, but fearlessly
  advanced, unbiassed and yet exquisitely cultivated, inheritors of the
  treasure of the past purged of all ancient defilement, sensuous, passionate,
  determined, forerunners of a super- humanity"&mdash;for already the phrases
  at least of Nietzsche were trickling into the restricted but turbid current
  of British thought.</p>

  <p>In their design the Stubland sisters were greatly aided by the sudden
  appearance of Miss Murgatroyd in the neighbourhood, and the rapid and
  emphatic establishment of the School of Saint George and the Venerable Bede
  within two miles of The Ingle-Nook door.</p>

  <p>Miss Murgatroyd was a sturdy, rufous lady with a resentful manner, as
  though she felt that everything and everybody were deliberately getting in
  her way, and an effort of tension that passed very readily from anger to
  enthusiasm and from enthusiasm to anger. Her place was in the van. She did
  not mind very much where the van was going so long as she was in it. She was
  a born teacher, too, and so overpoweringly moved to teach that what she
  taught was a secondary consideration. She wanted to do something for
  mankind&mdash;it hardly mattered what. In America she would have been
  altogether advanced and new, but it was a peculiarity of middle-class British
  liberalism at the end of the nineteenth century just as it was of
  middle-class French liberalism a hundred years before, that it was strongly
  reactionary in colour. In the place of Rousseau and his demand for a return
  to the age of innocence, we English had Ruskin and Morris, who demanded a
  return to the Middle Ages. And in Miss Murgatroyd there was Rousseau as well
  as Ruskin; she wanted, she said, the best of everything; she was very
  comprehensive; she epitomized the movements of her time.</p>

  <p>A love disappointment&mdash;the man had fled inexplicably to the ends of
  the earth and vanished&mdash;had exacerbated in Miss Murgatroyd a passion for
  the plastic affections of children; she had resolved to give herself wholly
  to the creation of a new sort of school embodying all the best ideals of the
  time. She saw herself a richly-robed, creative prophetess among the
  clustering and adoring young.</p>

  <p>She had had a certain amount of capital available, and this she had
  expended upon the adaptation of a pleasant, many-roomed, modern house that
  looked out bravely over the valley of the Weald about a mile and
  three-quarters from The Ingle-Nook, to the necessities of a boarding-school,
  and here she presently accumulated her scholars. She furnished it very
  brightly in art colours and Morris patterns; wherever possible the woodwork
  was stained a pleasing green and perforated with heart-shaped holes; there
  were big, flat, obscurely symbolical colour-prints by Walter Crane,
  reproductions in bright colours of the works of Rossetti and Burne Jones and
  Botticelli, and a full-size cast of the Venus of Milo. The name was Ruskinian
  in spirit with a touch of J.R. Green's <i>Short History of the English
  People</i>.</p>

  <p>Miss Murgatroyd was indiscriminately receptive of new educational ideas;
  she meant to miss nothing; and some of these ideas were quite good and some
  were quite silly; and nearly every holiday she went off with a large notebook
  and much enthusiasm to educational congresses and conferences and summer
  schools and got some more. One that she acquired quite early, soon after the
  battle of Omdurman, was to put all her girls and most of her boys into
  djibbahs&mdash;loose, pretty garments that were imitated from and named after
  the Dervish form of shirt. Hers was one of the first of those numerous
  "djibbah schools" that still flourish in England.</p>

  <p>Also she had a natural proclivity towards bare legs and sandals and
  hatlessness, and only a certain respect for the parents kept the school from
  waves of pure vegetarianism. And she did all she could to carry her classes
  out of the classrooms and into the open air....</p>

  <p>The end of the nineteenth century was a happy and beautiful time for the
  bodies of the children of the more prosperous classes. Children had become
  precious. Among such people as the Stublands one never heard of such a thing
  as the death of a child; all their children lived and grew up. It was a point
  upon which Arthur had never tired of insisting. Whenever he had felt bored
  and wanting a brief holiday he had been accustomed to go off with a knapsack
  to study church architecture, and he had never failed to note the lists of
  children on the monuments. "There you are again," he would say. "Look at that
  one: 'and of Susan his wife by whom he had issue eleven children of whom
  three survived him.' That's the universal story of a woman's life in the
  sixteenth and seventeenth century. Nowadays it would read,' by whom he had
  issue three children who all survived him.' And you see here, she died first,
  worn out, and he married again. And here are five more children, and three
  die in infancy and childhood. There was a frightful boom in dying in those
  days; dying was a career in itself for two-thirds of the children born. They
  made an art of early death. They were trained to die in an edifying manner.
  Parents wrote books about their little lost saints. Instead of rearing
  them."....</p>

  <p>Miss Murgatroyd's school was indeed healthy and pretty and full of
  physical happiness, but the teaching and mental training that went on in it
  was of a lower quality. Mental strength and mental balance do not show in
  quite the same way as their physical equivalents. Minds do not grow as bodies
  do, through leaving the windows open and singing in the sun.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Aunt Phoebe was an old acquaintance of Miss Murgatroyd. They
  had met at Adelboden during one of the early Fabian excursions in
  Switzerland. Afterwards Miss Murgatroyd had been charmed by Aunt Phoebe's
  first book, a little thin volume of bold ideas in grey covers and a white
  back, called, <i>By-thoughts of a Stitchwoman</i>. In it Aunt Phoebe
  represented herself rather after the fashion of one of those richly conceived
  women who sit and stitch in the background of Sir Frederick Leighton's great
  wall paintings at South Kensington, "The Industrial Arts applied to Peace"
  and "The Industrial Arts Applied to War" (her needlework was really very bad
  indeed) and while she stitched she thought. She thought outrageously; that
  was the idea; and she represented all the quiet stitching sex as thinking as
  outrageously. Miss Murgatroyd had a kindred craving for outrageous thinking,
  and the book became the link of a great intellectual friendship. They vied
  with one another in the extremity of their opinions and the mystical
  extravagance of their expressions. They maintained a tumescent flow of
  thought that was mostly feeling and feeling that was mostly imitation, far
  over the heads of the nice little children, who ran about the bright and airy
  school premises free from most of the current infections of body and spirit,
  and grew as children do grow under favourable circumstances, after the manner
  of Nature in her better moods, that is to say after the manner of Nature
  ploughed and weeded and given light and air.</p>

  <p>So far as Aunt Phoebe was concerned, the great thoughts were confined to
  one or two intimates and&mdash;a rather hypothetical circle&mdash;her
  readers. Her mental galumphings were a thing apart. A kind of shyness
  prevented her with strangers and children. But Miss Murgatroyd was impelled
  by a sense of duty to build up the character of her children by discourse,
  more particularly on Sundays. On Sunday mornings the whole school went to
  church; in the afternoon it had a decorous walk, or it read or talked, and
  Miss Mills, the junior assistant, read aloud to the little ones; in the
  evening it read or it drew and painted, except for a special half hour when
  Miss Murgatroyd built its character up. That was her time. Thus, for example,
  she built it up about Truth.</p>

  <p>"Girls," she began, "I want to talk to you a little this evening about
  Truth. I want you to think about Truth, to concentrate your minds upon it and
  see just all it means and can mean to us. You know we must all tell the
  Truth, but has it ever occurred to you to ask why we must tell the Truth? I
  want you to ask that. I want you to be aware of why you have to be good in
  this way and that. I do not want you to be unthinkingly good. I want you to
  be</p>

  <p class="poem">'Not like dumb, driven cattle!<br>
  Be a hero in the strife!'</p>

  <p>or a heroine as the case may be. And so, why do we tell the Truth? Is it
  because if we did not do so people would be deceived and things go wrong?
  Partly. Is it because if we did not do so, people would not trust us? Also
  yes, partly. But the real reason, girls and boys, is this, the real reason is
  that Lying Lips are an Abomination to the Lord, they are disgusting to Him,
  and so they ought to be disgusting to us. That is the real reason why we
  should tell the truth. Because it is a thing offensive and disgraceful, and
  if we did not do so, then we should tell a Lie.</p>

  <p>("Doris, do stop plaiting your sister's hair, please. There is a time for
  all things.)</p>

  <p>"I hope there is no one here who can bear to think calmly of telling a
  Lie; and yet every time you do not tell the Truth manfully and bravely you do
  that. It is an offence so dreadful that we are told in Scripture that
  whosoever calleth his brother a liar&mdash;no doubt without sufficient
  evidence&mdash;is in danger of Hell Fire. I hope you will think of that if
  ever you should be tempted at any time to tell a Lie.</p>

  <p>"But now I want you to think a little of what is Truth. It is clear you
  cannot tell the truth unless you know what truth is. Well, what is truth? One
  thing, I think, will occur to you all at once as part at least of the answer.
  Truth is straightness. "When we say a ruler is true we mean that it is
  straight, and when we say a wall or a corner is out of truth we mean that it
  isn't straight. And, in vulgar parlance, when we say a man is a straight man
  we mean one whose acts and words are true. And another thing of which our
  great teacher Ruskin so often reminds us is, that Truth is Simplicity. True
  people are always simple, and simple people are usually too simple to be
  anything but true. Truth never explains. It never argues. When I have to ask
  a girl&mdash;and sometimes I have to ask a girl&mdash;did she or did she not
  do this or that, then if she answers me&mdash;simply and straightly Yes or
  No, I feel I am getting the truth, but if she answers back, 'that depends/ or
  'Please, Miss Murgatroyd, may I explain just how it was?' then I know that
  there is something coming&mdash;something else coming, and not the straight
  and simple, the homespun, simple, valiant English Truth at all. Yes and No
  are the true words, because as Plato and Aristotle and the Greek philosophers
  generally taught us in the Science of Logic long ago, and taught it to us for
  all time, a thing either is or else it is not; it is no good explaining or
  trying to explain, nothing can ever alter that now for ever. Either you did
  do the thing or you didn't do the thing. There is no other choice. That is
  the very essence of Logic; it would be impossible to have Logic without
  it."...</p>

  <p>So Miss Murgatroyd building up in her pupils' minds by precept and
  example, the wonderful art and practice of English ratiocination.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">At first Joan and Peter did not see very much of Miss
  Murgatroyd. She moved about at the back of things, very dignified and remote,
  decorative and vaguely terrible. Their business lay chiefly with Miss
  Mills.</p>

  <p>Miss Mills was also an educational enthusiast, but of a milder, gentler
  type than Miss Murgatroyd; she lacked Miss Murgatroyd's confidence and
  boldness; she sometimes doubted whether everything wasn't almost too
  difficult to teach. She was no blind disciple of her employer. She had a
  suppressed sense of academic humour that she had acquired by staying with an
  aunt who kept a small Berlin-wool shop in Oxford, and once or twice she had
  thought of the most dreadful witticisms about Miss Murgatroyd.</p>

  <p>Though she had told them to no one, they had kept her ears hot for days.
  Often she wanted quite badly to titter at the school; it was so different
  from an ordinary school. Yet she liked wearing a djibbah and sandals. That
  was fun. She had no educational qualifications, but year by year she was
  slowly taking the diploma of Associate of the London College of Preceptors.
  It is a kindly college; the examinations for the diploma may be taken subject
  by subject over a long term of years. She used to enjoy going up to London
  for her diploma at Christmas and Midsummer. Her great difficulty was the
  arithmetic. The sums never came right.</p>

  <p>Miss Murgatroyd was usually very severe upon what she called the Fetish of
  Examinations; she herself had neither degree nor diploma, it was a moral
  incapacity, and she admitted that she could as soon steal as pass an
  examination; but it was understood that Miss Mills pursued this qualification
  with no idea whatever of passing but merely "for the sake of the stimulus."
  She made a point of never preparing at all ("cramming" that is) for any of
  the papers she "took." This put the thing on a higher level altogether.</p>

  <p>She had already done the Theory and Practice of Education part of the
  diploma. For that she had read parts of <i>Leonard and Gertrude</i>, and she
  had attended five lectures upon Froebel. Those were days long before the
  Montessori System, which is now so popular with our Miss Millses; the
  prevalent educational vogues in the 'nineties were Kindergarten and Swedish
  drill (the Ling System). Miss Mills was an enthusiast for the Kindergarten.
  She began teaching Joan and Peter queer little practices with paper mats and
  paper-pattern folding, and the stringing of beads. As Joan and Peter had been
  doing such things for a year or so at home as "play," their ready
  teachability impressed her very favourably. All the children who fell under
  Miss Mills got a lot of Kindergarten, even though some of them were as old as
  nine or ten. They had lots of little songs that she made them sing with
  appropriate action. All these little songs dealt with the familiar daily
  life&mdash;as it was lived in South Germany four score years ago. The
  children pretended to be shoemakers, foresters, and woodcutters and hunters
  and cowherds and masons and students wandering about the country, and they
  imitated the hammering of shoes, the sawing of stone or the chopping down of
  trees, and so forth. It had never dawned upon Miss Mills that such types as
  these were rare objects upon the Surrey countryside. In the country about her
  there were no masons because there was no stone, no cowherds because there
  were no cows on the hills and the cows below grazed in enclosed fields, trees
  and wood were handled wholesale by machinery, and people's boots came from
  Northampton or America, and were repaired in London. If any one had suggested
  songs about golf caddies, jobbing gardeners, or traction-engines, or
  steam-ploughs, or sawmills, or rate-collectors, or grocers' boys, or
  season-ticket holders, or stockbrokers from London stealing rights-of-way, or
  carpenters putting up fences and trespass-notice boards, she would have
  thought it a very vulgar suggestion indeed.</p>

  <p>Kindergarten did not occupy all the time-table of Miss Mills. She regarded
  kindergarten as a special subject. She also taught her class to read, she
  taught them to write, she imparted the elements of history and geography, she
  did not so much lay the foundations of mathematics as accumulate a sort of
  rubble on which Mr. Beldame, the visiting mathematical master (Tuesdays and
  Thursdays), was afterwards to build. Here again Joan and Peter were
  fortunate. Peter had learnt his alphabet before he was two; Joan had not been
  much later with it, and both of them could read easy little stories already
  before they came under Miss Mills' guidance. That English spelling was
  entirely illogical, had not troubled them in the least. Insistence upon
  logical consistency comes later in life. Miss Mills never discovered their
  previous knowledge. She had heard of a method of teaching to read which was
  called the "Look and Say Method," and the essence of it was that you never
  learnt your letters. It was devised for the use of those older children who
  go to elementary schools from illiterate homes, Mid who are beginning to
  think for themselves a little. From the first by this method the pupils
  learnt the letters in combination.</p>

  <p>"Now, Peter," Miss Mills would say, "this is 'to.' Look and
  say&mdash;to."</p>

  <p>"To," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Now I put this little squiggle to it."</p>

  <p>("P," said Peter privately).</p>

  <p>"And it is 'top'."</p>

  <p>"Top," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"And now <i>this</i> is 'co.' What is this? Look and say."</p>

  <p>Peter regarded "cop" for a moment. He knew c-o-p was the signal for "cop,"
  just as S.O.S. is the signal for "help urgently needed," but he knew also it
  was forbidden to read out the letters of the signal.</p>

  <p>"Cop," said Peter, after going through the necessary process of
  thought.</p>

  <p>His inmost feeling about the matter was that Miss Mills did not know her
  letters, but had some queer roundabout way of reading of her own, and that he
  was taking an agreeable advantage of her....</p>

  <p>Then Miss Mills taught Peter to add and subtract and multiply and divide.
  She had once heard some lectures upon teaching arithmetic by graphic methods
  that had pleased her very much. They had seemed so clear. The lecturer had
  suggested that for a time easy sums might be shown in the concrete as well as
  in figures. You would first of all draw your operation or express it by wood
  blocks, and then you would present it in figures. You would draw an addition
  of 3 to 4, thus:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1303241h-images/JoanAndPeter1.jpg">
  </div>

  <p>And then when your pupil had counted it and verified it you would</p>

  <p>write it down:</p>

  <p class="cp">3 + 4 = 7</p>

  <p>But Miss Mills, when she made her notes, had had no time to draw all the
  parallelograms; she had just put down one and a number over it in each case,
  and then her memory had muddled the idea. So she taught Joan and Peter thus:
  "See," she said, "I will make it perfectly plain to you. Perfectly plain. You
  take three&mdash;so," and she drew</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1303241h-images/JoanAndPeter2.jpg">
  </div>

  <p>and then you take four&mdash;so," and she drew</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1303241h-images/JoanAndPeter3.jpg">
  </div>

  <p>and then you see three plus four makes seven&mdash;so:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1303241h-images/JoanAndPeter4.jpg">
  </div>

  <p>"Do you see now how it <i>must</i> be so, Peter?"</p>

  <p>Peter tried to feel that he did.</p>

  <p>Peter quite agreed that it was nice to draw frames about the figures in
  this way. Afterwards he tried a variation that looked like the face of old
  Chester Drawers:</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1303241h-images/JoanAndPeter5.jpg">
  </div>

  <p>But for some reason Miss Mills would not see the beauty of that. Instead
  of laughing, she said: "Oh, no, that's quite wrong!" which seemed to Peter
  just selfishly insisting on her own way.</p>

  <p>Well, one had to let her have her own way. She was a grown-up. If it had
  been Joan, Peter would have had his way....</p>

  <p>Both Joan and Peter were much addicted to drawing when they went to the
  School of St. George and the Venerable Bede. They had picked it up from
  Dolly. They produced sketches that were something between a scribble and an
  inspired sketch. They drew three-legged horses that really kicked and men who
  really struck hard with arms longer than themselves, terrific blows. If Peter
  wanted to make a soldier looking very fierce in profile, he drew an extra eye
  aglare beyond the tip of the man's nose. If Joan wanted to do a pussy-cat
  curled up, she curled it up into long spirals like a snake. Any intelligent
  person could be amused by the sketches of Joan and Peter. But Miss Mills
  discovered they were all "out of proportion," and Miss Murgatroyd said that
  this sort of thing was "mere scribbling." She called Peter's attention to the
  strong, firm outlines of various drawings by Walter Crane. She said that what
  the hands of Joan and Peter wanted was discipline. She said that a drawing
  wasn't a drawing until it was "lined in." She set the two children drawing
  pages and pages of firm, straight lines. She related a wonderful fable of how
  Giotto's one aim in life was to draw a perfect freehand circle. She held out
  hopes that some day they might draw "from models," cones and cubes and
  such-like stirring objects. But she did not think they would ever draw well
  enough to draw human beings. Neither Miss Mills nor Miss Murgatroyd thought
  it was possible for any one, not being a professional artist, to draw a human
  being in motion. They knew it took years and years of training. Even then it
  was very exhausting to the model. They thought it was impertinent for any one
  young to attempt it.</p>

  <p>So Joan and Peter got through their "drawing lessons" by being as
  inattentive as possible, and in secret they practised drawing human beings as
  a vice, as something forbidden and detrimental and delightful. They drew them
  kicking about and doing all sorts of things. They drew them with squinting
  eyes and frightful noses. Sometimes they would sort of come like people they
  knew. They made each other laugh. Peter would draw nonsense things to amuse
  the older girls. When he found difficulties with hands or feet or horses'
  legs he would look secretly at pictures to see how they were done. He thought
  it was wrong to do this, but he did it. He wanted to make his pictures
  alive-er and liker every time; he was unscrupulous how he did it. So
  gradually the two children became caricaturists. But in their school reports
  there was never anything about their drawing except "Untidy," or, in the case
  of Joan, "Could do better if she would try."</p>

  <p>Peter was rather good at arithmetic, in spite of Miss Mills' instruction.
  He got sums right. It was held to be a gift. Joan was less fortunate. Like
  most people who have been badly taught, Miss Mills had one or two foggy
  places in her own arithmetical equipment. She was not clear about seven
  sevens and eight eights; she had a confused, irregular tendency to think that
  they might amount in either case to fifty-six, and also she had a trick of
  adding seven to nine as fifteen, although she always got from nine to seven
  correctly as sixteen. Every learner of arithmetic has a tendency to start
  little local flaws of this sort, standing sources of error, and every good,
  trained teacher looks out for them, knows how to test for them and set them
  right. Once they have been faced in a clear-headed way, such flaws can be
  cured in an hour or so. But few teachers in upper and middle-class schools in
  England, in those days, knew even the elements of their business; and it was
  the custom to let the baffling influence of such flaws develop into the
  persuasion that the pupil had not "the gift for mathematics." Very few women
  indeed of the English "educated" classes to this day can understand a
  fraction or do an ordinary multiplication sum. They think computation is a
  sort of fudging&mdash;in which some people are persistently lucky enough to
  guess right&mdash;"the gift for mathematics"&mdash;or impudent enough to
  carry their points. That was Miss Mills' secret and unformulated conviction,
  a conviction with which she was infecting a large proportion of the
  youngsters committed to her care. Joan became a mathematical gambler of the
  wildest description. But there was a guiding light in Peter's little head
  that made him grip at last upon the conviction that seven sevens make always
  forty-nine, and eight eights always sixty-four, and that when this haunting
  fifty-six flapped about in the sums it was because Miss Mills, grown-up
  teacher though she was, was wrong.</p>

  <p>Mr. Robert Mond, who has done admirable things for the organized study and
  organized rearing of infants, once told me that a baby was the hardest thing
  in the world to kill. If it were not, he said, there would be no grown-up
  people at all. "But a lot," he added, " get their digestions spoilt, mind
  you, or grow up rickety."... Still harder is it to kill a child's
  intelligence. There is something heroic about the fight that every infant
  mind has to make against the bad explanations, the misleading suggestions,
  the sheer foolishness in which we adults entangle it. The dawning
  intelligence of Peter, like a young Hercules, fought with the serpentine
  muddle-headedness of Miss Mills in its cradle, and escaped&mdash;remarkably
  undamaged.... Joan's, too, fought and escaped, except perhaps for a slight
  serpentine infection. She was feminine and flexible; she lacked a certain
  brutality of conviction that Peter possessed.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">But the regular teaching was the least important thing in
  the life of the School of St. George and the Venerable Bede. It existed
  largely in order to be put on one side.</p>

  <p>Miss Murgatroyd had the temperament of a sensational editor. Her school
  was a vehicle for Booms. Every term there was at least one fundamental
  change.</p>

  <p>The year when Joan and Peter joined the school was the year of the Diamond
  Jubilee, and Miss Murgatroyd had a season of loyalty. The "Empire" and a
  remarkable work called Sixty Years a Queen dominated the school; Victoria,
  that poor little old panting German widow, was represented as building up a
  great fabric of liberty and order, as reconciling nations, as showing what a
  woman's heart, a mother's instinct, could do for mankind. She was, Miss
  Murgatroyd conveyed, the instigator of such inventions as the electric light
  and the telephone; she spread railways over the world as one spreads bread
  with butter; she inspired Tennyson and Dickens, Carlyle and William Morris to
  their remarkable efforts. The whole world revered her. All this glow of
  personal loyalty vanished from the school before the year was out; the Queen
  ceased to be mentioned and the theme of Hand Industry replaced her.
  Everything was to be taught by hand and no books were to be used. Education
  had become too bookish. "Rote learning" was forbidden throughout the
  establishment and "text-books" were to be replaced by simple note-books made
  by the children themselves. Then two bright girls came to the school whose
  father was French, and, by a happy accident, a little boy also joined up who
  had been very well trained by a French governess. All three spoke French
  extremely well. Miss Murgatroyd was inspired to put the school French on a
  colloquial footing, and the time-table was reconstructed with a view to the
  production of Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme on St. George's Day, the anniversary
  day of the school.</p>

  <p>A parent who could paint was requisitioned as a scene-painter, the stage
  was put up in the main schoolroom, and those who could take no other part
  were set to help make the costumes and distribute programs at the
  performance....</p>

  <p>These things happened over the heads of Joan and Peter very much as the
  things in the newspaper used to happen over our heads before the Great War
  got hold of us. They went about their small lives amidst these things and
  with a vast indifference to all such things. They played their little parts
  in them&mdash;the realities of life were not there.</p>

  <p>To begin with, Mary used to take them to school; but after a year and a
  half of that it occurred to Aunt Phyllis that it would cultivate
  self-reliance if they went alone. So Mary only went to fetch them when there
  was need of an umbrella or some such serious occasion. The path ran up
  through the bushes to the high road past the fence of Master's paddock where
  Peter had once covered himself with tar. Then they had to go along the high
  road with a pine-wood to the right&mdash;a winding path amidst the trees ran
  parallel to the road&mdash;and presently with a pine-wood to the left, which
  hid the hollow in which the parents of young Cuspard had made their abode and
  out of which young Cuspard would sometimes appear, a ginger-haired,
  hard-breathing youngster, bare-headed and bare-footed and altogether very
  advanced, and so to the little common where there would be geese or a
  tethered pony. Joan and Peter crossed this obliquely by the path, which was
  often boggy in wet weather, and went along by the Sheldrick's holly hedge to
  the open crest of heather from which one could run down to the school. One
  could see the playground and games going on long before one could get down to
  them. And if it were not too stormy the school flag with its red St. George
  and the Dragon on white would be flying. There were no indications of the
  Venerable Bede on the Flag, but Joan had concluded privately that he was
  represented by the red knob at the top of the flagstaff. For a year and more
  Joan thought that the Venerable Bede was really a large old bead of profound
  mystical significance.</p>

  <p>Joan and Peter varied with the seasons, but except when Joan wore a
  djibbah they were dressed almost alike; in high summer with bare legs and
  brown smocks and Heidelberg sandals, and in winter like rolls of green wool
  stuck on leather gaiters. When they grew beyond the smock stage, then they
  both wore art green blouses with the school emblem of St. George on the
  pockets, but Joan wore a dark blue gym skirt and Peter had dark blue
  knickerbockers simply. The walk altered a little every day. Now the trees
  were dark and the brambles by the roadside wet and wilted, now all the world
  was shooting green buds except for the pines, now the pines were taking up
  the spring brightness, now all the world was hot and dusty and full of the
  smell of resin, and now again it was wet and misty and with a thousand sorts
  of brightly coloured fungus among the pine stems. Joan and Peter learnt by
  experience that throwing pine-cones hurts, and reserved them for the Cuspard
  boy who had never mastered this lesson. Peter started a "Moo-seum" of fungi
  in the playroom, and made a great display of specimens that presently dried
  up or deliquesced and stank. When the snow came in the winter the Cuspard boy
  waylaid them at the corner with a prepared heap of snowballs and fell upon
  them with shrieks of excitement, throwing so fast and wildly and playing the
  giddy windmill so completely that it was quite easy for Joan and Peter to
  close in and capture his heap. Whereupon he fled toward the school weeping
  loudly that it was his heap and refusing to be comforted.</p>

  <p>But afterwards all three of them made common cause against a treacherous
  ambuscade behind the Sheldrick holly hedge.</p>

  <p>It was on these journeyings that Joan began to hear first of the
  marvellous adventures of Uncle Nobby and Bungo Peter. She most liked Bungo
  Peter because he had such a satisfying name; Peter never told her he was
  really the newel knob at home, but she always understood him to be something
  very large and round and humorous and richly coloured. Sometimes he was as
  big as the world and sometimes he was a suitable playmate for little
  children. He was the one constant link in a wandering interminable Saga that
  came like a spider's thread endlessly out of Peter's busy brain. It was a
  story of quests and wanderings, experiments and tasks and feuds and wars;
  Nobby was almost always in it, kind and dreadfully brave and always having
  narrow escapes and being rescued by Bungo Peter. Daddy and Mummy came in and
  went out again, Peter and Joan joined in. For a time Bungo Peter had a
  Wonderful Cat that would have shamed Puss-in-boots. Sometimes the story would
  get funny, so funny that the two children would roll along the road, drunken
  with laughter. As for example when Bungo Peter had hiccups and couldn't say
  anything else whatever you asked him.</p>

  <p>After a time Joan learned the trick of the Saga and would go on with it in
  her own mind as a day-dream. She invented that really and truly Bungo Peter
  loved her desperately and that she loved Bungo Peter; but she knew, though
  she knew not why nor wherefore, that this was a thing Peter must never be
  told.</p>

  <p>Sometimes she would try to cut in and make some of the saga herself.
  "Lemme tell you, Petah," she used to squeal. "You just lemme tell you." But
  it was a rare thing for Peter to give way to her; sometimes he would not
  listen at all to what she had to say about Bungo Peter; he would smite her
  down with "No, he didn't do nuffin of the sort, not reely," and sometimes
  when she had thought of a really good thing to tell about him, Peter would
  take it away from her and go on telling about it himself, as for instance
  when she thought of "Lightning-slick," that Bungo Peter used to put on his
  heels.</p>

  <p>Peter listened to her poor speeding-up with "Lightning-slick" for a
  while.</p>

  <p>Then he said: "And after that, Joan, after that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh! <i>lemme</i> go on, Petah. <i>Do</i> lemme go on. The fird time he
  was runned after by anyfing it was this."</p>

  <p>"He put it on his bicycle wheels," said Peter, getting bored by her,
  "instead of oil."</p>

  <p>"He put it on his bicycle wheels instead of oil," said Joan, accepting the
  idea, "and along came a Tiger." (She had already done a Mad Dog and a
  Bear.)</p>

  <p>But after that Peter took over altogether while she was waving about
  rather helplessly and breathlessly with "the <i>Forf</i> time Bungo Peter
  used Lightning-slick, the forf time&mdash;" and hesitating whether to make it
  a snake or an elephant, Peter could stand it no longer.</p>

  <p>"But you don't know what Bungo Peter did the <i>Forf</i> time,
  Joan&mdash;you don't reely and I do. Bungo Peter told me. Bungo Peter wanted
  the holidays to come, so Bungo Peter went and put Lightning-slick on the
  axles of the Erf."</p>

  <p>"What good was that?"</p>

  <p>"It went fast. It went faster and faster. The Erf. It regular spun round.
  And the sun rose and the sun set jest in an hour or so. 'Cos it <i>would</i>,
  Joan. It <i>would</i>. Yes, it <i>would</i>. There wasn't any time for
  anyfing. People got up and had their breckfus&mdash;and it was bedtime.
  People went out for walks and got b'nighted. Then when the holidays came
  Bungo Peter just put a stick in the place and stopped it going fast any
  more."</p>

  <p>"Put a stick in what place?"</p>

  <p>"Where the Erf goes round. And then, then the days were as long as long.
  They lasted&mdash;oo, 'undreds of 'ours, heaps."</p>

  <p>"Didn't they get 'ungry?" said Joan, overcome by this magnificent
  invention.</p>

  <p>"They 'ad <i>free</i> dinners every day, sometimes four, and 's many teas
  as they wanted. Out-of-doors. Only you see they didn't 'ave to go to bed,
  'ardly ever. See, Joan? ..."</p>

  <p>There had to be a pause of blissful contemplation before their minds could
  go on to any further invention.</p>

  <p>"I believe if I had the fings I could make Lightning-slick," Said Peter
  with a rising inflection of the voice.</p>

  <p>He did believe. As soon as it was really said he believed it. Joan, round-
  eyed with admiration, believed too....</p>

  <p>This Saga of Bungo Peter did not so much end as die out, when Aunt Phyllis
  got little bicycles for her charges after Joan's seventh birthday, and they
  began to ride to school. You cannot tell legends on a bicycle.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Sheldrick was a large, loose painter man held together
  by a very hairy tweed suit, and the Sheldricks were a large, loose family not
  so much born and brought up as negligently let loose into the world at the
  slightest provocation by a small facetious mother. It was Mr. Sheldrick who
  painted the scenery for the school play productions, and it was the
  Sheldricks who first put it into Miss Murgatroyd's head that children could
  be reasonably expected to act. The elder Sheldricks were so to speak the
  camels and giraffes of Miss Murgatroyd's school, but the younger ones came
  down to dimensions that made them practicable playmates for Joan and Peter.
  Every now and then there would be a Sheldrick birthday (and once Mr.
  Sheldrick sold a picture) and then there would be a children's tea-party. It
  was always a dressing-up tea-party at the Sheldricks. The Sheldrick household
  possessed a big chest full of pieces of coloured stuff, cloaks, fragmentary
  wigs, tinsel, wooden swords and the like; this chest stood on the big landing
  outside the studio and it was called the " dressing-up box." It was an
  inexhaustible source of joy and a liberal education to the Sheldricks and
  their friends.</p>

  <p>There were grades of experience in these dressing-up parties. At the
  lowest, when you were just a "little darling" fit only for gusty
  embraces&mdash;Joan was that to begin with and Peter by dint of a resolute
  angularity was but battling his way out of it&mdash;you put on a preposterous
  hat or something and ran about yelling, "Look at meeeeee!" Then you
  rose&mdash;Peter rose almost at once and saw to it that Joan rose too, to
  Dumb Crambo.</p>

  <p>In Dumb Crambo one half of the party, the bored half, is "in." It chooses
  a word, such as "sleep," it tells the "outs" that it rhymes with "sneep," and
  the "outs" then prepare and act as rapidly as possible, "deep," "creep,"
  "sheep," and so on until they hit upon the right word. There was always much
  rushing about upon the landing, a great fermentation of ideas, a perpetual "I
  say, let's," imagination, contrivance, co-operation. So rapidly, joyfully and
  abundantly, with a disarming effect of confusion, the Sheldricks at their
  tea-parties did exactly what Miss Mills believed she was doing in her slow,
  elaborate, remote-spirited Kindergarten lessons, in which she was perpetually
  saying, "No; no, dear, that isn't right!" or "Now let us all do it over again
  just once more and get it perfect." It was Peter who discovered that these
  strange ritual-exercises of Miss Mills' were really a rigid version of the
  Sheldrick entertainments, and tried to introduce novelties of gesture and
  facial play and slight but pleasing variations in the verses. He got a laugh
  or so. But Miss Mills soon put a stop to these experiments.</p>

  <p>From Dumb Crambo the Sheldrick dressing-up games rose to scenes from
  history and charades. Then Mrs. Sheldrick was moved to write a children's
  play about fairies and bluebells and butterflies and an angel-child who had
  died untimely, a play that broke out into a wild burlesque of itself even at
  its first rehearsals. Then came a wave of Shakespearian enthusiasm that was
  started by the two elder Sheldricks and skilfully fostered by Daddy
  Sheldrick, who was getting bored by Dumb Crambo and charades. After a little
  resistance the younger ones fell in with the new movement and an auspicious
  beginning was made with selections from <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>.
  Miss Murgatroyd was first made aware of this new development by a case of
  discipline. The second Sheldrick girl was charged with furtively learning
  passages of Shakespeare by heart instead of pretending to attend to Miss
  Mills' display of a total inability to explain the method used in the
  extraction of the square root. Had it been any other playwright than
  Shakespeare, things might have gone hard with the Sheldrick girl, but
  "Shakespeare is different."</p>

  <p>Miss Murgatroyd, perceiving there was more in this than a mere question of
  discipline, came to see one of the Sheldrick performances, was converted, and
  annexed the whole thing. The next term of school life she made a Shakespeare
  Boom, and she astonished the world and herself by an altogether charming
  production of <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>. In those days the histrionic
  possibilities of young children were unsuspected by the parents and
  schoolmasters who walked over them. Romeo was still played in England by
  elderly men with time-worn jowls and reverberating voices, and Juliet by dear
  old actresses for whom the theatre-going public had a genuine filial
  affection. England had forgotten how young she was in the days of good Queen
  Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>Both Joan and Peter took a prominent part in Miss Murgatroyd's production
  because, in spite of nearly four years of Miss Mills, they still had
  wonderfully good memories. Peter made a dignified Oberon and also a
  delightfully quaint Thisbe, and Joan was Puck. She danced a dance. She danced
  in front of the Queen Titania after the Fairy song. It was a dance in which
  she ceased to be human and became a little brown imp with flashing snake's
  eyes and hair like a thunder-cloud. It had been invented years ago by poor
  dead and drowned Dolly, and the Sheldricks had picked it up again from Joan
  and developed and improved it for her.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">But the Sheldricks were not always acting Shakespeare. There
  were phases in those tea-parties when a kind of wildness came into their
  blood and the blood of those they entertained that called for something more
  violent than dressing-up or acting. Then in summertime they had a great
  scampering and hiding in the garden, it was the sort of garden where you can
  run across the beds and charge through the shrubs, and in winter they played
  "Ogre" or "Darkness Ogre" indoors. In Ogre some one&mdash;it was usually Mr.
  Sheldrick&mdash;was Ogre, and the little corner room out of the hall was his
  Den. And you hid. In the Sheldrick's house you could hide anywhere except in
  the studio or the pantry and china closet; you could hide in Mrs. Sheldrick's
  wardrobe or in the linen cupboard over the hot water pipes (until it got too
  hot for you) or under anybody's bed in anybody's room. And the Ogre came
  after you and caught you&mdash;often by the foot you had left out carelessly
  beyond the counterpane&mdash;and took you to his Den, and there you were a
  prisoner until some brave soul came careering across the hall to touch your
  hand and rescue you and set you free again. The Ogre was never safe against
  rescues until every one was caught, and everybody never was caught; sooner or
  later came a gaol delivery, and so the game began all over again and went on
  until a meal or something released the Ogre or the Ogre struck work. Nobody
  was so good an Ogre as Mr. Sheldrick; there was such a nice terribleness
  about him, and he had a way of chanting "Yumpty-Ow. Yumpty-Ow," as he came
  after you.</p>

  <p>Of course every house is not suitable for Ogre. Intelligent children who
  understand the delights of Ogre classify homes into two sorts. There are the
  commonplace homes we most of us inhabit with one staircase, and there are the
  glorious homes with two, so that you can sneak down one while the Ogre hunts
  for you up the other. The Sheldrick home had two entirely separate staircases
  and a long passage between them, and a sort of loop-line arrangement of
  communicating bedrooms. And also, though this has nothing to do with Ogre, it
  was easy to get out upon the Sheldrick roof.</p>

  <p>"Darkness Ogre" was more exciting in a dreadful kind of way than Ogre. It
  was only played in winter, and all the blinds and curtains were drawn and all
  the lights put out. You didn't need to hide. You just got into a corner and
  stood still, holding your breath. And the Ogre took off his boots and put on
  felt slippers, and all the noise he made was a rustle and a creak, and you
  were never sure that it was him&mdash;unless he betrayed himself by
  whispering "Yumpty-Ow." He creaked rather more than most, but that was a
  matter for delicate perceptions. There were frightful moments when you could
  hear him moving about and feeling about in the very room where you stood
  frozen, getting nearer and nearer to you. You had to bite your knuckles not
  to scream.</p>

  <p>Once when they were playing Darkness Ogre, Peter was in a corner of Mrs.
  Sheldrick's room with Sydney Sheldrick, the third of the Sheldrick sisters,
  and they were crowding up very close together. And suddenly Sydney put her
  arms round Peter and began to kiss his ears and cheek. Peter resisted, pushed
  her away from him. "Ssh," said Sydney. "You be my little sweetheart." Peter
  resisted this proposal with vigour. Then they heard the Ogre creaking down
  the passage. Sydney drew Peter closer to her, but Peter struggled away from
  her and made a dash for the further door. He was almost caught. He escaped
  because somebody else started into flight from the corner of the landing
  outside the studio and drew the Ogre off the scent.</p>

  <p>Afterwards Peter avoided secluded corners when Sydney was about.</p>

  <p>But somehow he could not forget what had happened. He kept on thinking of
  Sydney for a time, and after that she seemed always to be a little more
  important than the rest of his older schoolmates. Perhaps it was because she
  took more notice of him. She wanted to help his work, and she would ruffle
  his hair or pinch his ear as she went past him. She wore a peculiar long
  jersey so that you could distinguish her from the others quite a long way
  off. She had level brows and a radiant smile, her shoulders were strong and
  her legs and feet were very pretty. He noted how well she walked. She always
  seemed to be looking at Peter. When he shut his eyes and thought of her he
  could remember her better than he could other people. He did not know whether
  he liked her or disliked her more than the others; but he perceived that she
  had in some way become exceptional.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">Young Winterbaum was another of Miss Murgatroyd's pupils who
  made a lasting impression on Peter. He was dark-eyed and fuzzy-haired, the
  contour of his face had a curious resemblance to that of a sheep, and his
  head was fixed on in a different way so that be looked more skyward and down
  his face at you. His expression was one of placid self-satisfaction; his
  hands twisted about, and ever and again he pranced as he walked. He had a
  superfluity of gesture, and his voice was a fat voice with the remotest
  possible hint of a lisp. He had two little round, jolly, frizzy, knock-about
  sisters who ousted Joan and Peter from their position as the little darlings
  of the school. The only boy in the school who at all resembled him was young
  Cuspard, but young Cuspard had not the same bold lines either in his face or
  conduct; he was red-haired, his nose was a snout instead of a hook, and
  instead of rather full, well-modelled lips he had that sort of loose mouth
  that blows. Young Winterbaum said his nose had the Norman arch, and that it
  showed he was aristocratic and one of the conquerors of England. He was
  second cousin to a peer, Lord Contango. It was only slowly that Peter came to
  apprehend the full peculiarity of young Winterbaum.</p>

  <p>The differences in form and gesture of the two boys were only the outward
  and visible signs of profound differences between their imaginations. For
  example, the heroes of Peter's romancings were wonderful humorous persons,
  Nobbys and Bungo Peters, and his themes adventures, struggles, quests that
  left them neither richer nor poorer than before in a limitless,
  undisciplined, delightful world, but young Winterbaum's hero was himself, and
  he thought in terms of achievement and acquisition. He was a King and the
  strongest and bravest and richest of all Kings. He had wonderful horses,
  wonderful bicycles, wonderful catapults and an astonishing army. He counted
  these things. He walked from the other direction to school, and though no one
  knew it but himself, he walked in procession. Guards went before him and
  behind him, and ancient councillors walked beside him. And always he was
  going on to fresh triumphs and possessions.</p>

  <p>He had a diplomatic side to him. He was prepared to negotiate upon the
  matter of kingship. One day he reached the crest above the school while it
  was still early, and found Joan and Peter sitting and surveying the
  playground, waiting for the first bell before they ran down. He stood beside
  Peter.</p>

  <p>"All this is my Kingdom," he said, waving both his arms about over the
  Weald. "I am King of all this, I have a great army."</p>

  <p>"Not over this part," said Peter modestly but firmly.</p>

  <p>"You be King up to here," said young Winterbaum. "You have an army
  too."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> want a kingdom too," said Joan.</p>

  <p>Young Winterbaum proposed a fair division of Peter's kingdom between Joan
  and Peter.</p>

  <p>Peter let Joan have what young Winterbaum gave her. It took some moments
  to grasp this new situation. "My kingdom," he said suddenly, "goes right over
  to those ponds there and up to the church."</p>

  <p>"You can't," said young Winterbaum. "I've claimed that."</p>

  <p>Peter grunted. It did not seem worth while to have a kingdom unless those
  ponds were included.</p>

  <p>"But if you like I'll give your people permission to go over all that
  country whenever they like."</p>

  <p>Peter still felt there was a catch in it somewhere.</p>

  <p>"I've got a hundred and seven soldiers," said young Winterbaum. "And six
  guns that shoot."</p>

  <p>Joan was surprised and shocked to hear that Peter had five hundred
  soldiers.</p>

  <p>"Each of my soldiers, each one, counts as a thousand men," said young
  Winterbaum, getting ahead again.</p>

  <p>Then the first bell rang and suspended the dispute. But Peter went down to
  the school with a worried feeling. He wished he had thought of claiming all
  Surrey as his kingdom first. It was a lamentable oversight. He was disposed
  to ask the eldest Sheldrick girl whether young Winterbaum really had a
  <i>right</i> to claim all the Weald. There was a reason in these
  things....</p>

  <p>Young Winterbaum had an extraordinary knack of accentuating possessions.
  Joan and Peter were very pleased and proud to have bicycles; the first time
  they arrived upon them at the school young Winterbaum took possession of them
  and examined them thoroughly. They were really good bicycles, excellent
  bicycles, he explained, and new, not second-hand; but they were not
  absolutely the best sort.</p>

  <p>The best sort nowadays had wood rims. He was going to have a bicycle with
  wood rims. And there ought to be a Bowden brake in front as well as behind;
  the one in front was only a spoon brake. It was a pity to have a spoon brake;
  it would injure the tyre. He doubted if the tubing was helical tubing. And
  the bell wasn't a "King of the Road." It was no good for Peter to pretend it
  had a good sound, "the King of the Road" had a better sound. When young
  Winterbaum got his bicycle his bell was going to be a "King of the Road, 1902
  pattern."...</p>

  <p>Young Winterbaum was always doing this with things, bringing them up into
  the foreground of life, grading them, making them competitive and irritating.
  There was no getting ahead of him. He made Peter feel that the very dust in
  the Winterbaum dustbin was Grade A. Standard I. while The Ingle-Nook was
  satisfied with any old makeshift stuff.</p>

  <p>Young Winterbaum's clothes were made by Samuelson's, the best boys' tailor
  in London; there was no disputing it because there was an advertisement in
  <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> that said as much; he was in trousers and Peter
  had knickerbockers; he wore sock suspenders, and he had his name in gold
  letters inside his straw hat. Also he had a pencil-case like no other
  pencil-case in the school. He was always proposing a comparison of
  pencil-cases.</p>

  <p>His imagination turned precociously and easily to romance and love and the
  beauty of women. He read a number of novelettes that he had borrowed from his
  sister's nurse. He imparted to Peter the idea of a selective pairing off of
  the species, an idea for which A Midsummer Night's Dream had already prepared
  a favourable soil. It was after he had seen Joan dance her dance when that
  play was performed and heard the unstinted applause that greeted her, that he
  decided to honour her above all the school with his affections. Previously he
  had wavered between the eldest Sheldrick girl because she was the biggest,
  tallest and heaviest girl in the school (though a formidable person to
  approach) and little Minnie Restharrow who was top in so many classes. But
  now he knew that Joan was "it," and that he was in love with her.</p>

  <p>But some instinct told him that Peter had to be dealt with.</p>

  <p>He approached Peter in this manner.</p>

  <p>"Who's your girl, Peter?" said young Winterbaum. "Who is your own true
  love? You've got to have some one."</p>

  <p>Peter drew a bow at a venture, and subconscious processes guided the
  answer. "Sydney Sheldrick," he said.</p>

  <p>Young Winterbaum seemed to snatch even before Peter had done speaking.
  "I'm going to have Joan," he said. "She dances better than any one. She's
  going to be, oh!&mdash;a lovely woman."</p>

  <p>Peter was dimly aware of an error. He had forgotten Joan. "I'm going to
  have Joan too," he said.</p>

  <p>"You can't have two sweethearts," said young Winterbaum.</p>

  <p>"I can. I'm going to. I'm different."</p>

  <p>"But Joan's mine already."</p>

  <p>"Get out," said Peter indignantly. "You can't have her."</p>

  <p>"But she's mine."</p>

  <p>"Shut it," said Peter vulgarly*</p>

  <p>"I'll fight you a duel for her. We will fight a real duel for her."</p>

  <p>"You hadn't better begin," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"But I mean&mdash;you know&mdash;a duel, Peter."</p>

  <p>"Let's fight one now," said Peter, "'f you think you're going to have Joan
  for <i>your</i> girl."</p>

  <p>"We will fight with swords."</p>

  <p>"Sticks."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but call them swords. And we shall have to have seconds and a
  doctor."</p>

  <p>"Joan's my second."</p>

  <p>"You can't have Joan. <i>My</i> second's the Grand Duke of Surrey-
  Sussex."</p>

  <p>"Then mine's Bungo-Peter."</p>

  <p>"But we've got no sticks."</p>

  <p>"I know where there's two sticks," said Peter. "Under the stairs. And we
  can fight in the shrubbery over by the fence."</p>

  <p>The sticks were convenient little canes. "They ought to have hilts," said
  young Winterbaum. "You ever fenced?"</p>

  <p>"Not much," said Peter guardedly.</p>

  <p>"I've often fenced with my cousin, the honourable Ralph&mdash;you know.
  Like this&mdash;guard. One. Two. You've got to have a wrist."</p>

  <p>They repaired to the field of battle. "We stand aside while the seconds
  pace out the ground," explained young Winterbaum. "Now we shake hands. Now we
  take our places."</p>

  <p>They proceeded to strike fencer-like attitudes. Young Winterbaum suddenly
  became one of the master swordsmen of the world, but Peter was chiefly intent
  on where he should hit young Winterbaum. He had got to hit him and hurt him a
  lot, or else he would get Joan. They crossed swords. Then young Winterbaum
  feinted and Peter hit him hard on the arm. Then young Winterbaum thrust Peter
  in the chest, and began to explain at once volubly that Peter was now
  defeated and dead and everything conclusively settled.</p>

  <p>But nobody was going to take away Peter's Joan on such easy terms. Peter,
  giving his antagonist no time to complete his explanation, slashed him
  painfully on the knuckles. "I'm not dead," said Peter, slashing again. "I'm
  not dead. See? Come on!"</p>

  <p>Whereupon young Winterbaum cried out, as it were with a trumpet, in a loud
  and grief-stricken voice. "Now I shall hurt you. That's too much," and swiped
  viciously at Peter's face and raised a weal on Peter's cheek. Whereupon
  Peter, feeling that Joan was slipping from him, began to rain blows upon
  young Winterbaum wherever young Winterbaum might be supposed to be tender,
  and young Winterbaum began to dance about obliquely and cry out, "Mustn't hit
  my legs. Mustn't hit my legs. Not fair. Oo-oh! my knuckles!" And after one or
  two revengeful slashes at Peter's head which Peter&mdash;who had had his
  experiences with Joan in a rage&mdash;parried with an uplifted arm, young
  Winterbaum turned and ran&mdash;ran into the arms of Miss Murgatroyd, who had
  been attracted to the shrubbery by his cries....</p>

  <p>It was the first fight that had ever happened in the school of St. George
  and the Venerable Bede since its foundation.</p>

  <p>"He said I couldn't fight him," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"He went on fighting after I'd pinked him," said young Winterbaum.</p>

  <p>Neither of them said a word about Joan.</p>

  <p>So Miss Murgatroyd made a great session of the school, and the two
  combatants, flushed and a little heroic, sat on either side of her discourse.
  She said that this was the first time she had ever had to reprove any of her
  pupils for fighting. She hoped that never again would it be necessary for her
  to do so. She said that nothing we could do was quite so wicked as fighting
  because nothing was so flatly contradictory to our Lord's commandment that we
  should love one another. The only fight we might fight with a good conscience
  was the good fight. In that sense we were all warriors. We were fighters for
  righteousness. In a sense every one was a knight and a fighter, every girl as
  well as every boy. Because there was no more reason why girls should not
  fight as well as boys. Some day she hoped this would be recognized, and girls
  would be given knighthoods and wear their spurs as proudly as the opposite
  sex. Earth was a battlefield, and none of us must be dumb driven cattle or
  submit to injustice or cruelty. We must not think that life was made for
  silken ease or self-indulgence. Let us think rather of the Red Indian
  perpetually in training for conflict, lean and vigorous and breathing only
  through his nose. No one who breathed through his or her open mouth would
  ever be a fighter.</p>

  <p>At this point Miss Murgatroyd seemed to hesitate for a time. Breathing was
  a very attractive topic to her, and it was drawing her away from her main
  theme. She was, so to speak, dredging for her lost thread in the swift
  undertow of hygienic doctrine as one might dredge for a lost cable. She got
  it presently, and concluded by hoping that this would be a lesson to Philip
  and Peter and that henceforth they would learn that great lesson of Prince
  Kropotkin's that cooperation is better than conflict.</p>

  <p>Neither of the two combatants listened very closely to this discourse.
  Peter was wrestling with the question whether a hot red weal across one's
  cheek is compatible with victory, and young Winterbaum with the still more
  subtle difficulty of whether he had been actually running away or merely
  stepping back when he had collided with Miss Murgatroyd, and what impression
  this apparently retrograde movement had made on her mind and upon the mind of
  Peter. Did they understand that sometimes a swordsman had to go back and
  could go back without the slightest discredit?...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">After this incident the disposal of Joan ceased to be a
  topic for conversation between young Winterbaum and Peter, and presently
  young Winterbaum conveyed to Peter in an offhand manner that he adored Minnie
  Restharrow as the cleverest and most charming girl in the school. She was
  indeed absolutely the best thing to be got in that way. She was, he opined,
  cleverer even than Miss Murgatroyd. He was therefore, he intimated, in love
  with Minnie Restharrow. It was a great passion.</p>

  <p>So far as Peter was concerned, he gathered, it might be.</p>

  <p>All the canons of romance required that Peter, having fought for and won
  Joan, should thereupon love Joan and her only until he was of an age to marry
  her. As a matter of fact, having disposed of this invader of his private
  ascendancy over Joan, he thought no more of her in that relationship. He
  decided, however, that if young Winterbaum was going to have a sweetheart he
  must have one too, and mysterious processes of his mind indicated Sydney
  Sheldrick as the only possible person. It was not that Peter particularly
  wanted a sweetheart, but he was not going to let young Winterbaum come it
  over him&mdash;any more than he was going to let young Winterbaum be King of
  more than half of Surrey. He was profoundly bored by all this
  competitiveness, but obscure instincts urged him to keep his end up.</p>

  <p>One day Miss Murgatroyd was expatiating to the mother of a prospective
  pupil upon the wonderful effects of coeducation in calming the passions. "The
  boys and girls grow up together, get used to each other, and there's never
  any nonsense between them."</p>

  <p>"And don't they&mdash;well, take an interest in each other?"</p>

  <p>"Not in that way. Not in any undesirable way. Such as they would if they
  had been morbidly separated."</p>

  <p>"But it seems almost unnatural for them not to take an interest."</p>

  <p>"Experience, I can assure you, shows otherwise," said Miss Murgatroyd
  conclusively.</p>

  <p>At that moment two figures, gravely conversing together, passed across the
  lawn in the middle distance; one was a well-grown girl of thirteen in a
  short-skirted gymnasium dress, the other a nice-looking boy of ten,
  knickerbockered, bare-legged, sandalled, and wearing the art green blouse of
  the school. They looked the most open-air and unsophisticated children of
  modernity it was possible to conceive. This is what they were saying:</p>

  <p>"Sydney, when I grow up I'm going to marry you. You got to be my
  sweetheart. See?"</p>

  <p>"You darling! Is that what you have to tell me? I didn't think you loved
  me a little bit."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to marry you," said Peter, sticking to the facts of the
  case.</p>

  <p>"I'd hug you. Only old Muggy is looking out of the window. But the very
  first chance I get I'll kiss you. And you'll have to kiss me back, mind,
  Peter."</p>

  <p>"Where some one can't see us," Peter stipulated.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I <i>love</i> spooning," said the ardent Sydney. "'Member when I
  kissed you before? ..."</p>

  <p>"The girls refine the boys and the whole atmosphere is just a
  <i>family</i> atmosphere," Miss Murgatroyd was explaining at the window.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap08"
     name="chap08">CHAPTER VIII. &mdash; THE HIGH CROSS PREPARATORY
     SCHOOL</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">FROM the time when he was christened until he was ten, Lady
  Charlotte Sydenham remained only a figure in the remotest background of
  Peter's life. Once or twice he saw her in the downstairs room at The
  Ingle-Nook with his aunts bristling defensively beside her, and once she came
  to the school, and each time she looked at him with a large, hard, hostile
  smile and said: "And ha-ow s Peter? and then with a deepening disapproval:
  "Ha-ow s Joan? But that did not mean that Lady Charlotte had done with Joan
  and Peter, nor that she had relinquished in the slightest degree her claims
  to dominate their upbringing. She was just letting them grow up a little
  "according to their mother's ideas, poor woman," and biding her time. She
  wrote every now and then to Aunts Phyllis and Phoebe, just to remind them of
  her authority, and she wrote two long and serious letters to Oswald about
  what was to be done. He answered her briefly in such terms as: "Let well
  alone. Religion comes later." Oswald had never returned to England. He had
  been in Uganda now for five long years, and her fear of him was dying down.
  She was beginning to think that perhaps he did not care very much for Joan
  and Peter. He had had blackwater fever again. Perhaps he would never come
  home any more.</p>

  <p>Then in the years 1901 and 1902 she had been much occupied by a special
  campaign against various London socialists that had ended in a libel case.
  She was quite convinced that all socialists were extremely immoral people,
  she was greatly alarmed at the spread of socialism, and so she wrote and
  employed a secretary to write letters to a number of people marked "private
  and confidential," warning them against this or that prominent socialist. In
  these she made various definite statements which, as her counsel vainly tried
  to argue, were not to be regarded as statements of fact so much as
  illustrations of the tendency of socialist teaching. She was tackled by a
  gentleman in a red necktie named Bamshot, of impregnable virtue, in whom her
  free gift of "numerous illegitimate children" had evoked no gratitude. Her
  efforts to have him "thoroughly cross-examined" produced no sympathy in
  either judge or jury. All men, she realized, are wicked and anxious to shield
  each other. She left the court with a passionate and almost uncontrollable
  desire to write more letters about Bamshot and more, worse than ever, and
  with much nastier charges. And it was perhaps a subconscious effort to shift
  the pressure of this dangerous impulse that turned her mind to the state of
  spiritual neglect in which Joan and Peter were growing out of childhood.</p>

  <p>A number of other minor causes moved her in the same direction. She had
  had a violent quarrel about the bill with the widow of an Anglican clergyman
  who kept her favourite pension at Bordighera; and she could still not forgive
  the establishment at Pallanza that, two years before, had refused to dismiss
  its head-waiter for saying "Vivent les Boers!" in her hearing. She had been
  taking advice about a suitable and thoroughly comfortable substitute for
  these resorts and meanwhile she had stayed on in England&mdash;until there
  were oysters on the table. Lady Charlotte Sydenham had an unrefined appetite
  for oysters, and with oysters came a still less refined craving for Dublin
  stout. It was an odd secret weakness understood only by her domestics, and
  noted only by^a small circle of intimate friends.</p>

  <p>"I don't seem to fancy anything very much to-day, Unwin," Lady Charlotte
  used to say.</p>

  <p>"I don't know if you'd be tempted by a nice oyster or two, mlady. They're
  very pick-me-up things," the faithful attendant would suggest. "It's
  September now, and there's and R in the month, so its safe to venture-"</p>

  <p>"Mm."</p>

  <p>"And if I might make so bold as to add a 'arf bottle of good Guinness,
  m'lady. It's a tonic. Run down as you are."</p>

  <p>Without oysters neither Lady Charlotte nor Unwin would have considered
  stout a proper drink for a lady. And indeed it was not a proper drink for
  Lady Charlotte. A very little stout sufficed to derange her naturally
  delicate internal chemistry. Upon the internal chemistry of Lady Charlotte
  her equanimity ultimately depended. There is wrath in stout....</p>

  <p>Then Mr. Grimes, who had never ceased to hope that considerable
  out-of-court activities might still be developed around these two little
  wards, had taken great pains to bring Aunt Phoebe's <i>Collected Papers of a
  Stitchwoman (Second Series)</i> and her little precious volume <i>Carmen
  Naturae</i> before his client's notice.</p>

  <p>These books certainly made startling reading for Lady Charlotte. She had
  never seen the first "Stitchwoman" papers, she knew nothing of Swinburne,
  Ruskin, Carlyle, the decadents, nothing of the rich inspirations of the later
  Victorian period, arid so the almost luscious richness of Aunt Phoebe's
  imagination, her florid verbiage, her note of sensuous defiance, burst almost
  devastatingly upon a mind that was habituated to the ordered passions and
  pearly greys of Mrs. Henry Wood's novels <i>More Leaves</i>, <i>Good
  Words</i>, and <i>The Quiver</i>.</p>

  <p>"'With what measure ye mete,'" she read, "'so shall it be meted unto you
  again,' and the Standard that Man has fixed for woman recoils now upon his
  head. Which standard is it to be,&mdash;His or Hers? No longer can we fight
  under two flags. Wild oats, or the Immaculate Banner? Question to be answered
  shrewdly, and according to whether we deem it is Experience or Escape we live
  for, now that we are out of Eden footing it among the sturdy, exhilarating
  thistles. What will ye, my masters?&mdash;pallid man unstained, or seasoned
  woman? Judgment hesitates. Judgment may indeed hesitate. I, who sit here
  stitching, mark her hesitation, myself&mdash;observant. Is it too bold a
  speculation that presently golden lassies as well as golden lads will sow
  their wild oats bravely on the slopes of life? Is it too much to dream of
  that grave mother of a greater world, the Woman of the Future, glancing back
  from the glowing harvest of her life to some tall premonition by the
  wayside?&mdash;her One Wild Oat! the crown and seal of her education!"</p>

  <p>"Either she means nothing by that," said Lady Charlotte, "or she means
  just sheer depravity. Wild Oat, indeed! Really! To call it that I With Joan
  on her hands already!"</p>

  <p>And here again is a little poem from <i>Carmen Naturae</i>, which also
  impressed Lady Charlotte very unfavourably:</p>

  <p class="cp">THE MATERIALIST SINGS</p>

  <p class="poem">Put by your tangled Trinities<br>
  And let the atoms swing,<br>
  The merry magic atoms<br>
  That trace out everything.</p>

  <p class="poem">These ancient gods are fantasies,<br>
  Mere Metaphors and Names;<br>
  But I can feel the Vortex Ring<br>
  Go singing through my veins.</p>

  <p class="poem">No casket of a pallid ghost,<br>
  But all compact of thrills,<br>
  My body beats and throbs and lives,<br>
  My Mighty Atom wills.</p>

  <p>"I <i>don't</i> know what the world is coming to," said Lady Charlotte.
  "In other times a woman who ventured to write such blasphemy would have been
  Struck Dead...."</p>

  <p>"Thrills again!" said Lady Charlotte, turning over the offending pages.
  "In a book that any one may read. Exposing her thrills to any Bagman who
  chooses to put down three and sixpence for the pleasure. Imagine it,
  Unwin!"</p>

  <p>Unwin did her best, assuming an earnest expression....</p>

  <p>Other contributory influences upon Lady Charlotte's state of mind were her
  secret anxiety for the moral welfare of the realm now that Queen Victoria had
  given place to the notoriously lax Edward VII., and the renascence of
  sectarian controversies in connexion with Mr. Balfour's Education Act.
  Anglicanism was rousing itself for a new struggle to keep hold of the
  nation's children, the Cecils and Lord Halifax were ranging wide and free
  with the educational dragnet, and Lady Charlotte was a part of the great
  system of Anglicanism. The gale that blows the ships home, lifts the
  leaves.... But far more powerful than any of these causes was the death of a
  certain Mr. Pybus, who was Unwin's brother-in-law; he died through an
  operation undertaken by a plucky rather than highly educated general
  practitioner, to remove a neglected tumour. This left Unwin's sister in want
  of subsidies, and while Unwin lay in bed one night puzzling over this family
  problem, it occurred to her that if her sister could get some little girl to
  mind...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Grimes was very helpful and sympathetic when Lady
  Charlotte consulted him. He repeated the advice he had given five years ago,
  that Lady Charlotte should not litigate but act, and so thrust upon the other
  parties the onus of litigation. She should obtain possession of the two
  children, put them into suitable schools&mdash;"I don't see how we can put
  that By-blow into a school," Lady Charlotte interpolated&mdash;and refuse to
  let the aunts know where they were until they consented to reasonable terms,
  to the proper religious education of the children, to their proper clothing,
  and to their separation. " Directly we have the engagement of the Misses
  Stubland not to disturb the, new arrangement," said Mr. Grimes, "we shall
  have gained our point. I see no harm in letting the children rejoin their
  aunts for their holidays."</p>

  <p>"That woman may corrupt them at any time," said Lady Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"On that point we can watch and enquire. Of course, the boy might stay at
  the school for the holiday times. There is a class of school which caters for
  that sort of thing. That we can see to later."...</p>

  <p>Mr. Grimes arranged all the details of the abduction of Joan and Peter
  with much tact and imagination. As a preliminary step he made Lady Charlotte
  write to Aunt Phoebe expressing her opinion that the time was now ripe to put
  the education of the children upon a rational footing. They were no longer
  little children, and it was no longer possible for them to go on as they were
  going. Peter was born an English gentleman, and he ought to go to a good
  preparatory school for boys forthwith; Joan's destinies in life were
  different, but they were certainly destinies for which play-acting, running
  about with bare feet, and dressing like a little savage could be no sort of
  training. Lady Charlotte (Mr. Grimes made her say) had been hoping against
  hope that some suggestion for a change would come from the Misses Stubland.
  She could not hope against hope for ever. She must therefore request a
  conference, at which Mr. Grimes could be present, for a discussion of the new
  arrangements that were now urgently necessary. To this the Misses Stub-land
  replied evasively and carelessly. In their reply Mr. Grimes, without
  resentment, detected the hand of Mr. Sycamore. They were willing to take part
  in a conference as soon as Mr. Oswald Sydenham returned. They had reason to
  believe he was on his way to England now.</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte, still guided by Mr. Grimes, then assumed a more peremptory
  tone. She declared that in the interests of both children it was impossible
  for things to go on any longer as they had been going. Already the boy was
  ten. The plea that nothing could be done until Mr. Sydenham returned was a
  mere delaying device. The boy ought to go to school forthwith. Lady Charlotte
  was extremely sorry that the Misses Stubland would not come to any agreement
  upon this urgent matter. She could not rest content with things in this
  state, and she would be obliged to consider what her course of
  action&mdash;for the time had come for her to take action&mdash;must be.</p>

  <p>With the way thus cleared, Mr. Grimes set his forces in motion. "Leave it
  to me, Lady Charlotte," he said. "Leave it to me." A polite young man
  appeared one morning seated in a chariot of fire outside the road gate of the
  School of St George and the Venerable Bede. He was in one of those strange
  and novel portents, a "motor-car." This alone made him interesting and
  attractive, and it greatly impressed young Winterbaum to discover that the
  visitor had come about Joan and Peter. Young Winterbaum went out to
  scrutinize the motor-car and its driver, and see if there was anything wrong
  about it. But it was difficult to underestimate.</p>

  <p>"It's a petrol car," he said. "Belsize.... Those are fine lamps."</p>

  <p>Miss Murgatroyd gathered that the guardians of Joan and Peter found it
  necessary to interview the children, and had sent the car to fetch them.</p>

  <p>"Miss Stubland said nothing of this when I saw her the day before
  yesterday," said Miss Murgatroyd. "We do not care for interruptions in the
  children's work."</p>

  <p>The young man explained that the case was urgent. "Lady Charlotte has been
  called away. And she must see the children before she goes out of
  England."</p>

  <p>There was something very reassuring about the motor-car. They departed
  cheerfully to the ill-concealed envy and admiration of young Winterbaum.</p>

  <p>The young man had red hair, a white, freckled face, and a costly and
  remarkable made-up necktie of green plush. The expression of his pale blue
  eyes was apprehensive, and ever and again he blew. His efforts at
  conversation were fragmentary and unilluminating. "I got to take you for a
  long ride," he said, seating himself between Peter and Joan. "A lovely long
  ride."</p>

  <p>"Where?" said Joan.</p>

  <p>"You'll see in a bit," said the young man.</p>

  <p>"We going to Chastlands?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>"No," said the young man.</p>

  <p>"Then where are we going?" said Peter.</p>

  <p>"These here cars'11 do forty&mdash;fifty miles an hour," said the young
  man, changing the subject.</p>

  <p>In a little while they had passed beyond the limits of Peter's knowledge
  altogether, and were upon an unknown road. It was astonishing how the car
  devoured the road. You saw a corner a long way off and then immediately you
  were turning this corner. The car went as swiftly up the hills as down. It
  said "honk." The trees and hedges flew by as if one was in a train, and
  behind we trailed a marvellous cloud of dust. The driver sat before us with
  his head sunken between his hunched-up shoulders; he never seemed to move; he
  was quite different from the swaying, noble coachman with the sun-red face,
  wearing a top hat with a waist and a broad brim, who sat erect and poised his
  whip and drove Lady Charlotte's white horse.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">For a time the road ran undulating between high hedges and
  tall trees and through villages, and all along to the right of it were the
  steep, round-headed Downs. Then came a little town, and the automobile turned
  off: into a valley that cut the Downs across and opened out more and more,
  and then came heathery common and a town, and then lanes and many villages,
  flat meadows and flatter, poplars, and then another town with a bridge, and
  then across long levels of green a glimpse of the big tower of Windsor
  Castle. "This is Runnymede, where Magna Carta was signed," said the young man
  suddenly. "And that's Windsor, where the King lives&mdash;when he isn't
  living somewhere else, as he usually does.... He's a 'ot un is the King....
  See the chap there sailing a boat?"</p>

  <p>They went right into Windsor and had a glimpse of the great gates of the
  Castle and the round tower very near to them, and then they turned down a
  steep, narrow, paved street and so came into a district of little mean villas
  in rows and rows. And outside one of these the car stopped.</p>

  <p>"Here we are," said the young man.</p>

  <p>"Where are we?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>"Where we get out," said the young man. "Time we had a feed."</p>

  <p>"Dinnah," said Joan, with a bright expression, and prepared to
  descend.</p>

  <p>A small, white-faced, anxious woman appeared at the door. She was wearing
  amiability as one wears a Sabbath garment. Moreover, she had a greyish-black
  dress that ended in a dingy, stiff buff frilling at the neck and wrists.</p>

  <p>"You Mrs. Pybus?" asked the young man.</p>

  <p>"I been expecting you a nour," said Mrs. Pybus, acquiescing in the name.
  "Is this the young lady and gentleman?"</p>

  <p>That again was a question that needed no answer. The group halted
  awkwardly on the doorstep for a few seconds. "And this is Miss Joan?" said
  Mrs. Pybus, with a joyless smile. "I didn't expect you to be 'arf yr' size.
  And what a short dress they put you in! You must 'ave regular shot up. Makes
  you what I call leggy...."</p>

  <p>This again was poor as a conversational opening.</p>

  <p>"'Ow old might you be, dearie?" asked Mrs. Pybus.</p>

  <p>"I'm eight," said Joan. "But I'll be nine soon."</p>

  <p>The young man for inscrutable reasons found this funny. He guffawed.
  "She's eight," he said to the world at large; "but she'll be nine soon.
  That's good, that is!"</p>

  <p>"If you're spared, you shud say," said Mrs. Pybus. "You're a big eight,
  any'ow. 'Ow old are you, dear?"</p>

  <p>Peter was disliking her quietly with his hands in his pockets. He paused
  for a moment, doubting whether he would answer to the name of "dear." "Ten,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>"Just ten?" asked the young man as if alert for humour.</p>

  <p>Peter nodded, and the young man was thwarted.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll be ready for something to eat," said Mrs. Pybus. "'Adn't
  you better come in?"</p>

  <p>They went in.</p>

  <p>The room they entered was, perhaps, the most ordinary sort of room in
  England at that time, but it struck upon the observant minds of Joan and
  Peter as being strange and remarkable. They had never been before in an
  ordinary English living-room. It was a small, oblong room with a faint
  projection towards the street, as if it had attempted to develop a bow window
  and had lacked the strength to do so. On one side was a fireplace surmounted
  by a mantelshelf and an "overmantel," an affair of walnut-wood with a number
  of patches of looking-glass and small brackets and niches on which were
  displayed an array of worthless objects made to suggest ornaments, small sham
  bronzes, shepherdesses, sham Japanese fans, a disjointed German pipe and the
  like. In the midst of the mantelshelf stood a black marble clock insisting
  fixedly that the time was half-past seven, and the mantelshelf itself and the
  fireplace were "draped" with a very cheap figured muslin that one might well
  have supposed had never been to the wash except for the fact that its pattern
  was so manifestly washed out. The walls were papered with a florid pink
  wallpaper, and all the woodwork was painted a dirty brownish-yellow colour
  and "grained" so as to render the detection of dirt impossible. Small as this
  room was there had been a strenuous and successful attempt to obliterate such
  floor space as it contained by an accumulation of useless furniture; there
  were flimsy things called whatnots in two of its corners, there was a bulky
  veneered mahogany chiffonier opposite the fireplace, and in the window two
  ferns and a rubber plant in wool-adorned pots died slowly upon a rickety
  table of bamboo. The walls had been a basis for much decorative activity,
  partly it would seem to conceal or minimize a mysterious skin disease that
  affected the wallpaper, but partly also for a mere perverse impulse towards
  litter. There were weak fret work brackets stuck up for their own sakes and
  more or less askew, and stouter brackets entrusted with the support of more
  "ornaments," small bowls and a tea-pot that valiantly pretended they were
  things of beauty; there were crossed palm fans, there was a steel engraving
  of Queen Victoria giving the Bible to a dusky potentate as the secret of
  England's greatness; there was "The Soul's Awakening," two portraits of
  George and May, and a large but faded photograph of the sea front at
  Scarborough in an Oxford frame. A gas "chandelier" descended into the midst
  of this apartment, betraying a confused ornate disposition in its lines, and
  the obliteration of the floor space was completed by a number of black
  horsehair chairs and a large table, now "laid" with a worn and greyish-white
  cloth for a meal. Such were the homes that the Victorian age had evolved by
  the million in England, and to such nests did the common mind of the British
  resort when it wished to meditate upon the problems of its Imperial destiny.
  Joan and Peter surveyed it open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>The table was laid about a cruet as its central fact, a large, metallic
  edifice surmounted by a ring and bearing weary mustard, spiritless pepper,
  faded cayenne pepper, vinegar and mysteries in bottles. Joan and Peter were
  interested in this strange object and at the same time vaguely aware of
  something missing. What they missed were flowers; on this table there were no
  flowers. There was a cold joint, a white jug of beer and a glass jug of
  water, and pickles. "I got cold meat," said Mrs. Pybus, "not being sure when
  you were coming." She arranged her guests. But she did not immediately begin.
  She had had an idea. She regarded Peter.</p>

  <p>"Now, Peter," she said, "let me 'ear you say Grice."</p>

  <p>Peter wondered.</p>

  <p>"Say Grice, dearie."</p>

  <p>"Grice, "said Peter.</p>

  <p>The young man with the red hair was convulsed with merriment. "That's
  good," he said. "That's reely Good. Kids are amusing."</p>

  <p>"But I tole you to say Grice," said Mrs. Pybus, ruffled.</p>

  <p>"I said it."</p>

  <p>The young man's voice squeaked as he explained. "He doesn't know 'ow to
  say Grace," he said. "Never 'card of it."</p>

  <p>"Is it a catch?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>The young man caught and restrained a fresh outburst of merriment with the
  back of his hand, and then explained again to Mrs. Pybus.</p>

  <p>"'E's a perfec' little 'eathen," said Mrs. Pybus. "I never did. They'll
  teach you to say grice all right, my boy, before you're very much older. Mark
  my words." And with a sort of businesslike reverence Mrs. Pybus gabbled her
  formula. Then she proceeded to carve. As she carved she pursed her lips and
  frowned.</p>

  <p>The cold meat was not bad, but the children ate fastidiously, and Joan,
  after her fashion, left all her fat. This attracted the attention of Mrs.
  Pybus. "Eat it up, dearie," said Mrs. Pybus. "Wiste not, want not."</p>

  <p>"I don't eat fat."</p>

  <p>"But you must eat fat," said Mrs. Pybus.</p>

  <p>Joan shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Well 'ave to teach you to eat fat," said Mrs. Pybus with a dangerous
  gentleness. For the time, however, the teaching was not insisted upon.
  "Lovely bits! Enough to feed a little dog," said Mrs. Pybus, as she removed
  Joan's plate to make way for apple tart.</p>

  <p>The conversation was intermittent. It was as if they waited for some
  further event. The young man with the red hair spoke of the great world of
  London and the funeral of Lord Salisbury.</p>

  <p>"'E was a great statesman, say what you like," said the young man with red
  hair.</p>

  <p>He also spoke of Holbein's attempt to swim the channel.</p>

  <p>"They say 'e oils 'imself all over," said the young man.</p>

  <p>"Lor'!" said Mrs. Pybus.</p>

  <p>"It can't be comfortable," said the young man; "say what you like."</p>

  <p>Presently the young man broke a silence by saying: "These here Balkans
  seem to be giving trouble again."</p>

  <p>"Troublesome lot they are," said Mrs. Pybus.</p>

  <p>"Greeks and Macedonians and Turks and Bulgarians and such. It fair makes
  my head spin, the lot of them. Servians there are too, and Montenegroes. Too
  many of 'em altogether. Cat and dog."</p>

  <p>"Are them the same Greeks that used to be so clever?" asked Mrs.
  Pybus.</p>

  <p>"<i>Used</i> to be," said the young man with a kind of dark scorn, and
  suddenly began to pick his teeth with a pin.</p>

  <p>"They can't even speak their own language now&mdash;not properly. Fair
  rotten," the young man added.</p>

  <p>He fascinated Joan. She had never watched anything like him. But Peter
  just hated him.</p><br>

  <h3>§4</h3>

  <p class="first">Upon this scene there presently appeared a new actor. He was
  preluded by a knocking at the door, he was ushered in by Mrs. Pybus who was
  opening and shutting her mouth in a state of breathless respect; he was
  received with the utmost deference by the young man with red hair. Indeed,
  from the moment when his knocking was heard without, the manner and bearing
  of the red-haired young man underwent the most marvellous change. An agitated
  alacrity appeared in his manner; he stood up and moved nervously; by weak,
  neckward movements of his head he seemed to indicate he now regretted wearing
  such a bright green tie. The newcomer appeared in the doorway. He was a tall,
  grey-clad, fair gentleman, with a face that twitched and a hand that dandled
  in front of him. He grinned his teeth at the room. "So thassem," he said,
  touching his teeth with his thumbnail.</p>

  <p>He nodded confidentially to the red-haired young man without removing his
  eyes from Joan and Peter. He showed still more of his teeth and rattled his
  thumbnail along them. Then he waved his hand over the table. "Clear all this
  away," he said, and sat down in the young man's chair. Mrs. Pybus cleared
  away rapidly, assisted abjectly by the young man.</p>

  <p>Mr. Grimes seemed to check off the two children. "You're Joan," he said.
  "I needn't bother about you. You're provided for. Peter. Peter's our
  business."</p>

  <p>He got out a pocket-book and pencil. "Let's look at you, Peter. Just come
  out here, will you?"</p>

  <p>Peter obeyed reluctantly and suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"No stockings. Don't they wear stockings at that school of yours?"</p>

  <p>"Not when we don't want them," said Peter. " No."</p>

  <p>"'Mazes me you wear anything," said Mr. Grimes. "S'pose it'll come to
  that. Let's see your hat."</p>

  <p>"Haven't got a hat," said Peter. "Wouldn't wear it if I had."</p>

  <p>"<i>Wouldn't</i> you!" said Mr. Grimes. "H'm!"</p>

  <p>"Nice little handful," said Mr. Grimes, and hummed. He produced a paper
  from the pocket-book and read it, rubbing his teeth with the point of his
  pencil.</p>

  <p>"Lersee whassor outfit we wan'," said Mr. Grimes. "H'm.... H'm....
  H'm...."</p>

  <p>He stood up briskly. "Well, young man, we must go out and get you some
  clothes and things. What's called a school outfit. We'll have to go in that
  motor-car again. Quickest way. Get your hat. But you haven't got a hat."</p>

  <p>"Me come too," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"No. You can't come to a tailor's, and that's where we're going. Little
  girls can't come to tailors, you know," said Mr. Grimes.</p>

  <p>Peter thought privately that Mr. Grimes was just the sort of beast who
  would take you to a tailor's. Well, he would stick it out. This couldn't go
  on for ever. He allowed himself to be guided by Mr. Grimes to the door. He
  restrained an impulse to ask to be allowed to sit beside the driver. One
  doesn't ask favours of beasts like Grimes.</p>

  <p>Joan went to the window to watch the car and Mr. Grimes' proceedings
  mistrustfully.</p>

  <p>"I got a nice picture-book for you to look at," said Mrs. Pybus, coming
  behind her. "Don't go standing and staring out of the window, dearie. It's an
  idle thing to stare out of windows."</p>

  <p>Joan had an unpleasant feeling that she had to comply with this. Under the
  initiative of Mrs. Pybus she sat up to the table and permitted a large book
  to be opened in front of her, feigning attention. She kept her eye as much as
  possible on the window. She was aware of Peter getting into the car with Mr.
  Grimes. There was a sudden buzzing of machinery, the slam of a door, and the
  automobile moved and vanished.</p>

  <p>She gave a divided attention to the picture-book before her, which was
  really not properly a picture-book at all but an old bound volume of the
  Illustrated London News full of wood engravings of royal processions and
  suchlike desiccated matter. It was a dusty, frowsty volume, damp-stained at
  the edges. She tried to be amused. But it was very grey and dull, and she
  felt strangely uneasy. Every few minutes she would look up expecting to see
  the car back outside, but it did not return....</p>

  <p>She heard the red-haired young man in the passage saying he thought he'd
  have to be getting round to the railway-station, and there was some point
  explained by Mrs. Pybus at great length and over and over again about the
  difference between the Great Western and the South Western Railway. The front
  door slammed after him at last, and Mrs. Pybus was audible returning to her
  kitchen.</p>

  <p>Presently she came and looked at Joan with a thin, unreal smile on her
  white face.</p>

  <p>"Getting on all right with the pretty pictures, dearie?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"When's Peter coming back?" asked Joan.</p>

  <p>"Oh, not for a longish bit," said Mrs. Pybus. "You see, he's going to
  school."</p>

  <p>"Can I go to school?"</p>

  <p>"Not 'is school. He's going to a boy school."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Joan, learning for the first time that schools have sexes. "Can
  I go out in the garden?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't much of a garden," said Mrs. Pybus. "But what there is you're
  welcome."</p>

  <p>It wasn't much of a garden. Rather it was a yard, into which a lean-to
  scullery, a coal shed, and a dustbin bit deeply. Along one side was a high
  fence cutting it off from a similar yard, and against this high fence a few
  nasturtiums gingered the colour scheme. A clothes-line stretched diagonally
  across this space and bore a depressed pair of black stockings, and in the
  corner at the far end a lilac bush was slowly but steadily and successfully
  wishing itself dead. The opposite corner was devoted to a collection of
  bottles, the ribs of an umbrella, and a dust-pan that had lost its handle.
  From beneath this curious rather than pleasing accumulation peeped the
  skeleton of a "rockery" built of brick clinkers and free from vegetation of
  any sort. An unseen baby a garden or two away deplored its existence loudly.
  At intervals a voice that sounded like the voice of an embittered little girl
  cut across these lamentations:</p>

  <p>"Well, you shouldn't 'ave broke yer bottle," said the voice, with a note
  of moral demonstration....</p>

  <p>Joan stayed in this garden for exactly three minutes. Then she returned to
  Mrs. Pybus, who was engaged in some dim operations with a kettle in the
  kitchen. "Drat this old kitchener!" said Mrs. Pybus, rattling at a
  damper.</p>

  <p>"Want to go 'ome," Joan said, in a voice that betrayed emotion.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pybus turned her meagre face and surveyed Joan without excessive
  tenderness.</p>

  <p>"This is your 'ome, dearie," she said.</p>

  <p>"I live at Ingle-Nook," said Joan.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Pybus shook her head. "All that's been done away with," she said.
  "Your aunts 'ave give you up, and you're going to live 'ere for
  good&mdash;'long o' me."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Meanwhile Mr. Grimes, with a cheerful kindliness that Peter
  perceived to be assumed, conveyed that young gentleman first to an outfitter,
  where he was subjected to nameless indignities with a tape, and finally sent
  behind a screen and told to change out of his nice, comfortable old clothes
  and Heidelberg sandals into a shirt and a collar and a grey flannel suit, and
  hard black shoes. All of which he did in a mute, helpless rage, because he
  did not consider himself equal to Mr. Grimes and the outfitter and his staff
  (with possibly the chauffeur thrown in) in open combat. He was then taken to
  a hairdresser and severely clipped, which struck him as a more sensible
  proceeding; the stuff they put on his head was indeed pleasingly aromatic;
  and then he was bought some foolery of towels and things, and finally a Bible
  and a prayer-book and a box. With this box he returned to the outfitter's,
  and was quite interested in discovering that a pile of things had accumulated
  on the counter, ties, collars and things, and were to be packed in the box
  for him forthwith. A junior assistant was doing up his Limpsfield clothes in
  a separate parcel. So do we put off childish things. That parcel was to go
  via Mr. Grimes to The Ingle-Nook.</p>

  <p>A memory of certain beloved sea stories came into Peter's head. "This my
  kit?" he asked Mr. Grimes abruptly.</p>

  <p>"You might call it your kit," said Mr. Grimes.</p>

  <p>"Am I going on a battleship?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>Mr. Grimes&mdash;and the two outfitting assistants in sympathy&mdash;were
  loudly amused.</p>

  <p>"You're going to High Cross School," said Mr. Grimes, emerging from his
  mirth. "Firm treatment. Sound Church training. Unruly boys not objected
  to."</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," said Peter.</p>

  <p>They returned to the automobile, and after a mile or so of roads and
  turnings stopped outside a gaunt brace of drab-coloured semi-detached villas
  standing back behind a patch of lawn, and having a walled enclosure to the
  left and an overgrown laurel shrubbery to the right. "Here's High Cross
  School," said Mr. Grimes, a statement that was rendered unnecessary by a
  conspicuous black and gold board that rose above the walled enclosure. They
  descended.</p>

  <p>"Wonther which ithe houth," mused Mr. Grimes, consulting his teeth, and
  then suddenly decided and led Peter towards the right hand of the two
  associated doors. "This," said Mr. Grimes, as they waited on the doorstep,
  "is a real school.... No nonsense about it," said Mr. Grimes.</p>

  <p>Peter nodded with affected intelligence.</p>

  <p>They were ushered by a slatternly maid-servant into the presence of a
  baldish man with a white, puffy face and pale grey eyes, who was wearing a
  university gown and seemed to be expecting them. He was standing before the
  fireplace in the front parlour, which had a general air of being a study.
  There were an untidy desk facing the window and bookshelves in the recess on
  either side of the fireplace. Over the mantel was a tobacco-jar bearing the
  arms of some college, and reminders of Mr. Mainwearing's university
  achievements in the form of a college shield and Cambridge photographs.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Mr. Grimes, "here's your young man, and thrust Peter
  forward.</p>

  <p>"So you've come to join us?" said Mr. Mainwearing with a sort of clouded
  amiability.</p>

  <p>"Join what?" said Peter.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mainwearing raised his eyebrows. "High Cross School," he said.</p>

  <p>"I'm at the School of St. George and the Venerable Bede," said Peter. "So
  how can I?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mr. Grimes; "you're joining here now."</p>

  <p>"But I can't go to <i>two</i> schools."</p>

  <p>"Consequently you're coming to this one," said Mr. Grimes.</p>

  <p>"It's very sudden," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"What's this about the School of Saint What's-his-name? asked Mr.
  Mainwearing of Mr. Grimes.</p>

  <p>"It's just a sort of fad school they've been sending him to," Mr. Grimes
  explained. "We're altering all that. It's a girls' school, and he's a growing
  boy. It's a school where socialism and play-acting are school subjects, and
  everybody runs about with next to nothing on. So his proper guardians have
  decided that's got to stop. And here we are."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mainwearing regarded Peter heavily while this was going on.</p>

  <p>"Done any square root yet?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>Peter had not.</p>

  <p>"Know the date of Magna Carta?"</p>

  <p>Peter did not. "It was under John," he said.</p>

  <p>"I wanted the date," said Mr. Mainwearing. "What's the capital of
  Bulgaria?"</p>

  <p>Peter did not know.</p>

  <p>"Know any French irregular verbs?"</p>

  <p>Peter said he didn't.</p>

  <p>"Got to begin at the beginning," said Mr. Mainwearing. "Got your
  outfit?"</p>

  <p>"We've just seen to that," said Mr. Grimes. "There's one or two things I'd
  like to say to you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He glanced at Peter.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mainwearing comprehended. He came and laid one hand on Peter. "Time
  you saw some of your schoolfellows," he said.</p>

  <p>Under his guiding pressure Peter was impelled along a passage, through an
  archway, across an empty but frowsty schoolroom in which one solitary small
  boy sat and sobbed grievously, and so by way of another passage to a kind of
  glass back-door from which steps went down to a large gravelled space, behind
  the high wall that carried the black and gold board. In the corner were
  parallel bars. A group of nine or ten boys were standing round these bars:
  they were all clad in the same sort of grey flannels that Peter was wearing,
  and they had all started round at the sound of the opening of the door. One
  shock-headed boy perhaps a head taller than any of the rest, had a great red
  mouth beneath a red nose.</p>

  <p>"Boys!" shouted Mr. Mainwearing; "here's a new chum. See that he learns
  his way about a bit, Probyn."</p>

  <p>"Yessir!" said the shock-headed boy in a loud adult kind of voice.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mainwearing gave Peter a shove that started him down the steps towards
  the playground, and slammed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>Most of these boys were bigger than any boys that Peter had ever known
  before. They looked enormous. He reckoned some must be fifteen or
  sixteen&mdash;quite. They were as big as the biggest Sheldrick girl. Probyn
  seemed indeed as big as a man; Peter could see right across the playground
  that he had a black smear of moustache. His neck and wrists and elbows stuck
  out of his clothes.</p>

  <p>Peter with his hands in his new-found pockets walked slowly towards these
  formidable creatures across the stony playground. They regarded him
  enigmatically. So explorers must feel, who land on a strange beach in the
  presence of an unknown race of men.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">"Come on, fathead!" said Probyn as he drew near.</p>

  <p>Peter had expected that tone. He affected indifference.</p>

  <p>"What's your name?" asked Probyn.</p>

  <p>"Stubland," said Peter. "You Probyn?"</p>

  <p>"Stubland," said Probyn. "Stubland. What's your Christian name?"</p>

  <p>"Peter. What's yours?"</p>

  <p>Probyn disregarded this counter question markedly. "Simon Peter, eh! Your
  father got you out of the Bible, I expect. Know anything of cricket, Simon
  Peter?"</p>

  <p>"Not much," said Simon Peter.</p>

  <p>"Can you swim?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Can you fight?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know."</p>

  <p>"What's your father?"</p>

  <p>Peter didn't answer. Instead, he fixed his attention upon a fair-haired
  boy of about his own size who was standing at the end of the parallel bars.
  "What's your name?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The fair boy looked at Probyn.</p>

  <p>"Damn it!" said Probyn. "I asked you a question, Mr. Simon Peter."</p>

  <p>Peter continued disregardful. "Hasn't this school got a flagstaff?" he
  asked generally.</p>

  <p>Probyn came closer to him and gripped him by the shoulder. "I asked you a
  question, Mr. Simon Peter. What is your father?"</p>

  <p>It was a question Peter could not answer because for some obscure reason
  he could not bring himself to say that his father was dead. If ever he said
  that, he knew his father would be dead. But what else could he say of his
  father? So he seemed to shrink a little and remained mute. "We'll have to
  cross-examine you," said Probyn, and shook him.</p>

  <p>The fair boy came in front of Peter. It was clear he had great confidence
  in Probyn. He had a fat, smooth, round face that Peter disliked.</p>

  <p>"Simon Peter," he said. "Answer up."</p>

  <p>"What is your father?" said Probyn.</p>

  <p>"What's your father?" repeated the fair boy, and then suddenly flicked
  Peter under the nose with his finger.</p>

  <p>But this did at least enable Peter to change the subject. He smote at the
  fat-faced boy with great vigour and missed him. The fat-faced boy dodged back
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" said Probyn. "Ginger!"</p>

  <p>"That chap's not going to touch my nose," said Peter. "Anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Touch it when I like," said the fat-faced boy.</p>

  <p>"You won't."</p>

  <p>"You want to <i>fight</i>?" asked the fat-faced boy, conscious of popular
  support.</p>

  <p>Peter said he wasn't going to have his nose flicked anyhow.</p>

  <p>"Flick it again, Newton," said Probyn, "and see."</p>

  <p>"I'll show you in no time," said Newton.</p>

  <p>"Why!&mdash;I'd lick you with one hand," continued Newton.</p>

  <p>Peter said nothing. But he regarded his antagonist very intently.</p>

  <p>"Skinny little snipe," said Newton. "Whaddyou think you'd do to me?"</p>

  <p>"Hit him, Newton," said a cadaverous boy with freckles.</p>

  <p>"Hit him, Newton. He's too cocky," said another. "Flick his silly nose
  again and see."</p>

  <p>"I'll hit him 'f'e wants it," said Newton, and buttoned up his jacket in a
  preparatory way.</p>

  <p>"Hit him, Newton," other voices urged.</p>

  <p>"Let him put up his fists," said Newton.</p>

  <p>"Do that when I please," said Peter rather faintly.</p>

  <p>Newton had seemed at first just about Peter's size. Now he seemed very
  much larger. All the boys seemed to have grown larger. They were gathering in
  a vast circle of doom round a minute and friendless Peter. Probyn loomed over
  him like a figure of fate. Peter wondered whether he need have hit at Newton.
  It seemed now a very unwise thing indeed to have done. Newton was alternately
  swaying towards him and swaying away from him, and repeating his demand for
  Peter to put his hands up. He seemed on the verge of flicking again. He was
  going to flick. Probyn watched them both critically. Then with a rapid
  movement of the mind Peter realized that Newton's face was swaying now well
  within his range; the moment had come, and desperately, with a great effort
  and a wide and sweeping movement of the arm, he smote hard at Newton's cheek.
  Smack. A good blow. Newton recoiled with an expression of astonishment.
  "You&mdash;swine!" he said.</p>

  <p>Two other boys came running across the playground, and voices explained,
  "New boy.... Fight...."</p>

  <p>But curiously enough the fight did not go on. Newton at a slightly greater
  distance continued to loom threateningly, but did no more than loom. His
  cheek was very red. "I'll break your jaw, cutting at me like that," he said.
  "You swine!" He used foul and novel terms expressive of rage. He looked at
  Probyn as if for approval, but Probyn offered none. He continued to threaten,
  but he did not come within arm's length again.</p>

  <p>"Hit him back, Newton," several voices urged, but with no success.</p>

  <p>"Wait till I start on him," said Newton.</p>

  <p>"Buck up, young Newton," said Probyn suddenly, "and stop jawing. You began
  it. I'm not going to help you. Make a ring, you chaps. It's a fair
  fight."</p>

  <p>Peter found himself facing Newton in the centre of an interested
  circle.</p>

  <p>Newton was walking crab fashion athwart the circle, swaying with his fists
  and elbows high. He was now-acting a dangerous intentness. "Come on," he said
  terribly.</p>

  <p>"Hit him, Newton," said the cadaverous boy. "Don't wait for him."</p>

  <p>"You started it, Newton," Probyn insisted. "And he's hit you fair."</p>

  <p>A loud familiar sound, the clamorous ringing of a bell, struck across the
  suspended drama. "That's tea," said Newton eagerly, dropping his fists. "It's
  no good starting on him now."</p>

  <p>"You'll have to fight him later," said Probyn. "Now he's hit you."</p>

  <p>"It's up to you, Newton," said the cadaverous boy, evidently following
  Probyn's lead.</p>

  <p>"<i>Cave</i>. It's Noser," said a voice.</p>

  <p>There was a little pause.</p>

  <p>"Toke!" cried Probyn.</p>

  <p>"Toke, Simon Peter," said the cadaverous boy informingly....</p>

  <p>Peter found himself no longer in focus. Every one was moving towards the
  door whence Peter had descended to the playground, and at this door there now
  stood a middle-aged man with a large nose and a sly expression, surveying the
  boys.</p>

  <p>Impelled by gregarious instincts, Peter followed the crowd.</p>

  <p>He did not like these hostile boys. He did not like this shabby-looking
  place. He was quite ready to believe that presently he would have to go on
  fighting Newton. He was not particularly afraid of Newton, but he perceived
  that Probyn stood behind him. He detested Probyn already. He was afraid of
  Probyn. Probyn was like a golliwog. . He knew by instinct that Probyn was
  full of disagreeable possibilities for him, and that it would be very hard to
  get away from Probyn. And what did it all mean? Was he never going back to
  Limpsfield again?</p>

  <p>The bell had had exactly the tone of the tea bell at Miss Murgatroyd's
  school. It might have been the same bell. And it had made his heart homesick
  for the colour and brightness of the School of St. George and the Venerable
  Bede, and for the friendly garden and familiar rooms of Ingle-Nook. For the
  first time he realized that he had fallen into this school as an animal falls
  into a trap, that his world had changed, that home was very far away....</p>

  <p>And what had they done to Joan?...</p>

  <p>Had he to live here always?...</p>

  <p>It struck Mr. Noakley, the assistant master with the large nose, as he
  watched the boys at tea, that the new boy had a face like a doll, but really
  that face with its set, shining, expressionless eyes was only the mask, the
  very thin mask, that covered a violent disposition to blubber....</p>

  <p>Well, no one was going to see Peter blub. No one was going to hear him
  blub....</p>

  <p>Tonight perhaps in bed.</p>

  <p>He had still to realize the publicity of a school dormitory....</p>

  <p>He knew he couldn't box, but he had seen something in Newton's eyes that
  made him feel that Newton was not invincible. He would grip his fists in a
  very knobby way and hit Newton as hard as he could in the face.
  Oh!&mdash;frightfully hard....</p>

  <p>Peter was not eating very much. "Bags I your slice of Toke," said the
  cadaverous boy.</p>

  <p>"Take the beastly stuff," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Little spoilt mammy coddle," thought old Nosey Noakley. "We aren't good
  enough for him."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">So it was that Mr. Grimes, acting for Lady Charlotte, set
  about the rescue of Joan and Peter from, as she put it, "the freaks, faddists
  and Hill-Top philosophies of the Surrey hills," and their restoration to the
  established sobrieties and decorums of English life. Very naturally this
  sudden action came as an astonishing blow to the two advanced aunts. At nine
  o'clock that evening Miss Murgatroyd was called down to see Miss Phyllis
  Stubland, who had ridden over on her bicycle. "Where are the children?" asked
  Aunt Phyllis.</p>

  <p>"You sent for them," said Miss Murgatroyd.</p>

  <p>"Sent for them!"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I remember now. The young man said it was Lady Charlotte Sydenham.
  Didn't you know? She is going abroad tomorrow or the next day."</p>

  <p>"Sent for them!" Aunt Phyllis repeated....</p>

  <p>Two hours later Aunt Phyllis was telling the terrible news to Mary. Aunt
  Phoebe was in London for the night to see Mr. Tree play Richard II, and there
  were no means of communicating with her until the morning. The Ingle-Nook was
  much too Pre-Raphaelite to possess a telephone, and Aunt Phoebe was sleeping
  at the flat of a friend in Church Row, Hampstead. Next morning a telegram
  found her still in bed.</p>

  <p>class="telegram"&gt; <tt>"CHILDREN KIDNAPPED BY LADY CHARLOTTE CONSULT
  SYCAMORE PHYLLIS"</tt></p>

  <p>said the telegram.</p>

  <p>"<i>No!</i>" cried Aunt Phoebe sharply.</p>

  <p>Then as the little servant-maid was on the point of closing the door,
  "Tell Miss Jepson," Aunt Phoebe commanded....</p>

  <p>Miss Jepson found Aunt Phoebe out of bed and dressing with a rapid
  casualness. It was manifest that some great crisis had happened. "An outrage
  upon all women," said Aunt Phoebe. "I have been outraged."</p>

  <p>"My dear!" said Miss Jepson.</p>

  <p>"Read that telegram!" cried Aunt Phoebe, pointing to a small ball of pink
  paper in the corner of the room.</p>

  <p>Miss Jepson went over to the corner with a perplexed expression, and
  smoothed out the telegram and read it.</p>

  <p>"A <i>Bradshaw</i> and a hansom!" Aunt Phoebe was demanding as she moved
  rapidly about the room from one scattered garment to another. "No breakfast.
  I can eat nothing. Nothing. I am a tigress. A maddened tigress. Maddened.
  Beyond endurance. Oh! Can you reach these buttons, dear!"</p>

  <p>Miss Jepson hovered about her guest readjusting her costume in accordance
  with commonplace standards while Aunt Phoebe expressed herself in Sibylline
  utterances.</p>

  <p>"Children dedicated to the future.... Reek of ancient corruptions....
  Abomination of desolation.... The nine fifty-three.... Say half an hour....
  Remonstrance.... An avenging sword.... The sword of the Lord and of
  Gideon."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to this Mr. Sycamore?" asked Miss Jepson suddenly.</p>

  <p>Aunt Phoebe seemed lost for a time and emerged with, "Good
  God!&mdash;<i>No!</i> This is an occasion when a woman must show she can act
  as a man. This tries us, Amanda. I will have no man in this. No man at all!
  Are women to loll in harems for ever while men act and fight? When little
  children are assailed?..."</p>

  <p>"Chastlands," said Aunt Phoebe to the cabman, waving Miss Jepson's
  <i>Bradshaw</i> in tier hand.</p>

  <p>The man looked stupid.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Charing Cross," she cried scornfully. "The rest is beyond you."</p>

  <p>And in the train she startled her sole fellow-traveller and made him get
  out at the next station by saying suddenly twice over in her loud, clear
  contralto voice the one word "<i>Action</i>." She left Miss Jepson's
  <i>Bradshaw</i> in the compartment when she got out.</p>

  <p>She found Chastlands far gone in packing for Lady Charlotte's flight
  abroad. "I demand Lady Charlotte," she said. She followed up old Cashel as he
  went to announce her. He heard her coming behind him, but his impression of
  her was so vivid that he deemed it wiser not to notice this informality. And
  besides in his dry, thin way he wanted to hear why she demanded Lady
  Charlotte. He perceived the possibilities of a memorable clash. He was a
  quiet, contemplative man who hid his humour like a miser's treasure and lived
  much upon his memories. Weeks after a thing had happened he would suddenly
  titter, in bed, or in church, or while he was cleaning his plate. And non$
  were told why he tittered.</p>

  <p>For a moment Aunt Phoebe hovered on the landing outside the Chastlands
  drawing-room.</p>

  <p>"I can't see her," she heard Lady Charlotte say, with something like a
  note of terror. "It is impossible."</p>

  <p>"Leave her to me, me Lady," said a man's voice.</p>

  <p>"Tell her to wait, Cashel," said Lady Charlotte.</p>

  <p>Aunt Phoebe entered, trailing her artistic robes. Before her by the
  writing-table in the big window stood Lady Charlotte, flounced, bonneted,
  dressed as if for instant flight. A slender, fair, wincing man in grey stood
  nearer, his expression agitated but formidable. They had evidently both risen
  to their feet as Aunt Phoebe entered. Cashel made insincere demonstrations of
  intervention, but Aunt Phoebe disposed of him with a gesture. A haughty and
  terrible politeness was in her manner, but she sobbed slightly as she
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"Lady Charlotte," she said, "where are my wards?</p>

  <p>"They are my wards," said Lady Charlotte no less haughtily.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Lady Charlotte. Permit me," said Mr. Grimes, with soothing
  gestures of his lean white hands.</p>

  <p>"Please do not intervene," said Aunt Phoebe.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Grimes, madam, is my solicitor," said Lady Charlotte. "You may go,
  Cashel."</p>

  <p>Cashel went reluctantly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Grimes advanced a step and dandled his hands and smiled
  ingratiatingly. Italian and Spanish women will stab, he had heard, and
  fishwives are a violent class. Otherwise he believed all women, however
  terrible in appearance, to be harmless. This gave him courage.</p>

  <p>"Miss Stubland, I believe," he said. "These young people, young Stubland
  and his foster-sister to wit, are at present in my charge&mdash;under
  instructions from Lady Charlotte."</p>

  <p>"Where?" asked Aunt Phoebe.</p>

  <p>"Our case, Miss Stubland, is that they were not being properly educated in
  your charge. That is our case. They were receiving no sound moral and
  religious training, and they were being brought up in&mdash;to say the least
  of it&mdash;an eccentric fashion. Our aim in taking them out of your charge
  is to secure for them a proper ordinary English bringing up."</p>

  <p>"Every word an insult," panted Aunt Phoebe. "Every word. What have you
  done with them?"</p>

  <p>"Until we are satisfied that you will consent to continue their training
  on proper lines, Miss Stubland, you can scarcely expect us to put it in your
  power to annoy these poor children further."</p>

  <p>Mr. Grimes' face was wincing much more than usual, and these involuntary
  grimaces affected Aunt Phoebe in her present mood as though they were
  deliberate insults. He did not allow for this added exasperation.</p>

  <p>"Annoy!" cried Aunt Phoebe.</p>

  <p>"That is the usual expression. We are perfectly within our rights in
  refusing you access. Having regard to your manifest determination to upset
  any proper arrangement."</p>

  <p>"You refuse to let me know where those children are?"</p>

  <p>"Unless you can get an order against us."</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;go to some old judge?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Grimes gesticulated assent. If she chose to phrase it in that way, so
  much the worse for her application.</p>

  <p>"You won't You will go on with this kidnapping?"</p>

  <p>"Miss Stubland, we are entirely satisfied with our present course and our
  present position."</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte endorsed him with three great nods.</p>

  <p>Aunt Phoebe stood aghast.</p>

  <p>Mr. Grimes remained quietly triumphant. Lady Charlotte stood quietly
  triumphant behind him. For a moment it seemed as if Aunt Phoebe had no reply
  of any sort to make.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly she advanced three steps and seized upon Mr. Grimes. One
  hand gripped his nice grey coat below the collar behind, the other, the
  looseness of his waistcoat just below the tie. And lifting him up upon his
  toes Aunt Phoebe shook him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Grimes was a lean, spare, ironical man. Aunt Phoebe was a
  well-developed woman. Yet only by an enormous effort did she break the
  instinctive barriers that make a man sacred from feminine assault. It was an
  effort so enormous that when at last it broke down the dam of self-restraint,
  it came through a boiling flood of physical power. It came through with a
  sort of instantaneousness. At one moment Mr. Grimes stood before Lady
  Charlotte's eyes dominating the scene; at the next he was, as materialists
  say of the universe, "all vibrations." He was a rag, he was a scrap of carpet
  in Aunt Phoebe's hands. The appetite for shaking seemed to grow in Aunt
  Phoebe as she shook.</p>

  <p>From the moment when Aunt Phoebe gripped him until she had done shaking
  him nobody except Lady Charlotte made an articulate sound. And all that Lady
  Charlotte said, before astonishment overcame her, was one loud "Haw!" The
  face of Mr. Grimes remained set, except for a certain mechanical rattling of
  the teeth in a wild stare at Aunt Phoebe; Aunt Phoebe's features bore that
  earnest calm one may see upon the face of a good woman who washes clothes or
  kneads bread. Then suddenly it was as if Aunt Phoebe woke up out of a
  trance.</p>

  <p>"You make&mdash;you make me forget myself!" said Aunt Phoebe with a low
  sob, and after one last shake relinquished him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Grimes gyrated for a moment and came to rest against a massive table.
  He was still staring at Aunt Phoebe.</p>

  <p>For a moment the three people remained breathing heavily and contemplating
  the outrage. At last Mr. Grimes was able to raise a wavering, pointing finger
  to gasp, "You have&mdash;you have&mdash;yes&mdash;indeed&mdash;forgotten
  yourself!"</p>

  <p>Then, as if he struggled to apprehend the position, "You&mdash;you have
  assaulted me."</p>

  <p>"Let it be&mdash;let it be a warning to you," said Aunt Phoebe.</p>

  <p>"That is a threat."</p>

  <p>"Agreed," panted Aunt Phoebe with spirit, though she had not meant to
  threaten him at all.</p>

  <p>"If you think, madam, that you can assault me with impunity&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't have thought it&mdash;before I took hold of you. A bag of
  bones.... Man indeed!" And then very earnestly&mdash;"Yes."</p>

  <p>She paused. The pause held all three of them still.</p>

  <p>"But why&mdash;oh, why!&mdash;should I bandy words with such a thing as
  you?" she asked with a sudden belated recovery of her dignity.
  "You&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She sought her word carefully.</p>

  <p>"Flibber-gib!"</p>

  <p>And forgetting altogether the mission upon which she had come, Aunt Phoebe
  turned about to make her exit from the scene. It seemed to her, perhaps
  justly, that it was impossible to continue the parley further. "Legalized
  scoundrel!" she said over her shoulder, and moved towards the door. In that
  first tremendous clash of the New Woman and the Terrific Old Lady, it must be
  admitted that the New Woman carried off, so to speak, the physical honours.
  Lady Charlotte stood against the fireplace visibly appalled. Only when Aunt
  Phoebe was already at the door did it occur to Lady Charlotte to ring the
  bell to have her visitor "shown out." Her shaking hand could scarcely find
  the bell handle. For the rest she was ineffective, wasting great
  opportunities for scorn and dignity. She despised herself for not having a
  larger, fiercer solicitor. She doubted herself. For the first time in her
  life Lady Charlotte Sydenham doubted herself, and quailed before a new birth
  of time.</p>

  <p>Upon the landing appeared old Cashel, mutely respectful. He showed out
  Aunt Phoebe in profound silence. He watched her retreating form with
  affectionate respect, stroking his cheek slowly with two fingers. He closed
  the door.</p>

  <p>He stood as one who seeks to remember. "Flibber-jib," he said at last very
  softly, without exultation or disapproval. He simply wanted to have it
  exactly right. Then he went upstairs to have a long, mild, respectful look at
  Mr. Grimes, and to ask if he could do anything for him....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">Aunt Phoebe's return to The Ingle-Nook blended triumph and
  perplexity.</p>

  <p>"I could never have imagined a man so flimsy," she said.</p>

  <p>"But where are the children?" asked Aunt Phyllis.</p>

  <p>"If all men are like him&mdash;then masculine ascendancy is an
  imposture."</p>

  <p>("Yes, but where are the children?")</p>

  <p>"So a baulked tigress might feel."</p>

  <p>Aunt Phyllis decided to write to Mr. Sycamore.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Mainwearing was the proprietor of a private school for
  young gentlemen, not by choice but by reason of the weaknesses of his
  character. It was card-playing more than anything else that had made him an
  educator. And it was vanity and the want of any sense of proportion that had
  led to the card-playing.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mainwearing's father had been a severe parent, severe to the pitch of
  hostility. He had lost his wife early, and he had taken a grudge against his
  only son, whose looks he did not like. He had sent him to Cambridge with a
  bitter assurance that he would do no good there; had kept him too short of
  money to be comfortable, spent most of his property&mdash;he was a retired
  tea-broker&mdash;in disappointing and embittering jaunts into vice, and died
  suddenly, leaving&mdash;unwillingly, but he had to leave it&mdash;about three
  thousand pounds to his heir. Young Mainwearing had always been short of
  pocket-money, and for a time he regarded this legacy as limitless wealth; he
  flashed from dingy obscurity into splendour, got himself coloured shirts and
  remarkable ties, sought the acquaintance of horses, slipped down to London
  for music-halls and "life." When it dawned upon him that even three thousand
  pounds was not a limitless ocean of money, he attempted to maintain its level
  by winning more from his fellow undergraduates. Nap and poker were the
  particular forms of sport he affected. He reckoned that he was, in a quiet
  way, rather cleverer than most fellows, and that he would win. But he was out
  in his reckoning. He left Cambridge with a Junior Optime in the Mathematical
  Tripos and a residuum of about seven hundred pounds. lie was a careful
  cricketer, and he had liked football at school in his concluding years when
  he was big enough to barge into the other chaps. Surveying the prospect
  before him, he decided that a school was the best place for him, he
  advertised himself as "of gentlemanly appearance" and "good at games," and he
  found his billet in a preparatory school at Brighton. Thence he went to a big
  grammar school, and thence came to the High Cross School to remain first as
  assistant, then as son-in-law and partner, and now as sole proprietor. Mrs.
  Mainwearing was not very useful as a helpmeet, as she was slightly but not
  offensively defective in her mind; still one must take life as one finds it.
  She was, at any rate, regular in her habits, and did not interfere with the
  housekeeper, a worthy, confidence-creating woman, much tipped by the tenderer
  sort of parent.</p>

  <p>Of course Mr. Mainwearing had no special training as a teacher. He had no
  ideas about education at all. He had no social philosophy. He had never asked
  why he was alive or what he was up to. Instinct, perhaps, warned him that the
  answer might be disagreeable. Much less did he inquire what his boys were
  likely to be up to. And it did not occur to him, it did not occur to any one
  in those days, to consider that these deficiencies barred him in any way from
  the preparation of the genteel young for life. He taught as he had been
  taught; his teachers had done the same; he was the last link of a long chain
  of tradition that had perhaps in the beginning had some element of intention
  in it as to what was to be made of the pupil. Schools, like religions, tend
  perpetually to forget what they are for. High Cross School, like numberless
  schools in Great Britain in those days, had forgotten completely; it was a
  mysterious fated routine; the underlying idea seemed to be that boys must go
  to school as puppies have the mange. Certain school books existed, God alone
  knew why, and the classes were taken through them. It was like reading
  prayers. Certain examination boards checked this process in a way that Mr.
  Mainwearing felt reflected upon his honour, and like all fundamentally
  dishonest people he was inclined to be touchy about his honour. But parents
  wanted examination results and he had to give in. Preparation for
  examinations dominated the school; no work was done in the school that did
  not lead towards an examination paper; if there had been no examinations, no
  work would have been done at all. But these examinations might have been
  worse than they were. The examiners were experienced teachers and considerate
  for their kind. They respected the great routine. The examiners in classics
  had, at best, Babu Latin and less Greek, and so they knew quite well how to
  set a paper that would enable the intelligent candidate to conceal an entire
  incapacity for reading, writing, or speaking a classical language; the
  examiners in mathematics knew nothing of practical calculations, and treated
  the subject as a sort of Patience game; the foreign language examiners stuck
  loyally to the grammar; in drawing the examiners asked you to copy "copies,"
  they did not, at any rate, require you to draw things; and altogether the
  "curse of examinations" might have pressed on Mr. Mainwearing harder than it
  did. Suppose the language papers had been just long passages to translate
  into and out of English, and that the mathematical test had been all
  problems, and the drawing test had been a test of drawing anything! What
  school could have stood the strain?</p>

  <p>To assist him in the work of his school Mr. Mainwearing had gathered about
  him a staff of three. He had found a young man rather of his own social
  quality, but very timid, a B.A. Cantab, by way of the botanical special; then
  there was Noakley, a rather older, sly creature, with a large overbalancing
  nose, who had failed to qualify years ago as an elementary assistant
  school-master and so had strayed into the uncharted and uncertificated ways
  of a private school; and finally there was Kahn, an Alsatian, who taught
  languages and the piano. With these three and the active assistance of Mrs.
  Rich, the housekeeper, the school maintained its sluggish routines.</p>

  <p>The boys slept in two long rooms that had been made by knocking through
  partitions in the two upper floors, and converted into dormitories by the
  simple expedient of crowding them with iron bedsteads and small chests of
  drawers. It was the business of Noakley&mdash;who had a separate room on the
  top floor&mdash;to arouse the boys at seven with cries and violence for the
  business of the day. But there was a tacit understanding between him and the
  boys not to molest each other until about twenty minutes past.</p>

  <p>It was a rule, established by Mr. Mainwearing in a phase of hygienic
  enthusiasm some years before, that on fine mornings throughout the year the
  boys should go for a sharp run before breakfast. It was a modern and
  impressive thing to do and it cost him nothing. It was Noakley's duty to
  accompany them on this run. He was unable to imagine any more loathsome duty.
  So that he had invented a method of supplementing the rains of heaven by
  means of a private watering-pot. His room was directly above Mr.
  Mainwearing's, and Mr. Mainwearing slept with his window shut and his blinds
  down, and about seven-fifteen or so every morning the curious passer-by might
  have seen a lean, sly man with an enormous nose, his mouth wide open and his
  tongue out with effort, leaning far out of an upper bedroom of High Cross
  School and industriously and carefully watering the window and window-sill of
  the room two storeys below him. Later, perhaps, a patient observer might have
  been rewarded by the raising of Mr. Mainwearing's blind and a glimpse of Mr.
  Mainwearing, unshaven and in a white cotton nightgown, glancing out at the
  weather....</p>

  <p>So generally the morning began with a tedious, sticky, still sleepy hour
  called Early Prep, in the schoolroom on the ground floor. It was only during
  Kahn's alternate week of morning duty that the run ever occurred. Then it
  wasn't a run. It began as a run and settled down as soon as it was out of
  sight of the school to a sulky walk and a muttered monologue by Kahn in
  German&mdash;he never spoke any language but German before
  breakfast&mdash;about his "<i>Magen</i>."</p>

  <p>Noakley's method in early prep, was to sit as near to the fire as possible
  in the winter and at the high desk in summer, and to leave the boys alone so
  long as they left him alone. They conversed in undertones, made and threw
  paper darts at one another, read forbidden fiction, and so forth. Breakfast
  at half-past eight released them, and there was a spell of playground before
  morning school at half-past nine. At half-past nine Mr. Mainwearing and Mr.
  Smithers, the botanical Cantab, appeared in the world, gowned and a little
  irritable, and prayers and scripture inaugurated the official day. Mr.
  Mainwearing's connexion was a sound Church connexion, and he opened the day
  with an abbreviated Matins and the collect and lessons for the day. Then the
  junior half of the school went upstairs to the second class-room with Mr.
  Smithers, while Mr. Mainwearing dealt tediously with Chronicles or Kings.
  Meanwhile Kahn and Noakley corrected exercise-books in the third class-room,
  and waited their time to take up their part in the great task of building up
  the British imperial mind. By eleven o'clock each of the four class-rooms was
  thoroughly stuffy and the school was in full swing; Mr. Mainwearing, who
  could not have translated a new satire by Juvenal to save his life, was
  "teaching" Greek or Latin or history, Mr. Smithers was setting or explaining
  exercises on the way to quadratic equations or Euclid Book II., which were
  the culminating points of High Cross mathematics; Kahn, hoarse with loud
  anger, was making a personal quarrel of the French class; and Noakley was
  gently setting the feet of the younger boys astray in geography or arithmetic
  or parsing. This was the high-water mark of the day's effort.</p>

  <p>After the midday dinner, which was greasy and with much too much potato in
  it, came a visible decline. In the afternoon Mr. Mainwearing would start a
  class upon some sort of exercises, delegate Probyn to keep order, and retire
  to slumber in his study; Smithers and Kahn, who both suffered from
  indigestion, would quarrel bitterly with boys they disliked and inflict
  punishments; Noakley would sleep quietly through a drawing class on the tacit
  understanding that there was no audible misbehaviour, and that the boys would
  awaken him if they heard Mr. Mainwearing coming.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mainwearing, when he came, usually came viciously. He would awaken in
  an evil temper and sit cursing his life for some time before he could rouse
  himself to a return to duty. He would suddenly become filled with suspicions,
  about the behaviour of the boys or the worthiness of his assistants. He would
  take his cane and return with a heavy scowl on his face through the archway
  to his abandoned class.</p>

  <p>He would hear a murmur of disorder, a squeak of "<i>cave</i>!" and a
  hush.</p>

  <p>Or he would hear Probyn's loud bellow: "Shut up, young Pyecroft. Shut it,
  I say!&mdash;or I'll report you!"</p>

  <p>He would appear threateningly in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"What's he doing, Probyn?" he would ask. "What's he doing?"</p>

  <p>"Humbugging about, Sir. He's always humbugging about."</p>

  <p>The diffused wrath of Mr. Mainwearing would gather to a focus. If there
  were no little beasts like young Pyecroft he wouldn't be in this infernal,
  dull, dreary hole of a school.</p>

  <p>"I'll teach you to humbug about, Pyecroft," he would say. "Come out,
  Sir!"</p>

  <p>"Please, Sir!"</p>

  <p>Roar. "Don't bandy words with me, you little Hound! Come out, I say!"</p>

  <p>"Please!" Young Pyecroft would come out slowly and weeping. Mr.
  Mainwearing would grip him hungrily.</p>

  <p>"I'll teach you to humbug about. (Cut.) I'11 teach you! (Cut.) I can't
  leave this class-room for a moment but half a dozen of you must go turning it
  upside down." (Cut.)</p>

  <p>"Wow!"</p>

  <p>"Don't answer me, Sir!" (Cut.) "Don't answer me." (Cut.) "Now, Sir?"</p>

  <p>Pyecroft completely subdued. Pyecroft relinquished.</p>

  <p>"Now, are there any more of you?" asked Mr. Mainwearing, feeling a little
  better.</p>

  <p>Then he would hesitate. Should he take the set work at once, or should he
  steal upstairs on tiptoe to catch out one of the assistants? His practice
  varied. He always suspected Noakley of his afternoon sleep, and was never
  able to catch him. Noakley slept with the class-room door slightly open. His
  boys could hear the opening of the classroom door downstairs. When they did
  they would smack down a book upon the desk close beside him, and Noakley
  would start teaching instantly like an automaton that has just been released.
  He didn't take a second to awaken, so that he was very hard indeed to
  catch.</p>

  <p>The school remained a scene of jaded activities until four, when a bell
  rang for afternoon prayers under Mr. Mainwearing in the main schoolroom. Then
  the boys would sing a hymn while Kahn accompanied on a small harmonium that
  stood in the corner of the room. While prayers were going on a certain
  scattered minority of the boys were speculating whether Kahn or Smithers
  would remember this or that task that had been imposed in a moment of
  passion, weighing whether it was safer to obey or forget. Kahn and Smithers
  would return to the class-rooms reluctantly to gather in the harvest of their
  own wrath, but now for a little time Noakley was free to do nothing. Noakley
  hardly ever imposed punishments. When he was spoken to upon the subject he
  would put his nose down in a thoughtful manner and reply in a tone of mild
  observation: "The boys, they seem to mind me somehow."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the released boys dispersed to loaf about the playground and the
  outhouses and playing-field until tea at five. Sometimes there was a hectic
  attempt at cricket or football in the field in which Mr. Mainwearing
  participated, and then tea was at half-past five. When Mr. Mainwearing
  participated he liked to bat, and he did not like to be bowled out. Noakley
  was vaguely supposed to superintend Tea and evening prep., and the boys,
  after a supper of milk and biscuits, were packed off to bed at half-past
  eight. It was much too early to send the bigger boys to bed, but "Good God!"
  said Mr. Mainwearing; "am I to have no peace in my day?" And he tried to ease
  his conscience about what might go on in the dormitories after bedtime by
  directing</p>

  <p>Noakley to "exercise a general supervision," and by occasionally stealing
  upstairs in his socks.</p>

  <p>Wednesday and Saturday were half-holidays, and in the afternoon the boys
  wore flannels or shorts, according to the season, and played pick-up cricket
  or football or hockey in a well-worn field at the back of the school, or they
  went for a walk with Noakley or Smithers. On Sundays they wore top hats and
  pseudo-Eton jackets, and went to church in the morning and the evening. In
  the afternoon Smithers took Scripture wearily for an hour, and then went for
  a walk with Noakley! And on Sunday evening they wrote home carefully
  supervised letters saying how happy they were and how they were all in the
  best of health and about "examinational prospects," and how they hoped they
  were making satisfactory progress and suchlike topics. But they never gave
  any account of the talk that went on during the playground loafing, nor of
  the strange games and ceremonies over which Probyn presided in the
  dormitories, nor of the exercises of Mr. Main wearing's cane. There was no
  library, and the boys never read anything except school books and such
  printed matter as they themselves introduced into the school. They never read
  nor drew nor painted nor made verses to please themselves. They never dreamt
  of acting or singing. Their only training in the use of their hands was at
  cricket, and they never looked at a newspaper. Occasionally Smithers gave a
  lesson in botany, but there was no other science teaching. Science teaching
  requires apparatus and apparatus costs money, and so far as the prospectus
  went it was quite easy to call the botany "science."...</p><br>

  <h3>§ 10</h3>

  <p class="first">In this manner did High Cross School grind and polish its
  little batch of boys for their participation in the affairs of the greatest,
  most civilized and most civilizing empire the world has ever seen.</p>

  <p>It was, perhaps, a bad specimen of an English private school, but it was a
  specimen. There were worse as well as better among the schools of England.
  There were no doubt many newer and larger, many cleaner, many better
  classified. Some had visiting drill-sergeants, some had chemistry cupboards,
  some had specially built gymnasia, some even had school libraries of a
  hundred volumes or so.... Most of them had better housing and better arranged
  dormitories. And most of them were consistently "preparatory," stuck to an
  upward age-limit, and turned out a boy as soon as he became a youth to go on
  to business or medicine or the public schools. Mr. Mainwearing's school was
  exceptional in this, that it had to hold on to all it could get. He had a
  connexion with one or two solicitors, an understanding&mdash;Mr. Grimes was
  one of his friends&mdash;and his school contained in addition to Peter
  several other samples of that unfortunate type of boy whose school is found
  for him by a solicitor. Some stayed at Windsor with Mr. Mainwearing during
  the holidays. In that matter High Cross School was exceptional. But the want
  of any intellectual interest, of any spontaneous activities of the mind at
  all in High Cross School, was no exceptional thing.</p>

  <p>Life never stands altogether still, but it has a queer tendency to form
  stationary eddies, and very much of the education of middle-class and upper-
  class youth in England had been an eddy for a century. The still exquisite
  and impressionable brains of the new generation came tumbling down the
  stream, curious, active, greedy, and the eddying schools caught them with a
  grip of iron and spun them round and round for six or seven precious years
  and at last flung them out....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 11</h3>

  <p class="first">Into this vicious eddy about Mr. Mainwearing's life and
  school came the developing brain of Master Peter Stubland, and resented it
  extremely. At first he had been too much astonished by his transfer from
  Limpsfield to entertain any other emotion; it was only after some days at
  High Cross School that he began to realize that the experience was not simply
  astonishing but uncongenial, and indeed hateful.</p>

  <p>He discovered he hated the whole place. Comprehended within this general
  hatred were particular ones. He hated Newton. The fight remained in suspense,
  neither boy knew anything of scientific fisticuffs, neither had ever worn a
  boxing-glove, and both were disposed to evade the hard, clear issue of the
  ring. But Newton continued to threaten and grimace at him, and once as he was
  passing Peter on the staircase he turned about and punched him in the
  back.</p>

  <p>For Newton Peter's hatred was uncomplicated; for Probyn and a second boy
  nearly as big, a fair, sleepy boy named Ames, Peter had a feeling that
  differed from a clear, clean hatred; it had an element of disgust and dread
  in it. Probyn, with Ames as an accessory and Newton as his pet toady,
  dominated the school. It is an unnatural and an unwholesome thing for boys
  and youths of various ages to be herded as closely together as they were in
  High Cross School; the natural instinct of the young is against such an
  association. In a good, big school whose atmosphere is wholesome, boys will
  classify themselves out in the completest way; they will not associate, they
  will scarcely speak with boys outside their own year. There is a foolish way
  of disposing of this fact by saying that boys are "such Snobs." But indeed
  they are kept apart by the fiercest instinct of self-preservation. All life
  and all its questions are stirring and unfolding in the young boy; in every
  sort of young creature a natural discretion fights against forced and
  premature developments. "Keep to your phase," says nature. The older boys,
  perplexed by novel urgencies and curiosities, are embarrassed by their
  younger fellows; younger boys are naturally afraid of older ones and a little
  disposed to cringe. But what were such considerations as these to a man like
  Mainwearing? He had never thought over, he had long since forgotten, his own
  development. Any boy, old or young, whose parents could pay the bill, was got
  into the school and kept in the school as long as possible. None of the
  school work was interesting; there were constant gaps in the routine when
  there was nothing to do but loaf. It was inevitable that the older boys
  should become mischievous louts; they bullied and tormented and corrupted the
  younger boys because there was nothing else to do; if there had been anything
  else to do they would have absolutely disregarded the younger boys; and the
  younger boys did what they could to propitiate these powerful and
  unaccountable giants. The younger boys "sucked up" to the bigger boys; they
  became, as it were, clients; they were annexed by patrons. They professed
  unlimited obedience in exchange for protection. Newton, for instance, called
  himself Probyn's "monkey"; Pyecroft was Ames's. Probyn would help Newton with
  his sums, amuse himself by putting him to the torture (when Newton was
  expected to display a doglike submission) or make him jealous by professing
  an affection for other small boys.</p>

  <p>Peter came into this stuffy atmosphere of forced and undignified
  relationships instinct, though he knew it not, with a passionate sense of
  honour. From the very beginning he knew there was something in these boys and
  in their atmosphere that made them different from himself, something from
  which he had to keep himself aloof. There was a word missing from his
  vocabulary that would have expressed it, and that word was "Cad." But at the
  School of St. George and the Venerable Bede they were not taught to call any
  people "cads."</p>

  <p>He was a boy capable of considerable reserve. He did not, like young
  Winterbaum, press his every thought and idea upon those about him. He could
  be frank where he was confident, but this sense of difference smote him dumb.
  Several of his schoolfellows, old Noakley, and Mr. Mainwearing, became
  uncomfortably aware of an effect of unspoken comment in Peter. He would
  receive a sudden phrase of abuse with a thoughtful expression, as though he
  weighed it and compared it with some exterior standard. This irritated a
  school staff accustomed to use abusive language. Probyn, after Peter had hit
  Newton, took a fancy to him that did not in the least modify Peter's
  instinctive detestation of the red nostrils and the sloppy mouth and the
  voluminous bellow. Peter became rapidly skilful in avoiding Probyn's
  conversation, and this monstrously enhanced his attraction for Probyn.
  Probyn's attention varied between deliberate attempts to vex and deliberate
  attempts to propitiate. He kept alive the promise of a fight with Newton, and
  frankly declared that Peter could lick Newton any day. Newton was as
  distressed as a cast mistress.</p>

  <p>One evening the cadaverous boy discovered Peter drawing warriors on
  horseback. He reported this strange gift to Ames. Ames came demanding
  performances, and Peter obliged.</p>

  <p>"He <i>can</i> draw," said Ames. "George and the Dragon, eh? It's
  <i>good</i>."</p>

  <p>Probyn was shouted to, and joined in the admiration.</p>

  <p>Peter drew this and that by request.</p>

  <p>"Draw a woman," said Ames, and then, as the nimble pencil obeyed,
  "No&mdash;not an old woman. Draw&mdash;you know. Draw a savage woman."</p>

  <p>"Draw a girl bathing&mdash;like they are in Ally Sloper's Half-Holiday,"
  said Probyn. "Just with light things on."</p>

  <p>"Draw a heathen goddess," said Ames. "With nothing on at all."</p>

  <p>Peter said he couldn't draw goddesses.</p>

  <p>"Go on," said Ames. "Draw a savage woman."</p>

  <p>Peter, being pressed, tried a negress. They hung over him insisting upon
  details.</p>

  <p>"Get out, young Newton!" cried Probyn. "Don't come hanging round here.
  He's drawing things."</p>

  <p>Ames pressed further requests.</p>

  <p>"Shan't draw any more," said Peter with a sudden disinclination.</p>

  <p>"Go it, Simon Peter," said Ames, "don't be a mammy-good."</p>

  <p>"Gaw! if I could draw!" said Probyn.</p>

  <p>But Peter had finished drawing.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 12</h3>

  <p class="first">No further questions were asked Peter about his father, but
  on Sunday night, when home-letter time came round, any doubt about the
  soundness of his social position was set at rest by Mr. Mainwearing himself.
  Home-letters from High Cross School involved so many delicate considerations
  that the proprietor made it his custom to supervise them himself. He
  distributed sheets of paper with the school heading, and afterwards he
  collected them and addressed them himself in his study. "You, Stubland, must
  write a letter to your aunt," he said loudly across the room, "and tell her
  how you are getting on."</p>

  <p>"Aunt Phyllis?" said Peter.</p>

  <p>"No, no!" Mr. Mainwearing answered in clear tones. "Your aunt, Lady
  Charlotte Sydenham."</p>

  <p>Respectful glances at Peter, and a stare of admiration from Probyn.</p>

  <p>After a season of reflection Peter held up his hand. "Please, Sir, I don't
  write letters to Lady Charlotte."</p>

  <p>"You must begin."</p>

  <p>Still further reflection. "I want to write to my Aunt Phyllis."</p>

  <p>"Nonsense! Do as I tell you."</p>

  <p>Peter reflected again for some minutes. He was deeply moved. He controlled
  a disposition to weep. (No one was going to see Peter blub in this
  school&mdash;ever.) Then Mr. Mainwearing saw him begin to write, with
  intervals of deep thought. But the letter was an unsatisfactory one.</p>

  <p>"<i>Dear Aunt Phyllis,</i>" it began&mdash;in spite of instructions.</p>

  <p class="letter">"This is a very nice school and I like it very much. I have
  no pocket-money. We eat Toke. Please come and take me away now. Your
  affectionate nephew</p>

  <p class="letter">"PETER."</p>

  <p>Then Peter rubbed his eyes and it made his finger wet, and there was a
  drop of eye wet fell on the paper, but he did not blub. He did not blub, he
  knew, because he had made up his mind not to blub, but his face was flushed
  almost like that of a boy who has been blubbing.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mainwearing came and read the letter. "Come, come," he said, "this
  won't do," which was just what Peter had expected. "This is obstinacy," said
  Mr. Mainwearing.</p>

  <p>He got Peter a fresh sheet of paper and stood over him. "Write as I tell
  you," said Mr. Mainwearing.</p>

  <p>The other boys listened as this letter was dictated to a quiet but
  obedient Peter:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Lady Charlotte,</p>

  <p class="letter">"I arrived safely on Wednesday at High Cross School, which
  I like very much. I had a long ride in an automobile. Mr. Grimes bought me a
  splendid bat. Mr. Mainwearing has examined me upon my attainments, and
  believes that with effort I shall make satisfactory progress here. We play
  cricket here and do modern science as well as our classical studies. I hope
  you may never be disappointed by my efforts after all your kindness to
  me.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Your affectionate nephew,</p>

  <p class="letter">"PETER STUBLAND."</p>

  <p>In the night Peter woke up out of an ugly and miserable dream, and his
  eyes were wet with tears. He believed he was caught at High Cross School for
  good and all. He believed that all the things he hated and dreaded were about
  him now for ever.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 13</h3>

  <p class="first">From the first Mr. Mainwearing had been prepared for Peter's
  antagonism. He had been warned by Mr. Grimes that Peter might prove "a little
  difficult." The letter to Aunt Phyllis confirmed this impression he had
  already formed of a fund of stiff resistance in his new pupil. "I shall have
  to talk to that young man," he said.</p>

  <p>The occasion was not long in coming.</p>

  <p>It came next morning in the general Scripture lesson. The boys were
  reading the Gospel of St. Matthew verse by verse, and in order to check
  inattention Mr. Mainwearing, instead of allowing the boys to read in
  rotation, was dodging the next verse irregularly from boy to boy. "Now,
  Pyecroft," he would say; "Now&mdash; Rivers."</p>

  <p>He was always ready to pick up a nickname and improve upon it for the
  general amusement. "Now, Simonides," he said.</p>

  <p>No answer.</p>

  <p>"Simonides!"</p>

  <p>Peter, with his New Testament open before him, was studying the map of
  Africa on the end wall. That was Egypt and that was the Nile, and down that
  you went to Uganda, where all the people dressed in white and Nobby walked
  fearlessly among lions.</p>

  <p>Peter became aware of a loud shout of "Sim-on-i-des!"</p>

  <p>It was apparently being addressed to him by Mr. Mainwearing. He returned
  at a jump to Europe and High Cross School.</p>

  <p>"Wool-gathering again," said Mr. Mainwearing. "Thinking of the dear old
  Agapemone, eh? We can't have that here, young man. We can't allow that here.
  We must quicken that proud but sluggish spirit of yours. With the usual
  stimulus. Come out, sir."</p>

  <p>He moved towards the cane, which hung from a nail beside the high
  desk.</p>

  <p>Obliging schoolfellows explained to Peter. "He spoke to you three times."
  "He's going to swish you." "You'll get it."</p>

  <p>Peter went very white and sat very tight.</p>

  <p>"Now, young man," said Mr. Mainwearing, flicking the cane. "Step out,
  please....</p>

  <p>"Come out here, sir."</p>

  <p>No answer from Peter.</p>

  <p>"Stubland," roared Mr. Mainwearing. "Come out at once."</p>

  <p>There came a break in the traditions of High Cross School.</p>

  <p>Peter rose to his feet. It seemed he was going to obey. And then he said
  in a voice, faint and small but perfectly clear, "I ain't going to be caned.
  No."</p>

  <p>There was a great pause. There was as it were silence in Heaven. And then,
  his footsteps echoing through that immensity of awe, Mr. Mainwearing advanced
  upon Peter. Peter with a loud undignified cry fled along the wall under the
  map of Palestine towards the door.</p>

  <p>"Stop him there, Ames!" cried Mr. Mainwearing. Ames was slow to
  understand.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mainwearing put down the cane on the mantelshelf and became very
  active; he leapt a desk clumsily, upset an inkpot, and collided with Ames at
  the door a moment after Peter had vanished. On the landing outside Peter
  hesitated, and then doubled downstairs to the boot-hole. For a moment Mr.
  Mainwearing was at fault. "Hell!" he said. All the classroom heard him say
  "Hell!" All the school treasured that cry in its heart for future use.
  "Young&mdash;," said Mr. Mainwearing. It was long a matter for secret
  disputation in the school what particularly choice sort of young thing Mr.
  Mainwearing had called Peter. Then he heard a crash in the boot-hole and was
  downstairs in a moment. Peter was out in the area, up the area steps as quick
  as a scared grey mouse, and then he made his mistake. He struck out across
  the open in front of the house. In a dozen strides Mr. Mainwearing had
  him.</p>

  <p>"I'll thrash you, Sir," said Mr. Mainwearing, swinging the little body by
  the collar, and shaking him as a dog might shake a rat. "I'll thrash you.
  I'll thrash you before the whole school."</p>

  <p>But two people had their blood up now.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell my uncle Nobby," yelled Peter. "I'll tell my uncle Nobby. He's
  a soldier."</p>

  <p>Thus disputing they presently reappeared in the lower class-room. Peter
  was tremendously dishevelled and still kicking, and Mr. Mainwearing was
  holding him by the general slack of his garments.</p>

  <p>"Silence, Sir, while I thrash you," said Mr. Mainwearing, and he was red
  and moist.</p>

  <p>"My uncle, he's a soldier. He's a V.C. You thrash me and he'll kill you.
  He'll kill you. He'll kill you."</p>

  <p>"Gimme my cane, some one," said Mr. Mainwearing.</p>

  <p>"He'll kill you."</p>

  <p>Nobody got the cane. "Probyn," cried Mr. Mainwearing, "give me my
  cane."</p>

  <p>Probyn hesitated, and then said to young Newton, "You get it." Young
  Newton had been standing up, half offering himself for this service. He
  handed the cane to Mr. Mainwearing.</p>

  <p>"You touch me!" threatened Peter, "you touch me. He'll kill you," and
  taking advantage of the moment when Mr. Main wearing's hand was extended for
  the cane he scored a sound kick on the master's knee. Then by an inspired
  wriggle he sought to involve himself with Mr. Mainwearing's gown in such a
  manner as to protect his more vulnerable area.</p>

  <p>But now Mr. Mainwearing was in a position to score. He stuck his cane
  between his teeth in an impressive and terrible manner, and then got his gown
  loose and altered his grip on his small victim. Now for it! The school hung
  breathless. <i>Cut</i>. Peter became as lively as an eel. Cut.</p>

  <p>There were tears in his voice, but his voice was full and clear.</p>

  <p>"He'll kill you. He'll come here and kill you. I'll burn down the
  school."</p>

  <p>"You will, will you?"</p>

  <p><i>Cut</i>. A kick. <i>Cut</i>. Silent wriggles.</p>

  <p>"Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten," counted Mr. Mainwearing and stopped,
  and let go his hold with a shove. "Now go to your place," he said. He was
  secretly grateful to Peter that he went. Peter had a way at times of looking
  a very small boy, and he did so now. He was tearful, red and amazingly
  dishevelled, but still not broken down to technical blubbing. His face was
  streaked with emotion; it was only too manifest that the routines of High
  Cross had reduced his private ablutions to a minimum. He glanced over his
  shoulder to see if he was still pursued. He could still sob, "My uncle."</p>

  <p>But Mr. Mainwearing did not mean this to be the close of the encounter. He
  had thought out the problems of discipline according to his lights; a boy
  must give in. Peter had still to give in.</p>

  <p>"And now Stubland," he proclaimed, "stay in after afternoon school, stay
  in all tomorrow, and write me out five hundred times, 'I must not sulk. I
  must obey.' Five hundred times, Sir."</p>

  <p>Something muffled was audible from Peter, something suggestive of a
  refusal.</p>

  <p>"Bring them to me on Wednesday evening at latest. That will keep you
  busy&mdash;and no time to spare. You hear me? Sir? 'I must not sulk' and 'I
  must obey.' And if they are not ready, Sir, twelve strokes good and full. And
  every morning until they are ready, twelve strokes. That's how we do things
  here. No shirking. Play the fool with me and you pay for it&mdash;up to the
  hilt. This, at any rate, is a school, a school where discipline is respected,
  whatever queer Socialist Agapemone you may have frequented before. And now
  I've taken you in hand, young man, I mean to go through with you&mdash;if you
  have a hundred uncles Nobchick armed to the teeth. If you have a thousand
  uncles Nobchick, they won't help you, if you air your stubborn temper at High
  Cross School...."</p>

  <p>Perhaps Peter would have written the lines, but young Newton, in the
  company of two friends, came up to him in the playground before dinner. "
  Going to write those lines, Simon Peter?" asked young Newton.</p>

  <p>What could a chap do but say, "No fear."</p>

  <p>"You'll write 'em all right," said Newton, and turned scornfully. So Peter
  sat in the stuffy schoolroom during detention time, and drew pictures of
  soldiers and battles and adventures and mused and made his plans.</p>

  <p>He was going to run away. He was going to run right out of this disgusting
  place into the world. He would run away tomorrow after the midday meal. It
  would be the Wednesday half-holiday, and to go off then gave him his very
  best chance of a start; he might not be missed by any one in particular
  throughout the afternoon. The gap of time until tea-time seemed to him to be
  a limitless gap. "Abscond," said Peter, a beautiful, newly-acquired word.
  Just exactly whither he wanted to go, he did not know. Vaguely he supposed he
  would have to go to his Limpsfield aunts, but what he wanted to think he was
  doing was running away to sea. He was going to run away to sea and meet Nobby
  very soon; he was going to run against Nobby by the happiest chance, Nobby
  alone, or perhaps even (this was still dreamier) Daddy and Mummy. Then they
  would go on explorations together, and he and Nobby would sleep side by side
  at camp fires amidst the howling of lions. Somewhere upon that expedition he
  would come upon Mainwearing and Probyn and Newton, captives perhaps in the
  hands of savages.</p>

  <p>What would he and Nobby and Mummy and Daddy and Bungo Peter and Joan do to
  such miscreants?...</p>

  <p>This kept Peter thinking a long time. Because it was beyond the limits of
  Peter's generosity just now to spare Mr. Mainwearing. Probyn perhaps. Probyn,
  penitent to the pitch of tears, might be reduced to the status of a humble
  fag; even Newton might go on living in some very menial capacity&mdash;there
  could be a dog with the party of which Newton would always go in
  fear&mdash;but Mr. Mainwearing had exceeded the limits of mercy....</p>

  <p>A man like that was capable of any treason....</p>

  <p>Peter had it!&mdash;a beautiful scene. Mr. Mainwearing detected in a
  hideous conspiracy with a sinister Arab trader to murder the entire
  expedition, would be captured redhanded by Peter (armed with a revolver and a
  cutlass) and brought before Nobby and Bungo Peter. "The man must die," Nobby
  would say. "And quickly," Bungo Peter would echo, "seeing how perilous is our
  present situation."</p>

  <p>Then Peter would step forward. Mr. Mainwearing in a state of abject terror
  would fling himself down before him, cling to his knees, pray for
  forgiveness, pray Peter to intercede.</p>

  <p>Yes. On the whole&mdash;yes. Peter would intercede.</p>

  <p>Peter began to see the scene as a very beautiful one indeed....</p>

  <p>But Nobby would be made of sterner stuff. "You are too noble, Peter. In
  such a country as this we cannot be cumbered with traitor carrion. "We have
  killed the Arab. Is it just to spare this thousand times more perjured
  wretch, this blot upon the fair name of Englishman? Mainwearing, if such
  indeed be your true name, down on your knees and make your peace with
  God."...</p>

  <p>At this moment the reverie was interrupted by Mr. Mainwearing in
  cricketing flannels traversing the schoolroom. He was going to have a whack
  before tea. He just stood at the wickets and made the bigger boys bowl to
  him.</p>

  <p>Little he knew!</p>

  <p>Peter affected to write industriously....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 14</h3>

  <p class="first">After the midday meal on Wednesday Peter loafed for a little
  time in the playground.</p>

  <p>"Coming to play cricket, Simon Peter?" said Probyn.</p>

  <p>"Got to stay in the schoolroom," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"He's going to write his five hundred lines," said young Newton. "I said
  he would."</p>

  <p>(Young Newton would know better later.)</p>

  <p>Peter went back unobtrusively to the schoolroom. In his desk were two
  slices of bread-and-butter secreted from the breakfast table and wrapped in
  clean pages from an exercise-book. These were his simple provisions. With
  these, a pencil, and a good serviceable catapult he proposed to set out into
  the wide, wide world. He had no money.</p>

  <p>He "scouted" Mr. Mainwearing into his study, marked that he shut the door,
  and heard him pull down the blind. The armchair creaked as the schoolmaster
  sat down for the afternoon's repose. That would make a retreat from the front
  door of the school house possible. The back of the house meant a risk of
  being seen by the servants, the playground door or the cricket-field might
  attract the attention of some sneak. But from the front door to the road and
  the shelter of the playground wall was but ten seconds dash. Still Peter,
  from the moment he crept out of the main class-room into the passage to the
  moment when he was out of sight of the windows was as tightly strung as a
  fiddle-string. Never before in all his little life had he lived at such a
  pitch of nervous intensity. Once in the road he ran, and continued to run
  until he turned into the road to Clewer. Then he dropped into a good smart
  walk. The world was all before him.</p>

  <p>The world was a warm October afternoon and a straight road, poplars and
  red roofs ahead. Whither the road ran he had no idea, but in the back of his
  mind, obscured but by no means hidden by a cloud of dreams, was the necessity
  of getting to Ingle-Nook. After he had walked perhaps half a mile upon the
  road to Clewer it occurred to Peter that he would ask his way.</p>

  <p>The first person he asked was a nice little old lady with a kind face, and
  she did not know where the road went nor whence it came. "That way it goes to
  Pescod Street," she said, "if you take the right turning, and that way it
  goes past the racecourse. But you have to turn off, you know. That's Clewer
  Church."</p>

  <p>No, she didn't know which was the way to Limpsfield. Perhaps if Peter
  asked the postman he'd know.</p>

  <p>No postman was visible....</p>

  <p>The next person Peter asked was as excessive as the old lady was
  deficient. He was a large, smiling, self-satisfied man, with a hearty
  laugh.</p>

  <p>"Where does the road go, my boy?" he repeated. "Why! it goes to Maidenhead
  and Cookham. Cookham! Have you hear the story? This is the way the man told
  the waiter to take the underdone potatoes. Because it's the way to Cook-ham.
  See? Good, eh? But not so good as telling him to take peas that was. Through
  Windsor, you know. Because it's the way to Turnham Green. Ha, ha!</p>

  <p>"How far is Maidenhead? Oh! a tidy bit&mdash;a tidy bit. Say four miles.
  Put it at four miles."</p>

  <p>When Peter asked for Limpsfield the large man at once jumped to the
  conclusion he meant Winchfield. "That's a bit on your left," he said, t 'just
  a bit on your left. How far? Oh! a tidy bit. Say five miles&mdash;five miles
  and a 'arf, say."</p>

  <p>When he had gone on a little way the genial man shouted back to Peter:
  "Might be six miles, perhaps," he said. "Not more."</p>

  <p>Which was comforting news. So Peter went on his way with his back to
  Limpsfield&mdash;which was a good thirty miles and more away from
  him&mdash;and a pleasant illusion that Aunts Phyllis and Phoebe were quite
  conveniently just round the corner....</p>

  <p>About four o'clock he had discovered Maidenhead bridge, and thereafter the
  river held him to the end. He had never had a good look at a river before. It
  was a glowing October afternoon, and the river life was enjoying its Indian
  summer. High Cross School was an infinite distance away, and all its' shadows
  were dismissed from his mind. Boats are wonderful things to a small boy who
  has lived among hills. He wandered slowly along the towing-path, and watched
  several boats and barges through the lock. In each boat he hoped to see Uncle
  Nobby. But it just happened that Uncle Nobby wasn't there. Near the lock some
  people were feeding two swans. When they had gone through the lock Peter went
  close down to the swans. They came to him in a manner so friendly that he
  gave them the better part of his provisions. After that he watched the
  operations of a man repairing a Canadian canoe beside a boat-letting place.
  Then he became interested in the shoaling fish in the shallows. After that he
  walked for a time, on past some little islands. At last, as he was now a
  little foot-sore, he sat down on the bank in the lush grass above some clumps
  of sweet rush.</p>

  <p>He was just opposite the autumnal fires of the Cleveden woods, amidst
  which he could catch glimpses of Italian balustrading. The water was a dark
  mirror over which hung a bloom of mist. Now and then an infrequent boat would
  glide noiselessly or with a measured beat of rowlocks, through the brown
  water. Afar off was a swan....</p>

  <p>Presently he would go on to Ingle-Nook. But not just yet. When his feet
  and legs were a little rested he would go on. He would ask first for
  Limpsfield and then for Ingle-Nook. It would be three or four miles. He would
  get there in time for supper.</p>

  <p>He was struck by a thought that should have enlightened him. He wondered
  no one had ever brought him before from Ingle-Nook to this beautiful place.
  It was funny they did not know of it....</p>

  <p>Above that balustrading among the trees over there, must be a palace, and
  in that palace lived a beautiful princess who loved Peter....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 15</h3>

  <p class="first">It seemed at the first blush the most delightful accident in
  the world that the man with the ample face should ask Peter to mind his
  boat.</p>

  <p>He rowed up to the wooden steps close by where Peter was sitting. He
  seemed to argue a little with the lady who was steering and had to back away
  again, but at last he got the steps and shipped his oars and held on with a
  boat hook and got out. He helped the lady to land.</p>

  <p>"Here, Tommy!" he shouted, tying up the boat to the rail of the steps.
  "Just look after this boat a bit. We're going to have some tea."</p>

  <p>"We shall have to walk miles," said the lady.</p>

  <p>"Damn!" said the man.</p>

  <p>Something seemed to tell Peter that the man was cross.</p>

  <p>Peter doubted whether he was properly Tommy. Then he saw that there was
  something attractive in looking after a boat.</p>

  <p>"Don't let any one steal it," said the man with the ample face, with an
  unreal geniality. "And I'll give you a tanner."</p>

  <p>Peter arose and came to the steps. The lady and the gentleman stood for a
  time on the top of the bank, disputing fiercely&mdash;she wanted to go one
  way and he another&mdash;and finally disappeared, still disputing, in the
  lady's direction. Or rather, the lady made off in the direction of Cookham
  and the gentleman followed protesting. "Any way it's miles," she said....</p>

  <p>Slowly the afternoon quiet healed again. Peter was left in solitude with
  the boat, the silvery river, the overhanging woods, the distant swan.</p>

  <p>At first he just sat and looked at the boat.</p>

  <p>It had crimson cushions in it, and the lady had left a Japanese sunshade.
  The name of the boat was the Princess May. The lining wood of the boat was
  pale and the outer wood and the wood of the rowlocks darker with just one
  exquisite gold line. The oars were very wonderful, but the boat-hook with its
  paddle was much more wonderful. It would be lovely to touch that boat-hook.
  It was a thing you could paddle with or you could catch hold with the hook or
  poke with the spike.</p>

  <p>In a minute or so the call of the boat-hook had become irresistible, and
  Peter had got it out of the boat. He held it up like a spear, he waved it
  about. He poked the boat out with it and tried to paddle with it in the water
  between the boat and the bank, but the boat swung back too soon.</p>

  <p>Presently he got into the boat very carefully so as to paddle with the
  boat-hook in the water beyond the boat. In wielding the paddle he almost
  knocked off his hat, so he took it off and laid it in the bottom of the boat.
  Then he became deeply interested in his paddling.</p>

  <p>When he paddled in a certain way the whole boat, he found, began to swing
  out and round, and when he stopped paddling it went back against the bank.
  But it could not go completely round because of the tight way in which the
  ample-faced man had tied it to the rail of the steps. If the rope were tied
  quite at its end the boat could be paddled completely round. It would be
  beautiful to paddle it completely round with the waggling rudder up-stream
  instead of down.</p>

  <p>That thought did not lead to immediate action. But within two minutes
  Peter was untying the boat and retying it in accordance with his
  ambitions.</p>

  <p>In those days the Boy Scout movement was already in existence, but it had
  still to disseminate sound views about knot-tying among the rising
  generation. Peter's knot was not so much a knot as a knot-like gesture. How
  bad it was he only discovered when he was back in the boat and had paddled it
  nearly half-way round. Then he saw that the end of the rope was slipping off
  the rail to which he had tied it as a weary snake might slink off into the
  grass. The stem of the boat was perhaps a yard from shore.</p>

  <p>Peter acted with promptitude. He dropped his paddle, ran to the bows, and
  jumped. Except for his left leg he landed safely. His left leg he recovered
  from the water. But there was no catching the rope. It trailed submerged
  after the boat, and the boat with an exasperating leisureliness, with a
  movement that was barely perceptible, widened its distance from the bank.</p>

  <p>For a time Peter's mind wrestled with this problem-Should he try and find
  a stick that would reach the boat? Should he throw stones so as to bring it
  back in shore?</p>

  <p>Or perhaps if he told some one that the boat was adrift?</p>

  <p>He went up the steps to the towing-path. There was no one who looked at
  all helpful within sight. He watched the boat drift slowly for a time towards
  the middle of the stream. Then it seemed to be struck with an idea of going
  down to Maidenhead. He watched it recede and followed it slowly. When he saw
  some people afar off he tried to look as though he did not belong to the
  boat. He decided that presently somebody would appear rowing&mdash;whom he
  would ask to catch his boat for him. Then he would tow it back to its old
  position.</p>

  <p>Presently Peter came to the white gate of a bungalow and considered the
  advisability of telling a busy gardener who was mowing a lawn, about the
  boat. But it was difficult to frame a suitable form of address.</p>

  <p>Still further on a pleasant middle-aged woman who was trimming a privet
  hedge very carefully with garden shears, seemed a less terrible person to
  accost. Peter said to her modestly and self-forgetfully; "I think there's a
  boat adrift down there."</p>

  <p>The middle-aged woman peered through her spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Some one couldn't have tied it up," she said, and having looked at the
  boat with a quiet intelligence for some time she resumed her clipping.</p>

  <p>Her behaviour did much to dispel Peter's idea of calling in adult
  help.</p>

  <p>When he looked again the boat had turned round. It had drifted out into
  the middle of the stream, and it seemed now to be travelling rather faster
  and to be rocking slightly. It was not going down towards the lock but away
  towards where a board said "Danger." Danger. It was as if a cold hand was
  laid on Peter's heart. He no longer wanted to find the man with the ample
  face and tell him that his boat was adrift. The sun had set, the light seemed
  to have gone out of things, and Peter had a feeling that it was long past
  tea-time. He wished now he had never seen the man with the ample face. Would
  he have to pay for the boat? Could he say he had never promised to mind
  it?</p>

  <p>But if that was so why had he got into the boat and played about with
  it?</p>

  <p>His left shoe and his left trouser-leg were very wet and getting cold.</p>

  <p>A great craving for tea and home comforts generally arose in Peter's
  wayward mind. Home comforts and forgetfulness. It seemed to him high time
  that he asked some one the way to Limpsfield....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 16</h3>

  <p class="first">When Noakley and Probyn arrived at Maidenhead bridge in the
  late afternoon it seemed to them that they had done all that reasonable
  searchers could do, and that the best thing now was to take the train back to
  Windsor. They were tired and they felt futile. And then, when hope was
  exhausted, they struck the trail of Peter. The policeman at the foot of the
  bridge had actually noted him. "'Overed about the bridge for a bit," said the
  policeman, "and then went along the towing path. A little grave chap in grey
  flannel. Funny thing, but I thought 'E might be a runaway.... Something about
  'im...."</p>

  <p>So it was that Noakley and Probyn came upon the ample-faced man at the
  lock, in the full tide of his distress.</p>

  <p>He was vociferous to get across to the weir. "The boat ought to have come
  down long ago," he was saying, "unless it's caught up in something. If he was
  in the boat the kid's drowned for certain...."</p>

  <p>Noakley had some difficulty in getting him to explain what kid. It was
  difficult to secure the attention of the ample-faced man. In fact before this
  could be done he twice pushed back Noakley's face with his hand as though it
  was some sort of inanimate obstacle.</p>

  <p>It was a great and tragic experience for Probyn. They both went across by
  the lock to the island behind the lead of the lockkeeper and the ample-faced
  man. They came out in sight of the weir; the river was still full from the
  late September rains and the weir was a frothing cascade, and at the crest of
  it they saw an upturned boat jammed by the current against the timbers. A
  Japanese umbrella circled open in a foamy eddy below, stick upward. The sun
  was down now; a chill was in the air; a sense of coming winter.</p>

  <p>And then close at hand, caught in some weedy willow stems that dipped in
  the rushing water Probyn discovered a little soddened straw hat, a little
  half-submerged hat, bobbing with the swift current, entangled in the willow
  stems.</p>

  <p>It was unmistakable. It bore the white and black ribbon of High Cross
  School.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" cried Probyn at the sight of the hat, and burst into
  tears.</p>

  <p>"Poor little Peter. I'd have done anything for him!"</p>

  <p>He sobbed, and as he sobbed he talked. He became so remorseful and so
  grossly sentimental that even Noakley was surprised....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 17</h3>

  <p class="first">When next morning Mr. Grimes learnt by a long and expensive
  telegram from Mr. Mainwearing, followed almost immediately by a long
  explanatory letter, that Peter had run away from school and had been drowned
  near Boulter's Lock, he was overcome with terror. He had visions of Aunt
  Phoebe&mdash;doubled, for he imagined Aunt Phyllis to be just such
  another&mdash;as an avenger of blood. At the bare thought he became again a
  storm of vibrations. His clerks in the office outside could hear his nails
  running along his teeth all the morning, like the wind among the reeds. His
  imagination threw up wild and hasty schemes for a long holiday in some
  inaccessible place, in Norway or Switzerland, but the further he fled from
  civilization the more unbridled the vengeance, when it did overtake him,
  might be. Lady Charlotte was still in England. On the day appointed and for
  two days after, the Channel sea was reported stormy. All her plans were
  shattered and she had stayed on. She was still staying on. In a spasm of
  spite he telegraphed the dire news to her. Then he went down to Windsor, all
  a-quiver, to see that Mr. Mainwearing did not make a fool of himself, and to
  help him with the inquest on Peter as soon as the body was recovered.</p>

  <p>His telegram did have a very considerable effect upon Lady Charlotte, the
  more so as it arrived within an hour or so of a letter from Mrs. Pybus
  containing some very disconcerting news about Joan. At midday came Mr.
  Mainwearing's story&mdash;pitched to a high note of Anglican piety. The body,
  he said, was still not found, "but we must hope for the best." When Mr.
  Sycamore arrived at Chastlands in the afternoon he found Lady Charlotte
  immensely spread out in her drawing-room as an invalid, with Unwin on guard
  behind her. She lay, a large bundle of ribbon, lace, and distresses, upon a
  sofa; she had hoisted an enormous beribboned lace cap with black-and-gold
  bows. On a table close at hand were a scent-bottle, smelling-salts, camphor,
  menthol, and suchlike aids. There were also a few choice black grapes and a
  tonic. She meant to make a brave fight for it.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sycamore was not aware how very dead Peter was at Chastlands and
  Windsor, seeing that he was now also at The Ingle-Nook in a state of
  considerable vitality. It was some moments before he realized this localized
  demise. Indeed it was upon an entirely different aspect of this War of the
  Guardians that he was now visiting the enemy camp.</p>

  <p>At first there was a little difficulty made about admitting him. Cashel
  explained that Lady Charlotte was "much upset. Terribly upset." Finally he
  found himself in her large presence.</p>

  <p>She gave him no time to speak.</p>

  <p>"I am ill, Mr. Sycamore. I am in a wretched state. Properly I should be in
  bed now. I have been unable to travel abroad to rest. I have been totally
  unable to attend to affairs. And now comes this last blow. Terrible! A
  judgment."</p>

  <p>"I was not aware, Lady Charlotte, that you knew," Mr. Sycamore began.</p>

  <p>"Of course I know. Telegrams, letters. No attempt to break it to me. The
  brutal truth. I cannot tell you how I deplore my supineness that has led to
  this catastrophe."</p>

  <p>"Hardly supine," Mr. Sycamore ventured.</p>

  <p>"Yes, supine. If I had taken up my responsibilities years ago&mdash;when
  these poor children were christened, none of this might have happened.
  Nothing."</p>

  <p>Mr. Sycamore perceived that he was in the presence of something more than
  mere fuss about Peter's running away. A wary gleam came into his
  spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps, Lady Charlotte, if I could see your telegram," he said.</p>

  <p>"Give it him, Unwin," she said.</p>

  <p>"Stole a boat&mdash;carried over a weir," he read. "But this is terrible!
  I had no idea."</p>

  <p>"Give him the letter. No&mdash;not that one. The other."</p>

  <p>"Body not yet recovered," he read, and commented with confidence, "It will
  turn up later, I feel sure. Of course, all this is&mdash;news to me;
  boat&mdash;weir&mdash;everything. Yes."</p>

  <p>"And I was ill already!" said Lady Charlotte. "There is reason to suppose
  my heart is weak. I use myself too hard. I am too concerned about many
  things. I cannot live for myself alone. It is not my nature. The doctor had
  commanded a quiet month here before I even thought of travel&mdash;literally
  commanded. And then comes this blow. The wretched child could not have chosen
  a worse time."</p>

  <p>She gave a gesture of despair. She fell back upon her piled pillows with a
  gesture of furious exhaustion.</p>

  <p>"In the last twenty-four hours," she said, "I have eaten one egg, Mr.
  Sycamore.... And some of that I left."</p>

  <p>Mr. Sycamore's note of sympathy was perhaps a little insincere. "Of
  course," he said, "in taking the children away from their school&mdash;where
  they were at least safe and happy&mdash;you undertook a considerable
  responsibility."</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte took him up with emphasis. "I admit no
  responsibility&mdash;none whatever. Understand, Mr. Sycamore, once for all, I
  am not responsible for&mdash;whatever has happened to this wretched little
  boy. Sorry for him&mdash;yes, but I have nothing to regret. I took him away
  from&mdash;undesirable surroundings&mdash;and sent him to a school, by no
  means a cheap school, that was recommended very highly, very highly indeed,
  by Mr. Grimes. It was my plain duty to do as much. There my responsibility
  ends."</p>

  <p>Mr. Sycamore had drifted quietly into a chair, and was sitting obliquely
  to her in an attitude more becoming a family doctor than a hostile lawyer. He
  regarded the cornice in the far corner of the room as she spoke, and replied
  without looking at her, softly and almost as if in soliloquy:
  "Legally&mdash;no."</p>

  <p>"I am not responsible," the lady repeated. "If any one is responsible, it
  is Mr. Grimes."</p>

  <p>"I came to ask you to produce your two wards," said Mr. Sycamore abruptly,
  "because Mr. Oswald Sydenham lands at Southampton tonight."</p>

  <p>"He has always been coming."</p>

  <p>"This time he has come."</p>

  <p>"If he had come earlier all this would not have happened. Has he really
  come?"</p>

  <p>"He is here&mdash;in England, that is."</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte gasped and lay back. Unwin handed her the bottle of
  smelling-salts. "I have done nothing more than my duty," she said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sycamore became more gentle in his manner than ever. "As the person
  finally responsible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>No!</i>"</p>

  <p>"Haven't you been just a little careless?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sycamore, it was this boy who was careless. I am sorry to say it now
  that he&mdash;I can only hope that at the last&mdash;But he was not a good
  boy. Anything but a good boy. He had been altogether demoralized by those
  mad, violent creatures. He ran away from this school, an excellent school,
  highly recommended. And: you must remember, Mr. Sycamore, that I was paying
  for it. The abnormal position of the property, the way in which apparently
  all the income is to be paid over to these women&mdash;without consulting me.
  Well, I won't complain of that now. I was prepared to pay. I paid. But the
  boy was already thoroughly corrupted. His character was undermined. He ran
  away. I wash my hands of the consequences."</p>

  <p>Mr. Sycamore was on the point of saying something and thought better of
  it.</p>

  <p>"At any rate," he said, "I have to ask you on behalf of Mr. Oswald
  Sydenham to produce the other child&mdash;the girl."</p>

  <p>"She can't be produced," said Lady Charlotte desperately.</p>

  <p>"That really does make things serious."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't misunderstand me! The child is in excellent
  hands&mdash;excellent hands. But there are&mdash;neighbours. She was told to
  keep indoors, carefully told. What must she do but rush out at the first
  chance! She had had fair warning that there were measles about, she had had
  measles explained to her carefully, yet she must needs go and make friends
  with a lot of dirty little wretches!"</p>

  <p>"And catch measles."</p>

  <p>"Exactly."</p>

  <p>"That's why&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"That's why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There again, Lady Charlotte, and again with all due respect, haven't you
  been just a little careless? At that nice, airy school in Surrey there was
  never any contagion&mdash;of any sort."</p>

  <p>"There was no proper religious teaching."</p>

  <p>"Was there any where you placed these children?"</p>

  <p>"I was led to believe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She left it at that.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sycamore allowed himself to point the moral. "It is a very remarkable
  thing to me, Lady Charlotte, most remarkable, that Catholic people and Church
  of England people&mdash;you must forgive me for saying it&mdash;and religious
  bodies generally should be so very anxious and energetic to get control of
  the education of children and so careless&mdash;indeed they are dreadfully
  careless&mdash;of the tone, the wholesomeness and the quality of the
  education they supply. And of the homes they permit. It's almost as if they
  cared more for getting the children branded than whether they lived or
  died."</p>

  <p>"The school was an excellent school," said Lady Charlotte; an excellent
  school. Your remarks are cruel and painful."</p>

  <p>Mr. Sycamore again restrained some retort. Then he said, I think it would
  be well for Mr. Oswald Sydenham to have the address of the little girl."</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte considered. "There is nothing to conceal," she said, and
  gave the address of Mrs. Pybus," a most trustworthy woman," Mr. Sycamore took
  it down very carefully in a little note-book that came out of his vest
  pocket. Then he seemed to consider whether he should become more offensive or
  not, and to decide upon the former alternative.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said reflectively as he replaced the little book, "that
  the demand for religious observances and religious orthodoxy as a first
  condition in schools is productive of more hypocrisy and rottenness in
  education than any other single cause. It is a matter of common observation.
  A school is generally about as inefficient as its religious stripe is marked.
  I suppose it is because if you put the weight on one thing you cannot put it
  on another. Or perhaps it is because no test is so easy for a thoroughly mean
  and dishonest person to satisfy as a religious test. Schools which have no
  claims to any other merit can always pass themselves off as severely
  religious. Perhaps the truth is that all bad schools profess orthodoxy rather
  than that orthodoxy makes bad schools. Nowadays it is religion that is the
  last refuge of a scoundrel."</p>

  <p>"If you have nothing further to say than this Secularist lecturing," said
  Lady Charlotte with great dignity, "I should be obliged if you would find
  somewhere&mdash;some Hall of Science&mdash;... Considering what my feelings
  must be. . . Scarcely in the mood for&mdash;blasphemies."</p>

  <p>"Lady Charlotte," said Mr. Sycamore, betraying a note of indignation in
  his voice; "this school into which you flung your little ward was a very
  badly conducted school indeed."</p>

  <p>"It was nothing of the sort," said Lady Charlotte. "How dare you reproach
  me?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Sycamore went on as though she had not spoken. "There was a lot of
  bullying and nasty behaviour among the boys, and the masters inflicted
  punishments without rhyme or reason."</p>

  <p>"How can you know anything of the sort?"</p>

  <p>"On the best authority&mdash;the boy's."</p>

  <p>"But how could he&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He was thrashed absurdly and set an impossible task for not answering to
  a silly nickname. There was no one to whom he could complain. He ran away. He
  had an idea of reaching Limpsfield, but when he realized that night was
  coming on, being really a very sensible little boy, he selected a
  kindly-looking house, asked to see the lady of the house, and told her he had
  run away from home and wanted to go back. He gave his aunt's address at The
  Ingle-Nook, and he was sent home in the morning. He arrived home this
  morning."</p>

  <p>Lady Charlotte made a strange noise, but Mr. Sycamore hurried on. "How
  this delusion about a boat and a weir got into the story I don't know. He
  says nothing about them. Indeed, he says very little about anything. He's a
  reserved little boy. We have to get what we can out of him."</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that the boy is still alive!" cried Lady Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"Happily!"</p>

  <p>"In face of these telegrams!"</p>

  <p>"I saw him not two hours ago."</p>

  <p>"But how do you account for these telegrams and letters?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Sycamore positively tittered. "That's for Mr. Grimes to explain."</p>

  <p>"And he is alive&mdash;and unhurt?"</p>

  <p>"As fresh as paint; and quite happy."</p>

  <p>"Then if ever a little boy deserved a whipping, a thoroughly good
  whipping," cried Lady Charlotte, "it is Master Peter Stubland! Safe, indeed!
  It's outrageous! After all I have gone through! Unwin!"</p>

  <p>Unwin handed the salts.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sycamore stood up. He still had the essence of his business to
  communicate, but there was something in the great lady's blue eyes that made
  him want to stand up. And that little tussock of fair hair on her
  cheek&mdash;in some indescribable way it had become fierce.</p>

  <p>"To think," said Lady Charlotte, "that I have been put to all this
  unutterable worry and distress&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was at a loss for words. Mr. Sycamore appreciated the fact that if he
  had anything more to say to her he must communicate it before the storm
  burst. He stroked his chin thoughtfully, and began to deliver his message
  with just the faintest quality of hurry in his delivery.</p>

  <p>"The real business upon which I came to you today, Lady Charlotte, has
  really nothing to do with this&mdash;escapade at all. It is something else.
  Things have arisen that alter the outlook for those children very
  considerably. There is every reason to suppose that neither you nor the
  Misses Stubland are properly guardians of Joan and Peter at all. No. One
  moment more, Lady Charlotte; let me explain. Two young Germans, it would
  appear, witnessed the accident to the boat from the top of the Capri
  headland. They saw Mr. Stub-land apparently wrestling with the boatman, then
  the boat overset and the two men never reappeared. They must have dragged
  each other down. The witnesses are quite certain about that. But Mrs.
  Stubland, poor young lady, could be seen swimming for quite a long time; she
  swam nearly halfway to land before she gave in, although the water was very
  choppy indeed. I made enquiries when I was in Naples this spring, and I do
  not think there would be much trouble in producing those witnesses still.
  They were part of the&mdash;what shall I call it?&mdash;social circle of that
  man Krupp, the gunmaker. He lived at Capri. If we accept this story, then,
  Lady Charlotte, Mrs. Stubland's will holds good, and her husband's does not,
  and Mr. Oswald Sydenham becomes the sole guardian of the children...."</p>

  <p>He paused. The lady's square face slowly assumed an expression of
  dignified satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"So long as those poor children are rescued from those women," said Lady
  Charlotte, "my task is done. I do not grudge any exertion, any sacrifice I
  have made, so long as that end is secured. I do not look for thanks. Much
  less repayment. Perhaps some day these children may come to
  understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Unwin made a sound like the responses in church.</p>

  <p>"I would go through it all again," said Lady Charlotte&mdash;"willingly. .
  . Now that my nephew has returned I have no more anxiety." She made an
  elegant early-Georgian movement with the smelling-salts. "I am completely
  justified. I have been slighted, tricked, threatened, insulted, made ill ...
  but I am justified."</p>

  <p>She resorted again to the salts.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap09"
     name="chap09">CHAPTER IX. &mdash; OSWALD TAKES CONTROL</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">WHILE Mr. Sycamore was regaling himself with the
  discomfiture of Lady Charlotte, Oswald Sydenham was already walking about the
  West End of London.</p>

  <p>He had come upon a fresh crisis in his life. He was doing his best to
  accept some thoroughly disagreeable limitations. His. London specialist had
  but confirmed his own conviction. It was no longer possible for him to
  continue in Africa. He had reached the maximum of blackwater fever permitted
  to normal men. The next bout&mdash;if there was a next bout&mdash;would kill
  him. In addition to this very valid reason for a return, certain small
  fragments of that Egyptian shell long dormant in his arm had awakened to
  mischief, and had to be removed under the more favourable conditions to be
  found in England. He had come back therefore to a land where he had now no
  close friends and no special occupations, and once more he had to begin life
  afresh.</p>

  <p>He had returned with extreme reluctance. He could not see anything ahead
  of him in England that gripped his imagination at all. He was strongly
  tempted to have his arm patched up, and return to Africa for a last spell of
  work and a last conclusive dose of the fever germ. But in England he might be
  of use for a longer period, and a kind of godless conscience in him insisted
  that there must be no deliberate waste in his disposal of his life.</p>

  <p>For some time he had been distressed by the general ignorance, in England
  of the realities of things African, and by the general coarsening and
  deterioration, as he held it to be, of the Imperial idea. There was much over
  here that needed looking into, he felt, and when it was looked into then the
  indications for further work might appear. Why not, so far as his powers
  permitted, do something in helping English people to realize all that Africa
  was and might be. That was work he might do, and live. In Africa there was
  little more for him to do but die.</p>

  <p>That was all very well in theory. It did not alter his persuasion that he
  was going to be intolerably lonely if he stayed on in England. Out there were
  the Chief Commissioner and Muir and half a dozen other people for whom he had
  developed a strong affection; he was used to his native servants and he liked
  them; he had his round of intensely interesting activities, he was accustomed
  to the life. Out there, too, there was sunshine. Such sunshine as the
  temperate zone can never reproduce. This English world was a grey, draughty,
  cloudy, lonely world, and one could not always be working. That sunshine
  alone meant a vast deprivation.</p>

  <p>This sort of work he thought of doing and which seemed the only thing now
  that he could possibly do, wasn't, he reflected uncomfortably, by any means
  the work that he could do best. He knew he was bad-tempered. Ill-health
  intensified a natural irritability. He knew his brain was now a very
  uncertain instrument, sometimes quite good, sometimes a weary fount of
  half-formed ideas and indecisions. As an advocate of the right way in Africa,
  he would do some good no doubt; but he would certainly get into some tiresome
  squabbles, he would bark his knuckles and bruise his shins.
  Nevertheless&mdash;cheerless though the outlook was&mdash;it was, he felt,
  the work he ought to do.</p>

  <p>"Pump up enthusiasm," said Oswald. "Begin again. What else can I do?"</p>

  <p>But what he was pumping up that afternoon in London was really far more
  like anger. Rage and swearing were the natural secretions of Oswald's mind at
  every season of perplexity; he became angry when other types would be
  despondent. Where melancholic men abandon effort, men of the choleric type
  take to kicking and smashing. Where the former contract, the latter beat
  about and spread themselves. Oswald, beneath his superficial resignation, was
  working up for a quarrel with something. His instinct was to convert the
  distress of his developing physical insufficiencies into hostility to some
  external antagonist.</p>

  <p>lie knew of, and he was doing his best to control, this black urgency to
  violent thoughts and conclusions. He wanted to kick and he knew he must not
  yet waste energy in kicking. He was not justified in kicking. He must not
  allow his sense of personal grievance against fate to disturb his mind. He
  must behave with a studied calm and aloofness.</p>

  <p>"Damn!" said Oswald, no doubt by way of endorsing this decision.</p>

  <p>Pursuant to these virtuous resolutions this tall, lean, thwarted man, full
  of jealous solicitude for the empire he had helped enlarge, this disfigured
  man whose face was in two halves like those partially treated portraits one
  sees outside the shops of picture-cleaners, was engaged in comporting himself
  as much as possible like some pleasant, leisurely man of the world with no
  obligation or concern but to make himself comfortable and find amusement in
  things about him. He was doing his best to feel that there was no hurry about
  anything, and no reason whatever for getting into a state of mind. Just a
  calm quiet onlooker he had to be. He was, he told himself, taking a look
  round London as a preliminary to settling down there. Perhaps he was going to
  settle down in London. Or perhaps in the country somewhere. It did not matter
  which&mdash;whichever was the most pleasant. It was all very pleasant. Very
  pleasant indeed. A life now of wise lounging and judicious, temperate
  activities it had to be. He must not fuss.</p>

  <p>He had arrived in England the day before, but as yet, except for a brief
  note to Mr. Sycamore, he had notified no one of his return. He had put up at
  the Climax Club in Piccadilly, a proprietary club that was half hotel, where
  one could get a sitting-room as well as a bedroom; and after a visit to his
  doctor&mdash;a visit that confirmed all his worst apprehensions of the need
  of abandoning Africa for ever&mdash;he had spent the evening in the club
  trying to be calm over the newspapers and magazines. But when one is ill and
  tired as Oswald was, all that one reads in the newspapers and magazines is
  wrong and exasperating.</p>

  <p>It was 1903; the time when Mr. Joseph Chamberlain returned from South
  Africa to launch his Tariff Reform agitation&mdash;and Oswald was
  temperamentally a Free Trader. The whole press, daily, weekly, monthly, was
  full of the noises of the controversy. It impressed him as a controversy
  almost intolerably mean. His Imperialism was essentially a romantic and
  generous imagination, a dream of service, of himself, serving the Empire and
  of the Empire serving mankind. The tacit assumption underlying this most
  sordid of political campaigns that the Empire was really nothing of the kind,
  that it was an adventure of exploitation, a national enterprise in the higher
  piracy, borrowing a faded picturesqueness from the scoundrelism of the
  Elizabethan and Jacobean buccaneers, the men who started the British slave
  trade and the Ulster trouble and founded no Empire at all except the
  plantations of Virginia and Barbados, distressed and perplexed his mind
  almost unendurably. It was so maddeningly plausible. It was so manifestly the
  pathway of destruction.</p>

  <p>After throwing The National Review into a distant armchair and then, when
  he met the startled eye of a fellow member, trying to look as though that was
  his usual way with a magazine, he sought distraction in Southey's "Doctor,"
  which happened to be in the club library. After dinner he went out for a
  stroll in the West End, and visited the Alhambra. He found that more soothing
  than the papers. The old excitement of the human moth at the candles of vice
  he no longer felt. He wondered why these flitting allurements had ever
  stirred him. But he liked the stir and the lights and the pleasant
  inconsecutive imbecility of the entertainment.</p>

  <p>He slept fairly well. In the morning a clerk of Mr. Sycamore's telephoned
  to say that that gentleman was out of town, he had been called down to see
  Lady Charlotte Sydenham, but that he would be back, and would probably try to
  "get" Oswald about eleven in the evening. He had something important to tell
  Oswald. The day began cloudy, and repented and became fine. By midday it was,
  for London, a golden day. Yet to Oswald it seemed but a weak solution of
  sunshine. If you stood bareheaded in such sunshine you would catch a chill.
  But he made the best of it.</p>

  <p>"October mild and boon," he quoted. He assured himself that it would be
  entertaining to stroll about the West End and look at the shops and mark the
  changes in things. He breakfasted late at one of the windows overlooking the
  Green Park, visited the club barber, walked along to his tailor, bought three
  new hats and a stout gold-banded cane with an agate top in Bond Street, a
  pair of boots, gloves arid other sundries. Then he went into his second club,
  the Plantain, in Pall Mall, to read the papers&mdash;until he discovered that
  he was beginning to worry about Tariff Reform again. He saw no one he knew,
  and lunched alone. In the afternoon he strolled out into London once
  more.</p>

  <p>He was, he found, no longer uncomfortable and self-conscious in the
  streets of London. His one-sided, blank-sided face did not make him
  self-conscious now as it used to do, he had reconciled himself to his
  disfigurement. If at first he had exaggerated its effect, he now inclined to
  forget it altogether. He wore hats nowadays with a good broad brim, and
  cocked them to over-shadow the missing eye; his dark moustache had grown and
  was thick and symmetrical; he had acquired the habit of looking at himself in
  glasses so as to minimize his defaced half. It seemed to him a natural thing
  now that the casual passer-by should pull up for the fraction of a second at
  the sight of his tall figure, or look back at him as if to verify a first
  impression. Didn't people do that to everybody?</p>

  <p>He went along Pall Mall, whose high gentility was still in those days
  untroubled by the Royal Automobile Club and scarcely ruffled by a discreet
  shop or so; he turned up through St. James's Street to Piccadilly with a
  reminiscent glance by the way down Jermyn Street, where he had had his first
  experiences of restaurants and suchlike dissipations in his early midshipman
  days. How far away those follies seemed now! The shops of Bond Street drew
  him northward; the Dore Gallery of his childhood, he noted, was still going
  on; he prowled along Oxford Street as far as the Marble Arch&mdash;Gillows
  was still Gillows in those days, and Selfridge had yet to dawn on the London
  world&mdash;and beat back by way of Seymour Street to Regent Street. He
  nodded to Verrey's, where long ago he had lunched in a short plaid frock and
  white socks under the auspices of his godmother, old Lady Percival Pelham. It
  was all very much as he had left it in '97. That fever of rebuilding and
  rearrangement which was already wrecking the old Strand and sweeping away
  Booksellers' Row and the Drury Lane slums and a score of ancient landmarks,
  had not yet reached the West End. There was the same abundance of smart
  hansom cabs crawling in the streets or neatly ranked on the stands; the same
  populous horse omnibuses, the same brightly dressed people, and, in Regent
  Street and Piccadilly, the same too-brightly-dressed women loiterers, only
  now most of them were visibly coarse and painted; there were the same
  mendicants and sandwich-men at the pavement edge. Perhaps there were more
  omnibuses crowding upon one another at Piccadilly and Oxford Circuses, and
  more people everywhere. Or perhaps that was only the effect of returning from
  a less crowded world.</p>

  <p>Now and then he saw automobiles, queer, clumsy carriages without horses
  they seemed to be, or else low, heavy-looking vehicles with a flavour of
  battleship about them. Several emitted bluish smoke and trailed an evil
  smell. In Regent Street outside Liberty's art shop one of these mechanical
  novelties was in trouble. Everybody seemed pleased. The passing cabmen were
  openly derisive. Oswald joined the little group of people at the pavement
  edge who were watching the heated and bothered driver engaged in some obscure
  struggle beneath his car.</p>

  <p>An old gentleman in a white waistcoat stood beside Oswald, and presently
  turned to him.</p>

  <p>"Silly things," he said. "Noisy, dangerous, stinking things. They ought to
  be forbidden."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps they will improve," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"How could that thing improve?" asked the old gentleman. "Lotta dirty
  ironmongery."</p>

  <p>He turned away with the air of a man for whom a question had been settled.
  Oswald followed him thoughtfully....</p>

  <p>He resumed his identifications. Piccadilly Circus! Here was the good old
  Café Monico; yonder the <i>Criterion</i>."</p>

  <p>But everything seemed smaller.</p>

  <p>That was the thing that struck him most forcibly; London revisited he
  discovered to be an intense little place.</p>

  <p>It was extraordinary that this should be the head of the Empire. It
  seemed, when one came back to it, so entirely indifferent to the Empire, so
  entirely self-absorbed. When one was out beyond there, in Uganda, East
  Africa, Sudan, Egypt, in all those vast regions where the British were doing
  the best work they had ever done in pacification and civilization, one
  thought of London as if it were a great head that watched one from afar, that
  could hear a cry for help, that could send support. Yet here were these
  people in these narrow, brightly served streets, very busy about their own
  affairs, almost as busy and self-absorbed as the white-robed crowd in the big
  market-place in Mengo, and conspicuously, remarkably not thinking of
  Africa&mdash;or anything of the sort. He compared Bond Street and its
  crowded, inconvenient side-walks with one of the great garden vistas of the
  Uganda capital, much to the advantage of the latter. He descended by the Duke
  of York's steps, past the old milk stall with its cow, into the Mall.
  Buckingham Palace, far away, was much less impressive than the fort at
  Kampala on its commanding hill; the vegetation of St. James's Park and its
  iron fencing were a poor substitute for the rich-patterned reed palisades and
  the wealth of fronds that bordered the wide prospects of the Uganda capital.
  All English trees looked stunted to Oswald's eyes.</p>

  <p>Towards the palace, tree-felling was in progress, the felling of trees
  that could never be replaced; and an ugly hoarding veiled the erection of
  King Edward's pious memorial to Queen Victoria, the memorial which later her
  grandson, the Kaiser, was to unveil.</p>

  <p>He went on into Whitehall&mdash;there was no Admiralty Arch in those days,
  and one came out of the Mall by way of Spring Gardens round the corner of an
  obtrusive bank. Oswald paused for a minute to survey the squat buildings and
  high column of Trafalgar Square, pale amber in the October sunshine, and then
  strolled down towards Westminster. He became more and more consciously the
  loitering home-comer. He smiled at the mounted soldiers in their boxes
  outside the Horse Guards, paused at and approved of the architectural
  intentions of the new War Office, and nodded to his old friends, the
  Admiralty and the Colonial Office. Here they brewed the destinies of the Old
  World outside Europe and kept the Seven Seas. He played his part with
  increased self-approval. He made his way to Westminster Bridge and spent some
  time surveying the down river prospect. It was, after all, a little ditch of
  a river. St. Paul's was fairly visible, and the red, rusty shed of Charing
  Cross station and its brutal iron bridge, fit monument of the clumsy looting
  by "private enterprise" that characterized the Victorian age, had never
  looked uglier.</p>

  <p>He crossed from one side of the bridge to the other, leant over the
  parapet and regarded the Houses of Parliament. The flag was flying, and a
  number of little groups of silk-hatted men and gaily dressed ladies were
  having tea on the terrace.</p>

  <p>"I wonder why we rule our Empire from a sham Gothic building," thought
  Oswald. "If anything, it ought to be Roman...."</p>

  <p>He turned his attention to the traffic and the passers-by. "They don't
  realize," he said. "Suppose suddenly they were to have a mirage here of some
  of the lands and cities this old Parliament House controls?"</p>

  <p>A little stout man driving a pony-trap caught his attention. It was a
  smart new pony-trap, and there was a look of new clothes about its driver; he
  smoked a cigar that stuck upward from the corner of his mouth, and in his
  button-hole was a red chrysanthemum; his whole bearing suggested absolute
  contentment with himself and acquiescence in the universe; he handled his
  reins and drew his whip across the flanks of his shining cob as delicately as
  if he was fly-fishing. "What does he think he is up to?" asked Oswald. A
  thousand times he had seen that Sphinx of perfect self-contentment on passing
  negro faces.</p>

  <p>"The Empire doesn't worry him," said Oswald.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">It was worrying Oswald a lot. Everything was worrying Oswald
  just then. It is a subtle question to answer of such cases whether the
  physical depression shapes the despondent thought, or whether the gnawing
  doubt prepares the nervous illness. His confidence in his work and the system
  to which he belonged had vanished by imperceptible degrees.</p>

  <p>For some years he had gone about his work with very few doubts. He had
  been too busy. But now ill-health had conspired with external circumstances
  to expose him to questionings about things he had never questioned before.
  They were very fundamental doubts. They cut at the roots of his life. He was
  beginning to doubt whether the Empire was indeed as good a thing and as great
  a thing as he had assumed it to be.... The Empire to which his life had been
  given.</p>

  <p>This did not make him any less an Imperialist than he had been, but it
  sharpened his imperialism with a sense of urgency that cut into his mind.</p>

  <p>Altogether Oswald had now given nearly eighteen years to East and Central
  Africa. His illness had called a halt in a very busy life. For two years and
  more after his last visit to England, he had been occupied chiefly in
  operations in and beyond the Lango country against Kabarega and the remnant
  of the rebel Sudanese. He had assisted in the rounding-up of King Mwanga, the
  rebel king of Uganda, and in setting up the child king and the regency that
  replaced him. At the end of 1899 his former chief, Sir Harry Johnston, had
  come up from British Central Africa as Special Commissioner to Uganda, and
  the work of land settlement, of provincial organization, of railways and
  postal development had gone on apace. Next year indeed war had come again,
  but it was the last war in this part of the world for some time. It was
  caused by the obstinate disposition of the Nandi people to steal the copper
  wire from the telegraph poles that had been set up in their country. Hitherto
  their chief use for copper wire had been to make bracelets and anklets for
  their married women. They were shocked by this endless stretching out of
  attenuated feminine adornment. They did their best to restore it to what they
  considered was its proper use. It was a homely misunderstanding rather than a
  war. Oswald had led that expedition to a successful explanation. Thereafter
  the leading fact in the history of Uganda until the sleeping sickness came
  had been the construction of the railway from the coast to Lake Victoria
  Nyanza.</p>

  <p>In Uganda as in Nyasaland Oswald Sydenham had found himself part of a
  rapid and busy process of tidying up the world. For some years it had carried
  him along and determined all his views.</p>

  <p>The tidying-up of Africa during the closing years of the nineteenth
  century was indeed one of the most rapid and effective tidyings up in
  history. In the late 'eighties the whole of Africa from the frontiers of
  lower Egypt down to Rhodesia had been a world of chaotic adventure and
  misery; a black world of insecure barbarism invaded by the rifle, and the
  Arab and European adventurers who brought it. There had been no such thing as
  a school from Nubia to Rhodesia, and everywhere there had been constant
  aimless bloodshed. Long ages of conflict, arbitrary cruelty and instinctive
  fierceness seemed to have reached a culmination of destructive disorder. The
  increasing light that fell on Africa did but illuminate a scene of collapse.
  The new forces that were coming into the country appeared at first as
  hopelessly blind and cruel as the old; the only difference was that they were
  better armed. The Arab was frankly a slaver, European enterprise was deeply
  interested in forced labour. The first-fruits of Christianity had been civil
  war, and one of Oswald's earliest experiences of Uganda had been the attack
  of Mwanga and his Roman Catholic adherents upon the Anglicans in Mengo, who
  held out in Lugard's little fort and ultimately established the soundness of
  the Elizabethan compromise by means of a Maxim gun It was never a confident
  outlook for many years anywhere between the Zambesi and the Nile cataracts.
  Probably no honest man ever worked in west and central Africa between 1880
  and 1900 who escaped altogether from phases of absolute despair; who did not
  face with a sinking heart, lust, hatred, cunning and treachery, black
  intolerance and ruthless aggression. And behind all the perversities of man
  worked the wickedness of tropical Nature, uncertain in her moods, frightful
  in her storms, fruitful of strange troubles through weed and parasite, insect
  and pestilence. Yet civilization had in the long run won an astonishing
  victory. In a score of years, so endless then, so brief in retrospect, roads
  that had been decaying tracks or non-existent were made safe and open
  everywhere, the railway and the post and telegraph came to stay, vast regions
  of Africa which since the beginning of things had known no rule but the whim
  and arbitrary power of transitory chiefs and kings, awoke to the conception
  of impartial law; war canoes vanished from the lakes and robber tribes learnt
  to tend their own cattle and cultivate their gardens. And now there were
  schools. There were hospitals. Perhaps a quarter of a million young people in
  Uganda alone could read and write; the percentage of literacy in Uganda was
  rapidly overtaking that in India and Russia.</p>

  <p>On the face of it this was enough to set one thinking of the whole world
  as if it were sweeping forward to universal civilization and happiness. For
  some years that had been Oswald's habit of mind. It had been his sustaining
  faith. He had gone from task to task until this last attack of black-water
  fever had arrested his activities. And then these doubts displayed
  themselves.</p>

  <p>From South Africa, that land of destiny for western civilization, had come
  the first germ of his doubting. Sir Harry Johnston, Oswald's chief, a frank
  and bitter critic of the New Imperialism that had thrust up from the Cape to
  Nyasaland under the leadership of Cecil Rhodes, helped to shape and point his
  scepticism. The older tradition of the Empire was one of administration
  regardless of profit, Johnston declared; the new seemed inspired by
  conceptions of violent and hasty gain. The Rhodes example had set all Africa
  dancing to the tune of crude exploitation. It had fired the competitive greed
  of the King of the Belgians and unleashed blood and torture in the Congo Free
  State. The Congo State had begun as a noble experiment, a real attempt at
  international compromise; it had been given over to an unworthy trustee and
  wrecked hideously by his ruthless profit-hunting. All over the Empire, honest
  administrators and colonial politicians, friendly explorers and the
  missionaries of civilization, were becoming more and more acutely aware of a
  heavy acquisitive thrust behind the New Imperialism. Usually they felt it
  first in the treatment of the natives. The earlier ill-treatment of the
  native came from the local trader, the local planter, the white rough; now as
  that sort of thing was got in hand and men could begin to hope for a new and
  better order, came extensive schemes from Europe for the wholesale detachment
  of the native from his land, for the wholesale working and sweating of the
  native population....</p>

  <p>Had we defeated the little robbers only to clear the way for organized
  imperial robbery?</p>

  <p>Such things were already troubling Oswald's mind before the shock of the
  South African war. But before the war they amounted to criticisms of this
  administration or that, they were still untouched by any doubts of the
  general Imperial purpose or of the Empire as a whole. The South African war
  laid bare an amazing and terrifying amount of national incompetence. The
  Empire was not only hustled into a war for which there was no occasion, but
  that war was planned with a lack of intelligent foresight and conducted with
  a lack of soundness that dismayed every thoughtful Englishman. After a
  monstrous wasteful struggle the national resources dragged it at last to a
  not very decisive victory. The outstanding fact became evident that the
  British army tradition was far gone in decay, that the army was feebly
  organized and equipped, and that a large proportion of its officers were
  under-educated men, narrow and conventional, inferior in imagination and
  initiative to the farmers, lawyers, cattle-drovers, and suchlike leaders
  against whom their wits were pitted. Behind the rejoicings that hailed the
  belated peace was a real and unprecedented national humiliation. For the
  first time the educated British were enquiring whether all was well with the
  national system if so small a conquest seemed so great a task. Upon minds
  thus sensitized came the realization of an ever more vigorous and ever more
  successful industrial and trade competition from Germany and the United
  States; Great Britain was losing her metallurgical ascendancy, dropping far
  behind in the chemical industries and no longer supreme upon the seas. For
  the first time a threat was apparent in the methods of Germany. Germany was
  launching liner after liner to challenge the British mercantile ascendancy,
  and she was increasing her navy with a passionate vigour. What did it mean?
  All over the world the British were discovering the German. And the German,
  it seemed, had got this New Imperialism that was in the British mind in a
  still harsher, still less scrupulous and still more vulgar form. "Wake up,
  England," said the Prince of Wales returning from a visit to Canada, and
  Oswald heard the phrase reverberating in Uganda and talked about it and
  thought it over continually.</p>

  <p>(And Lord Rosebery spoke of "efficiency.") But now when Oswald sought in
  the newspapers for signs of this waking up that he desired, he found instead
  this tremendous reiteration of the ideas of the New Imperialism, acquisitive,
  mercenary, and altogether selfish and national, which he already so
  profoundly disliked. The awakening he desired was an awakening of the spirit,
  an awakening to broader ideas and nobler conceptions of the nation's role in
  the world's affairs. He had hoped to find men talking of great schemes of
  national education, of new schools of ethnology, of tropical botany and
  oriental languages that would put the Imperial adventure on a broad basis of
  understanding and competent direction. Instead, he found England full of wild
  talk about "taxing the foreigner." A hasty search for national profit he
  refused to recognize as an awakening. For him indeed it had far more of the
  quality of a nightmare.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">It is remarkable how much our deeper convictions are at the
  mercy of physiological jolts.</p>

  <p>Before the renewed attacks of fever had lowered his vitality, Oswald had
  felt doubtful of this and that, but he had never doubted of the ultimate
  human triumph; he had never even doubted that the great Empire he served
  would survive, achieve its mission triumphantly, and incorporate itself in
  some way with a unified mankind. He himself might blunder or fail, there
  might be all sorts of set-backs, but in the end what he called Anglo-Saxonism
  would prevail, the tradition of justice and free speech would be justified by
  victory, and the darkest phase of the Martyrdom of Man end. But now the fever
  had so wrought on his nerves and tissues that he no longer enjoyed this
  ultimate confidence. He could think that anything might fail. He could even
  doubt the stability of the Victorian world.</p>

  <p>One night during this last illness that had brought him home he fell
  thinking of Zimbabwe and the lost cities of Africa, and then presently of the
  dead cities of Yucatan, and then of all the lost and vanished civilizations
  of the world, of the long succession of human failures to secure any abiding
  order and security. With this he mingled the suggestion of a recent
  anthropological essay he had read. Two races of men with big brains and
  subtle minds, the Neanderthal race and the Cro-Magnon race, it was argued
  very convincingly, had been entirely exterminated before the beginnings of
  our present humanity. Our own race too might fail and perish and pass away.
  In the night with a mounting temperature these were very grisly and horrible
  thoughts indeed. And when at last he passed from such weary and dismal
  speculations to sleep, there came a dream to crown and perpetuate his mood, a
  dream that was to return again and again.</p>

  <p>It was one of those dreams that will sometimes give a nightmare reality of
  form and shape to the merest implications of the waking life, one of those
  dreams that run before and anticipate and perhaps direct one's daylight
  decisions. That black artist of delirium who throws his dark creations upon
  our quivering mental screens, had seized and utilized all Oswald's
  germinating misgivings and added queer suggestions of his own. Through a
  thousand irrelevant and transitory horrors one persistent idea ran through
  Oswald's distresses. It was the idea of a dark forest. And of an endless
  effort to escape from it. He was one of the captains of a vaguely conceived
  expedition that was lost in an interminable wilderness of shadows; sometimes
  it was an expedition of limitless millions, and the black trees and creepers
  about him went up as high as the sky, and sometimes he alone seemed to be the
  entire expedition, and the darkness rested on his eyes, and the thorns
  wounded him, and the great ropes of the creepers slashed his face. He was
  always struggling to get through this forest to some unknown hope, to some
  place where there was light, where there was air and freedom, where one could
  look with brotherly security upon the stars; and this forest which was Life,
  held him back; it held him with its darkness, it snared him with slime and
  marshy pitfalls, it entangled him amidst pools and channels of black and
  blood-red stinking water, it tripped him and bound him with its creepers;
  evil beasts snared his followers, great serpents put them to flight,
  inexplicable panics and madnesses threw the long straggling columns into
  internecine warfare, incredible imbecilities threatened the welfare of the
  entire expedition. He would find himself examining the loads of an endless
  string of porters, and this man had flung away bread and loaded his pack with
  poisonous fungi, and that one had replaced ammunition by rust and rubbish and
  filth. He would find himself in frantic remonstrance with porters who had
  flung aside their loads, who were sullenly preparing to desert; or again, the
  whole multitude would be stricken with some strange disease with the most
  foul and horrible symptoms, and refuse the doubtful medicines he tendered in
  his despair; or the ground would suddenly breed an innumerable multitude of
  white thin voracious leeches that turned red-black as they fed....</p>

  <p>Then far off through the straight bars of the tree stems a light shone,
  and a great hope sprang up in him. And then the light became red, a wavering
  red, a sudden hot breeze brought a sound of crackling wood and the soughing
  of falling trees, spires and flags and agonized phantoms of flame rushed up
  to the zenith; through the undergrowth a thousand black beasts stampeded, the
  air was thick with wild flights of moths and humming-birds, and he realized
  that the forest had caught fire....</p>

  <p>That forest fire was always a climax. With it came a burning sensation in
  loins and back. It made him shout and struggle and fight amidst the black
  fugitives and the black thickets. Until the twigs and leaves about him were
  bursting into flames like a Christmas tree that is being lit up. He would
  awaken in a sweating agony.</p>

  <p>Then presently he would be back again in the midst of that vague
  innumerable expedition in the steamy deep grey aisles of the forest, under
  the same gathering sense of urgent necessity, amidst the same inextricable
  thickening tangle of' confusions and cross-purposes.</p>

  <p>In his waking moments Oswald, if he could, would have dismissed that dream
  altogether from his mind. He could argue that it was the creation of some
  purely pathological despondency, that it had no resemblance, no parallelism,
  no sort of relation to reality. Yet something of its dark hues was reflected
  in his waking thoughts. Sometimes this reflection was so faint as to be
  scarcely perceptible, but always it was there.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">The Plantain, to which Oswald drifted back to dine, was a
  club gathered from the ends of the earth and very proud of the fact; it was
  made up of explorers, travellers, colonial officials, K.C.M.G.'s and
  C.M.G.'s. It was understood to be a great exchange of imperial ideas, and
  except for a group or so of members who lived in and about London, it had no
  conversation because, living for the most part at different ends of the
  earth, its members did not get to know each other very well. Occasionally
  there was sporting gossip. Shy, sunburnt men drifted in at intervals of three
  or four years, and dined and departed. Once a member with a sunstroke from
  India gave way to religious mania, and tried to preach theosophy from the
  great staircase to three lonely gentlemen who were reading the telegrams in
  the hall. He was removed with difficulty. The great red-papered,
  white-painted silences of the club are copiously adorned with rather old
  yellow maps of remote regions, and in the hall big terrestrial and celestial
  globes are available for any members who wish to refresh their minds upon the
  broad facts of our position in space. But the great glory of the club is its
  wealth of ethnological and sporting trophies. Scarcely is there a variety of
  spear, stabbing or disembowelling knife, blowing tube, bow, crossbow, or
  matchlock, that is not at the disposal of any member nimble enough to pluck
  it from the wall. In addition there is a vast collection of the heads of
  beasts; everywhere they project from walls and pillars; heads of bison,
  gazelles and wart-hogs cheer the souls of the members even in the humblest
  recesses. In the dining-room, above each table, a hippopotamus or a
  rhinoceros or a tiger or a lion glares out with glassy eyes upon the world,
  showing every item in its dentition. Below these monsters sits an occasional
  empire-builder, in the careful evening dress of the occasional visitant to
  civilization, seeming by contrast a very pallid, little, nicely behaved thing
  indeed.</p>

  <p>To the Plantain came Oswald, proposing to dine alone, and in this
  dining-room he discovered Slingsby Darton, the fiscal expert, a little
  Cockney with scarcely any nose at all, sitting with the utmost impudence
  under the largest moose. Oswald was so pleased to discover any one he knew
  that he only remembered that he detested Slingsby Darton as he prepared to
  sit down with him. There was nothing for it then but to make the best of
  him.</p>

  <p>Oswald chose his dinner and his wine with care. Bed wines were forbidden
  him, but the wine waiter had good authority, authority from India and
  gastrically very sensitive, for the Moselle he recommended. And in answer to
  Slingsby Darton's enquiries, Oswald spread out his theory that he was an
  amiable, pleased sort of person obliged to come home from Uganda, sorry to
  leave Uganda, but glad to be back in the dear old country and "at the centre
  of things," and ready to take up anything</p>

  <p>"Politics?" said Slingsby Darton. "We want a few voices that have got out
  of sight of the parish pump."</p>

  <p>Politics&mdash;well, it might be. But it was a little hard to join on to
  things at first. "Fearful lot of squabbling&mdash;not very much doing. Not
  nearly as much as one had hoped."</p>

  <p>That seemed a restrained, reasonable sort of thing to say. Nor was it
  extravagant to throw out, "I thought it was 'Wake up, England'; but she seems
  just to be talking in her sleep."</p>

  <p>Out flares the New Imperialism at once in Oswald's face. "But have you
  read Chamberlain's great speeches?" Slingsby Darton protests.</p>

  <p>"I had those in mind," said Oswald grimly.</p>

  <p>Both gentlemen were in the early phase of encounter. It was not yet time
  to join issue. Slingsby Darton heard, but made no retort. Oswald was free to
  develop his discontents.</p>

  <p>Nothing seemed to be getting done, he complained. The army had been proved
  inefficient, incapable even of a colonial war, but what were we doing?</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Slingsby Darton. "You dare not even whisper
  'conscription.'"</p>

  <p>Oswald had not been thinking of that but of a technical reorganization,
  more science, more equipment. But all that he could see in the way of a
  change were "these beastly new caps." (Those were the days of the hated
  'Brodrick.') Then economic reorganization hung fire. "Unemployed" processions
  grew bigger every winter. ("Tariff," whispered Darton. "Intelligent
  organization," said Oswald.) Then education&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Education," said Oswald, "is at the heart of the whole business."</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't say that altogether," said Slingsby Darton.</p>

  <p>"At the heart of the whole business," Oswald repeated as though Slingsby
  Darton had not spoken. "The people do not know. Our people do not
  understand." The Boer war had shown how horribly backward our education
  was&mdash;our higher education, our scientific and technical education, the
  education of our officials and generals in particular. "We have an empire as
  big as the world and an imagination as small as a parish." But it would be a
  troublesome job to change that. Much too troublesome. Oswald became bitter
  and accusatory. His living side sneered. It would bother a lot of Balfour's
  friends quite uncomfortably. The dear old Church couldn't keep its grip on an
  education of that sort, and of course the dear old Church must have its grip
  on education. So after a few large-minded flourishes, the politicians had
  swamped the whole question of educational reform in this row about church
  schools and the Passive Resistance movement, both sides only too glad to get
  away from reality. Oswald was as bitter against the Passive Resister as he
  was against the Church.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether I should give quite the primary place to education,"
  said Slingsby Darton, battling against this tirade. "I don't know whether I
  should quite say that. Mr. Chamberlain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The fat, as the vulgar say, was in the fire.</p>

  <p>October, 1903, was a feverish and impassioned time in English affairs.
  From Birmingham that month the storm had burst. With a great splash Mr.
  Joseph Chamberlain had flung the issue of Protection into the sea of
  political affairs; huge waves of disturbance were sweeping out to the
  uttermost boundaries of the empire. Instead of paying taxes we were to "tax
  the foreigner." To that our fine imperial dream had come. Over dinner-tables,
  in trains and smoking-rooms, men were quarrelling with their oldest friends.
  To Oswald the conversion of Imperialism into a scheme for world exploitation
  in the interests of Birmingham seemed the most atrocious swamping of real
  issues by private interests that it was possible to conceive. The Sydenham
  strain was an uncommercial strain. Slingsby Darton was manifestly in the full
  swirl of the new movement, the man looked cunning and eager, he put his pert
  little face on one side and raised his voice to argue. A gathering
  quarrelsomeness took possession of Oswald. He began to speak very rapidly and
  pungently. He assumed an exasperating and unjustifiable detachment in order
  to quarrel better. He came into these things from the outside, he declared,
  quite unbiased, oh! quite unbiased. And this "nail-trust organizer's
  campaign" shocked him&mdash;shocked him unspeakably. Here was England
  confessedly in a phase of inefficiency and deterioration, needing a careful
  all-round effort, in education, in business organization, in military
  preparation. And suddenly drowning everything else in his noise came "this
  demagogue ironmonger with his panacea!"</p>

  <p>Slingsby Darton was indignant. "My dear Sir! I cannot hear you speak of
  Mr. Chamberlain in such terms as that!"</p>

  <p>"But consider the situation," said Oswald. "Consider the situation! When
  of all things we want steady and harmonious constructive work, comes all the
  uproar, all the cheap, mean thinking and dishonest spouting, the music-hall
  tricks and poster arguments, of a Campaign."</p>

  <p>Slingsby Darton argued. "But, my dear Sir, it is a constructive campaign!
  It is based on urgent economic needs."</p>

  <p>Oswald would have none of that. Tariff Reform was a quack remedy. "A
  <i>Zollverein</i>. Think of it! With an empire in great detached patches all
  over the world. Each patch with different characteristics and different
  needs. A child could see that a <i>Zollverein</i> is absurd. A child could
  see it. Yet to read the speeches of Chamberlain you'd think a tariff could
  work geographical miracles and turn the empire into a compact continent,
  locked fast against the foreigner. How can a scattered host become a band of
  robbers? The mere attempt takes us straight towards disaster."</p>

  <p>"Straight away from it!" Slingsby Darton contradicted.</p>

  <p>Oswald went on regardlessly. "An empire&mdash;scattered like
  ours&mdash;run on selfish and exclusive lines must bring us into conflict
  with every other people under the sun," he asserted. "It must do. Apart from
  the utter and wanton unrighteousness, apart from the treason to humanity. Oh!
  I hate this New Imperialism. I hate it and dread it. It spoils my sleep at
  nights, it worries me and worries me...."</p>

  <p>Slingsby Darton thought he would do better to worry about this free trade
  of ours which was bleeding us to death.</p>

  <p>"I do not speak as one ignorant of the empire," said Oswald. "I have been
  watching it&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Slingsby Darton, disregarded, maintained that he, too, had been
  watching.</p>

  <p>But Oswald was now at the "I tell you, Sir," stage.</p>

  <p>He declared that the New Imperialism came from Germany. It was invented by
  professors of <i>Weltpolitik</i>. Milner had grafted it upon us at Balliol.
  But German conditions were altogether different from ours, Germany was a
  geographical unity, all drawn together, unified by natural necessity, like a
  fist. Germany was indeed a fist&mdash;by geographical necessity. The British
  empire was like an open hand. Must be like an open hand. We were an open
  people&mdash;or we were nothing. We were a liberalizing power or we were the
  most pretentious sham in history. But we seemed to be forgetting that liberal
  idea for which we stood. We swaggered now like owners, forgetting that we
  were only trustees. Trustees for mankind. We were becoming a boastful and a
  sprawling people. The idea of grabbing half the world&mdash;and then shutting
  other peoples out with tariffs, was&mdash;Oswald was losing
  self-control&mdash;"a shoving tradesman's dream." And we were doing
  it&mdash;as one might expect "a trust-organizing-nail-maker"&mdash;phrase
  rubbed in with needless emphasis&mdash;to do it. "We were shoving about,
  treading on everybody's toes&mdash;and failing to educate, failing to arm
  Yes&mdash;shoving. It was a good word. He did not mind how many times he used
  it. "This dream of defying the world without an army, and dominating it
  without education!" The Germans were at least logical in their swagger. If
  they shoved about they also armed. And they educated. Anyhow they trained.
  But we trod on everybody's toes and tried to keep friends all round....</p>

  <p>So Oswald&mdash;under the moose&mdash;while Slingsby Darton did what he
  could by stabbing an objection at him now and again. It became clearer and
  clearer to Slingsby Darton that the only possibility before him of holding
  his own, short of throwing knives and glasses at Oswald, was to capture the
  offensive.</p>

  <p>"You complain of a panacea," he said, poking out two arresting fingers at
  Oswald. "That Tariff Reform is a panacea. But what of education? What of this
  education of yours? That also is a panacea."</p>

  <p>And just then apt to his aid came "Walsall and the Bishop of Pinner from
  their table under the big, black, clerical-looking hippopotamus. Walsall was
  a naturalist, and had met Oswald in the days of his biological enthusiasm;
  the Bishop of Pinner had formerly been the Bishop of Tanganyika and knew
  Oswald by repute. So they came over to greet him and were at once seized upon
  as auxiliaries by Slingsby Darton.</p>

  <p>"We're getting heated over politics," said Slingsby Darton, indicating
  that at least Oswald was.</p>

  <p>"Every one is getting heated over politics," said the bishop. "It's as bad
  as the Home Rule split."</p>

  <p>"Sydenham's panacea is to save the world by education. He won't hear of
  economic organization."</p>

  <p>The bishop opened eyes and mouth at Oswald until he looked like the full
  moon....</p>

  <p>On that assertion of Slingsby Darton's they drifted past the paying-desk
  to the small smoking-room, and there they had a great dispute about education
  beneath a gallery audience, so to speak, composed of antelope, Barbary sheep,
  gnu, yaks, and a sea lion. Oswald had never realized before how passionately
  he believed in education. It was a revelation. He discovered himself. He
  wanted to tell these men they were uneducated. He did succeed in saying that
  Mr. Chamberlain was "essentially an uneducated man."</p>

  <p>Walsall was a very trying opponent for a disputant of swift and passionate
  convictions. He had a judicial affectation, a Socratic pose. He was a grey,
  fluffy-headed man with large tortoiseshell spectacles and a general
  resemblance to a kind wise owl. He liked to waggle his head slowly from side
  to side and smile. He liked to begin sentences with "But have you thought?"
  or "I think you have overlooked " or "So far from believing that, I hold the
  exact converse." He said these things in a very suave voice as though each
  remark was carefully dressed in oil before serving.</p>

  <p>He expressed grave doubts whether there was "any benefit in
  education&mdash;any benefit whatever."</p>

  <p>But the argument that formed that evening's entertainment for the sea lion
  and those assorted ruminating artio-dactyls was too prolonged and heated and
  discursive to interest any but the most sedulous reader. Every possible sort
  of heresy about education seemed loose that night for the affliction of
  Oswald. Slingsby Darton said, "Make men prosperous and education will come of
  its own accord." Walsall thought that the sort of people who benefited by
  education "would get on anyhow." He thought knowledge was of value according
  to the difficulty one experienced in attaining it. (Could any sane man really
  believe that?) "I would persecute science," said Walsall, "and then it would
  be taken care of by enthusiasts."</p>

  <p>"But do you know," said Oswald, with an immense quiet in his manner, "that
  there is a&mdash;a British Empire? An empire with rather urgent needs?"</p>

  <p>(Suppressed murmur from Slingsby Darton: "Then I don't see what your
  position is at all!")</p>

  <p>Walsall disputed these "needs. "Weren't we all too much disposed to make
  the empire a thing of plan and will? An empire was a growth. It was like a
  man, it grew without taking thought. Presently it aged and decayed. We were
  not going to save the empire by taking thought.</p>

  <p>(Slingsby Darton, disregarded, now disagreeing with Walsall.)</p>

  <p>"Germany takes thought," Oswald interjected.</p>

  <p>"To its own undoing, perhaps," said Walsall....</p>

  <p>The bishop's method of annoyance was even blander than Walsall's, and more
  exasperating to the fevered victim. He talked of the evils of an "educated
  proletariat." For a stable community only a certain proportion of educated
  people was advisable. You could upset the social balance by over-educating
  the masses. "We destroy good, honest, simple-souled workers in order to make
  discontented clerks." Oswald spluttered, "You must make a citizen in a modern
  population understand something of the State he belongs to!"</p>

  <p>"Better, Faith," said the bishop. "Far better, Faith. Teach them a simple
  Catechism."</p>

  <p>He had visited Russia. He had been to the coronation of the Tzar, a
  beautiful ceremony, only a little marred by a quite accidental massacre of
  some of the spectators. Those were the days before the Russo-Japanese war and
  the coming of the Duma. There was much to admire in Russia, the good bishop
  declared; much to learn. Russia was the land of Mary, great-souled and
  blessed; ours alas! was the land of bustling Martha. Nothing more enviable
  than the political solidarity of Russia&mdash;"after our warring voices....
  Time after time I asked myself, 'Aren't we Westerns on the wrong track?' Here
  is something&mdash;Great. And growing greater. Something simple. Here is
  obedience and a sort of primitive contentment. Trust in the Little White
  Father, belief in God. Here Christianity lives indeed."</p>

  <p>About eleven o'clock Walsall was propounding a paradox. "All this talk of
  education," he said, "reminds me of the man who tried to lift himself by his
  own ears. How, I ask myself, can a democracy such as ours take an intelligent
  interest in its destiny unless it is educated, and how can it educate itself
  unless it takes an intelligent interest in its destiny? How escape that
  dilemma?"</p>

  <p>"A community," said Oswald, grappling with this after a moment, "a
  community isn't one mind, it's a number of minds, some more intelligent, some
  less. It's a perpetual flow of new minds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then something gave way within him.</p>

  <p>"We sit here," he said in a voice so full of fury that the mouth of the
  bishop fell open, "and while we talk this halfwitted, half-clever muck to
  excuse ourselves from getting the nation into order, the sands run out of the
  glass. The time draws near when the empire will be challenged&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stood up abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea," he said, "what the empire might be? Have you thought
  of these hundreds of millions to whom we might give light&mdash;had we light?
  Are we to be a possessing and profit-hunting people because we have not the
  education to be a leaderly people? Are we to do no better than Rome and
  Carthage&mdash;and loot the provinces of the world? Loot or education, that
  is the choice of every imperial opportunity. All England, I find, is echoing
  with screams for loot. Have none of us vision? None?"</p>

  <p>The bishop shook his head sadly. The man, he thought, was raving.</p>

  <p>"What is this vision of yours?" sneered Walsall. "Ten thousand
  professors?"</p>

  <p>"After all," said Slingsby Darton with a weary insidiousness, "we do not
  differ about our fundamental idea. You must have funds. You must endow your
  schools. Without Tariff Reform to give you revenue&mdash;</p>

  <p>But Oswald was not going to begin over again.</p>

  <p>"I ought to be in bed," he said, looking at his watch. "My doctor sends me
  to bed at ten...."</p>

  <p>"My God!" he whispered as he put on his coat under the benevolent
  supervision of an exceptionally fine Indian buffalo.</p>

  <p>"What is to happen to the empire," he cried, going out into the night and
  addressing himself to the moon, to the monument which commemorates the heroic
  incompetence of the Duke of York, and to an interested hansom cabby, "what is
  to happen to the empire&mdash;when these are its educated opinions?"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">But it is high time that Joan and Peter came back into this
  narrative. For this is their story, it bears their names on its covers and on
  its back and on its title-page and at the head of each left-hand page. It has
  been necessary to show the state of mind, the mental condition, the outlook,
  of their sole guardian when their affairs came into his hands. This done they
  now return by telephone. Oswald had not been back in the comfortable
  sitting-room at the Climax Club for ten minutes before he was rung up by Mr.
  Sycamore and reminded of his duty to his young charges. A club page called
  Mr. Sydenham to the receiver in his bedroom.</p>

  <p>In those days the telephone was still far from perfection. It had not been
  in general use for a decade.... Mr. Sycamore was audible as a still small
  voice.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sydenham? Sycamore speaking,"</p>

  <p>"No need to be," said Oswald. "You haven't been speaking to me."</p>

  <p>"Who am I speaking to? I want Mr. Sydenham. Sycamore speaking."</p>

  <p>"I'm Mr. Sydenham. Who are you? No need to be sick of your speaking so far
  as I'm concerned. I've only just been called to the telephone&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your solicitor, Sycamore. S.Y.C.A.M.O.R.E."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Eight O. How are you, Mr. Sycamore? I'm Sydenham. How are those
  children?"</p>

  <p>"Hope you're well, Mr. Sydenham?"</p>

  <p>"Gaudy&mdash;in a way. How are you?"</p>

  <p>"I've been with Lady Charlotte today. I don't know if you've heard
  anything of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Whop! Whop. Bunnik. <i>Silence</i>.</p>

  <p>After a little difficulty communication with Mr. Sycamore was partially
  restored. I say partially because his voice had now become very small and
  remote indeed. "I was saying, I don't know if you understand anything of the
  present state of affairs."</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Oswald. "Fire ahead."</p>

  <p>"Can you hear me distinctly? I find you almost inaudible."</p>

  <p>Remonstrances with the exchange led after a time to slightly improved
  communications.</p>

  <p>"You were saying something about a fire?" said Mr. Sycamore.</p>

  <p>"I said nothing about a fire. You were saying something about the
  children?"</p>

  <p>"Well, well. Things are in a very confused state, Mr. Sydenham. I hope you
  mean to take hold of their education. These children are not being educated,
  they are being fought over."</p>

  <p>"Who's thinking over them?"</p>

  <p>"No one. But the Misses Stubland and Lady Charlotte are fighting over
  them&mdash;F.I.G.H.T.I.N.G. I want you to think over them....
  You&mdash;yes.... Think, yes. Both clever children. Great waste if they are
  not properly educated.... Matters are really urgent. I have been with Lady
  Charlotte today. You know she kidnapped them?"</p>

  <p>"Kidnapped?"</p>

  <p>A bright girlish voice, an essentially happy voice, cut into the
  conversation at this point. "Three minutes up," it said.</p>

  <p>Empire-building language fell from Oswald. In some obscure way this
  feminine intervention was swept aside, and talk was resumed with Mr.
  Sycamore.</p>

  <p>It continued to be a fragmentary talk, and for a time the burthen of some
  unknown lady complaining to an unknown friend about the behaviour of a third
  unknown named George, stated to lack "gumption," interwove with the main
  theme. But Mr. Sycamore did succeed in conveying to Oswald a sense of urgency
  about the welfare of his two charges. Immediate attention was demanded. They
  were being neglected. The girl was ill. "I would like to talk it over with
  you as soon as possible," said Mr. Sycamore.</p>

  <p>"Can you come and breakfast here at eight?" said the man from the
  tropics.</p>

  <p>"Half past nine," said the Londoner, and the talk closed.</p>

  <p>The talk ended, but for a time the bell of Oswald's telephone remained in
  an agitated state, giving little nervous rings at intervals. When he answered
  these the exchange said "Number please," and when he said, "You rang me," the
  exchange said, "Oh, no! we didn't...."</p>

  <p>"An empire," whispered Oswald, sitting on the edge of his bed, "which
  cannot even run a telephone service efficiently...."</p>

  <p>"Education.</p>

  <p>He tried to recall his last speech at the club. Had he ranted? What had
  they thought of it? What precisely had he said? While they sat and talked
  muck&mdash;his memory was unpleasantly insistent upon that "muck"&mdash;the
  sands ran out of the hour-glass, a new generation grew up.</p>

  <p>Had he said that? That was the point of it all&mdash;about the new
  generation. A new generation was growing up and we were doing nothing to make
  it wiser, more efficient, to give it a broader outlook than the generation
  that had blundered into and blundered through the Boer war. Had he said that?
  That was what he ought to have said.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">For a long time he sat on his bed, blank-minded and too
  tired to finish undressing. He got to bed at last. But not to sleep. He found
  that the talk in the club had disturbed his mind almost unendurably. It had
  pointed and endorsed everything that he had been trying not to think about
  the old country. Now, too weary and too excited to sleep, he turned over and
  over again, unprofitably and unprogressively, the tangled impressions of his
  return to England.</p>

  <p>How many millions of such hours of restless questioning must have been
  spent by wakeful Englishmen in the dozen years between the Boer war and the
  Great war; how many nocturnally scheming brains must have explored the
  complicated maze of national dangers, national ambitions, and national
  ineptitude! If "Wake up, England," sowed no great harvest of change in the
  daylight, it did at any rate produce large phantom crops at night. He argued
  with Walsall over and over again, sometimes wide awake and close to the
  point, sometimes drowsily with the discussion becoming vague and strangely
  misshapen and incoherent. Was Walsall right? Was it impossible to change the
  nature and quality of a people? Must we English always be laggards in peace
  and blunderers in war? Were our achievements accidents, and our failures
  essential? Was slackness in our blood? Surely a great effort might accomplish
  much, a great effort to reorganize political life, to improve national
  education, to make the press a better instrument of public thought and
  criticism. To which Walsall answered again with, "How can a democratic
  community take an intelligent interest in its destinies unless it is
  educated, and how can it educate itself unless it takes an intelligent
  interest in its destinies?"</p>

  <p>Oswald groaned and turned over in bed.</p>

  <p>Thought passed by insensible degrees into dreaming and dreaming shallowed
  again to wakefulness. Always he seemed to be arguing with Walsall and the
  bishop for education and effort; nevertheless, now vaguely apprehended as an
  atmospheric background, now real and close, the black forest of his African
  nightmare was about him. Always he was struggling on and always he was hoping
  to see down some vista the warm gleam of daylight, the promise of the open.
  And Walsall, a vast forest owl with enormous spectacles, kept getting in the
  way, flapping hands that were really great wings at him and assuring him that
  there was no way out. None. "This forest is life. This forest will always be
  life. There is no other life. After all it isn't such a very bad forest."
  Other figures, too, came and went; a gigantic bishop sitting back in an easy
  chair blocked one hopeful vista, declaring that book-learning only made the
  lower classes discontented and mischievous, and then a stupidly contented fat
  man smoking a fat cigar drove in a gig athwart the line of march. He said
  nothing; he just drove his gig. Then somehow an automobile came in, a most
  hopeful means of escape, except that it had broken down; and Oswald was
  trying to repair it in spite of the jeering of an elderly gentleman in a
  white waistcoat. Suddenly the whole forest swarmed with children. There were
  countless children; there were just two children. Instead of a multitudinous
  expedition Oswald found himself alone in the black jungle with just two
  children, two white and stunted children who were dying for the air and
  light. No one had cared for them. One was ill, seriously ill. Unless the way
  out was found they could not live. They were Dolly's children, his wards. But
  what was he to do for them? .</p>

  <p>Then far ahead he saw that light of the great conflagration, that light
  that promised to be daylight and became a fire....</p>

  <p>"Black coffee," said Oswald during one of the wide-awake intervals.
  "Cigars. Talk. Over-excited.... I ought to be more careful.... I forget how
  flimsy I am still....</p>

  <p>"I must get my mind off these things. I'll talk to old Sycamore tomorrow
  and see about this little master Peter Stubland and his foster-sister. I'll
  go into the matter thoroughly. I haven't thought of them before.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if the boy still takes after Dolly....</p>

  <p>"After all," he said, rolling over, "it's true. Education is the big
  neglected duty of the time. It's fundamental. And what am I doing? It's just
  England&mdash;England all over&mdash;to let that boy be dragged up. I ought
  to see about him&mdash;now. I'll go down there....</p>

  <p>"I'll go and stay with Aunt Charlotte for a day or so. I'll send her a
  wire tomorrow.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">The quiet but observant life of old Cashel at Chastlands was
  greatly enlivened by the advent of Oswald.</p>

  <p>Signs of a grave and increasing agitation in the mind of Cashel's mistress
  became evident immediately after the departure of Mr. Sycamore. Manifestly
  whatever that gentleman had said or done&mdash;old Cashel had been able to
  catch very little&mdash;had been of a highly stimulating nature. So soon as
  he was out of the house, Lady Charlotte abandoned her sofa and table,
  upsetting her tonic as she did so, and still wearing her dressing-gown and
  cap, proceeded to direct a hasty packing for Italy. Unwin became much
  agitated, and a housemaid being addressed as a "perfect fool" became a
  sniffing fount of tears. There was a running to and fro with trunks and
  tea-baskets, a ringing of bells, and minor orders were issued and
  countermanded; the carriage was summoned twice for an afternoon drive and
  twice dismissed. When at last the lace peignoir was changed for a more
  suitable costume in which to take tea, Lady Charlotte came so near to actual
  physical violence that Unwin abruptly abandoned her quest of a perfect pose
  for wig and cap, and her ladyship surprised and delighted Cashel with a blond
  curl cocked waggishly over one eye. She did not have tea until half-past
  five.</p>

  <p>She talked to herself with her hard blue eyes fixed on vacancy. "I will
  not stay here to be insulted," she said.</p>

  <p>"Rampageous," whispered Cashel on the landing. "Rumbustious. What's it all
  about?"</p>

  <p>"Cashel!" she said sharply as he was taking away the tea-things.</p>

  <p>"M'lady."</p>

  <p>"Telephone to Mr. Grimes and ask him to take tickets as usual for myself
  and Unwin to Pallanza&mdash;for tomorrow."</p>

  <p>It was terrible but pleasing to have to tell her that Mr. Grimes would now
  certainly have gone home from his office.</p>

  <p>"See that it is done tomorrow. Tomorrow I must catch the eleven
  forty-seven for Charing Cross. I shall take lunch with me in the train. A
  wing of chicken. A drop of claret. Perhaps a sandwich. Gentleman's Relish or
  shrimp paste. And a grape or so. A mere mouthful. I shall expect you to be in
  attendance to help with the luggage as far as Charing Cross...."</p>

  <p>So she was going after all.</p>

  <p>"Like a flight," mused Cashel. "What's after the Old Girl?"...</p>

  <p>He grasped the situation a little more firmly next day.</p>

  <p>The preparations for assembling Lady Charlotte in the hall before
  departure were well forward at eleven o'clock, although there was no need to
  start for the station until the half hour. A brief telegram from Oswald
  received about half-past ten had greatly stimulated these activities....</p>

  <p>Unwin, very white in the face&mdash;she always had a bilious headache when
  travelling was forward&mdash;and dressed in the peculiar speckled black dress
  and black hat that she considered most deterrent to foreign depravity, was
  already sitting stiffly in the hall with Lady Charlotte's purple-coloured
  dressing-bag beside her, and Cashel having seen to the roll of rugs was now
  just glancing through the tea-basket to make sure that it was in order, when
  suddenly there was the flapping, rustling sound of a large woman in rapid
  movement upon the landing above, and Lady Charlotte appeared at the head of
  the stairs, all hatted, veiled and wrapped for travelling. Her face was
  bright white with excitement. "Unwin, I want you," she cried. "Cashel, say
  I'm in bed. Say I'm ill and must not be disturbed. Say I've been taken
  ill."</p>

  <p>She vanished with the agility of a girl of twenty&mdash;except that the
  landing was of a different opinion.</p>

  <p>The two servants heard her scuttle into her room and slam the door. There
  was a great moment of silence.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lor'!" Unwin rose with the sigh of a martyr, and taking the
  dressing-bag with her&mdash;the fittings alone were worth forty
  pounds&mdash;and pressing her handkerchief to her aching brow, marched
  upstairs.</p>

  <p>Cash el, agape, was roused by the ringing of the front door bell. He
  opened to discover Mr. Oswald Sydenham with one arm in a sling and a rug upon
  the other.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Cashel," he said. "I suppose my room isn't occupied? My telegram
  here? How's Lady Charlotte?"</p>

  <p>"Very poorly, sir," said Cashel. "She's had to take in her bed, sir."</p>

  <p>"Pity. Anything serious?"</p>

  <p>"A sudden attact, sir."</p>

  <p>"H'm. Well, tell her I'm going to inflict myself upon her for a day or so.
  Just take my traps in and I'll go on with this fly to Limpsfield. Say I'll be
  back to dinner."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

  <p>The old man bustled out to get in the valise and Gladstone bag that
  constituted Oswald's luggage. "When he came into the hall again he found the
  visitor scrutinizing the tea-basket and the roll of rugs with his one
  penetrating eye in a manner that made him dread a question. But Oswald never
  questioned servants; on this occasion only he winked at one.</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong with the arm, sir?" asked old Cashel.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Oswald, still looking markedly at the symptoms of imminent
  travel. " H'm."</p>

  <p>He went out to the fly, stood ready to enter it, and then swivelled round
  very quickly and looked up at his aunt's bedroom window in time to catch an
  instant impression of a large, anxious face regarding him.</p>

  <p>235 "Ah!" said Oswald, and returned smiling grimly into the hall.</p>

  <p>"Cashel, "he called.</p>

  <p>"Sir?"</p>

  <p>"Her ladyship is up. Tell her I have a few words to say to her before she
  goes."</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Look here, Cashel, you do what I tell you,"</p>

  <p>"Til tell Miss Unwin, sir."</p>

  <p>He went upstairs, leaving Oswald still thinking over the nigs. Yes, she
  was off! She had got everything; pointed Alpine sticks, tea-basket,
  travelling campstool. It must be Switzerland or Italy for the winter at
  least. A great yearning to see his aunt with his own eye came upon Oswald. He
  followed Cashel upstairs quietly but swiftly, and found him in a hasty
  whispered consultation with Unwin on the second landing. "Oh my 'ed'll burst
  bang," Unwin was saying.</p>

  <p>"'Er ladyship, sir," she began at the sight of Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Ssh!" he said to her, and held her and Cashel silent with an uplifted
  forefinger while he listened to the sounds of a large powerful woman going to
  bed swiftly and violently in her clothes.</p>

  <p>"I must go in to her, sir," said Unwin breaking the silence. "Poor dear!
  It's a very sudden attact."</p>

  <p>The door opened and closed upon Unwin.</p>

  <p>"Lock the door on him, you&mdash;you <i>Idiot</i>!" they heard Lady
  Charlotte shout&mdash;too late.</p>

  <p>The hated and dreaded visage of Oswald appeared looking round the corner
  of the door into the great lady's bedroom. Her hat had been flung aside, she
  was tying on an unconvincing night cap over her great blond travelling wig;
  her hastily assumed nightgown betrayed the agate brooch at her neck.</p>

  <p>"How dare you, sir!" she cried at the sight of him.</p>

  <p>"You're not ill. You're going to cut off to Italy this afternoon. What
  have you done to my Wards?"</p>

  <p>"A lady's sick room! Sacred, Sir! Have you no sense of decency?"</p>

  <p>"Is it measles, Auntie?"</p>

  <p>"Go away!"</p>

  <p>"I daren't. If I leave you alone in this country for a year or two you're
  bound to get into trouble. What am I to do with you?"</p>

  <p>"Unbecoming intrusion!"</p>

  <p>"You ought to be stopped by the Foreign Office. You'll lead to a war with
  Italy."</p>

  <p>"Go for a doctor, Cashel," she cried aloud in her great voice. "Go for the
  doctor."</p>

  <p>"M'lady," very faintly from the landing.</p>

  <p>"And countermand the station cab, Cashel," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"If you do anything of the sort, Cashel!" she cried, and sitting up in bed
  clutched the sheets with such violence that a large spring-sided boot became
  visible at the foot of the bed. The great lady had gone to bed in her boots.
  Aunt and nephew both glared at this revelation in an astonished silence.</p>

  <p>"How can you, Auntie," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"If I choose," said Lady Charlotte. "If I choose&mdash; Oh! Go away!"</p>

  <p>"Back to dinner," said Oswald sweetly, and withdrew.</p>

  <p>He was still pensive upon the landing when Unwin appeared to make sure
  that the station cab was not countermanded....</p>

  <p>Under the circumstances he was not surprised to find on his return from
  The Ingle-Nook that he was now the only occupant of Chastlands. Aunt
  Charlotte had fled, leaving behind a note that had evidently been written
  before his arrival.</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Nephew&mdash;I am sorry that my arrangements for going
  abroad this winter, already made, prevent my welcoming you home for this
  uninvited and totally unexpected visit. I am sure Cashel and the other
  servants will take good care of you. You seem to know the way to their good
  graces. There are many things I should have liked to talk over with you if
  you had given me due and proper notice of your return as you ought to have
  done, instead, of leaving it to a solicitor to break the glad tidings to me,
  followed by a sixpenny telegram. As it is, I shall just miss you. I have to
  go, and I cannot wait. All my arrangements are made. I suppose it is idle to
  expect civility from you ever or the slightest attention to the convenances.
  The Sydenhams have never shone in manners. Well, I hope you will take those
  two poor children quite out of the hands of those smoking, blaspheming,
  nightgown-wearing Limps field women. They are utterly unfit for such a
  responsibility. Utterly. I would not trust a pauper brat in their hands. The
  children require firm treatment, the girl especially, or they will be utterly
  spoilt. She is deceitful and dishonest, as one might expect; she gave Mrs.
  Pybus a very trying time indeed, catching measles deliberately and so
  converting the poor woman's house into a regular hospital. I fear for her
  later. I have done my best for them both. No doubt you will find it all spun
  into a fine tale, but I trust your penetration to see through a tissue of
  lies, however plausible it may seem at the first blush. I am glad to think
  you are now to relieve me of a serious responsibility, though how a single
  man not related to her in the slightest degree can possibly bring up a young
  girl, even though illegitimate, without grave scandal, passes my poor
  comprehension. No doubt I am an old-fashioned old fool nowadays! Thank God! I
  beg to be excused!</p>

  <p class="letter">Your affectionate Aunt</p>

  <p class="letter">CHARLOTTE.</p>

  <p>Towards the end of this note her ladyship's highly angular handwriting
  betrayed by an enhanced size and considerable irregularity, a deflection from
  her customary calm.</p><br>

  <p class="first">Oswald knocked for some time at the open green door of The
  Ingle-Nook before attracting any one's attention. Then a small but apparently
  only servant appeared, a little round-faced creature who looked up hard into
  Oswald's living eye&mdash;as though she didn't quite like the other. She
  explained that "Miss Phyllis" was not at home, and that "Miss Phoebe mustn't
  be disturved." Miss Phoebe was working. Miss Phyllis had gone away with
  Mary</p>

  <p>"Who's Mary?" said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Well, Sir, it's Mary who always 'as been 'ere, Sir,"&mdash;TO Windsor to
  be with Miss Joan. "Arid it's orders no one's 'llowed to upset Miss Phoebe
  when she's writing. Not even Lady Charlotte Sydenham, Sir. I dursn't give
  your name, Sir, even. I dursn't."</p>

  <p>"Except," she added reverentially, "it's Death or a Fire."</p>

  <p>"You aren't the Piano, per'aps?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Oswald had to confess he wasn't.</p>

  <p>The little servant looked sorry for him.</p>

  <p>And that was in truth the inexorable law now of The Ingle-Nook. Aunt
  Phoebe was taking herself very seriously&mdash;as became a Thinker whose
  Stitchwoman papers, deep, high, and occasionally broad in thought, were
  running into a sale of tens of thousands. So she sat hard and close at her
  writing-table from half-past nine to twelve every morning, secluded and
  defended from all the world, correcting, musing deeply over, and occasionally
  reading aloud the proofs of the third series of Stitchwoman papers. (Old
  Groom-bridge, the occasional gardener, used to listen outside in awe and
  admiration. "My word, but she do give it 'em!" old Groombridge used to say.)
  Oswald perceived that there was nothing to do but wait. "I'll wait," he said,
  "downstairs."</p>

  <p>"I suppose I ought to let you in," said the little servant, evidently
  seeking advice.</p>

  <p>"Oh, decidedly," said Oswald, and entered the room in which he had parted
  from Dolly six years ago.</p>

  <p>The door closed behind the little servant, and Oswald found himself in a
  house far more heavily charged with memories than he could have expected. The
  furniture had been but little altered; it was the morning time again, the
  shadow masses fell in the same places, it had just the same atmosphere of
  quiet expectation it had had on that memorable day before the door beyond had
  opened and Dolly had appeared, subdued and ashamed, to tell him of the act
  that severed them for ever. How living she seemed here by virtue of those
  inanimate' things! Had that door opened now he would have expected to see her
  standing there again. And he was alive still, strong and active, altered just
  a little by a touch of fever and six short years of experience, but the same
  thing or impulse and desire and anger, and she had gone beyond time and
  space, beyond hunger or desire. He had walked between this window and this
  fireplace on these same bricks on which he was pacing now, spitting abuse at
  her, a man mad with shame and thwarted desire. Never had he forgiven her, or
  stayed his mind to think what life had been for her, until she was dead. That
  outbreak, with gesticulating hands and an angry, grimacing face, had been her
  last memory of him. What a broken image he had made of himself in her mind!
  And now he could never set things right with her, never tell her of his
  belated understanding and pity. "I was a weak thing, confused and torn
  between my motives. Why did you&mdash;you who were my lover&mdash;why did you
  not help me after I had stumbled!" So the still phantom in that room
  reproached him, a phantom of his own creation, for Dolly had never reproached
  him; to the end she had had no reproaches in her heart for any one but
  herself because of their disaster.</p>

  <p>"Hold tight to love, little people," he whispered. "Hold tight to love....
  But we don't, we don't...."</p>

  <p>Never before had Oswald so felt the tremendous pitifulness of life. He
  felt that if he stayed longer in this room he must cry out. He walked to the
  garden door and stood looking at the empty flagstone path between the dahlias
  and sunflowers.</p>

  <p>It was all as if he had but left it yesterday, except for the heartache
  that now mingled with the sunshine.</p>

  <p>"Pat&mdash;whack&mdash;pat&mdash;whack"; he scarcely heeded that rhythmic
  noise.</p>

  <p>Peter had gone out of his head altogether. He walked slowly along the
  pathway towards the little arbour that overhung the Weald. Then, turning, he
  discovered Peter with a bat in his hand, regarding him....</p>

  <p>Directly Oswald saw Peter he marvelled that he had not been eager to see
  him before. The boy was absurdly like Dolly; he had exactly the same smile;
  and directly he saw the gaunt figure of his one-eyed guardian he cried out,
  "It's Nobby!" with a voice that might have been hers. There was a squeak of
  genuine delight in his voice. He wasn't at all the sturdy little thing in a
  pinafore that Oswald remembered, lie seemed indeed at the first glance just a
  thin, flat-chested little Dolly in grey flannel trousers.</p>

  <p>He had obviously been bored before this happy arrival of Oswald. He had
  been banging a rubber ball against the scullery with a cricket-bat and
  counting hits and misses. It is a poor entertainment. Oswald did not realize
  how green his memory had been kept by the Bungo-Peter saga, and Peter's
  prompt recognition after six years flattered him.</p>

  <p>The two approached one another slowly, taking each other in.</p>

  <p>"You remember me?" said Oswald superfluously.</p>

  <p>"Don't I just! You promised me a lion's skin."</p>

  <p>"So I did."</p>

  <p>He could not bear to begin this new relationship as a defaulter. "It's on
  its way to you," he equivocated, making secret plans.</p>

  <p>Peter, tucking his bat under his arm and burying his hands in his trouser
  pockets, drew still nearer. At a distance of four feet or thereabouts he
  stopped short and Oswald stopped short. Peter regarded this still incredible
  home-comer with his head a little on one side.</p>

  <p>"It was you, used to tell me stories."</p>

  <p>"You don't remember my telling you stories?"</p>

  <p>"I do. About the Ba-ganda who live in U-ganda. Don't you remember how you
  used to put out my Zulus and my elephants and lions on the floor and say it
  was Africa. You taught us roaring like lions&mdash;Joan and me. Don't you
  remember?"</p>

  <p>Oswald remembered. He remembered himself on all fours with the children on
  the floor of the sunny play-room upstairs, and some one sometimes standing,
  sometimes sitting above the game, some one who listened as keenly as the
  children, some one at whom he talked about that world of lakes as large as
  seas, and of trackless, sunless forests and of park-like glades and
  wildernesses of flowers, and about strings of loaded porters and of
  encounters with marvelling people who tad never before set eyes on a
  European....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">The idea that the guardianship of Peter was just a little
  duty to be seen to, vanished at the sight of him in favour of the realization
  of a living relationship. There are moments when small boys of ten in perfect
  health and condition can look the smallest, flimsiest, and most pathetic of
  created things&mdash;and at the same time preternaturally valiant and
  intelligent. They take on a likeness to sacred flames that may at any moment
  flicker out. More particularly does this unconscious camouflage of delicacy
  occur in the presence of parents and guardians already in a state of
  self-reproach and emotional disorder. Mr. Grimes with an eye to growth had
  procured a grey flannel suit a little too large for Peter, but it never
  occurred to Oswald that the misfit could be due to anything but a swift and
  ominous shrinkage of the boy. He wanted to carry him off forthwith to beer
  and cream and sea-bathing.</p>

  <p>But these were feelings he knew he must not betray.</p>

  <p>"I must tell you some more stories," he said. "I've come back to England
  to live."</p>

  <p>"<i>Here</i>?"&mdash;brightly.</p>

  <p>"Well, near here. But I shall see a lot of you now, Peter."</p>

  <p>"I'll like that," said Peter. "I've often thought of you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A pause.</p>

  <p>"You broken your arm?" said Peter</p>

  <p>"Not so bad as that. I've got to have some bits of shell taken out."</p>

  <p>"That Egyptian shell? When you got the V.C.?"</p>

  <p>"I never told you of the Egyptian shell?" asked Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Mummy did. Once. Long ago."</p>

  <p>Another pause.</p>

  <p>"This garden's not so greatly altered, Peter," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"There's a Friendship's Garden up that end," said Peter, indicating the
  end by a movement of his head. "But it isn't much. Aunt Phoebe started it and
  forgot it. Every one who came was to plant something. And me and Joan have
  gardens, but they've got all weedy now."</p>

  <p>"Let's have a look at it all," said Oswald, and guardian and ward strolled
  towards the steep.</p>

  <p>"The Dahlias are splendid this year," Oswald remarked, "and these Japanese
  roses are covered with berries. Splendid, aren't they? One can make a jelly
  of them Quite a good jelly. And let me see, wasn't there a little
  summer-house at the end of this path where one looked over the Weald? Ah!
  here it is. Hardly changed at all."</p>

  <p>He sat down. Here he had talked with Dolly and taken her hand....</p>

  <p>He bestirred himself to talk.</p>

  <p>"And exactly how old are you now, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"Ten years and two months," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"We'll have to find a school for you."</p>

  <p>"Have you been in Africa since I saw you?" Peter asked, avoiding the
  topic.</p>

  <p>"Since you saw me going off," said Oswald, and the man glanced at the boy
  and the boy glanced at the man, and each was wondering what the other
  remembered. "I've been in Uganda all the time. There's been fighting and
  working. Some day you must go to Uganda and see all that has been done. We've
  made a good railway and good roads and telegraphs. We've put down robbers and
  cruelty."</p>

  <p>"And shot a lot of lions?"</p>

  <p>"Plenty. The lions were pretty awful for a bit. About Nairobi and along
  the line."</p>

  <p>"Shot 'em when they were coming at you?"</p>

  <p>"One was coming straight at me."</p>

  <p>"That's my skin," said Peter.</p>

  <p>Oswald make no answer.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to go to Africa," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"You shall."</p>

  <p>He decided to begin at once upon his neglected task of making an Imperial
  citizen according to the ideas that prevailed before the advent of the New
  Imperialism. "That sort of thing," he said, "is what we Englishmen are for,
  you know, Peter. What our sort of Englishman is for anyhow. We have to go
  about the world and make roads and keep the peace and see fair play. We've
  got to kill big beasts and climb hard mountains. That's the job of the
  Englishman. He's a sort of policeman. A sort of working guardian Not a nosy
  slave-driver trying to get rich. He chases off slave-drivers. All the world's
  his beat. India, Africa, China, and the East, all the seas of the world. This
  little fat green country, all trim and tidy and set with houses and gardens,
  isn't much of a land for a man, you know&mdash;unless he's an invalid. It's a
  good land to grow up in and come back to die in. Or rest in. But in between,
  no!"</p>

  <p>"No,"said Peter.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"But you haven't come back to die, Uncle Nobby?"</p>

  <p>"No fear. But I've had to come back. I'm resting. This old arm, you know,
  and all that sort of thing. Just for a time.... And besides I want to see a
  lot of you."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You have to grow up here and learn all you can, science and all sorts of
  things, so that you can be a useful man&mdash;wherever you have to go." .</p>

  <p>"Africa," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Africa, perhaps. And that's why one has to go to school and
  college&mdash;and learn all about it."</p>

  <p>"They haven't taught me much about it yet," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Well, you haven't been to much in the way of schools," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Are there better schools?"</p>

  <p>"No end. We're going to find one," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"I wish school was over," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Why? You've got no end to learn yet."</p>

  <p>"I want to begin," said Peter, looking out across the tumbled gentleness
  of the Weald.</p>

  <p>"Begin school?"</p>

  <p>"No, begin&mdash;Africa, India&mdash;doing things."</p>

  <p>"School first," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Are there schools where you learn about guns and animals and mountains
  and foreign people?" said Peter.</p>

  <p>"There must be," said Oswald. "We'll find something."</p>

  <p>"Where you don't do Latin and parsing and 'straction of the square
  root."</p>

  <p>"Oh! those things have their place."</p>

  <p>"Did you have to do them, Uncle Nobby?"</p>

  <p>"Rather."</p>

  <p>"Were they useful to you?"</p>

  <p>"At times&mdash;in a way. Of course those things are good as training, you
  know&mdash;awfully good. Harden up the mental muscles, Peter."</p>

  <p>Peter made no reply to that.</p>

  <p>Presently Peter said, "Shall I learn about machines?"</p>

  <p>"When you've done some mathematics, Peter."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to fly," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"That's far away yet."</p>

  <p>"There was a boy at that school, his father was an engineer; and he said
  that flying machines were coming quite soon."</p>

  <p>This was beyond Oswald's range.</p>

  <p>"The French have got a balloon that steers about," he said. "That's as
  near as we are likely to come to flying for a long time yet."</p>

  <p>"This boy said that he meant a real flying machine, not a balloon. It was
  to be heavier than air. It would fly like a kite or a bird."</p>

  <p>"I doubt if we'll see that in my lifetime," said Oswald; "or yours," blind
  to the fate that had marked Peter for its own.</p>

  <p>"H'm," said Peter, with a shadow falling upon one of his brightest dreams.
  (Nobby ought to know these things. His word ought surely to be final. Still,
  after all, this chap's father was an engineer.) "I'd love to fly," said
  Peter.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 10</h3>

  <p class="first">Something with the decorative effect of a broad processional
  banner in a very High Church indeed, appeared upon the flagstone path. It was
  Aunt Phoebe.</p>

  <p>She had come out into the garden half an hour before her usual time. But
  indeed from the moment when she had heard Oswald and Peter talking in the
  garden below she had been unable to write more. After some futile attempts to
  pick up the lost thread of her discourse, she had gone to her bedroom and
  revised her toilet, which was often careless in the morning, so as to .be
  more expressive of her personality.</p>

  <p>She was wearing a long djibbah-like garment with a richly embroidered
  yoke, she had sandals over her brown stockings, and rather by way of symbol
  of authorship than for any immediate use she bore a big leather portfolio.
  There was moreover now a gold-mounted fountain pen amidst the other
  ingredients of the cheerful chatelaine that had once delighted Peter's
  babyhood.</p>

  <p>She seemed a fuller, more confident person than Oswald remembered. She
  came eloquent with apologies. "I have to make an inexorable rule," she said,
  "against disturbances. As if I were a man writer instead of a mere woman.
  Between nine and one I am a woman enclosed&mdash;cloistered&mdash;refused.
  Sacred hours of self-completeness. Unspeakably precious to me. Visitors are
  not even announced. It is a law&mdash;inflexible."</p>

  <p>"We must all respect our work," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"It's over now," said Aunt Phoebe, smiling like the sun after clouds.
  "It's over now for the day. I am just human&mdash;until tomorrow again."</p>

  <p>"You are writing a book?" Oswald asked rather ineptly.</p>

  <p>"The Stitchwoman; Series Three. Much is expected; much must be given. I am
  the slave now of a Following." Aunt Phoebe went to the wall and stood with
  her fine profile raised up over the view. She was a little breathless and
  twitching slightly, but very magnificent. Most of her hair was tidy. "Our old
  Weald, does it look the same?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite the same," said Oswald, standing up beside her.</p>

  <p>"But not to me," she said. Indeed not to me. To me every day it is
  different. Always wide, always wonderful, but different, always different. I
  know it so well."</p>

  <p>Oswald felt she had worked a "catch" on him. He was faintly nettled.</p>

  <p>"Still," he said, "fundamentally one must recognize that it's the same
  Weald."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Aunt Phoebe suddenly, looking at him very intently, and
  then, as if she tasted the word, "Fundamentally?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she added.</p>

  <p>Oswald was too much annoyed to reply.</p>

  <p>"And what do you think of your new charge?" she asked. "I don't know
  whether Peter quite understands that yet. The young squire goes to the men.
  He casts aside childish things, and rides out in his little Caparison to join
  the ranks. Do you know that, Peter? Mr. Sydenham is now your sole
  guardian."</p>

  <p>Peter looked at Oswald and smiled shyly, and his cheeks flushed.</p>

  <p>"I think we shall get on together," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Would that it ended there! You take the girl too?"</p>

  <p>"It is not my doing," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>Aunt Phoebe addressed the Weald.</p>

  <p>"Poor Dolly! So it is that the mother soul cheats itself. Through the
  ages&mdash;always self-abnegation for the woman." She turned to Oswald. "If
  she had had time to think I am certain she would not have excluded women from
  this trust. Certain. What have men to do with education? With the education
  of a woman more particularly. The Greater from the Less. But the thing is
  done. It has been a great experiment, a wonderful experiment; teaching, I
  learnt&mdash;but I doubt if you will understand that."</p>

  <p>There was a slight pause. "What exactly was the nature of the experiment?"
  asked Oswald modestly.</p>

  <p>"Feminine influence. Dominant."</p>

  <p>Oswald considered. "I don't know if you include Lady Charlotte," he threw
  out.</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Aunt Phoebe.</p>

  <p>"But she has played her part, I gather."</p>

  <p>"Feminine! No! She is completely a Man-made Woman. Quintessentially the
  Pampered Squaw. Holding her position by her former charms. A Sex Residuum.
  Relict. This last outrage. An incident&mdash;merely. Her course of action was
  dictated for her. A Man. A mere solicitor. One Grimes. The flimsiest
  creature! An aspen leaf&mdash;but Male. Male."</p>

  <p>Stern thoughts kept Aunt Phoebe silent for a time. Then she remarked very
  quietly, "I shook him. I shook him well."</p>

  <p>"I hope still to have the benefit of your advice," said Oswald
  gravely.</p>

  <p>"Nay," she said. But she was pleased. "A shy comment, perhaps. But the
  difference will be essential. Don't expect me to guide you as you would wish
  to be guided. That phase is over between men and women. We hand the children
  over&mdash;since the law will have it so. Take them!"</p>

  <p>And then addressing the Weald, Aunt Phoebe, in vibrating accents, uttered
  a word that was to be the keynote of £ decade of feminine activities.</p>

  <p>"The Vote," said Aunt Phoebe, getting a wonderful emotional buzz into her
  voice. "The Vo-o-o-o-o-te."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 11</h3>

  <p class="first">So it was that Oswald found himself fully invested with his
  responsibilities.</p>

  <p>There was a terrifying suggestion in Aunt Phoebe's manner that he would
  presently have to clap Peter's hat on, make up a small bundle of Peter's
  possessions, and fare forth with him into the wide world, picking up the
  convalescent at Windsor on the way, but that was a misapprehension of Aunt
  Phoebe's intentions. And, after all, it was Peter's house and garden if it
  came to that. For a time at least things could go on as they were. But the
  task of direction was now fully his. Whether these two young people were
  properly educated or not, whether they too became slackers and inadequate or
  worthy citizens of this great empire, rested now entirely in his hands.</p>

  <p>"They must have the best," he said....</p>

  <p>The best was not immediately apparent.</p>

  <p>From Chastlands and his two rooms at the Climax Club Oswald conducted his
  opening researches for the educational best, and whenever he was at
  Chastlands he came over nearly every day to The Ingle-Nook on his bicycle It
  was a well-remembered road. Scarcely was there a turn in it that did not
  recall some thought of the former time when he had ridden over daily for a
  sight of Dolly; he would leave his bicycle in a clump of gorse by the high
  road that was surely an outgrown fragment of the old bush in which he had
  been wont to leave it six years before; he would walk down the same rusty
  path, and his heart would quicken as it used to quicken at the thought of
  seeing Dolly. But presently Peter began to oust Dolly from his thoughts.
  Sometimes Peter would be standing waiting for him by the high road. Sometimes
  Peter, mounted on a little outgrown bicycle, would meet him on the purple
  common half way.</p>

  <p>A man and a boy of ten are perhaps better company than a man and a boy of
  fifteen. There's so much less egotism between them. At any rate Peter and
  Oswald talked of education and travel and politics and philosophy with
  unembarrassed freedom. Oswald, like most childless people, had had no
  suspicion of what the grey matter of a bright little boy's brain can hold. He
  was amazed at Peter's views and curiosities. It was Oswald's instinct never
  to talk "down" to man, woman or child. He had never thought about it, but if
  you had questioned him he would have told you that that was the sort of thing
  one didn't do. And this instinct gave him a wide range of available
  companionship. Peter had never conceived such good company as Oswald. You
  could listen to Oswald for hours. They discoursed upon every topic out of
  dreamland. And sometimes they came very close even to that dreamland where
  Bungo Peter adventured immortally. Oswald would feel a transfiguring
  presence, a touch of fantasy and half suspect their glorious companion.</p>

  <p>Much of their talk was a kind of story-telling.</p>

  <p>"How should we go to the Congo Forest?" Peter would ask. "Would one go by
  Nairobi?"</p>

  <p>"No, that's the other way. We'd have to go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>And forthwith Nobby and Peter were getting their stuff together and
  counting how many porters they would need....</p>

  <p>"One day perhaps we'd come upon a place 'fested with crocodiles," Peter
  would say.</p>

  <p>"We would. You would be pushing rather ahead of the party with your guns,
  looking for anything there might be&mdash;pushing through tall reeds far
  above your head," Oswald would oblige.</p>

  <p>"You'd be with me," insisted Peter....</p>

  <p>It was really story-telling....</p>

  <p>It was Peter's habit in those days when he was alone to meditate on paper.
  He would cover sheet after sheet with rapidly drawn scenes of adventure. One
  day Oswald found himself figuring in one of these dream pictures. He and
  Peter were leading an army in battle. "Capture of Ten War Elephants" was the
  legend thereon. But he realized how clearly the small boy saw him. Nothing
  was spared of the darkened, browless side of his face with its asymmetrical
  glass eye, the figure of him was very long and lean and bent, with its arm
  still in its old sling; and it was drawn manifestly with the utmost
  confidence and admiration and love....</p>

  <p>Peter's hostility to schools was removed very slowly. The lessons at High
  Cross had scarred him badly, and about Miss Mills clung associations of the
  utmost dreariness. Still it was Oswald's instinct to consult the young man on
  his destiny.</p>

  <p>"There's a lot you don't know yet," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Can't I read it out of books?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>"You can't read everything out of books," said Oswald. "There's things you
  ought to see and handle. And things you can only learn by doing."</p>

  <p>Oswald wanted Peter to plan his own school.</p>

  <p>Peter considered. "I'd like lessons about the insides of animals, and
  about the people in foreign countries&mdash;and how engines work&mdash;and
  all that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"Then we must find a school for you where they teach all that sort of
  thing," said Oswald, as though it was merely a question of ordering goods
  from the Civil Service Stores....</p>

  <p>He had much to learn yet about education.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 12</h3>

  <p class="first">But Oswald was still only face to face with the half of his
  responsibility.</p>

  <p>One morning he found Peter at the schoolroom table very busy cutting big
  letters out of white paper. Beside him was a long strip of Turkey twill from
  the dressing-up box that The Ingle-Nook had plagiarized from the Sheldricks.
  "I'm getting ready for Joan," said Peter. "I'm going to put 'Welcome' on this
  for over the garden gate. And there's to be a triumphal arch."</p>

  <p>Hitherto Peter had scarcely betrayed any interest in Joan at all, now he
  seemed able to think of no one else, and Oswald found himself reduced
  abruptly from the position of centre of Peter's universe to a mere helper in
  the decorations. But he was beginning to understand the small boy by this
  time, and he took the withdrawal of the limelight philosophically.</p>

  <p>When Aunt Phyllis and Joan arrived they found the flagged path from the
  "Welcome" gate festooned with chains of coloured paper (bought with Peter's
  own pocket-money and made by him and Oswald, with some slight assistance and
  much moral support from Aunt Phoebe in the evening) to the door. The
  triumphal arch had been achieved rather in the Gothic style by putting the
  movable Badminton net posts into a sort of trousering of assorted oriental
  cloths from the dressing-up chest, and crossing two heads of giant Heracleum
  between them. Peter stood at the door in the white satin suit his innocent
  vanity loved&mdash;among other roles it had served for Bassanio, Prince Hal,
  and Antony (over the body of Caesar)&mdash;with a face of extraordinary
  solemnity. Behind him stood Uncle Nobby.</p>

  <p>Joan wasn't quite the Joan that Peter expected. She was still wan from her
  illness and she had grown several inches. She was as tall as he. And she was
  white-faced, so that her hair seemed blacker than ever, and her eyes were big
  and lustrous. She came walking slowly down the path with her eyes wide open.
  There was a difference, he felt, in her movement as she came forward, though
  he could not have said what it was; there was more grace in Joan now and less
  vigour. But it was the same Joan's voice that cried, "Oh, Petah! It's
  lovely!" She stood before him for a moment and then threw her arms about him.
  She hugged him and kissed him, and Uncle Nobby knew that it was the smear of
  High Cross School that made him wriggle out of her embrace and not return her
  kisses.</p>

  <p>But immediately he took her by the hand.</p>

  <p>"It's better in the playroom, Joan," he said.</p>

  <p>"All right, Joan&gt; go on with him," said Oswald, and came forward to
  meet Aunt Phyllis. Aunt Phoebe was on the staircase a little aloof from these
  things, as became a woman of intellect, and behind Aunt Phyllis came Mary,
  and behind Mary came the Limpsfield cabman with Aunt Phyllis's trunk upon his
  shoulder, and demolished the triumphal arch. But Peter did not learn of that
  disaster until later, and then he did not mind; it had served its
  purpose.</p>

  <p>The playroom (it was the old nursery rechristened) was indeed better. It
  was all glorious with paper chains of green and white festooned from corner
  to corner. On the floor to the right under the window was every toy soldier
  that Peter possessed drawn up in review array&mdash;a gorgeous new Scots Grey
  band in the front that Oswald had given him. But that was nothing. The big
  arm-chair had been drawn out into the middle of the room, and on it was
  Peter's own lion-skin. And a piece of red stair-carpet had been put for Joan
  to go up to the throne upon. And beside the throne was a little table, and on
  the table was a tinsel robe from Clarkson's and a wonderful gilt crown and a
  sceptre. Oswald had brought them along that morning.</p>

  <p>"The crown is for you, Joan!" said Peter. "The sceptre was bought for
  you."</p>

  <p>Little white-faced Joan stood stockishly with the crown in one hand and
  the sceptre in the other. "Put the crown on, Joan," said Peter. "It's yours.
  It's a restoration ceremony."</p>

  <p>But she didn't put it on.</p>

  <p>"It's lovely&mdash;and it's lovely," whispered Joan in a sort of rapture,
  and stared about her incredulously with her big dark eyes. It was home
  again&mdash;home, and Mrs. Pybus had passed like an evil dream in the night.
  She had never really believed it possible before that Mrs. Pybus could pass
  away. Even while Aunt Phyllis and Mary had been nursing her, Mrs. Pybus had
  hovered in the background like something more enduring, waiting for them to
  pass away as inexplicably as they had come. Joan had heard the whining voice
  upon the stairs every day and always while she was ill, and once Mrs. Pybus
  had come and stood by her bedside and remarked like one who maintains an
  argument, "She'll be 'appy enough 'ere when she's better again."</p>

  <p>No more Mrs. Pybus! No more whining scoldings. No more unexpected slaps
  and having to go to bed supperless. No more measles and uneasy misery in a
  bed with grey sheets. No more dark dreadful sayings that lurked in the mind
  like jungle beasts. She was home, home with Peter, out of that
  darkness....</p>

  <p>And yet&mdash;outside was the darkness still....</p>

  <p>"Joan," said Peter, trying to rouse her. "There's a cake like a birthday
  for tea...."</p>

  <p>When Oswald came in she was still holding the gilt crown in her hand.</p>

  <p>She let Peter take it from her and put it on her head, still staring
  incredulously about her. She took the sceptre limply. Peter was almost gentle
  with this strange, staring Joan.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 13</h3>

  <p class="first">For some days Oswald regarded Joan as a grave and thoughtful
  child. She seemed to be what country people call "old-fashioned." She might
  have been a changeling. He did not hear her laugh once. And she followed
  Peter about as if she was his shadow.</p>

  <p>Then one day as he cycled over from Chastlands he heard a strange tumult
  proceeding from a little field on Master's farm, a marvellous mixture of
  familiar and unfamiliar sounds, an uproar, wonderful as though a tinker's van
  had met a school treat and the twain had got drunk together. The source of
  this row was hidden from him by a little coppice, and he dismounted and went
  through the wood to investigate. Joan and Peter had discovered a disused
  cowshed with a sloping roof of corrugated iron, and they had also happened
  upon an abandoned kettle and two or three tin cans. They were now engaged in
  hurling these latter objects on to the resonant roof, down which they rolled
  thunderously only to be immediately returned. Joan was no longer a slip of
  pensive dignity, Peter was no longer a marvel of intellectual curiosities.
  They were both shrieking their maximum. Oswald had never before suspected
  Joan of an exceptionally full voice, nor Peter of so vast a wealth of
  gurgling laughter. "Keep the Pot-A-boilin'&mdash;" yelled Joan. "Keep the
  Pot-A-boilin'."</p>

  <p>"Hoo!" cried Peter. "Hoo! Go it, Joan. Wow!"</p>

  <p>And then, to crown the glory, the kettle burst. It came into two pieces.
  That was too perfect! The two children staggered back. Each seized a half of
  the kettle and kicked it deliberately. Then they rolled away and fell on
  their stomachs amidst the grass, kicking their legs in the air.</p>

  <p>But the spirit of rowdyism grows with what it feeds upon.</p>

  <p>"Oh, let's do something reely awful!" cried Joan. "Let's do something
  reely awful, Petah!"</p>

  <p>Peter's legs became still and stiff with interrogation.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Petah!" said Joan. "If I could only smash a window. Prow a brick
  frough a real window, a Big Glass Window. Just one Glass Window."</p>

  <p>"Where's a window?" said Peter, evidently in a highly receptive
  condition.</p>

  <p>From which pitch of depravity Oswald roused him by a prod in the
  back....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 14</h3>

  <p class="first">But after that Joan changed rapidly. Colour crept back into
  her skin, and a faintly rollicking quality into her bearing. She became
  shorter again and visibly sturdier, and her hair frizzed more and stuck out
  more. Her laugh and her comments upon the world became an increasingly
  frequent embroidery upon the quiet of The Ingle-Nook. She seemed to have a
  delusion that Peter was just within earshot, but only just.</p>

  <p>Oswald wondered how far her recent experiences had vanished from her mind.
  He thought they might have done so altogether until one day Joan took him
  into her confidence quite startlingly. He was smoking in the little arbour,
  and she came and stood beside him so noiselessly that he did not know she was
  there until she spoke. She was holding her hands behind her, and she was
  regarding the South Downs with a pensive frown. She was paying him the most
  beautiful compliment. She had come to consult him.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Pybus said," she remarked, "that every one who doesn't believe
  there's a God goes straight to Hell....</p>

  <p>"I don't believe there's a God," said Joan, "and Peter knows there
  isn't."</p>

  <p>For a moment Oswald was a little taken aback by this simple theology. Then
  he said, "D'you think Peter's looked everywhere, Joan?"</p>

  <p>Then he saw the real point at issue. "One thing you may be sure about,
  Joan," he said, "and that is that there isn't a Hell. Which is rather a pity
  in its way, because it would be nice to think of this Mrs. Pybus of yours
  going there. But there's no Hell at all. There's nothing more dreadful than
  the dreadful things in life. There's no need to worry about Hell."</p>

  <p>That he thought was fairly conclusive. But Joan remained pensive, with her
  eyes still on the distant hills. Then she asked one of those unanswerable
  children's questions that are all implication, imputation, assumption,
  misunderstanding, and elision.</p>

  <p>"But if there isn't a Hell," said Joan, "what does God do?"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 15</h3>

  <p class="first">It was after Joan had drifted away again from these
  theological investigations that Oswald, after sitting some time in silence,
  said aloud and with intense conviction, "I love these children."</p>

  <p>He was no longer a stranger in England; he had a living anchorage. He
  looked out over the autumnal glories of the Weald, dreaming intentions. These
  children must be educated. They must be educated splendidly. Oswald wanted to
  see Peter serving the empire. The boy would have pluck&mdash;he had already
  the loveliest brain&mdash;and a sense of fun. And Joan? Oswald was, perhaps,
  not quite so keen in those days upon educating Joan. That was to come
  later....</p>

  <p>After all, the empire, indeed the whole world of mankind, is made up of
  Joans and Peters. What the empire is, what mankind becomes, is nothing but
  the sum of what we have made of the Joans and Peters.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">CHAPTER X. &mdash; A SEARCHING OF SCHOOLMASTERS</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">SO it was that a systematic intention took hold of the lives
  of Joan and Peter. They had been snatched apart adventurously and
  disastrously out of the hands of an aimless and impulsive modernism and
  dragged off into dusty and decaying corners of the Anglican system. Now they
  were to be rescued by this Empire worshipper, this disfigured and suffering
  educational fanatic, and taught?</p>

  <p>What was there in Oswald's mind? His intentions were still sentimental and
  cloudy, but they were beginning to assume a firm and definite form. Just as
  the Uganda children were being made into civilized men and women according to
  the lights and means of the Protectorate government, so these two children
  had to be made fit rulers and servants of the greatest empire in the world.
  They had to know all that a ruling race should know, they had to think and
  act as befitted a leading people. All this seemed to him the simple and
  obvious necessity of the case. But he was a sick man, fatigued much more
  readily than most men, given to moods of bitter irritability; he had little
  knowledge of how he might set about this task, he did not know what help was
  available and what was impossible. He made enquiries and some were very
  absurd enquiries; he sought advice and talked to all sorts of people; and
  meanwhile Joan and Peter spent a very sunny and pleasant November running
  wild about Limpsfield&mdash;until one day Oswald noted as much and packed
  them off for the rest of the term to Miss Murgatroyd again. The School of St.
  George and the Venerable Bede was concentrating upon a Christmas production
  of Alice in Wonderland. There could not be very much bad teaching anyhow, and
  there would be plenty of fun.</p>

  <p>How is one to learn where one's children may be educated?</p>

  <p>This story has its comic aspects: Oswald went first to the Education
  Department!</p>

  <p>He thought that if one had two rather clever and hopeful children upon
  whom one was prepared to lavish time and money, an Imperial Education
  Department would be able to tell an anxious guardian what schools existed for
  them and the respective claims and merits and inter-relationships of such
  schools. But he found that the government which published a six-inch map of
  the British Isles on which even the meanest outhouse is marked, had no
  information for the enquiring parent or guardian at all in this matter of
  schools. An educational map had still to become a part of the equipment of
  the civilized state. As it was inconceivable that party capital could be made
  out of the production of such a map, it was likely to remain a desideratum in
  Great Britain for many years to come.</p>

  <p>In an interview that remained dignified on one side at least until the
  last, Oswald was referred to the advertisement columns of The Times and the
  religious and educational papers, and to&mdash;"a class of educational
  agents," said the official with extreme detachment. " Usually, of course,
  people hear of schools."</p>

  <p>So it was that England still referred back to the happy days of the
  eighteenth century when our world was small enough for everybody to know and
  trust and consult everybody, and tell in a safe and confidential manner
  everything that mattered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" groaned Oswald suddenly, giving way to his internal enemies.
  "My God! Here are two children, brilliant children&mdash;with plenty of money
  to be spent on them! Doesn't the Empire care a twopenny dam what becomes of
  them?"</p>

  <p>"There is an Association of Private Schoolmasters, I believe," said the
  official, staring at him; "but I don't know if it's any good."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Joan was rehearsing a special dance in costume and Peter was
  word-perfect as the White Knight long before Oswald had found even a hopeful
  school for either of them. He clung for some time to the delusion that there
  must exist somewhere a school that would exactly meet Peter's natural and
  reasonable demand for an establishment where one would learn about "guns and
  animals, mountains, machines and foreign people," that would give lessons
  about "the insides of animals" and "how engines work" and "all that sort of
  thing." The man wanted a school kept by Leonardo da Vinci. When he found a
  curriculum singularly bare of these vital matters, he began to ask
  questions.</p>

  <p>His questions presently developed into a very tiresome and trying
  Catechism for Schoolmasters. He did not allow for the fact that most private
  schoolmasters in England were I rather overworked and rather under-exercised
  men with considerable financial worries. Indeed, he made allowances for no
  one. He wanted to get on with the education of Joan and Peter&mdash;and more
  particularly of Peter.</p>

  <p>His Catechism varied considerably in detail, but always it ran upon the
  lines of the following questions.</p>

  <p>"What sort of boy are you trying to make?"</p>

  <p>"How will he differ from an uneducated boy?</p>

  <p>"I don't mean in manners, I mean how will he differ in imagination?"</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;I said&mdash;imagination."</p>

  <p>"Don't you know that education is building up an imagination? I thought
  everybody knew that."</p>

  <p>"Then what is education doing?"</p>

  <p>Here usually the Catechized would become troublesome and the Catechist
  short and rude. The Catechism would be not so much continued as resumed after
  incivilities and a silence.</p>

  <p>"What sort of curriculum is my ward to go through?"</p>

  <p>"Why is he to do Latin?"</p>

  <p>"Why is he to do Greek?"</p>

  <p>"Is he going to read or write or speak these languages?"</p>

  <p>"Then what is the strange and peculiar benefit of them?"</p>

  <p>"What will my ward know about Africa when you have done with him?"</p>

  <p>"What will he know about India? Are there any Indian boys here?"</p>

  <p>"What will he know about Garibaldi and Italy? About engineering? About
  Darwin?"</p>

  <p>"Will he be able to write good English?"</p>

  <p>"Do your boys do much German? Russian? Spanish or Hindustani?"</p>

  <p>"Will he know anything about the way the Royal Exchange affects the
  Empire? But why shouldn't he understand the elementary facts of finance and
  currency? Why shouldn't every citizen understand what a pound sterling really
  means? All our everyday life depends on that. What do you teach about
  Socialism? Nothing! Did you say Nothing? But he may be a member of Parliament
  some day. Anyhow he'll be a voter."</p>

  <p>"But if you can't teach him everything why not leave out these damned
  classics of yours?"...</p>

  <p>The record of an irritable man seeking the impossible is not to {)e dwelt
  upon too closely.. During his search for the boys' school that has yet to
  exist, Oswald gave way to some unhappy impulses; he made himself distressing
  and exasperating to quite a number of people. From the first his attitude to
  scholastic agents was hostile and uncharitable. His appearance made them
  nervous and defensive from the outset, more particularly the fierce cocking
  of his hat and the red intensity of his eye. He came in like an accusation
  rather than an application.</p>

  <p>"And tell me, are these all the schools there are?" he would ask, sitting
  with various printed and copygraphed papers in his hand.</p>

  <p>"All we can recommend," the genteel young man in charge would say.</p>

  <p>"All you are paid to recommend?" Oswald would ask.</p>

  <p>"They are the best schools available," the genteel young man would
  fence.</p>

  <p>"Bah!" Oswald would say.</p>

  <p>A bad opening....</p>

  <p>From the ruffled scholastic agents Oswald would go on in a mood that was
  bound to ruffle the hopeful school proprietor. Indeed some of these
  interviews became heated so soon and so extravagantly that there was a
  complete failure to state even the most elementary facts of the case. Lurid
  misunderstandings blazed. Uganda got perplexingly into the dispute. From one
  admirable establishment in Eastbourne Oswald retreated with its principal
  calling after him from his dignified portico, "I wouldn't take the little
  nigger at any price."</p>

  <p>When his doctor saw him after this last encounter he told him; "You are
  not getting on as well as you ought to do. You are running about too much.
  You ought to be resting completely."</p>

  <p>So Oswald took a week's rest from school visiting before he tried
  again.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">If it had not been for the sense of Joan and Peter growing
  visibly day by day, Oswald might perhaps have displayed more of the patience
  of the explorer. But his was rather the urgency of a thirsty traveller who
  looks for water than the deliberation of a trigonometrical survey. In a
  little while he mastered the obvious fact that preparatory schools were
  conditioned by the schools for which they prepared. He found a school at
  Margate, White Court, which differed rather in quality, and particularly in
  the quality of its proprietor, than in the nature of its arrangements from
  the other schools he had been visiting, and to this he committed Peter.
  Assisted by Aunt Phyllis he found an education for Joan in Highmorton School,
  ten miles away; he settled himself in a furnished house at Margate to be near
  them both; and having thus gained a breathing time, he devoted himself to a
  completer study of the perplexing chaos of upper-class education in England.
  What was it "up to"? He had his own clear conviction of what it ought to be
  up to, but the more he saw of existing conditions, the more hopelessly it
  seemed to be up to either entirely different things or else, in a spirit of
  intellectual sabotage, up to nothing at all. From the preparatory schools he
  went on to the great public schools, and from the public schools he went to
  the universities. He brought to the quest all the unsympathetic detachment of
  an alien observer and all the angry passion of an anxious patriot. With some
  suggestions from Matthew Arnold.</p>

  <p>"Indolence." "Insincerity." These two words became more and more frequent
  in his thoughts as he went from one great institution to another.
  Occasionally the headmasters he talked to had more than a suspicion of his
  unspoken comments. "Their imaginations are dead within them," said Oswald.
  "If only they could see the Empire! If only they could forget their little
  pride and dignity and affectations in the vision of mankind!"</p>

  <p>His impressions of headmasters were for the most part taken against a
  background of white-flannelled boys in playing-fields or grey-flannelled boys
  in walled court-yards. Eton gave him its river effects and a bright,
  unforgettable boatman in a coat of wonderful blue; Harrow displayed its view
  and insisted upon its hill. Physically he liked almost all the schools he
  saw, except Winchester, which he visited on a rainy day. Almost always there
  were fine architectural effects; now there was a nucleus of Gothic, now it
  was time-worn Tudor red brick, now well-proportioned grey Georgian. Most of
  these establishments had the dignity of age, but Caxton was wealthily new.
  Caxton was a nest of new buildings of honey-coloured stone; it was growing
  energetically but tidily; it waved its hand to a busy wilderness of rocks and
  plants and said, "our botanical garden," to a piece of field and said "our
  museum group." But it had science laboratories with big apparatus, and the
  machinery for a small engineering factory. Oswald with an experienced eye
  approved of its biological equipment. All these great schools were visibly
  full of life and activity. At times Oswald was so impressed by this life and
  activity that he felt ashamed of his enquiries; it seemed ungracious not to
  suppose that all was going well here, that almost any of these schools was
  good enough and that almost any casual or sentimental considerations,
  Sydenham family traditions or the like, should suffice to determine which was
  to have the moulding of Peter. But he had set his heart now on getting to the
  very essentials of this problem; he was resolved to be blinded by no fair
  appearances, and though these schools looked as firmly rooted and stoutly
  prosperous as British oaks and as naturally grown as they, though they had an
  air of discharging a function as necessary as the beating of a heart and as
  inevitably, he still kept his grip on the idea that they were artificial
  things of men's contriving, and still pressed his questions: What are you
  trying to do? What are you doing? How are you doing it? How do you fit in to
  the imperial scheme of things?</p>

  <p>So challenged these various high and head-masters had most of them the air
  of men invited to talk of things that are easier to understand than to say.
  They were not at all pompous about their explanations; from first to last
  Oswald never discovered the pompous school-master of legend and history;
  without exception they seemed anxious to get out of their gowns and pose as
  intelligent laymen; but they were not intelligent laymen, they did not
  explain, they did not explain, they waved hands and smiled. They " hoped"
  they were "turning out clean English gentlemen." They didn't train their men
  specially to any end at all. The aim was to develop a general intelligence, a
  general goodwill.</p>

  <p>"In relation to the empire and its destiny?" said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"I should hardly fix it so definitely as that," said Overtone of
  Hillborough.</p>

  <p>"But don't you set before these youngsters some general aim in life to
  which they are all to contribute?"</p>

  <p>"We rather leave the sort of contribution to them," said Overtone.</p>

  <p>"But you must put something before them of where they are, where they are
  to come in, what they belong to?" said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"That lies in the world about them," said Overtone. "King and
  country&mdash;we don't need to preach such things."</p>

  <p>"But what the King signifies&mdash;if he signifies anything at
  all&mdash;and the aim of the country," urged Oswald. "And the Empire! The
  Empire&mdash;our reality. This greatness of ours beyond the seas."</p>

  <p>"We don't stress it," said Overtone. "English boys are apt to be
  suspicious and ironical. Have you read that delightful account of the
  patriotic lecture in <i>Stalky and Co</i>? Oh, you should,"</p>

  <p>A common evasiveness characterized all these head-masters when Oswald
  demanded the particulars of Peter's curriculum. He wanted to know just the
  subjects Peter would study and which were to be made the most important, and
  then when these questions were answered he would demand: "And why do you
  teach this? What is the particular benefit of that to the boy or the empire?
  How does this other fit into your scheme of a clear-minded man?" But it was
  difficult to get even the first questions answered plainly. From the very
  outset he found himself entangled in that longstanding controversy upon the
  educational value of Latin and Greek. His circumstances and his disposition
  alike disposed him to be sceptical of the value of these shibboleths of the
  British academic world. Their share in the timetable was enormous. Excellent
  gentlemen who failed to impress him as either strong-minded or exact, sought
  to convince him of the pricelessness of Latin in strengthening and
  disciplining the mind; Hinks of Carchester, the distinguished Greek scholar,
  slipped into his hand at parting a pamphlet asserting that only Greek studies
  would make a man write English beautifully and precisely. Unhappily for his
  argument Hinks had written his pamphlet neither beautifully nor precisely.
  Lippiek, irregularly bald and with neglected teeth, a man needlessly
  unpleasing to the eye, descanted upon the Greek spirit, and its blend of
  wisdom and sensuous beauty. He quoted Euripides at Oswald and breathed an
  antique air in his face&mdash;although he knew that Oswald knew practically
  no Greek.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Oswald, "but compare this," and gave him back three good
  minutes of Swahili.</p>

  <p>"But what does it mean? It's gibberish to me. A certain melody
  perhaps."</p>

  <p>"In English," Oswald grinned, "you would lose it all. It is a passage
  of&mdash;oh! quite fantastic beauty. "...</p>

  <p>No arguments, no apologetics, stayed the deepening of Oswald's conviction
  that education in the public schools of Great Britain was not a forward-going
  process but a habit and tradition, that these classical school-masters were
  saying "nothing like the classics" in exactly the same spirit that the
  cobbler said "nothing like leather," because it was the stuff they had in
  stock. These subjects were for the most part being slackly, tediously, and
  altogether badly taught to boys who found no element of interest in them, the
  boys were as a class acquiring a distaste and contempt for learning thus
  presented, and a subtle, wide demoralization ensued. They found a
  justification for cribs and every possible device for shirking work in the
  utter remoteness and uselessness of these main subjects; the extravagant
  interest they took in school games was very largely a direct consequence of
  their intense boredom in school hours.</p>

  <p>Such was the impression formed by Oswald. To his eyes these great schools,
  architecturally so fine, so happy in their out-of-door aspects, so pleasant
  socially, became more and more visibly whirlpools into which the living
  curiosity and happy energy of the nation's youth were drawn and caught, and
  fatigued, thwarted, and wasted. They were beautiful shelters of intellectual
  laziness&mdash;from which Peter must if possible be saved.</p>

  <p>But how to save him? There was, Oswald discovered, no saving him
  completely. Oswald had a profound hostility to solitary education. He knew
  that except through accidental circumstances of the rarest sort, a private
  tutor must necessarily be a poor thing. A man who is cheap enough to devote
  all his time to the education of one boy can have very little that is worth
  imparting. And education is socialization. Education is the process of making
  the unsocial individual a citizen....</p>

  <p>Oswald's decision upon Caxton in the end, was by no means a certificate of
  perfection for Caxton. But Caxton had a good i^ lopsided Modern Side, with
  big, business-like chemical and physical laboratories, a quite honest and
  living-looking biological and geological museum, and a pleasant and active
  layman as headmaster. The mathematical teaching instead of being a drill in
  examination solutions was carried on in connexion with work in the physical
  and engineering laboratories. It was true that the "Modern Side'* of Caxton
  taught no history of any sort, ignored logic and philosophy, and, in the
  severity of its modernity, excluded even that amount of Latin which is needed
  for a complete mastery of English; nevertheless it did manifestly interest
  its boys enough to put games into a secondary place. At Caxton one did not
  see boys playing games as old ladies in hydropaths play patience, desperately
  and excessively and with a forced enthusiasm, because they had nothing better
  to do. Even the Caxton school magazine did not give much more than two-thirds
  of its space to games. So to Caxton Peter went, when Mr. Mackinder of White
  Court had done his duty by him.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">Mr. Henderson, the creator of Caxton, was of the large sized
  variety of schoolmaster, rather round-shouldered and with a slightly
  persecuted bearing towards parents; his mind seemed busy with many
  things&mdash;buildings, extensions, governors, chapels. Oswald walked with
  him through a field that was visibly becoming a botanical garden, towards the
  school playing-fields. Once the schoolmaster stopped, his mind distressed by
  a sudden intrusive doubt whether the exactly right place had been chosen for
  what he called a "biological pond." He had to ask various questions of a
  gardener and give certain directions. But he was listening to Oswald,
  nevertheless.</p>

  <p>Oswald discoursed upon the training of what he called "the fortunate
  Elite." "We can't properly educate the whole of our community yet, perhaps,"
  he said, "but at least these expensive boys of ours ought to be given
  everything we can possibly give them. It's to them and their class the Empire
  will look. Naturally. We ought to turn out boys who know where they are in
  the world, what the empire is and what it aims to do, who understand
  something of their responsibilities to Asia and Africa and have a philosophy
  of life and duty...."</p>

  <p>"More of that sort of thing is done," said Mr. Henderson, "than outsiders
  suppose. Masters talk to boys. Lend them books."</p>

  <p>"In an incidental sort of way," said Oswald. "But three-quarters of the
  boys you miss.... Even here, it seems, you must still have your classical
  side. You must still keep on with Latin and Greek, with courses that will
  never reach through the dull grind to the stale old culture beyond. Why not
  drop all that? Why not be modern outright, and leave Eton and Harrow and
  Winchester and Westminster to go the old ways? Why not teach modern history
  and modern philosophy in plain English here? Why not question the world we
  see, instead of the world of those dead Levantines? Why not be a modern
  school altogether?"</p>

  <p>The headmaster seemed to consider that idea. But there were the gravest of
  practical objections.</p>

  <p>"We'd get no scholarships," he considered. "Our boys would stop at a dead
  end. They'd get no appointments. They'd be dreadfully handicapped....</p>

  <p>"We're not a complete system," said Mr. Henderson. "No. We're only part of
  a big circle. We've got to take what the parents send on to us and we've got
  to send them on to college or the professions or what not. It's only part of
  a process here&mdash;only part of a process."...</p>

  <p>Just as the ultimate excuse of the private schoolmasters had been that
  they could do no more than prepare along the lines dictated for them by the
  public school, so the public school waved Oswald on to the university. Thus
  he came presently with his questions to the university, to Oxford and
  Cambridge, for it was clear these set the pattern of all the rest in England.
  He came to Oxford and Cambridge as he came to the public schools, it must be
  remembered, with a fresh mind, for the navy had snatched him straight out of
  his preparatory school away from the ordinary routines of an English
  education at the tender age of thirteen.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Oswald's investigation of Oxford and Cambridge began even
  before Peter had entered School House at Caxton. As early as the spring of
  1906, the scarred face under the soft felt hat was to be seen projecting from
  one of those brown-coloured hansom cabs that used to ply in Cambridge. His
  bag was on the top and he was going to the University Arms to install himself
  and have "a good look round the damned place." At times there still hung
  about Oswald a faint flavour of the midshipman on leave in a foreign
  town.</p>

  <p>He spent three days watching undergraduates, he prowled about the streets,
  and with his face a little on one side, brought his red-brown eye to bear on
  the books in bookshop windows and the display of socks and ties and
  handkerchiefs in the outfitters. In those years the chromatic sock was just
  dawning upon the adolescent mind, it had still to achieve the iridescent
  glories of its crowning years. But Oswald found it symptomatic; <i>ex pede
  Herculem</i>. He was to be seen surveying the Backs, and standing about among
  the bookstalls in the Market Place. He paddled a Canadian canoe to Byron's
  pool, and watched a cheerful group dispose of a huge tea in the garden of the
  inn close at hand. They seemed to joke for his benefit, neat rather than
  merry jesting. So that was Cambridge, was it? Then he went on by a tedious
  crosscountry journey to the slack horrors of one of the Oxford hotels, and
  made a similar preliminary survey of the land here that he proposed to
  prospect. There seemed to be more rubbish and more remainders in the Oxford
  secondhand bookshops and less comfort in the hotels; the place was more
  self-consciously picturesque, there was less of Diana and more of Venus about
  its beauty, a rather blowsy Gothic Venus with a bad tooth or so. So it
  impressed Oswald. The glamour of Oxford, sunrise upon Magdalen tower, Oriel,
  Pater, and so forth, were lost upon Oswald's toughened mind; he had spent his
  susceptible adolescence on a battleship, and the sunblaze of Africa had given
  him a taste for colour like a taste for raw rye whiskey....</p>

  <p>He walked about the perfect garden of St. Giles' College and beat at the
  head of Blepp, the senior tutor, whose acquaintance he had made in the
  Athenaeum, with his stock questions. The garden of St. Giles' College is as
  delicate as fine linen in lavender; its turf is supposed to make American
  visitors regret the ancestral trip in the Mayflower very bitterly; Blepp had
  fancied that in a way it answered Oswald. But Oswald turned his glass eye and
  his ugly side to the garden, it might just as well have not been there, and
  kept to his questioning; "What are we making of our boys here? What are they
  going to make of the Empire? What are you teaching them? What are you not
  teaching them? How are you working them? And why? Why? What's the idea of it
  all? Suppose presently when this fine October in history ends, that the
  weather of the world breaks up; what will you have ready for the storm?"</p>

  <p>Blepp felt the ungraciousness of such behaviour acutely.</p>

  <p>It was like suddenly asking the host of some great beautiful dinner-party
  whether he earned his income honestly. Like shouting it up the table at him.
  But Oswald was almost as comfortable a guest for a don to entertain as a spur
  in one's trouser pocket. Blepp did his best to temper the occasion by an
  elaborate sweet reasonableness.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think there's something in our atmosphere?" he began.</p>

  <p>"I don't like your atmosphere. The Oxford shops seem grubby little shops.
  The streets are narrow and badly lit." *</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking of the shops."</p>

  <p>"It's where the youngsters buy their stuff, their furniture, and as far as
  I can see, most of their ideas."</p>

  <p>"You'll be in sympathy with the American lady who complained the other day
  about our want of bathrooms," Blepp sneered.</p>

  <p>"Well, why not?" said Oswald outrageously.</p>

  <p>Blepp shrugged his shoulders and looked for sympathy at the twisted brick
  chimneys of St. Giles'.</p>

  <p>Oswald became jerkily eloquent. "We've got an empire sprawling all over
  the world. We're a people at grips with all mankind. And in a few years these
  few thousand men here and at Cambridge and a few thousand in the other
  universities, have practically to be the mind of the empire. Think of the
  problems that press upon us as an empire. All the nations sharpen themselves
  now like knives. Are we making the mentality to solve the Irish riddle here?
  Are we preparing any outlook for India here? What are you doing here to get
  ready for such tasks as these?"</p>

  <p>"How can I show you the realities that go on beneath the surface?" said
  Blepp. "You don't see what is brewing today, the talk that goes on in the
  men's rooms, the mutual polishing of minds, Look not at our formal life but
  our informal life. Consider one college, consider for example Balliol. Think
  of the Jowett influence, the Milner group&mdash;not blind to the empire
  there, were we? Even that fellow Belloc. A saucy rogue, but good rich stuff.
  All out of just one college. These are things one cannot put in a syllabus.
  These are things that defeat statistics."</p>

  <p>"But that is no reason why you should put chaff and dry bones into the
  syllabus," said Oswald....</p>

  <p>"This place," said Oswald, and waved his arm at the great serenity of St.
  Giles', "it has the air of a cathedral close. It might be a beautiful place
  of retirement for sad and weary old men. It seems a thousand miles from
  machinery, from great towns and the work of the world."</p>

  <p>"Would you have us teach in a foundry?"</p>

  <p>"I'd have you teaching something about the storm that seems to me to be
  gathering in the world of labour. These youngsters here are going to be the
  statesmen, the writers and teachers, the lawyers, the high officials, the big
  employers, of tomorrow. But all that world of industry they have to control
  seems as far off here as if it were-on another planet. You're not talking
  about it, you're not thinking about it. You're teaching about the Gracchi and
  the Greek fig trade. You 're magnifying that pompous bore Cicero and
  minimizing &mdash;old Salisbury for example&mdash;who was a far more
  important figure in history&mdash;a greater man in a greater world."</p>

  <p>"With all respect to his memory," said Blepp, "but <i>good Lord</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Much greater. Your classics put out your perspective. Dozens of living
  statesmen are greater than Cicero. Of course our moderns are greater. If only
  because of the greatness of our horizons. Oxford and Cambridge ought to be
  the learning and thinking part of the whole empire, twin hemispheres in the
  imperial brain. But when I think of the size of the imperial body, its
  hundreds of nations, its thousands of cities, its tribes, its vast extension
  round and about the world, the immense problem of it, and then of the size
  and quality of this, I'm reminded of the Atlantosaurus. You've heard of the
  beast? Its brain was smaller than the ganglia of its rump. No doubt its brain
  thought itself quite up to its job. It wasn't. Something ate up the
  Atlantosaurus. These two places, this place, ought to be big enough, and
  bigly conceived enough, to irradiate our whole world with ideas. All the
  empire. They ought to dominate the minds of hundreds of millions of men. And
  they dominate nothing. Leave India and Africa out of it. They do not even
  dominate England. Think only of your labour at home, of that huge blind
  Titan, whom you won't understand, which doesn't understand you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There again," interrupted Blepp sharply, "you are simply ignorant of what
  is going on here. Because Oxford has a certain traditional beauty and a
  decent respect for the past, because it doesn't pose and assert itself rawly,
  you are offended. You do not realize how active we can be, how up-to-date we
  are. It wouldn't make us more modern in spirit if we lived in enamelled
  bathrooms and lectured in corrugated iron sheds. That isn't modernity. That's
  your mistake. In respect to this very question of labour, we have got our
  labour contact. Have you never heard of Ruskin College? Founded here by an
  American of the most modern type, one Vrooman." He repeated the name
  "Vrooman," not as though he loved it but as though he thought it ought to
  appeal to Oswald. "I think he came from Chicago." Surely a Teutonic name from
  Chicago was modern enough to satisfy any one! "It is a college of real
  working-men, of the Trade Union leader type, the actual horny-handed article,
  who come up here&mdash;I suppose because they don't agree with your idea that
  we deal only in the swathings of mummies. They at any rate think that we have
  something to tell the modern world, something worth their learning. Perhaps
  they know their needs better than you do."</p>

  <p>Oswald was momentarily abashed. He expressed a desire to visit this Ruskin
  College.</p>

  <p>Blepp explained he was not himself connected with the college. "Not quite
  my line," said Blepp parenthetically; but he could arrange for a visit under
  proper guidance, and presently under the wing of a don of radical tendencies
  Oswald went.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him the most touching and illuminating thing in Oxford. It
  reminded him of <i>Jude The Obscure</i>.</p>

  <p>Ruskin College was sheltered over some stables in a back street, and it
  displayed a small group of oldish young men, for the most part with north-
  country accents, engaged in living under austere circumstances&mdash;they
  paid scarcely anything and did all the housework&mdash;and doing their best
  to get hold of the precious treasure of knowledge and understanding they were
  persuaded Oxford possessed. They had come up on their savings by virtue of
  extraordinary sacrifices. Graduation in any of the Oxford schools was
  manifestly impossible to them, if only on account of the Greek bar; the
  university had no use for these respectful pilgrims and no intention of
  encouraging more of them, and the "principal," Mr. Dennis Hird, in the teeth
  of much opposition, was vamping a sort of course for them with the aid of a
  few liberal-minded junior dons who delivered a lecture when their proper
  engagements permitted. There was a vague suggestion of perplexity in the
  conversation of the two students with whom Oswald talked. This tepid drip of
  disconnected instruction wasn't what they had expected, but then, what had
  they expected? Vrooman, the idealist who had set the thing going, had
  returned to America leaving much to be explained. Oswald dined with Blepp at
  St. Osyth's that night, and spoke over the port in the common room of these
  working men who were "dunning Oxford for wisdom."</p>

  <p>Jarlow, the wit of the college, who had been entertaining the company with
  the last half-dozen Spoonerisms he had invented, was at once reminded of a
  little poem he had made, and he recited it. It was supposed to be by one of
  these same Ruskin College men, and his artless rhyming of * l Socrates" and
  "fates" and "sides" and "Euripides," combined with a sort of modest
  pretentiousness of thought and intention, was very laughable indeed.
  Everybody laughed merrily except Oswald.</p>

  <p>"That's quite one of your best, Jarlow," said Blepp.</p>

  <p>But Oxford had been rubbing Oswald's fur backwards that day. The common
  room became aware of him sitting up stiffly and regarding Jarlow with an evil
  expression.</p>

  <p>"Why the Devil," said Oswald, addressing himself pointedly and querulously
  to Jarlow, "shouldn't a working-man say 'So-crates?' We all say 'Paris.'
  These men do Oxford too much honour."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">Perhaps there was a sort of necessity in the educational
  stagnation of England during those crucial years before the Great War. All
  the influential and important people of the country were having a thoroughly
  good time, and if there was a growing quarrel between worker and employer no
  one saw any reason in that for sticking a goad into the teacher. The
  disposition of the mass of men is always on the side of custom against
  innovation. The clear-headed effort of yesterday tends always to become the
  unintelligent routine of tomorrow. So long as we get along we go along. In
  the less exacting days of good Queen Victoria the educational processes of
  Great Britain had served well enough; they still went on because the
  necessity for a more thorough, coherent, and lucid education had still to be
  made glaringly manifest. Few people understood the discontent of a Ray
  Lankester, the fretfulness of a Kipling. Foresight dies when the imagination
  slumbers. Only catastrophe can convince the mass of people of the possibility
  of catastrophe. The system had the inertia of a spinning top. The most
  thoroughly and completely mis-taught of one generation became the
  mis-teachers of the next. "Learn, obey, create nothing, initiate nothing,
  have no troublesome doubts," ran the rules of scholarly discretion.
  "Prize-boy, scholar, fellow, don, pedagogue; prize-boy, scholar, fellow,
  don"&mdash;so spun the circle of the schools. Into that relentless circle the
  bright, curious little Peters, who wanted to know about the insides of
  animals and the way of machines and what was happening, were drawn; the
  little Joans, too, were being drawn. The best escaped complete deadening,
  they found a use for themselves, but life usually kept them too busy and used
  them too hard for them ever to return to teach in college or school of the
  realities they had experienced. And so as Joan and Peter grew up, Oswald
  became more and more tolerant of a certain rabble rout of inky outsiders who,
  without authority and dignity, were at least putting living ideas of social
  function and relationship in the way of adolescent enquiry.</p>

  <p>It became manifest to Oswald that the real work of higher education, the
  discussion of God, of the state and of sex, of all the great issues in life,
  while it was being elaborately evaded in the formal education of the country,
  was to a certain extent being done, thinly, unsatisfactorily, pervertedly
  even by the talk of boys and girls among themselves, by the casual
  suggestions of tutors, friends, and chance acquaintances, and more
  particularly by a number of irresponsible journalists and literary men. For
  example though the higher education of the country afforded no comprehensive
  view of social inter-relationship at all, the propaganda of the socialists
  did give a scheme&mdash;Oswald thought it was a mistaken and wrong-headed
  scheme&mdash;of economic interdependence. If the school showed nothing to
  their children of the Empire but a few tiresome maps, Kipling's stories, for
  all his Jingo violence, did at least breathe something of its living spirit.
  As Joan and Peter grew up they ferreted out and brought to their guardian's
  knowledge a school of irresponsible contemporary teachers, Shaw, Wells and
  the other Fabian Society pamphleteers, the Belloc-Chesterton group,
  Cunninghame Graham, Edward Carpenter, Orage of <i>The New Age,</i>
  Galsworthy, Cannan; the suffragettes, and the like. If the formal teachers
  lacked boldness these strange self-appointed instructors seemed to be nothing
  if not bold. <i>The Freewoman</i>, which died to rise again as <i>The New
  Freewoman</i>, existed it seemed chiefly to mention everything that a young
  lady should never dream of mentioning. Aunt Phoebe's monthly,
  <i>Wayleaves</i>, in its green and purple cover, made a gallant effort to
  outdo that valiant weekly. Aunt Phoebe was a bright and irresponsible
  assistant in the education of Oswald's wards. She sowed the house with
  strange books whenever she came to stay with them. Oswald found Joan reading
  Oscar Wilde when she was seventeen. He did not interrupt her reading, for he
  could not imagine how to set about the interruption. Later on he discovered a
  most extraordinary volume by Havelock Ellis lying in the library, an
  impossible volume. He read in it a little and then put it down. Afterwards he
  could not believe that book existed. He thought he must have dreamt about it,
  or dreamt the contents into it. It seemed incredible that Aunt Phoebe!... He
  was never quite sure. When he went to look for it again it had vanished, and
  he did not like to ask for it.</p>

  <p>More and more did this outside supplement of education in England press
  upon Oswald's reluctant attention. Most of these irregulars he disliked by
  nature and tradition. None of them had the dignity and restraint of the great
  Victorians, the Corinthian elegance of Ruskin, the Teutonic hammer-blows of
  Carlyle. Shaw he understood was a lean, red-haired Pantaloon, terribly
  garrulous and vain; Belloc and Chesterton thrust a shameless obesity upon the
  public attention; the social origins of most of the crew were appalling,
  Bennett was a solicitor's clerk from the potteries, Wells a counter-jumper,
  Orage came from Leeds. Oswald had seen a picture of Wells by Max that
  confirmed his worst suspicions about these people; a heavy bang of hair
  assisted a cascade moustache to veil a pasty face that was broad rather than
  long and with a sly, conceited expression; the creature still wore a long and
  crumpled frock coat, acquired no doubt during his commercial phase, and
  rubbed together two large, clammy, white, misshapen hands. Except for
  Cunninghame Graham there was not a gentleman, as Oswald understood the word,
  among them all. But these writers got hold of the intelligent young because
  they did at least write freely where the university teacher feared to tread.
  They wrote, he thought, without any decent restraint. They seasoned even
  wholesome suggestions with a flavour of scandalous excitement. It remained an
  open question in his mind whether they did more good by making young people
  think or more harm by making them think wrong. Progressive dons he found
  maintained the former opinion. With that support Oswald was able to follow
  his natural disposition and leave the reading of his two wards
  unrestrained.</p>

  <p>And they read&mdash;and thought, to such purpose as will be presently
  told.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">But here Justice demands an interlude.</p>

  <p>Before we go on to tell of how Joan and Peter grew up to adolescence in
  these schools that Oswald&mdash;assisted by Aunt Phyllis in the case of
  Joan&mdash;found for them, Mr. Mackinder must have his say, and make the
  Apology of the Schoolmaster. He made it to Oswald when first Oswald visited
  him and chose his school out of all the other preparatory schools, to be
  Peter's. He appeared as a little brown man with a hedgehog's nose and much of
  the hedgehog's indignant note in his voice. He came, shy and hostile, into
  the drawing-room in which Oswald awaited him. It was, by the by, the most
  drawing-room-like drawing-room that Oswald had ever been in; it was as if
  some one had said to a furniture dealer, "People expect me to have a
  drawing-room. Please let me have exactly the sort of drawing-room that people
  expect." It displayed a grand piano towards the French window, a large
  standard lamp with an enormous shade, a pale silk sofa, an Ottoman, a big
  fern in an ornate pot, and water-colours of Venetian lagoons. In the midst of
  it all stood Mr. Mackinder, in a highly contracted state, mutely radiating an
  interrogative "Well?"</p>

  <p>"I'm looking for a school for my nephew," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"You want him here?"</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;Do you mind if first of all I see something of the
  school?"</p>

  <p>"We're always open to investigation," said Mr. Mackinder, bitterly.</p>

  <p>"I want to do the very best I can for this boy. I feel very strongly that
  it's my duty to him and the country to turn him out&mdash;as well as a boy
  can be turned out."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mackinder nodded his head and continued to listen.</p>

  <p>This was something new in private schoolmasters. For the most part they
  had opened themselves out to Oswald, like sunflowers, like the receptive
  throats of nestlings. They had embraced and silenced him by the wealth of
  their assurances.</p>

  <p>"I have two little wards," he said. "A boy and a girl. I want to make all
  I can of them. They ought to belong to the Elite. The strength of a
  country&mdash;of an empire&mdash;depends ultimately almost entirely on its
  Elite. This empire isn't overwhelmed with intelligence, and most of the talk
  we hear about the tradition of statesmanship-Mr. Mackinder made a short
  snorting noise through his nose that seemed to indicate his opinion of
  contemporary statesmanship.</p>

  <p>"You see I take this schooling business very solemnly. These upper-class
  schools, I say, these schools for the sons of prosperous people and
  scholarship winners, are really Elite-making machines. They really
  make&mdash;or fail to make &mdash;the Empire. That makes me go about asking
  schoolmasters a string of questions. Some of them don't like my questions.
  Perhaps they are too elementary. I ask: what is this education of yours up
  to? What is the design of the whole? What is this preparation of yours for?
  This is called a Preparatory School. You lay the foundations. What is the
  design of the building for which these foundations are laid?"</p>

  <p>He paused, determined to make Mr. Mackinder say something before he
  discoursed further.</p>

  <p>"It isn't so simple as that," was wrung from Mr. Mackinder. " Suppose we
  just walk round the school. Suppose we just see the sort of place it is and
  what we are doing here. Then perhaps you'll be able to see better what we
  contribute&mdash;in the way of making a citizen."</p>

  <p>The inspection was an unusually satisfactory one. White Court was one of
  the few private schools Oswald had seen that had been built expressly for its
  purpose. Its class rooms were well lit and well arranged, its little science
  museum seemed good and well arranged and well provided with diagrams; its
  gymnasium was businesslike; its wall blackboards unusually abundant and
  generously used, and everything was tidy. Nevertheless the Catechism for
  Schoolmasters was not spared. "Now," said Oswald, "now for the
  curriculum?"</p>

  <p>"We live in the same world with most other English schools," Mr. Mackinder
  sulked. "This is a preparatory school."</p>

  <p>"What are called English subjects?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"How do you teach geography?"</p>

  <p>"With books and maps."</p>

  <p>Oswald spoke of lantern slides and museum visits. The cinema had yet to
  become an educational possibility.</p>

  <p>"I do what I can," said Mr. Mackinder; "I'm not a millionaire."</p>

  <p>"Do you <i>do</i> classics?"</p>

  <p>"We do Latin. Clever boys do a little Greek. In preparation for the public
  schools."</p>

  <p>"Grammar of course?...</p>

  <p>"What else?....</p>

  <p>"French, German, Latin, Greek, bits of mathematics, botany, geography,
  bits of history, book-keeping, music lessons, some water-colour painting;
  it's very mixed," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"It's miscellaneous."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mackinder roused himself to a word of defence: "The boys don't
  specialize."</p>

  <p>"But this is a diet of scraps," said Oswald, reviving one of the most
  controversial topics of the catechism. "Nothing can be done thoroughly."</p>

  <p>"We are necessarily elementary."</p>

  <p>"It's rather like the White Knight in <i>Alice In Wonderland</i> packing
  his luggage for nowhere."</p>

  <p>"We have to teach what is required of us," said Mr. Mackinder.</p>

  <p>"But what is education up to?" asked Oswald.</p>

  <p>As Mr. Mackinder offered no answer to that riddle, Oswald went on. "What
  is Education in England up to, anyhow? In Uganda we knew what we were doing.
  There was an idea in it. The old native tradition was breaking up. We taught
  them to count and reckon English fashion, to read and write, we gave them
  books and the Christian elements, so that they could join on to our
  civilization and play a part in the great world that was breaking up their
  little world. We didn't teach them anything that didn't serve mind or soul or
  body. We saw the end of what we were doing. But half this school teaching of
  yours is like teaching in a dream. You don't teach the boy what he wants to
  know and needs to know. You spend half his time on calculations he has no use
  for, mere formal calculations, and on this dead language stuff! It's like
  trying to graft mummy steak on living flesh. It's like boiling fossils for
  soup."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mackinder said nothing.</p>

  <p>"And damn it!" said Oswald petulantly; "your school is about as good a
  school as I've seen or am likely to see....</p>

  <p>"I had an idea," he went on, "of just getting the very best out of those
  two youngsters&mdash;the boy especially&mdash;of making every hour of his
  school work a gift of so much power or skill or subtlety, of opening the
  world to him like a magic book.... The boy's tugging at the magic
  covers...."</p>

  <p>He stopped short.</p>

  <p>"There are no such schools," said Mr. Mackinder compactly. "This is as
  good a school as you will find."</p>

  <p>And there he left the matter for the time. But in the evening he dined
  with Oswald at his hotel, and it may be that iced champagne had something to
  do with a certain relaxation from his afternoon restraint. Oswald had already
  arranged about Peter, but he wanted the little man to talk more. So he set
  him an example. He talked of his own life. He represented it as a life of
  disappointment and futility. "I envy you your life of steadfast usefulness."
  He spoke of his truncated naval career and his disfigurement. Of the years of
  uncertainty that had followed. He talked of the ambitions and achievements of
  other men, of the large hopes and ambitions of youth.</p>

  <p>"I too," said Mr. Mackinder, warming for a moment, and then left his
  sentence unfinished. Oswald continued to generalize....</p>

  <p>"All life, I suppose, is disappointment&mdash;is anyhow largely
  disappointment," said Mr. Mackinder presently.</p>

  <p>"We get something done."</p>

  <p>"Five per cent., ten per cent., of what we meant to do."</p>

  <p>The schoolmaster reflected. Oswald refilled his glass for him.</p>

  <p>"To begin with I thought, none of these other fellows really know how to
  run a school. I will, I said, make a nest of Young Paragons. I will take a
  bunch of boys and get the best out of them, the best possible; watch them,
  study them, foster them, make a sort of boy so that the White Court brand
  shall be looked for and recognized...."</p>

  <p>He sipped his faintly seething wine and put down the glass.</p>

  <p>"Five per cent," he said; "ten per cent, perhaps." He touched his lips
  with his dinner-napkin. "I have turned out some creditable boys."</p>

  <p>"Did you make any experiments in the subjects you taught?"</p>

  <p>"At first. But one of the things we discover in life as we grow past the
  first flush of beginning, is just how severely we are conditioned. We are
  conditioned. We seem to be free. And we are in a net. You have criticized my
  curriculum today pretty severely, Mr. Sydenham. Much that you say is
  absolutely right. It is wasteful, discursive, ineffective. Yes.... But in my
  place I doubt if you could have made it much other than it is....</p>

  <p>"One or two things I do. Latin grammar here is taught, on lines strictly
  parallel with the English and French and German&mdash;that is to say, we
  teach languages comparatively. It was troublesome to arrange, but it makes a
  difference mentally. And I take a class in Formal Logic; English teaching is
  imperfect, expression is slovenly, without that. The boys write English
  verse. The mathematical teaching too, is as modern as the examining boards
  will let it be. Small things, perhaps. But you do not know the obstacles.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sydenham, your talk today has reminded me of all the magnificent
  things I set out to do at White Court, when I sank my capital in building
  White Court six and twenty years ago. When I found that I couldn't control
  the choice of subjects, when I found that in that matter I was ruled by the
  sort of schools and colleges the boys had to go on to and by the preposterous
  examinations they would have to pass, then I told myself, 'at least I can
  cultivate their characters and develop something like a soul in them, instead
  of crushing out individuality and imagination as most schools do...'</p>

  <p>"Well, I think I have a house of clean-minded and cheerful and willing
  boys, and I think they all tell the truth...."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what I'm to do with the religious teaching of these two
  youngsters of mine," said Oswald abruptly. "Practically, they're
  Godless."</p>

  <p>Mr. Mackinder did not speak for a little while. Then he said, "It is
  almost unavoidable, under existing conditions, that the religious teaching in
  a school should be&mdash;formal and orthodox.</p>

  <p>"For my own part&mdash;I'm liberal," said Mr. Mackinder, and added, "very
  liberal. Let me tell you, Mr. Sydenham, exactly how I see things."</p>

  <p>He paused for a moment as if he collected his views.</p>

  <p>"If a little boy has grown up in a home, in the sort of home which one
  might describe as God-fearing, if he has not only heard of God but seen God
  as a living influence upon the people about him, then&mdash;then, I admit,
  you have something real. He will believe in God. He will know God.
  God&mdash;simply because of the faith about him&mdash;will be a knowable
  reality. God is a faith. In men. Such a boy's world will fall into shape
  about the idea of God. He will take God as a matter of course. Such a boy can
  be religious from childhood&mdash;yes.... But there are very few such
  homes."</p>

  <p>"Less, probably, than there used to be?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mackinder disavowed an answer by a gesture of hands and shoulders. He
  went on, frowning slightly as he talked. * He wanted to say exactly what he
  thought. "For all other boys, Mr. Sydenham, God, for all practical purposes,
  does not exist. Their worlds have been made without him; they do not think in
  terms of him; and if he is to come into their lives at all he must come in
  from the outside&mdash;a discovery, like a mighty rushing wind. By what is
  called Conversion. At adolescence. Until that happens you must build the soul
  on pride, on honour, on the decent instincts. It is all you have. And the
  less they hear about God the better. They will not understand. It will be a
  cant to them&mdash;a kind of indelicacy. The two greatest things in the world
  have been the most vulgarized. God and sex. . . If I had my own way I would
  have no religious services for my boys at all."</p>

  <p>"Instead of which?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Mackinder paused impressively before replying.</p>

  <p>"The local curate is preparing two of my elder boys for Confirmation at
  the present time."</p>

  <p>He gazed gloomily at the tablecloth. "If one could do as one liked!" he
  said. "If only one could do as one liked!"</p>

  <p>But now Oswald was realizing for the first time the eternal tragedy of the
  teacher, that sower of unseen harvests, that reaper of thistles and the wind,
  that serf of custom, that subjugated rebel, that feeble, persistent
  antagonist of the triumphant things' that rule him. And behind that immediate
  tragedy Oswald was now apprehending for the first time something more
  universally tragic, an incessantly recurring story of high hopes and a grey
  ending; the story of boys and girls, clean and sweet-minded, growing up into
  life, and of the victory of world inertia, of custom drift and the tarnishing
  years.</p>

  <p>Mr. Mackinder spoke of his own youth. Quite early in life had come
  physical humiliations, the realization that his slender and delicate physique
  debarred him from most active occupations, and his resolve to be of use in
  some field where his weak and undersized body would be at no great
  disadvantage. "I made up my mind that teaching should be my religion," he
  said.</p>

  <p>He told of the difficulties he had encountered in his attempts to get any
  pedagogic science or training. "This is the most difficult profession in the
  world," he said, "and the most important. Yet it is not studied; it has no
  established practice; it is not endowed. Buildings are endowed and
  institutions, but not teachers." And in Great Britain, in the schools of the
  classes that will own and rule the country, ninety-nine per cent, of the work
  was done by unskilled workmen, by low-grade, genteel women and young men. In
  America the teachers were nearly all women. "How can we expect to raise a
  nation nearly as good as we might do under such a handicap?" He had read and
  learnt what he could about teaching; he had served for small salaries in
  schools that seemed living and efficient; finally he had built his own school
  with his own money. He had had the direst difficulties in getting a staff
  together. "What can one expect?" he said. "We pay them hardly better than
  shop assistants&mdash;less than bank clerks. You see the relative importance
  of things in the British mind." What hope or pride was there to inspire an
  assistant schoolmaster to do good work?</p>

  <p>"I thought I could make a school different from all other schools, and I
  found I had to make a school like most other fairly good schools. I had to
  work for what the parents required of me, and the ideas of the parents had
  been shaped by their schools. I had never dreamt of the immensity of the
  resistance these would offer to constructive change. In this world there are
  incessant changes, but most of them are landslides or epidemics.... I tried
  to get away from stereotyping examinations. I couldn't. I tried to get away
  from formal soul-destroying religion. I couldn't. I tried to get a staff of
  real assistants. I couldn't. I had to take what came. I had to be what was
  required of me....</p>

  <p>"One works against time always. Over against the Parents. It is not only
  the boys one must educate, but the parents&mdash;let alone one's self. The
  parents demand impossible things. I have been asked for Greek and for
  bookkeeping by double-entry by the same parent. I had&mdash;I had to leave
  the matter&mdash;as if I thought such things were possible. After all, the
  Parent is master. One can't run a school without boys,"</p>

  <p>"You'd get some boys," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Not enough. I'm up against time. The school has to pay."</p>

  <p>"Can't you hold out for a time? Run the school on a handful of
  oatmeal?"</p>

  <p>"It's running it on an overdraft I don't fancy. You're not a married man,
  Mr. Sydenham, with sons to consider,"</p>

  <p>"No," said Oswald shortly. "But I have these wards. And, after all,
  there's not only today but tomorrow. If the world is going wrong for want of
  education . If you don't give it your sons will suffer."</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow, perhaps. But today comes first. I'm up against time. Oh, I'm up
  against time."</p>

  <p>He sat with his hands held out supine on the table before him.</p>

  <p>"I started my school twenty-seven years ago next Hilary. And it seems like
  yesterday. When I started it I meant it to be something memorable in
  schools.... I jumped into it. I thought I should swim about.... It was like
  jumping into the rapids of Niagara. I was seized, I was rushed along.... Ai!
  Ai!..."</p>

  <p>"Time's against us all," said Oswald. "I suppose the next glacial age will
  overtake us long before we're ready to fight out our destiny."</p>

  <p>"If you want to feel the generations rushing to waste," said Mr.
  Mackinder, "like rapids&mdash;like rapids&mdash;you must put your heart and
  life into a private school."</p>

  <p class="first">"THE generations rushing to waste like rapids&mdash;like
  rapids...."</p>

  <p>Ten years later Oswald found himself repeating the words of the little
  private schoolmaster.</p>

  <p>He was in the gravest perplexity. Joan was now nineteen and a half and
  Peter almost of age, and they had had a violent quarrel. They would not live
  in the same house together any longer, they declared. Peter had gone back
  overnight to Cambridge on his motor bicycle; Joan's was out of order&mdash;an
  embittering addition to her distress&mdash;and she had cycled on her push
  bicycle over the hills that morning to Bishop's Stortford to catch the
  Cambridge train. And Oswald was left to think over the situation and all that
  had led to it.</p>

  <p>He sat alone in the May sunshine in the little arbour that overlooked his
  rose garden at Pelham Ford, trying to grasp all that had happened to these
  stormy young people since he had so boldly taken the care of their lives into
  his hands. He found himself trying to retrace the phases of their upbringing,
  and his thoughts went wide and far over the problem of human training.
  Suddenly he had discovered his charges adult. Joan had stood before him,
  amazingly grown up&mdash;a woman, young, beautiful, indignant.</p>

  <p>Who could have foretold ten years ago that Joan would have been declaring
  with tears in her voice but much stiffness in her manner, that she had "stood
  enough" from Peter, and calling him "weak."</p>

  <p>"He insults all my friends, Nobby," she had said, "and as for his&mdash;.
  He's like that puppy we had who dug up rotten bones we had never suspected,
  all over the garden.</p>

  <p>"Oh! <i>his women are horrible</i>!" Joan had cried....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">Oswald's choice of a permanent home at Pelham Ford had been
  largely determined by the educational requirements of Joan and Peter. While
  Peter had been at White Court and Joan at Highmorton School twelve miles
  away, Oswald had occupied a not very well furnished "furnished house" at
  Margate. When Peter, after an inquisition by Oswald into English Public
  Schools, had been awarded at last as a sort of prize, with reservations, to
  Caxton, Oswald&mdash;convinced now by his doctors and his own disagreeable
  experiences that he must live in England for the rest of his life if he was
  to hope for any comfort or activity&mdash;decided to set up a permanent home
  with a garden and buildings that would be helpful through days of dullness in
  some position reasonably accessible from London, Caxton and Margate, and
  later on from Cambridge, to which they were both predestined. After some
  search he found the house he needed in the pretty little valley of the Ash,
  that runs north-eastward from Ware. The Stubland aunts still remained as
  tenants of The Ingle-Nook, and made it a sort of alternative home for the
  youngsters.</p>

  <p>The country to the north and east of Ware is a country of miniature gorges
  with frequent water-splashes. The stream widens and crosses the road in a
  broad, pebbly shallow of ripples just at the end of Pelham Ford, there is a
  causeway with a white handrail for bicycles and foot passengers beside the
  ford, and beyond it is an inn and the post office and such thatched,
  whitewashed homes as constitute the village. Then beyond comes a row of big
  trees and the high red wall and iron gates of this house Oswald had taken.
  The church of Pelham Ford is a little humped, spireless building up the hill
  to the left. The stream brawls along for a time beside the road. Through the
  gates of the house one looks across a lawn barred by the shadows of big
  trees, at a blazing flower-garden that goes up a series of terraces to the
  little red tiled summerhouse that commands the view of the valley. The house
  is to the right and near the road, a square comfortable eighteenth-century
  red-brick house with ivy on its shadowed side and fig trees and rose trees
  towards the sun. It has a classical portico, and a grave but friendly
  expression.</p>

  <p>The Margate house had been a camp, but this was furnished with some
  deliberation. Oswald had left a miscellany of possessions behind him in
  Uganda which Muir had packed and sent on after him when it was settled that
  there could be no return to .Africa. The hall befitted the home of a member
  of the Plantain Club; African spoils adorned it, three lions' heads, a white
  rhinoceros head, elephants' feet, spears, gourds, tusks; in the midst a large
  table took the visitor's hat and stick, and bore a large box for the post.
  Out of this hall opened a little close study Oswald rarely used except when
  Joan and Peter and their friends were at home and a passage led to a sunny,
  golden-brown library possessing three large southward windows on the garden,
  a room it had pleased him greatly to furnish, and in which he did most of his
  writing. It had a parquet floor and Oriental rugs like sunlit flower-beds.
  Across the hall, opposite the study, was a sort of sittingroom-livingroom
  which was given over to Joan and Peter. It had been called the Schoolroom in
  the days when their holiday visits had been mitigated by the presence of some
  temporary governess or tutor, and now that those disciplined days were over
  their two developing personalities still jostled in the one apartment. A
  large pleasant drawing-room and a dining-room completed the tale of rooms on
  the ground floor.</p>

  <p>In this room across the hall there was much that would have repaid
  research on the part of Oswald. The room was a joint room only when Joan and
  Peter were without guests in the house. Whenever there were guests, whether
  they were women or men, Joan turned out and the room became a refuge or
  rendezvous for Peter. It was therefore rather Peter's than Joan's. Here as in
  most things it was Peter's habit to prevail over Joan. But she had her
  rights; she had had a voice in the room's decoration, a share in its
  disorder. The upper bookshelves to the right of the fireplace were hers and
  the wall next to that. Against this stood her bureau, locked and secure, over
  and against Peter's bureau. Oswald had given them these writing desks three
  Christmasses ago. But the mess on the table under the window was Peter's, and
  Peter had more than his fair share of the walls. The stuffed birds and
  animals and a row of sculls were the result of a "Mooseum" phase of Peter's
  when he was fourteen. The water-colour pictures were Peter's. The hearthrug
  was the lion-skin that Peter still believed had been brought for him from
  Nairobi by Oswald.</p>

  <p>Peter could caricature, and his best efforts were framed here; his style
  was a deliberate compliment to the incomparable Max. He had been very
  successful in bringing out the latent fierceness of Joan; one not ungraceful
  effort was called "The Scalp Dance," the other, less pleasing to its subject,
  represented Joan in full face with her hands behind her back and her feet
  apart, "Telling the Whole Troof." Joan, alas! had no corresponding skill for
  a retort, but she had framed an enlargement of a happy snapshot of Peter on
  the garden wall. She had stood below arid held her camera up so that Peter's
  boots and legs were immense and his head dwindled to nothing in perspective.
  So seen, he became an embodiment of masculine brutality. The legend was, "The
  Camera Can Detect What Our Eyes Cannot."</p>

  <p>One corner of this room was occupied by a pianola piano and a large untidy
  collection of classical music rolls; right and left of the fireplace the
  bookshelves bore an assortment of such literature as appealed in those days
  to animated youth, classics of every period from Plato to Shaw, and such
  moderns as Compton Mackenzie, Masefield, Gilbert Cannan and Ezra Pound. Back
  numbers of <i>The Freewoman</i>, <i>The New Age</i>, <i>The New
  Statesman</i>, and <i>The Poetry Review</i> mingled on the lowest shelf.
  There was a neat row of philosophical textbooks in the Joan section; Joan for
  no particular reason was taking the moral science tripos; and a microscope
  stood on Peter's table, for he was biological....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Oswald's domestic arrangements had at first been a grave
  perplexity. In Uganda he had kept house very well with a Swahili over-man and
  a number of "boys"; in Margate this sort of service was difficult to obtain,
  and the holiday needs of the children seemed to demand a feminine influence
  of the governess-companion type, a "lady." A succession of refined feminine
  personalities had intersected these years of Oswald's life. They were all
  ladies by birth and profession, they all wore collars supported by whalebone
  about their necks, and they all developed and betrayed a tenderness for
  Oswald that led to a series of flights to the Climax Club and firm but
  generous dismissals. Oswald's ideas of matrimony were crude and commonplace;
  he could imagine himself marrying no one but a buxom young woman of
  three-and-twenty, and he could not imagine any buxom young woman of
  three-and-twenty taking a healthy interest in a man over forty with only half
  a face and fits of fever and fretfulness. When these ladies one after another
  threw out their gentle intimations he had the ingratitude to ascribe their
  courage to a sense of his own depreciated matrimonial value. This caused just
  enough indignation to nerve him to the act of dismissal. But on each occasion
  he spent the best part of a morning and made serious inroads upon the club
  notepaper before the letter of dismissal was framed, and he always fell back
  upon the stock lie that he was going abroad to a <i>Kurort</i> and was going
  to lock up the house. On each occasion the house was locked up for three or
  four weeks, and Oswald lived a nomadic existence until a fresh lady could be
  found. Finally God sent him Mrs. Moxton.</p>

  <p>She came in at Margate during an interregnum while Aunt Phyllis was in
  control. Aunt Phyllis after a reflective interview passed her on to Oswald.
  She was more like Britannia than one could have imagined possible; her face
  was perhaps a little longer and calmer and her pink chins rather more
  numerous.</p>

  <p>"I understand," she said, seating herself against Oswald's desk, "that you
  are in need of some one to take charge of your household."</p>

  <p>"Did you&mdash;hear?" began Oswald.</p>

  <p>"It's the talk of Margate," she said calmly.</p>

  <p>"So I understand that you are prepared to be the lady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am not a lady," said Mrs. Moxton with a faint asperity.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"I am a housekeeper," she said, as who should say: "at least give me
  credit for that." "I have had experience with a single gentleman."</p>

  <p>There seemed to be an idea in it.</p>

  <p>"I was housekeeper to the late Mr. Justice Benlees for some years, until
  he died, and then unhappily, being in receipt of a small pension from him, I
  took to keeping a boarding-house. Winnipeg House. On the Marine Parade. A
  most unpleasant and anxious experience." Her note of indignation returned,
  and the clear pink of her complexion deepened by a shade. "A torrent of
  Common People."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Oswald. "I have seen them walking about the town. Beastly
  new yellow boots. And fast, squeaky little girls in those new floppy white
  hats. You think you could dispose of the boarding-house?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Moxton compressed her chins slightly in assent.</p>

  <p>"It's a saleable concern?"</p>

  <p>"There are those," said Mrs. Moxton with a faint sense of the marvels of
  God's universe in her voice, "who would be glad of it."</p>

  <p>He rested his face on his hand and regarded her profile very earnestly
  with his one red-brown eye&mdash;from the beginning to the end of the
  interview Mrs. Moxton never once looked straight at him. He perceived that
  she was incapable of tenderness, dissimulation, or any personal relationship,
  a woman in profile, a woman with a pride in her work, a woman to be
  trusted.</p>

  <p>"You'll do, "he said.</p>

  <p>"Of course, Sir, you will take up my references first. They are a
  little&mdash;old, but I think you will find them satisfactory."</p>

  <p>"I have no doubts about your references, Mrs. Moxton, but they shall be
  taken up nevertheless, duly and in order."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Sir," said Mrs. Moxton, giving him a three-quarter face, and
  almost looking at him in her pleasure.</p>

  <p>And thereafter Mrs. Moxton ruled the household of Oswald according to the
  laws and habits of the late Mr. Justice Benlees, who had evidently been a
  very wise, comfortable, and intelligent man. When she came on from the
  uncongenial furniture at Margate to the comfort and beauty of Pelham Ford she
  betrayed a certain approval by expanding an inch or so in every direction and
  letting out two new chins, but otherwise she made no remark. She radiated
  decorum and a faint smell of lavender. She had, it seemed, always possessed a
  black-watered-silk dress and a gold chain. Even Lady Charlotte approved of
  her.</p>

  <p>For some years Mrs. Moxton enabled Oswald to disregard the social
  difficulties that are supposed to surround feminine adolescence. Joan and
  Peter got along very well with Pelham Ford as their home, and no other
  feminine control except an occasional visit from the Stubland aunts. Then
  Aunt Charlotte became tiresome because Joan was growing up. "How can the gal
  grow up properly," she asked, "even considering what she is, in a house in
  which there isn't a lady at the head?"</p>

  <p>Oswald reflected upon the problem. He summoned Mrs. Moxton to his
  presence.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Moxton," he said, "when Miss Joan is here, I've been thinking, don't
  you think she ought to be, so to speak, mistress of the place?"</p>

  <p>"I have been wondering when you would make the change, Mr. Sydenham," said
  Mrs. Moxton. "I shall be very pleased to take my orders from Miss Joan."</p>

  <p>And after that Mrs. Moxton used to come to Joan whenever Joan was at
  Pelham Ford, and tell her what orders she had to give for the day. And when
  Joan had visitors, Mrs. Moxton told Joan just exactly what arrangements Joan
  was to order Mrs. Moxton to make. In.all things that mattered Mrs. Moxton
  ruled Joan with an obedience of iron. Her curtseys, slow, deliberate and
  firm, insisted that Joan was a lady&mdash;and had got to be one. She took to
  calling Joan "Ma'am." Joan had to live up to it, and did. Visitors increased
  after the young people were at Cambridge. Junior dons from Newnham and Girton
  would come and chaperon their hostess, and Peter treated Oswald to a variety
  of samples of the younger male generation. Some of the samples Oswald liked
  more than others. And he concealed very carefully from Aunt Charlotte how
  mixed these young gatherings were, how light was the Cambridge standard of
  chaperonage, and how very junior were some of the junior dons from the
  women's colleges.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">When children are small we elders in charge are apt to
  suppose them altogether plastic. There are resistances, it is true, but these
  express themselves at first only in tantrums, in apparently quite meaningless
  outbreaks; we impose our phrases and values so completely, that such
  spasmodic opposition seems to signify nothing. We impose our names for
  things, our classifications with their thousand implications, our
  interpretations. The child is imitative and obedient by instinct, its
  personality for the most part latent, warily hidden. That is "hand," we
  dictate, that is "hat," that is "pussy cat," that is "pretty, pretty," that
  is "good," that is "nasty," that is "ugly&mdash;Ugh!" That again is
  "fearsome; run away!" There is no discussion. If we know our parental
  business we are able to establish all sorts of habits, readinesses,
  dispositions in these entirely plastic days. "Time for Peter to go to bed,"
  uttered with gusto, becomes the signal for an interesting ritual upon which
  he embarks with dignity. Until some idiot visitor remarks loudly, "Doesn't he
  <i>hate</i> going to bed? I always hated going to bed." Whereupon in that
  matter the seeds of reflection and dissent are sown in the little mind.</p>

  <p>And so with most other matters. For a few years of advantage the new mind
  is clay and we have it to ourselves, and then, still clay, it becomes
  perceptibly resistent, perceptibly disposed to recover some former shape we
  have given it or to take an outline of its own. It discovers we are not
  divine and that even Dadda cannot recall the sunset. It is not only that
  other minds are coming in to modify and contradict our decisions. We
  contradict ourselves and it notes the contradiction. And old Nature begins to
  take an increasing share in the accumulating personality. Apart from what we
  give and those others give, things bubble up inside it, desires,
  imaginations, creative dreams. By imperceptible degrees the growing mind
  slips away from us. A little while ago it seemed like some open vessel into
  which we could pour whatever we chose; now suddenly it is closed and locked,
  hiding a fermentation.</p>

  <p>Perhaps things have always been more or less so between elders and young,
  but in the old days of slower change what fathers and mothers had to tell the
  child, priest and master re-echoed, laws and institutions confirmed, the
  practice of every one, good or evil, endorsed in black or white. But from the
  break-up of the Catholic culture in England onward there has been an
  unceasing conflict between more and more divergent stories about life, and in
  the last half century that clash has enormously intensified. What began as a
  war of ideals became at last a chaos. Adolescence was once either an
  obedience or a rebellion; at the opening of the twentieth century it had
  become an interrogation and an experiment. One heard very much of the right
  of the parent to bring up children in his own religion, his own ideas, but no
  one ever bothered to explain how that right was to be preserved. In Ireland
  one found near Dublin educational establishments surrounded by ten-foot walls
  topped with broken glass, protecting a Catholic atmosphere for a few precious
  and privileged specimens of the Erse nation. Mr. James Joyce in his
  <i>Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man</i>, has bottled a specimen of that
  Catholic atmosphere for the astonishment of posterity. The rest of the youth
  of the changing world lay open to every wind of suggestion that blew. The
  parent or guardian found himself a mere competitor for the attention and
  convictions of his charges.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Through childhood and boyhood and girlhood, Peter's sex and
  seniority alike had conspired to give him a leadership over Joan. His seemed
  the richer, livelier mind, he told most of the stories and initiated most of
  the games; Joan was the follower. That masculine ascendancy lasted until
  Peter was leaving Caxton; in spite of various emancipating forces at
  Highmorton. Then in less than a year Joan took possession of herself.</p>

  <p>Reserve is a necessary grace in all younger brothers and sisters. Peter
  spread his reveries as a peacock spreads its tail, but Joan kept her dreams
  discreetly private. All youth lives much in reverie; thereby the stronger
  minds anticipate and rehearse themselves for life in a thousand imaginations,
  the weaker ones escape from it. Against that early predominance of Peter,
  Joan maintained her self-respect by extensive secret supplements of the
  Bungo-Peter saga. For example she was Bungo-Peter's "Dearest Beloved." Peter
  never suspected how Bungo-Peter and she cuddled up together at the camp fires
  and were very close and warm every night, until she went off to sleep....</p>

  <p>When she was about fourteen Joan's imagination passed out of the phase of
  myth and saga into the world of romance. The real world drew closer to her.
  Bungo-Peter vanished; Nobby shrank down to a real Uncle Nobby. Her childish
  reveries had disregarded possibility; now the story had to be plausible; it
  had to join on to Highmorton and The Ingle-Nook and Pelham Ford; its heroine
  had to be conceivable as the real Joan. And with the coming of reality, came
  moods. There were times when she felt dull, and the world looked on her with
  a grey and stupid face, and other times to compensate her for these dull
  phases, seasons of unwonted exaltation. It was as if her being sometimes drew
  itself together in order presently to leap and extend itself.</p>

  <p>In these new phases of expansion she had the most perfect conviction that
  life, and particularly her life, was wonderful and beautiful and destined to
  be more and more so. She began to experience a strange new happiness in mere
  existence, a happiness that came with an effect of revelation. It is hard to
  convey the peculiar delight that invaded her during these phases. It was
  almost as if the earth had just been created for her and given to her as a
  present. There were moments when the world was a crystal globe of loveliness
  about her, moments of ecstatic realization of a universal beauty. The
  slightest things would suffice to release this sunshine in her soul. She
  would discover the intensest delight in little, hitherto disregarded details,
  in the colour of a leaf held up to the light, or the rhythms of ripples on a
  pond or the touch of a bird's feather. There were moments when she wanted to
  kiss the sunset, and times when she would clamber over the end wall of the
  garden at Pelham Ford in order to lie hidden and still, with every sense
  awake, in the big clump of bracken in the corner by the wood beyond. The
  smell of crushed bracken delighted her intensely. She wanted to be a nymph
  then and not a girl in clothes. And shining summer streams and lakes roused
  in her a passionate desire to swim, to abandon herself wholly to the
  comprehensive sweet silvery caress of the waters.</p>

  <p>In the days of the Saga story, the time of the story had always been
  Now&mdash;and Never; but in the drama of adolescence the time of all Joan's
  reveries was Tomorrow; what she dreamt of now were things that were to be
  real experiences in quite a little time, when she had grown just a year or so
  older, when she was a little taller, when she had left school, when she was
  really as beautiful as she hoped to be.</p>

  <p>The world about her by example and precept, by plays and stories and poems
  and histories, was supplying her with a rich confusion of material for these
  anticipatory sketches. One main history emerged in her fifteenth year. It
  went on for many months. Joan of Arc was in the making of it, and Jane Shore,
  and Nell Gwyn. At first she was the Lady Joan, and then she became just Joan
  Stubland, but always she was the king's mistress.</p>

  <p>From the very beginning Joan had found something splendid and attractive
  in the word "mistress," It had come to her first in a history lesson, and
  then more brightly clad in a costume novel. But it was a very glorious and
  noble kind of mistress that Joan had in view. Her ideas of the authority and
  duties of a mistress were vague; but she knew that a mistress rules by
  beauty. That she ruled Joan never doubted&mdash;or why should she be called
  mistress? And she prevailed over queens, so French history had instructed
  her. She made war and peace. Joan of Arc was inextricably mixed in with the
  vision. She was a beautiful girl, and she told the king of France what to do.
  At need she led armies. What else but a mistress could you call her?
  "Mistress of France," magnificent phrase! Of such ideas was Joan Stubland
  woven. The king perhaps would do injustice, or neglect a meritorious case.
  Then Joan Stubland would appear, watchful and dignified. "No," she would say.
  "That must not be. I am the king's mistress."</p>

  <p>And she wore a kind of light armour. Without skirts. Never with skirts.
  Joan at fourteen already saw long skirts ahead of her, and hated them as a
  man might hate a swamp that he must presently cross knee-deep.</p>

  <p>Where the king went Joan went. But he was not the current king, nor his
  destined successor. She had studied these monarchs in the illustrated
  papers&mdash;and in the news. She did not think much of them. They stood down
  out of Joan's dream in favour of a younger autocrat. After all, was there not
  also a young prince, her contemporary, who would some day be king? But in her
  imagination he was not like his published portraits; instead&mdash;and this
  is curious&mdash;he was rather like Peter. He was as much like Peter as any
  one. This was all of Peter that ever got into her reveries, for there was a
  curious bar in her mind to Peter being thought of either as her lover or as
  any one not her lover. Something obscure in her composition barred any such
  direct imaginations about Peter.</p>

  <p>So, contrawise to all established morality and to everything to which her
  properly constituted teachers were trying to shape her, a chance phrase in a
  history book filled the imagination of Joan with this dream of a different
  sort of woman's life altogether. In which one went side by side with a man in
  a manly way, sharing his power, being dear and beautiful to him. Compared
  with such a lot who would be one of these wives? "Who would stay at home
  and&mdash;as a consequence apparently of the religious ceremony of
  matrimony&mdash;have babies?</p>

  <p>The king's mistress story was Joan's dominant reverie, but it was not her
  only one. It was, so to speak, her serial; it was always "to be continued in
  our next." But her busy mind, whenever her attention was not fully occupied,
  was continually spinning romance; beside the serial story there were endless
  incidental ones. Almost always they were love stories. They were violent and
  adventurous in substance, full of chases, fights, and confrontations, but
  Joan did not stint herself of kissing and embraces. There were times when she
  liked tremendously to think of herself kissing. Most little girls of thirteen
  or fourteen are thinking with the keenest interest and curiosity about this
  lover business and its mysteries, and Joan was no exception. She was deeply
  interested to find she was almost as old as Juliet. Inspired by Shakespeare,
  Joan thought quite a lot about balconies and ladders&mdash;and Romeo. Some of
  her school contemporaries jested about these things and were very arch and
  sly. But she was as shy of talking about love as she was prone to love
  reveries. She talked of flowers and poetry and music and scenery and
  beautiful things as though they were things in themselves, but in her heart
  she was convinced that all the loveliness that shone upon her in the world
  was only so much intimation of the coming loveliness of love.</p>

  <p>The outward and visible disposition of Highmorton School was all against
  the spirit of such dreams. The disposition of Highmorton was towards a scorn
  of males. What Joan knew surely to be lovely, Highmorton denounced as
  "soppy." "Soppy" was a terrible word in boys' schools and girls' schools
  alike, a flail for all romance. But in the girls' schools it was used more
  particularly against tender thoughts of men. Highmorton taught the revolt of
  women from the love of men&mdash;in favour of the love of women. The school
  resounded always with the achievements of the one important sex, hitherto
  held back by man-made laws from demonstrating an all-round superiority. The
  staff at Highmorton had all a common hardness of demeanour; they were without
  exception suffragettes, and most of them militant suffragettes. They played
  hockey with great violence, and let the elder girls hear them say "damn!" The
  ones who had any beauty aspired to sub-virile effects; they impressed small
  adorers as if they were sexless angels. There was Miss Oriana Frobisher
  (science) with the glorious wave in her golden hair and the flash of
  lightning in her glasses. She had done great feats with love, it was said;
  she had refused a professor of botany and a fabulously rich widower, and the
  mathematical master was "gone" on her. There was Miss Kellaway, dark and
  pensive, known to her worshippers as "Queen of the Night," fragile, and yet a
  swift and nimble forward. Aunt Phoebe also had become a leading militant, and
  Aunt Phyllis, who wavered on the verge of militancy, continued the Highmorton
  teaching in the holidays. "Absolute equality between the sexes," was their
  demand; their moderate demand, seeing what men were. Joan would have been
  more than human not to take the colour of so universal a teaching. And yet in
  her reveries there was always one man exempt from that doom of general
  masculine inferiority. She had no use for a dream lover&mdash;unless he was
  dying of consumption or, Tristram fashion, of love-caused wounds&mdash;who
  could not outrun, out-fence, out-wrestle and out-think her, or for a
  situation of asserted equality which could not dissolve into caressing
  devotion.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">And of these preoccupations with the empire and the duties
  and destinies of the empire and the collective affairs of mankind, which to
  Oswald were the very gist and purpose of education, Highmorton taught Joan
  practically nothing. Miss Jevons, the Head, would speak now arid then of
  "loyalty to the crown" in a rather distant way&mdash;Miss Murgatroyd had been
  wont to do the same thing&mdash;and for the rest left politics alone. Except
  that there was one thing, one supreme thing, the Vote. When first little Joan
  heard of the Vote at Limpsfield she was inclined to think it was a flattened
  red round thing rather like the Venerable Bede at the top of the flagstaff.
  She learned little better at Highmorton. She gathered that women were going
  to "get the vote" and then they were to vote. They were going to vote somehow
  against the men and it would make the world better, but there was very little
  more to it than that. The ideas remained strictly personal, strictly
  dramatic. Wicked men like Mr. Asquith who opposed the vote were to be cast
  down; one of the dazzling Pankhurst family, or perhaps Miss Oriana Frobisher,
  was to take his place. Profound scepticisms about this vote&mdash;in her
  heart of hearts she called it the "old Vote," were hidden by Joan from the
  general observation of the school. She had only the slightest attacks of that
  common schoolgirl affliction, schoolmistress love; she never idolized Miss
  Jevons or Miss Frobisher or Miss Kellaway. Their enthusiasm for the vote,
  therefore, prevented hers.</p>

  <p>Later on it was to be different. She was to find in the vote a symbol of
  personal freedom&mdash;and an excellent excuse for undergraduate
  misbehaviour.</p>

  <p>It is true Highmorton School presented a certain amount of history and
  geography to Joan's mind, but in no way as a process in which she was
  concerned. She grew up to believe that in England we were out of history, out
  of geography, eternally blessed in a constitution that we could not better,
  under a crown which was henceforth for ever, so to speak, the centre of an
  everlasting social tea-party, and that party "politics" in Parliament and the
  great Vote struggle had taken the place of such real convulsions of human
  fortune as occurred in other countries and other times. Wars, famine,
  pestilence; the world had done with them. Nations, kings and people,
  politics, were for Joan throughout all her schooldays no more than scenery
  for her unending private personal romance.</p>

  <p>But because much has been told here of Joan's reveries it is not to be
  imagined that she was addicted to brooding. It was only when her mind was
  unoccupied that the internal story-teller got to work. Usually Joan was
  pretty actively occupied. The Highmorton ideal of breezy activity took hold
  of her very early; one kept "on the Go." In school she liked her work, even
  though her unworshipping disposition got her at times at loggerheads with her
  teachers; there was so much more in the lessons than there had been at Miss
  Murgatroyd's . Out of school she became rather a disorderly influence. At
  first she missed Peter dreadfully. Then she began to imitate Peter for the
  benefit of one or two small associates with less initiative than her own.
  Then she became authentically Peter-like. She tried a mild saga of her own in
  those junior days, and taught her friends to act a part in it as Peter had
  taught her to be a companion of the great Bungo. She developed the same sort
  of disposition to go up ladders, climb over walls, try the fronts of cliffs,
  go through open doors and try closed ones, that used to make Peter such
  agreeable company. Once or twice she and a friend or so even got lost by the
  mistress in charge of a school walk, and came home by a different way through
  the outskirts of Broadstairs. But that led to an awe-inspiring "fuss."
  Moreover, it took Joan some years to grasp the idea that the physical
  correction of one's friends is not ladylike. When it came to other girls she
  perceived that Peter's way with a girl was really a very good
  way&mdash;better than either hauteur or pinching. Holding down, for instance,
  or the wrist wrench.</p>

  <p>All the time that she was at Highmorton Joan found no friend as good as
  Peter. Tel Wymark, with the freckles, became important about Joan's fifteenth
  birthday as a good giggling associate, a person to sit with in the back seats
  of lectures and debates and tickle to death with dry comments on the forward
  proceedings. To turn on Tel quietly and slowly and do a gargoyle face at her
  was usually enough to set her off&mdash;or even to pull a straight face and
  sit as if you were about to gargoyle. Tel's own humour was by no means
  negligible, and she had a store of Limericks, the first Limericks Joan had
  encountered. Joan herself rarely giggled; on a few occasions she laughed
  loudly, but for most comic occasions her laughter was internal, and so this
  disintegration of Tel by merriment became a fascinating occupation. It was no
  doubt the contrast of her dark restraint that subjected her to the passionate
  affection of Adela Murchison.</p>

  <p>That affair began a year or so before the friendship with Tel. Adela was
  an abundant white-fleshed creature rather more than a year older than Joan.
  She came back from the Easter holidays, stage struck, with her head full of
  Rosalind. She had seen Miss Lillah McCarthy as Rosalind in As You Like it,
  and had fallen violently in love with her. She went over the play with Joan,
  and Joan was much fascinated by the Rosalind masquerade; in such guise Joan
  Stubland might well have met her king for the first time. Then Adela and Joan
  let their imaginations loose and played at Shakespearian love-making. They
  would get together upon walks and steal apart whenever an opportunity
  offered. Adela wanted to kiss a great deal, and once when she kissed Joan she
  whispered, "It's not Rosalind I love, not Lillah or any one else; just Joan."
  Joan kissed her in return. And then something twisted over in Joan's mind
  that drove her to austerity; suddenly she would have no more of this kissing,
  she herself could not have explained why or wherefore. It was the queerest
  recoil. "We're being too soppy," she said to Adela, but that did not in the
  least express it. Adela became a protesting and urgent lover; she wrote Joan
  notes, she tried to make scenes, she demanded Was there any one else?</p>

  <p>"No," said Joan. "But I don't like all this rot."</p>

  <p>"You did!" said Adela with ready tears shining in her pretty eyes.</p>

  <p>"And I don't now," said Joan....</p>

  <p>Joan herself was puzzled, but she had no material in her mind by which she
  could test and analyse this revulsion. She hid a dark secret from all the
  world, she hid it almost from herself, that once before, in the previous
  summer holidays, one afternoon while she was staying with her aunts at The
  Ingle-Nook, she had walked over by the Cuspard house on the way to Miss
  Murgatroyd's. And she had met young Cuspard, grown tall and quaintly
  good-looking, in white flannels. They had stopped to talk and sat down on a
  tree together, and suddenly he had kissed her. "You're lovely, Joan," he
  said. It was an incredible thing to remember, it was a memory so astounding
  as to be obscure, but she knew as a fact that she had kissed him again and
  had liked this kissing, and then had had just this same feeling of terror, of
  enormity, as though something vast clutched at her. It was fantastically
  disagreeable, not like a real disagreeable thing, but like a dream
  disagreeable thing. She resolved that in fact it had not happened, she barred
  it back out of the current of her thoughts, and it shadowed her life for
  days.</p>

  <p>The modern world tells the young a score of conflicting stories&mdash;more
  or less distinctly&mdash;about every essential thing. While men like Oswald
  dream of a culture telling the young plainly what they are supposed to be
  for, what this or that or the other is for, the current method of instruction
  about God and state and sex alike is a wrangle that never joins issue. For
  every youth and maiden .who is not strictly secluded or very stupid,
  adolescence is a period of distressful perplexity, of hidden hypotheses,
  misunderstood hints, checked urgency, and wild stampedes of the imagination.
  Joan's opening mind was like some ill-defended country across which armies
  marched. Came the School of St. George and the Venerable Bede, led by Miss
  Murgatroyd and applauded by Aunt Phoebe, baring its head and feet and knees,
  casting aside corsets, appealing to nature and simplicity, professing
  fearlessness, and telling the young a great deal less than it had the air of
  telling them. Came Highmorton, a bracing wind after that relaxing
  atmosphere.</p>

  <p>But Limpsfield had at least a certain honesty in its limited initiation;
  Highmorton was comparatively an imposture. With an effect of going right on
  beyond all established things to something finer and newer, Highmorton was
  really restoring prudery in a brutalized form. It is no more vigorous to ban
  a topic by calling it "soppy" and waving a muddy hockey-stick at it in a
  threatening manner, than it is to ban it by calling it "improper" and primly
  cutting it dead. There the topic remains.</p>

  <p>A third influence had made a contributory grab at Joan; Aunt Charlotte
  Sydenham's raid on the children's education was on behalf of all that was
  then most orthodox. Hers was indeed the essential English culture of the
  earlier Victorian age; a culture that so far as sex went was pure
  suppression&mdash;tempered by the broad hints and tittering chatter of
  servants and base people....</p>

  <p>Stuck away, shut in, in Joan's memory, shut in and disregarded as bees
  will wax up and disregard the decaying body of some foul intruder, were
  certain passages with Mrs. Pybus. They carried an impression at once vague
  and enormous, of a fascinating unclean horror. They were inseparably mixed up
  with strange incredulous thoughts of hell that were implanted during the same
  period. Such scenery as they needed was supplied by the dusty, faded
  furnishings of the little house in Windsor, they had the same faintly
  disagreeable dusty smell of a home only cleansed by stray wipes with a duster
  and spiritless sweeping with tea-leaves.</p>

  <p>That period had been a dark patch upon the sunlit fabric of Joan's life.
  Over it all brooded this Mrs. Pybus, frankly dirty while "doing" her house in
  the morning, then insincerely tidy in the afternoon. She talked continually
  to, at, and round about Joan. She was always talking. She was an untimely
  widow prone to brood upon the unpleasant but enormously importunate facts
  that married life had thrust upon her. She had an irresistible desire to
  communicate her experiences with an air of wisdom. She had a certain conceit
  of wisdom. She had no sense of the respect due to the ignorance of childhood.
  Like many women of her class and type she was too egotistical to allow for
  childhood.</p>

  <p>Never before had Joan heard of diseases. Now she heard of all the diseases
  of these two profoundly clinical families, the Pybuses and the Unwins. The
  Pybus family specialized in cancers, "chumors" and morbid growths generally;
  one, but he was rather remote and legendary, had had an "insec' in 'is 'ed";
  the distinction of the Unwins on the other hand was in difficult
  parturitions. All this stuff was poured out in a whining monologue in Joan's
  presence as Mrs. Pybus busied herself in the slatternly details of her
  housework.</p>

  <p>"Two cases of cancer I've seen through from the very first pangs," Mrs.
  Pybus would begin, and then piously, "God grant I never see a third."</p>

  <p>"Whatever you do, Joan, one thing I say never do&mdash;good though Pybus
  was and kind. Never marry no one with internal cancer, 'owever 'ard you may
  be drove. Indigestion, rheumatism, even a wooden leg rather. Better a man
  that drinks. I say it and I know. It doesn't make it any easier, Joan, to sit
  and see them suffer.</p>

  <p>"You've got your troubles yet to come, young lady. I don't expec' you
  understand 'arf what I'm telling you. But you will some day. I sometimes
  think if I 'adn't been kep' in ignorance things might have been better for
  me&mdash;all I bin called upon to go through." That was the style of thing.
  It was like pouring drainage over a rosebud. First Joan listened with
  curiosity, then with horror. Then unavailingly, always overpowered by a
  grotesque fascination, she tried not to listen. Monstrous fragments got
  through to her cowering attention. Here were things for a little girl to
  carry off in her memory, material as she sickened for measles for the most
  terrifying and abominable of dreams.</p>

  <p>"There's poor ladies that has to be reg'lar cut open....</p>

  <p>"I 'ad a dreadful time when I married Pybus. Often I said to 'im
  afterwards, you can't complain of me, Pybus. The things one lives
  through!...</p>

  <p>'Is sister's 'usband didn't 'ave no mercy on 'er....; Don't you go outside
  this gate, Joan&mdash;ever. If one of these 'ere Tramps should get hold of
  you.... I've 'card of a little girl...."</p>

  <p>If a congenial gossip should happen to drop in Joan would be told to sit
  by the window and look at the "nice picture book"&mdash;it was always that
  one old volume of The Illustrated London News&mdash;while a talk went on that
  insisted on being heard, now dropping to harsh whispers, now rising louder
  after the assurance of Mrs. Pybus:</p>

  <p>"Lord! She won't understand a word you're saying."</p>

  <p>If by chance Mrs. Pybus and her friend drifted for a time from personal or
  consanguineous experiences then they dealt with crimes. Difficulties in the
  disposal of the body fascinated these ladies even more than the pleasing
  details of the act. And they preferred murders of women by men. It seemed
  more natural to them....</p>

  <p>The world changed again. Through the tossing distress of the measles Aunt
  Phyllis reappeared, and then came a journey and The Ingle-Nook and dear
  Petah! and Nobby. She was back in a world where Mrs. Pybus could not exist,
  where the things of which Mrs. Pybus talked could not happen. Yet there was
  this in Joan's mind, unformulated, there was a passionate stress against its
  formulation, that all the other things she thought about love and beauty were
  poetry and dreaming, but this alone of all the voices that had spoken over
  and about her, told of something real. In the unknown beyond to which one got
  if one pressed on, was something of that sort, something monstrous, painful
  and dingy....</p>

  <p>Reality!</p>

  <p>Wax it over, little dream bees; cover it up; don't think of it! Back to
  reverie! Be a king's mistress, clad in armour, who sometimes grants a
  kiss.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">It was in the nature of Mrs. Pybus to misconceive things.
  She never grasped the true relationship of Joan and Peter; Mr. Grimes had
  indeed been deliberately vague upon that point in the interests of the
  Sydenham family, the use of the Stubland surname for Joan had helped him; and
  so there dropped into Joan's ears a suggestion that was at the time merely
  perplexing but which became gradually an established fact in her mind.</p>

  <p>"Ow! don't you know?" said Mrs. Pybus to her friend. "Ow, no!
  She's&mdash;" (Her voice sank to a whisper.)</p>

  <p>For a time what they said was so confidential as to convey nothing to Joan
  but a sense of mystery. "Ow 'is mother ever stood 'er in the 'ouse passes my
  belief," said Mrs. Pybus, coming up to the audible again. "Why! I'd 'ave
  <i>killed</i> 'er. But ladies and gentlemen don't seem to 'ave no natural
  affections&mdash;not wot <i>I</i> call affections. There she was brought into
  the 'ouse and treated just as if she was the little chap's sister."</p>

  <p>"She'd be?" said the friend, trying to grasp it.</p>

  <p>"'Arf sister," said Mrs. Pybus. "Of a sort. Neither 'ere nor there, so to
  speak. Not in the eyes of the law. And there they are&mdash;leastways they
  was until Lady Charlotte Sydenham interfered."</p>

  <p>The friend nodded her head rapidly to indicate intelligent
  appreciation.</p>

  <p>"It isn't like being <i>reely</i> brother and sister," said Mrs. Pybus,
  contemplating possibilities. "It's neither one thing nor another. And all
  wrop up in mystery as you might say. Why, oo knows? They might go falling in
  love with each other."</p>

  <p>"<i>'Orrible</i>!" said Mrs. Pybus's friend.</p>

  <p>"It 'ad to be put a stop to," said Mrs. Pybus.</p>

  <p>Confirmatory nodding, with a stern eye for the little figure that sat in a
  corner and pretended to be interested in the faded exploits of vanished
  royalties, recorded in that old volume of <i>The Illustrated London
  News</i>....</p>

  <p>That conversation sank down into the deeps of Joan's memory and remained
  there, obscured but exercising a dim influence upon her relations with Peter.
  One phrase sent up a bubble every now and then into her conscious thoughts:
  "half-sister." It was years after that she began to piece together the hidden
  riddle of her birth. Mummy and Daddy were away; that had served as well for
  her as for Peter far beyond the Limpsfield days. It isn't until children are
  in their teens that these things interest them keenly. It wasn't a thing to
  talk about, she knew, but it was a thing to puzzle over. Who was really her
  father? Who was her mother? If she was Peter's half-sister, then either his
  father was not hers or his mother....</p>

  <p>When people are all manifestly in a plot to keep one in the dark one does
  not ask questions.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">After the first violent rupture that Mr. Grimes had
  organized, Joan and Peter parted and met again in a series of separations and
  resumptions. They went off to totally dissimilar atmospheres, Joan to the
  bracing and roughening air of Highmorton and Peter first to the brightness of
  White Court and then to the vigorous work and play of Caxton; and each time
  they returned for the holidays to Margate or Limpsfield or Pelham Ford
  changed, novel, and yet profoundly familiar. Always at first when holidays
  brought them together again they were shy with each other and intensely
  egotistical, anxious to show off their new tricks and make the most of
  whatever small triumphs school life had given them. Then in a day or so they
  would be at their ease together like a joint that has been dislocated and has
  slipped into place again. Cambridge at last brought them nearer together, and
  ended this series of dislocations. After much grave weighing of the situation
  by Miss Fairchild, the principal of Newton Hall, Peter, when Joan came up,
  was given the status of a full brother.</p>

  <p>They grew irregularly, and that made some quaint variations of
  relationship. Peter, soon after he went to Caxton, fell to expanding
  enormously. He developed a chest, his limbs became great things. There was a
  summer bitten into Joan's memory when he regarded her as nothing more than a
  "leetle teeny female tick," and descanted on the minuteness of her soul and
  body. But he had lost some of his lightness, if none of his dexterity and
  balance, as a climber, and Joan got her consolations among the lighter
  branches of various trees they explored. Next Christmas Joan herself had done
  some serious growing, and the gap was not so wide. But it was only after her
  first term at Newnham that Joan passed from the subservience of a junior to
  the confidence of a senior. She did it at a bound. She met him one day in the
  narrow way between Sidney Street and Petty Cury. Her hair was up and her eyes
  were steady; most of her legs had vanished, and she had clothes like a real
  woman. We do not foregather even with foster brothers in the streets of
  Cambridge, but a passing hail is beyond the reach of discipline. "Hullo,
  Petah!" she said, "what a gawky great thing you 're getting!"</p>

  <p>Peter, a man in his second year, was so taken aback he had no adequate
  reply.</p>

  <p>"You've grown too," he said, "if it comes to that";&mdash;a flavourless
  reply. And there was admiration in his eyes.</p>

  <p>An encounter for subsequent regrets. He thought over it afterwards. The
  cheek of her! It made his blood boil.</p>

  <p>"So long, Petah," said Joan, carrying it off to the end....</p>

  <p>They were sterner than brother and sister with each other. There was never
  going to be anything "soppy" between them. At fourteen, when Peter passed
  into the Red Indian phase of a boy's development, when there can be no more
  "blubbing," no more shirking, he carried Joan with him. She responded
  magnificently to the idea of pluck. Spartan ideals ruled them both. And a
  dark taciturnity. Joan would have died with shame if Peter had penetrated the
  secret romance of Joan Stubland, and the days of Peter's sagas were over for
  ever. When Peter was fifteen he was consumed by a craving for a gun, and
  Oswald gave him one. "But kill," said Oswald. "If you let anything get away
  wounded&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Peter took Joan out into the wood at the back. He missed a pigeon, and
  then he got one.</p>

  <p>"Pick it up, Joan," he said, very calmly and grandly.</p>

  <p>Joan was white to the lips, but she picked up the bloodstained bird in
  silence. These things had to happen.</p>

  <p>Then out of a heap of leaves in front darted a rabbit. Lop, lop, lop, went
  its little white scut. <i>Bang</i>! and over it rolled, but it wasn't
  instantly killed. Horror came upon Joan. SHe was nearest; she ran to the
  wretched animal, which was lying on its side and kicking automatically, and
  stood over it. Its eyes were bright and wide with terror. "Oh, how am I to
  kill it?" she cried, with agony in her voice; "what am I to do-o?" She wrung
  her hands. She felt she was going to pieces, giving herself away, failing
  utterly. Peter would despise her and jeer at her. But the poor little beast!
  The poor beast! There is a limit to pride. She caught it up. "Petah!" she
  cried quite pitifully, on the verge of a whimper.</p>

  <p>Peter had come up to her. He didn't look contemptuous. He was white-lipped
  too. She had never seen him look scared before. He snatched the rabbit from
  her and killed it by one, two, three&mdash;she counted&mdash;quick
  blows&mdash;she didn't see. But she had met his eyes, and they were as
  distressed as hers. Just for a moment.</p>

  <p>Then he was a fifth form boy again. He examined his victim with an
  affectation of calm. "Too far back," he said. "Bad shot. Mustn't do that
  again."</p>

  <p>The rabbit was quite still and limp now, dangling from Peter's hand, its
  eye had glazed, blood dripped and clotted at its muzzle, but its rhythmic
  desperate kicking was still beating in Joan's brain.</p>

  <p>Was this to go on? Could she go on?</p>

  <p>Peter's gun and the pigeon were lying some yards away. He regarded them
  and then looked down at the rabbit he held.</p>

  <p>"Now I know I can shoot," he said, and left the sentence unfinished.</p>

  <p>"Bring the pigeon, Joan," he said, ending an indecision, and picked up his
  gun and led the way back towards the house....</p>

  <p>"We got a pigeon and a rabbit," Joan babbled at tea to Oswald. "Next time,
  Petah's going to let me have the gun."</p>

  <p>Our tone was altogether sporting.</p>

  <p>But there was no next time. There were many unspoken things between Joan
  and Peter, and this was to be one of them. For all the rest of their lives
  neither Joan nor Peter went shooting again. Men Peter was destined to
  slay&mdash;but no more beasts. Necessity never compelled them, and it would
  have demanded an urgent necessity before they would have faced the risk of
  seeing another little furry creature twist and wriggle and of marking how a
  bright eye glazes over. But they were both very bitterly ashamed of this
  distressing weakness. They left further shooting for "tomorrow," and it
  remained always tomorrow. They said nothing about their real feelings in the
  matter, and Peter cleaned and oiled his new gun very carefully and hung it up
  conspicuously over the mantelshelf of their common room, ready to be taken
  down at any time&mdash;when animals ceased to betray feeling.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 10</h3>

  <p class="first">Joan and Peter detested each other's friends from the
  beginning. The quarrel that culminated in that amazing speech of Joan's, had
  been smouldering between them for a good seven years. It went right back to
  the days when they were still boy and girl.</p>

  <p>To begin with, after their first separation they had had no particular
  friends; they had had acquaintances and habits of association, but the mind
  still lacks the continuity necessary for friendship and Euclid until the
  early teens. The first rift came with Adela Murchison. Joan brought her for
  the summer holidays when Peter had been just a year at Caxton.</p>

  <p>That was the first summer at Pelham Ford. v Aunt Phyllis was with them,
  but Aunt Pho3be was in great labour with her first and only novel, a fantasia
  on the theme of feminine genius, "These are my Children, or Mary on the
  Cross." (It was afterwards greatly censored. Boots, the druggist librarian,
  would have none of it.) She stayed alone, therefore, at The Ingle-Nook,
  writing, revising, despairing, tearing up and beginning again, reciting her
  more powerful passages to the scarlet but listening ears of Groombridge and
  the little maid, and going more and more unkempt, unhooked, and unbuttoned.
  Oswald, instead of resorting to the Climax Club as he was apt to do when Aunt
  Phoebe was imminent, abode happily in his new home.</p>

  <p>Adela was a month or so older than Peter and, what annoyed him to begin
  with, rather more fully grown. She was, as she only too manifestly perceived,
  a woman of the world in comparison with both of her hosts. She was still
  deeply in love with Joan, but by no means indifferent to this dark boy who
  looked at her with so much of Joan's cool detachment.</p>

  <p>Joan's romantic dreams were Joan's inmost secret, Adela's romantic
  intentions were an efflorescence. She was already hoisting the signals for
  masculine surrender. She never failed to have a blue ribbon astray somewhere
  to mark and help the blueness of her large blue eyes. She insisted upon the
  flaxen waves over her ears, and secretly assisted them to kink. She had a
  high colour. She had no rouge yet in her possession but there was rouge in
  her soul, and she would rub her cheeks with her hands before she came into a
  room. She discovered to Joan the incredible fact that Oswald was also a
  man.</p>

  <p>With her arm round Joan's waist or over her shoulder she would look back
  at him across the lawn.</p>

  <p>"I say," she said, "he'd be frightfully good-looking&mdash;if it wasn't
  for that."</p>

  <p>And one day, "I wonder if Mr. Sydenham's ever been in love."</p>

  <p>She lay in wait for Oswald's eye. She went after him to ask him
  unimportant things.</p>

  <p>Once or twice little things happened, the slightest things, but it might
  have seemed to Joan that Oswald was disposed to flirt with Adela. But that
  was surely impossible....</p>

  <p>The first effect of the young woman upon Peter was a considerable but
  indeterminate excitement. It was neither pleasurable nor unpleasurable, but
  it hung over the giddy verge of being unpleasant. It made him want to be very
  large, handsome and impressive. It also made him acutely ashamed of wanting
  to be very large, handsome and impressive. It turned him from a simple boy
  into a conflict of motives. He wanted to extort admiration from Adela. Also
  he wanted to despise her utterly. These impulses worked out to no coherent
  system of remarks and gestures, and he became awkward and tongue-tied.</p>

  <p>Adela wanted to be shown all over the house and garden. She put her arm
  about Joan in a manner Peter thought offensive. Then she threw back her hair
  at him over her shoulder and said, shooting a glance at him, "You come
  too."</p>

  <p>Cheek!</p>

  <p>Still, she was a guest, and so a fellow had to follow with his hands in
  his pockets and watch his own private and particular Joan being ordered about
  and&mdash;what was somehow so much more exasperating&mdash;pawed about.</p>

  <p>At what seemed to be the earliest opportunity Peter excused himself,-and
  went off to the outhouse in which he had his tools and chemicals and things.
  He decided he would rig up everything ready to make Sulphuretted
  Hydrogen&mdash;although he knew quite well that this was neither a large,
  handsome, nor impressive thing to do. And then he would wait for them to come
  along, and set the odour going.</p>

  <p>But neither of the girls came near his Glory Hole, and he was not going to
  invite them. He just hovered there un-visited, waiting with his preparations
  and whistling soft melancholy tunes. Finally he made a lot of the gas, simply
  because he had got the stuff ready, and stank himself out of his Glory Hole
  into society again.</p>

  <p>At supper, which had become a sort of dinner that night, Adela insisted on
  talking like a rather languid, smart woman of the world to Nobby. Nobby took
  her quite seriously. It was perfectly sickening.</p>

  <p>"D'you hunt much?" said Adela.</p>

  <p>"Not in England," said Nobby. "There's too many hedges for me. I've a
  sailor's seat."</p>

  <p>"All my people hunt," said Adela. "It's rather a bore, don't you think,
  Mr. Sydenham?"</p>

  <p>Talk like that!</p>

  <p>Two days passed, during which Peter was either being bored to death in the
  company of Adela and Joan or also bored to death keeping aloof from them. He
  cycled to Ware with them, and Adela's cycle had a change speed arrangement
  with a high gear of eighty-five that made it difficult to keep ahead of her.
  Beast!</p>

  <p>And on the second evening she introduced a new card game, Demon Patience,
  a scrambling sort of game in which you piled on aces in the middle and cried
  "Stop!" as soon as your stack was out. It was one of those games, one of
  those inferior games, at which boys in their teens are not nearly as quick as
  girls, Peter discovered. But presently Joan began to pull ahead and beat
  Adela and Peter. The two girls began to play against each other as if his
  poor little spurts didn't amount to anything. They certainly didn't amount to
  very much.</p>

  <p>Adela began to play with a sprawling eagerness. Her colour deepened; her
  manners deteriorated. She was tormented between ambition and admiration. When
  Joan had run her out for the third time, she cried, "Oh, Joan, you Wonderful
  Darling!"</p>

  <p>And clutched and kissed her!...</p>

  <p>All the other things might have been bearable if it had not been for this
  perpetual confabulating with Joan, this going off to whisper with Joan, this
  putting of arms round Joan's neck, this whispering that was almost kissing
  Joan's ear. One couldn't have a moment with Joan. One couldn't use Joan for
  the slightest thing. It would have been better if one hadn't had a Joan.</p>

  <p>On the mill-pond there was a boat that Joan and Peter were allowed to use.
  On the morning of the fifth day Joan found Peter hanging about in the
  hall.</p>

  <p>"Joan."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Come and muck about in Baker's boat."</p>

  <p>"If Adela&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, <i>leave</i> Adela! We don't want her. She'd stash it all up."</p>

  <p>"But she's a visitor!"</p>

  <p>"Pretty rotten visitor! What did you bring her here for? She's
  rotten."</p>

  <p>"She's not. She's all right. You're being horrid rude to her. Every chance
  you get. I like her."</p>

  <p>"Silly tick, she is!"</p>

  <p>"She's taller than you are, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Nyar Nyar Nyar Nyar," said Peter in a singularly ineffective mockery of
  Adela's manner. Adela appeared, descending the staircase. Peter turned
  away.</p>

  <p>"Peter wants to go in the boat on the mill-pond," said Joan, as if with
  calculated wickedness.</p>

  <p>"Oh! I <i>love</i> boats!" said Adela.</p>

  <p>What was a chap to do but go?"</p>

  <p>But under a thin mask of playfulness Peter splashed them both a
  lot&mdash;especially Adela. And in the evening he refused to play at Demon
  Patience and went and sat by himself to draw. He tried various designs. He
  was rather good at drawing Mr. Henderson, and he did several studies of him.
  Then the girls, who found Demon Patience slow with only two players, came and
  sat beside him. He was inspired to begin an ugly caricature of Adela.</p>

  <p>He began at the eyes.</p>

  <p>Joan knew him better than Adela. She saw what was coming. Down came her
  little brown paw on the paper. "No, you don't, Petah," she said.</p>

  <p>Peter looked into her face, hot against his, and there was a red light in
  his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Leago, Joan," he said.</p>

  <p>A struggle began in which Adela took no share.</p>

  <p>The Sydenham blood is hot blood, and though it doesn't like hurting
  rabbits it can be pretty rough with its first cousins. But Joan was still
  gripping the crumpled half of the offending sheet when Aunt Phyllis, summoned
  by a scared Adela, came in. The two were on the hearthrug, panting, and
  Joan's teeth were deep in Peter's wrist; they parted and rose somewhat
  abashed. "<i>My dears</i>!" cried Aunt Phyllis.</p>

  <p>"We were playing," said Joan, flushed and breathless, but honourably
  tearless.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Peter, holding his wrist tight. "We were playing."</p>

  <p>"Romping," said Aunt Phyllis. "Weren't you a little rough? Adela, you
  know, isn't used to your style...."</p>

  <p>After that, Peter shunned further social intercourse. He affected a great
  concentration upon experimental chemistry and photography, and bicycled in
  lonely pride to Waltham Cross, Baldock, and Dunmow. He gave himself up to the
  roads of Hertfordshire. When at last Adela departed it made no difference in
  his aloofness. Joan was henceforth as nothing to him; she was just a tick, a
  silly little female tick, an associate of things that went "Nyar Nyar Nyar."
  He hated her. At least, he would have hated her if there was anything that a
  self-respecting Caxtonian could hate in a being so utterly contemptible. (Yet
  at the bottom of his heart he loved and respected her for biting his wrist so
  hard.)</p>

  <p>Deprived of Adela, Joan became very lonely and forlorn. After some days
  there were signs of relenting on the part of Peter, and then came his
  visitor, Wilmington, a boy who had gone with him from White Court to Caxton,
  and after that there was no need of Joan. With a grim resolution Peter shut
  Joan out from all their pursuits. She was annihilated.</p>

  <p>The boys did experimental chemistry together, made the most disgusting
  stinks, blew up a small earthwork by means of a mine, and stained their hands
  bright yellow; they had long bicycle rides together, they did "splorjums" in
  the wood, they "mucked about" with Baker's boat. Joan by no effort could come
  into existence again. Once or twice as Peter was going off with Wilmington,
  Peter would glance back and feel a gleam of compunction at the little figure
  that watched him going. But she had her Adelas. She and Adela wrote letters
  to each other. She could go and write to her beastly Adela now....</p>

  <p>"Can't Joan come?" said Wilmington.</p>

  <p>"She's only a tick," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"She's not a bad sort of tick," said Wilmington.</p>

  <p>(What business was it of his?)</p>

  <p>Joan fell back on Nobby, and went for walks with him in the afternoon.</p>

  <p>Then came a complication. Towards the end Wilmington got quite soppy on
  Joan. It showed.</p>

  <p>Aunt Phyllis suggested charades for the evening hour after dinner.
  Wilmington and Peter played against each other, and either of them took out
  any people he wanted to act with him. Aunt Phyllis was a grave and dignified
  actress and Nobby could do better than you might have expected. Peter did
  Salome. (Sal&mdash;owe&mdash;me; doing sal volatile for Sal.) He sat as
  Herod, crowned and scornful with the false black beard, and Joan danced and
  afterwards brought the football in on a plate. Aunt Phyllis did
  pseudo-oriental music. But when Wilmington saw Joan dance he knew what it was
  to be in love. He sat glowering passion. For a time he remained frozen rigid,
  and then broke into wild hand-clapping. His ears were bright red, and Aunt
  Phyllis looked at him curiously. It was with difficulty that his clouded mind
  could devise a charade that would give him a call upon Joan. But he thought
  at last of Milton. (Mill&mdash;tun.)</p>

  <p>"I want you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Won't Aunty do?"</p>

  <p>"No, you. It's got to be a girl."</p>

  <p>He held the door open for her, and stumbled going out of the room. He was
  more breathless and jerky than ever outside. Joan heard his exposition with
  an unfriendly expression.</p>

  <p>"And what am I to do then?" she asked....</p>

  <p>"And then?..."</p>

  <p>They did "Mill" and "Tun" pretty badly. Came Wilmington's last precious
  moments with her. He broke off in his description of Milton blind and Joan as
  the amanuensis daughter. "Joan," he whispered, going hoarse with emotion."
  Joan, you 're lovely. I'd die for you."</p>

  <p>A light of evil triumph came into Joan's eyes.</p>

  <p>"Ugly thing!" said Joan, "what did you come here for? You've spoilt my
  holidays. Let go of my hand!... Let's go in and do our tableau."</p>

  <p>And afterwards when Wilmington met Joan in the passage she treated him to
  a grimace that was only too manifestly intended to represent his own
  expression of melancholy but undying devotion. In the presence of others she
  was coolly polite to him.</p>

  <p>Peter read his friend like a book, but refrained from injurious comment,
  and Wilmington departed in a state of grave nervous disarray.</p>

  <p>A day passed. There was not much left now of the precious holidays. Came a
  glowing September morning.</p>

  <p>"Joe-un," whooped Peter in the garden&mdash;in just the old note.</p>

  <p>"Pee-tah!" answered Joan, full-voiced as ever, distant but drawing
  nearer.</p>

  <p>"Come and muck about in Baker's boat."</p>

  <p>"Right-o, Petah!" said Joan, and approached with a slightly prancing
  gait.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 11</h3>

  <p class="first">Growing out of his Red Indian phase Peter moved up into the
  Lower Sixth and became a regular cynical man of the world with an air of
  knowing more than a thing or two. He was, in fact, learning a vast number of
  things that are outside the books; and rearranging many of his early shocks
  and impressions by the help of a confusing and increasing mixture of
  half-lights. The chaotic disrespect of the young went out of his manner in
  his allusion to school affairs, he no longer spoke of various masters as
  "Buzzy," "Snooks," and "the Croker," and a curious respectability had invaded
  his demeanour. The Head had had him in to tea and tennis. The handle of the
  prefect's birch was perhaps not more than a year now from his grip, if he
  bore himself gravely. He reproached Joan on various small occasions for
  "thundering bad form," and when Wilmington came, a much more wary and
  better-looking Wilmington with his heart no longer on his sleeve, the
  conversation became, so to speak, political. They talked at the dinner-table
  of the behaviour of so-and-so and this-and-that at "High" and at "Bottoms"
  and on "the Corso"; they discussed various cases of "side" and "cheek," and
  the permanent effect of these upon the standing and reputations of the youths
  concerned; they were earnest to search out and know utterly why Best did not
  get his colours and whether it was just to "super" old Rawdon. They discussed
  the question of superannuation with Oswald very gravely. "Don't you think,"
  said Oswald, "if a school takes a boy on, it ought to see him through!"</p>

  <p>"But if he doesn't work, sir?" said Wilmington.</p>

  <p>"A school oughtn't to produce that lassitude," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"A chap ought to <i>use</i> a school," said Peter.</p>

  <p>That was a new point of view to Oswald and Joan.</p>

  <p>Afterwards came Troop, a larger boy than either Peter or Wilmington, a
  prefect, a youth almost incredibly manly in his manner, and joined on to
  these discussions. Said Oswald, "There ought not to be such a thing as
  superannuation. A man ought not to be let drift to the point of un-teachable
  incapacity. And then thrown away. Some master ought to have shepherded him in
  for special treatment."</p>

  <p>"They don't look after us to that extent, sir," said Troop.</p>

  <p>"Don't they teach you? Or fail to teach you?"</p>

  <p>"It's the school teaches us," said Peter, as though it had just occurred
  to him.</p>

  <p>"Still, the masters are there," said Oswald, smiling.</p>

  <p>"The masters are there," Troop acquiesced. "But the life of the school is
  the tradition. And a big chap like Rawdon hanging about, too big to lick and
  too stupid for responsibility It breaks things up, sir."</p>

  <p>Oswald was very much interested in this prefect's view of the school life.
  Behind his blank mask he engendered questions; his one eye watched Troop and
  went from Troop to Peter. This manliness in the taught surprised him
  tremendously. Peter was acquiring it rapidly, but Troop seemed to embody it.
  Oswald himself had been a man early enough and had led a hard life of mutual
  criticism and exasperation with his fellows, but that had been in a working
  reality, the navy; this, he reflected, was a case of cocks crowing inside the
  egg. These boys were living in a premature autonomous state, an aristocratic
  republic with the Head as a sort of constitutional monarch. There was one
  questionable consequence at least. They were acquiring political habits
  before they had acquired wide horizons. Were the political habits of a school
  where all the boys were of one race and creed and class, suitable for the
  problems of a world's affairs?</p>

  <p>Troop, under Oswald's insidious leading, displayed his ideas modestly but
  frankly, and they were the ideas of a large child. Troop was a good-looking,
  thoroughly healthy youth, full of his grave responsibilities towards the
  school and inclined to claim a liberal attitude. He was very great upon his
  duty to "make the fellows live decently and behave decently." He was lured
  into a story of how one youth with a tendency to long hair had been partly
  won and partly driven to a more seemly coiffure; how he had dealt with a
  games shirker, and how a fellow had been detected lending socialist
  pamphlets&mdash;"not to his friends, sir, I shouldn't mind that so much, but
  pushing them upon any one"&mdash;and restrained. "Seditious sort of stuff,
  sir, I believe. No, I did not read it, sir." Troop was for cold baths under
  all circumstances, for no smoking under sixteen and five foot six, and for a
  simple and unquestioning loyalty to any one who came along and professed to
  be in authority over him. When he mentioned the king his voice dropped
  worshipfully. Upon the just use of the birch Troop was conscientiously
  prolix. There were prefects, he said, who "savaged" the fellows. Others
  swished without judgment. Troop put conscience into each whack.</p>

  <p>Troop's liberalism interested Oswald more than anything else about him. He
  was proud to profess himself no mere traditionalist; he wanted Caxton to
  "broaden down from precedent to precedent." Indeed he had ambitions to be
  remembered as a reformer. He hoped, he said, to leave the school "better than
  he found it"&mdash;the modern note surely. His idea of a great and memorable
  improvement was to let the Upper Fifth fellows into the Corso after morning
  service on Sunday. He did not think it would make them impertinent; rather it
  would increase their self-respect. He was also inclined to a reorganization
  of the afternoon fagging "to stop so much bawling down the corridor." There
  ought to be a bell&mdash;an electric bell&mdash;in each prefect's study. No
  doubt that was a bit revolutionary&mdash;Troop almost smirked. "It's all very
  well for schools like Eton or Winchester to stick to the old customs, sir,
  but we are supposed to be an Up-to-Date school. Don't you think, sir?" The
  egg was everything to this young cockerel; the world outside was naught.
  Oswald led him on from one solemn puerility to another, and as the big boy
  talked in his stout man-of-the-world voice, the red eye roved from him to
  Peter and from Peter back to Troop. Until presently it realized that Peter
  was watching it as narrowly. "What does Peter really think of this stuff?"
  thought Oswald. "What does Nobby really think of this stuff?" queried
  Peter.</p>

  <p>"I suppose, some day, you'll leave Caxton," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"I shall be very sorry to, sir," said Troop sincerely.</p>

  <p>"Have you thought at all&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not yet, sir. At least&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Troop's people," Peter intervened, "are Army people."</p>

  <p>"I see,"said Oswald.</p>

  <p>Joan listened enviously to all this prefectorial conversation. At
  Highmorton that sort of bossing and influencing was done by the junior
  staff....</p>

  <p>Oswald did his best to lure Troop from his administrative preoccupations
  into general topics. But apparently some one whom Troop respected had warned
  him against general topics. Oswald lugged and pushed the talk towards
  religion, Aunt Phyllis helping, but they came up against a stone wall. "My
  people are Church of England," said Troop, intimating thereby that his
  opinions were banked with the proper authorities. It was not for him to state
  them. And in regard to politics, "All my people are Conservative." One
  evening Oswald showed him a portfolio of drawings from various Indian
  temples, and suggested something of the complex symbolism of the figures.
  Troop thought it was "rather unhealthy," But&mdash;turning from these
  monstrosities&mdash;he had hopes for India. "My cousin tells me, sir, that
  cricket and polo are spreading very rapidly there." "Polo," said Oswald, "is
  an Indian game. They have played it for centuries. It came from Persia
  originally." But Troop was unable to imagine Indians riding horses; he had
  the common British delusion that the horse and the ship were both invented in
  our islands and that all foreign peoples are necessarily amateurs at such
  things. "I thought they rode elephants," said Troop with quiet
  conviction....</p>

  <p>Troop was not only a great experience for Oswald, he also exercised the
  always active mind of Joan very considerably.</p>

  <p>Peter, it seemed, hadn't even mentioned her beforehand.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" said Troop at the sight of her. "Got a sister?"</p>

  <p>"Foster-sister," said Peter, minimizing the thing. "Joan, this is
  Troop."</p>

  <p>Joan regarded him critically. "Can he play D.P.?"</p>

  <p>"Not one of my games," said Troop, who was chary of all games not usually
  played.</p>

  <p>"It's a game like Snap," said Peter with an air of casual contempt, and
  earned a bright scowl.</p>

  <p>For a day or so Troop and Joan kept aloof, watching one another. Then she
  caught him out rather neatly twice at single wicket cricket; he had a
  weakness for giving catches to point and she had observed it. "Caught!" he
  cried approvingly. Also she snicked and slipped and at last slogged boldly at
  his patronizing under-arm bowling. "Here's a Twister," he said, like an uncle
  speaking to a child.</p>

  <p>Joan smacked it into the cedar. "Twister!" quoth Joan, running.</p>

  <p>After that he took formal notice of her, betraying a disposition to
  address her as "Kid." (Ralph Connor was at that time adding his quota to the
  great British tradition. It is true he wrote in American about
  cowboys&mdash;but a refined cowboy was the fullest realization of an English
  gentleman's pre-war ideals&mdash;and Ralph Connor's cowboys are essentially
  refined. Thence came the "Kid," anyhow.) But Joan took umbrage at the "Kid."
  And she disliked Troop's manner and influence with Peter. And the way Peter
  stood it. She did not understand what a very, very great being a prefect is
  in an English public school, she did not know of Troop's superbness at
  rugger, it seemed to her that it was bad manners to behave as though a visit
  to Pelham Ford were an act of princely condescension. She was even disposed
  to diagnose Troop's largeness, very unjustly, as fat. So she pulled up Troop
  venomously with "My name's not Kit, it's Joan. J.O.A.N."</p>

  <p>"Sorry!" said Troop. And being of that insensitive class whose passions
  are only to be roused by a smacking, he began to take still more notice of
  her. She was, he perceived, a lively Kid. He felt a strong desire to reprove
  and influence her. He had no suspicion that what he really wanted to do was
  to interest Joan in himself.</p>

  <p>Joan's tennis was incurably tricky. Troop's idea of tennis was to play
  very hard and very swiftly close over the net, but without cunning. Peter and
  Wilmington followed his lead. But Joan forced victory upon an unwilling
  partner by doing unexpected things.</p>

  <p>Troop declared he did not mind being defeated, but that he was shocked by
  the spirit of Joan's play. It wasn't "sporting."</p>

  <p>"Those short returns aren't done, Kid," he said.</p>

  <p>"I do them," said Joan. "Ancient."</p>

  <p>Peter and Wilmington were visibly shocked, but Troop showed no resentment
  at the gross familiarity.</p>

  <p>"But if every one did them!" he reasoned.</p>

  <p>"I could take them," said Joan. "Any one could take them who knew
  how."</p>

  <p>The dispute seemed likely to die down into unverifiable assertions.</p>

  <p>"Peter can take them," said Joan. "He drops them back. But he isn't doing
  it today."</p>

  <p>Peter reflected. Troop would never understand, but there was something
  reasonable in Joan's line. "I'll see to Joan," he said abruptly, and came
  towards the middle of the net.</p>

  <p>The game continued on unorthodox but brilliant lines. "I don't call this
  tennis," said Troop.</p>

  <p>"If you served to her left," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"But she's a girl!" protested Troop. "Serve!"</p>

  <p>He made the concessions that are proper to a lady, and Joan scored the
  point after a brief rally with Peter. "Game," said Joan.</p>

  <p>Troop declared he did not care to play again. It would put him off tennis.
  "Take me as a partner," said Joan. "No&mdash;I don't think so, thanks," said
  Troop coldly.</p>

  <p>Every one became thoughtful and drifted towards the net. Oswald approached
  from the pergola, considering the problem.</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking about that sort of thing for years," he remarked,
  strolling towards them.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, aren't you with me?" asked Troop.</p>

  <p>"No. I'm for Joan&mdash;and Peter."</p>

  <p>"But that sort of trick play</p>

  <p>"No. The way to play a game is to get all over the game and to be equal to
  anything in it. If there is a stroke or anything that spoils the game it
  ought to be barred by the rules. Apart from that, a game ought to be worked
  out to its last possibility. Things oughtn't to be barred in the interests of
  a few conventional swipes. This cutting down of a game to just a few types of
  stroke</p>

  <p>Peter looked apprehensive.</p>

  <p>"It's laziness," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>Troop was too puzzled to be offended. "But you have to work tremendously
  hard, sir, at the proper game."</p>

  <p>"Not mentally," said Oswald, "There's too much good form in all our games.
  It's just a way of cutting down a game to a formality."</p>

  <p>"But, for instance, sir, would you bowl grounders at cricket?"</p>

  <p>"If I thought the batsman had been too lazy to learn what to do with them.
  Why not?"</p>

  <p>"If you look at it like that, sir!" said Troop and had no more to say. But
  he went away marvelling. Oswald was a V.C. Yet he looked at games
  like&mdash;like an American, he played to win; it was enough to perplex any
  one....</p>

  <p>"Must confess I don't see it," said Troop when Oswald had gone....</p>

  <p>When at last Troop and Wilmington departed Oswald went with them to the
  station&mdash;the luggage was sent on in the cart&mdash;and walked back over
  the ploughed ridge and up the lane with Peter. For a time they kept silence,
  but Troop was in both their minds.</p>

  <p>"He's a good sort," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Admirable&mdash;in some ways."</p>

  <p>"I thought," said Peter, "you didn't like him. You kept on pulling his
  leg."</p>

  <p>So Peter had seen.</p>

  <p>"Well, he doesn't exercise his brain very much," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Stops short at his neck," said Peter. "Exercise, I mean."</p>

  <p>"You and Troop are singularly unlike each other," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's exactly it. I can't make out why I like him. If nothing else
  attracted me, that would."</p>

  <p>"Does he know why he likes you?"</p>

  <p>"Hasn't the ghost of an idea. It worries him at times. Makes him want to
  try and get all over me."</p>

  <p>"Does he&mdash;at all?"</p>

  <p>"Lots," said Peter. "I fag at the blessed Cadet Corps simply because I
  like him. At rugger he's rather a god, you know. And he's a clean chap."</p>

  <p>"He's clean."</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's clean. It's catching," said Peter, and seemed to reflect. "And
  in a sort of way lately old Troop's taken to swatting. It's pathetic." Then
  with a shade of anxiety,"I don't think for a moment he twigged you were
  pulling his leg."</p>

  <p>Oswald came to the thing that was really troubling him. "Allowing for his
  class," said Oswald, "that young man is growing up to an outlook upon the
  world about as broad and high as the outlook of a bricklayer's labourer."</p>

  <p>Peter reflected impartially, and Oswald noted incidentally what a good
  profile the boy was developing.</p>

  <p>"A Clean, Serious bricklayer's labourer," said Peter, weighing his
  adjectives carefully.</p>

  <p>"But he may go into Parliament, or have to handle a big business," said
  Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Army for Troop," said Peter, "via a university commission."</p>

  <p>"Even armies have to be handled intelligently nowadays," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"He'll go into the cavalry," said Peter, making one of those tremendous
  jumps in thought that were characteristic of himself and Joan.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 12</h3>

  <p class="first">A day or so after Troop's departure Peter waylaid Oswald in
  the garden. Peter, now that Troop had gone, was amusing himself with
  dissection again&mdash;an interest that Troop had disposed of as a "bit
  morbid." Oswald thought the work Peter did neat and good; he had to brush up
  his own rather faded memories of Huxley's laboratory in order to keep pace
  with the boy.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd come to the Glory Hole and look at an old rat I dissected
  yesterday. I want to get its solar plexus and I'm not sure about it. I've
  been using acetic acid to bring out the nerves, but there's such a lot of
  white stuff about...."</p>

  <p>The dissection was a good piece of work, the stomach cleaned out and the
  viscera neatly displayed. Very much in evidence were eight small embryo rats
  which the specimen under examination, had not science overtaken her, would
  presently have added to the rat population of the world.</p>

  <p>"The old girl's been going it," said Peter in a casual tone, and turned
  these things over with the handle of his scalpel. "Now is all this stuff
  solar plexus, Nobby?"...</p>

  <p>The next morning Oswald stopped short in the middle of his shaving, which
  in his case involved the most tortuous deflections and grimacings. "It's all
  right with the boy," he said to himself.</p>

  <p>"I think it's all right.</p>

  <p>"No nonsense about it anyhow.</p>

  <p>"But what a tortuous, untraceable business the coming of knowledge is!
  Curiosity. A fad for dissecting. An instinct for cleanliness. Pride. A bigger
  boy like Troop.... Suppose Troop had been a different sort of boy?...</p>

  <p>"But then I suppose Peter and he wouldn't have hit it off together."</p>

  <p>Oswald scraped, and presently his mind tried over a phrase.</p>

  <p>"Inherent powers of selection," said Oswald. "Inherent.... I suppose I
  picked my way through a pretty queer lot of stuff...."</p>

  <p>He stood wiping his safety-razor blade.</p>

  <p>"There was more mystery in my time and more emotion. This is
  better....</p>

  <p>"Facts are clean," said Oswald, uttering the essential faith with which
  science has faced vice and priestcraft, magic and muddle and fear and
  mystery, the whole world over.</p>

  <p>"Facts are clean."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 13</h3>

  <p class="first">Joan followed a year after Peter to Cambridge. She entered
  at Newton Hall. Both Oswald and Aunt Phyllis preferred Newnham to Girton
  because of the greater freedom of the former college. They agreed that, as
  Oswald put it, if women were to be let out of purdah they might as well be
  let right out.</p>

  <p>Coming from Highmorton to Newnham was like emerging from some narrow,
  draughty passage in which one marches muddily with a whispering, giggling
  hockey team all very much of a sort, into a busy and confused market-place, a
  rather squabbling and very exciting market-place, in which there is the
  greatest variety of sorts. And Joan's mind, too, was opening out in an even
  greater measure. A year or so ago she was a spirited, intelligent animal, a
  being of dreams and unaccountable impulses; in a year or so's time she was to
  become a shaped and ordered mind, making plans, controlling every urgency,
  holding herself in relation to a definite conception of herself and the
  world. We have still to gauge the almost immeasurable receptivity of those
  three or four crucial years. We have still to grasp what the due use of those
  years may mean for mankind.</p>

  <p>Oswald had been at great pains to find out what was the best education the
  Empire provided for these two wards of his. But his researches had brought
  him to realize chiefly how poor and spiritless a thing was the very best
  formal education that the Empire could offer. It seemed to him, in the bitter
  urgency of his imperial passion, perhaps even poorer than it was. There was a
  smattering of Latin, a thinner smattering of Greek, a little patch of
  Mediterranean history and literature detached from past and future&mdash;all
  university history seemed to Oswald to be in disconnected fragments&mdash;but
  then he would have considered any history fragmentary that did not begin with
  the geological record and end with a clear tracing of every traceable
  consequence of the "period" in current affairs; there were mathematical
  specializations that did not so much broaden the mind as take it into a
  gully, modern and mediaeval language specializations, philosophical studies
  that were really not philosophical studies at all but partial examinations of
  remote and irrelevant systems, the study of a scrap of Plato or Aristotle
  here, or .an excursion (by means of translations) into the Hegelian
  phraseology there. This sort of thing given out to a few thousand young men,
  for the most part greatly preoccupied with games, and to a few hundred young
  women, was all that Oswald could discover by way of mental binding for the
  entire empire. It seemed to him like innervating a body as big as the world
  with a brain as big as a pin's head. As Joan and Peter grew out of school and
  went up to Cambridge they became more and more aware of a note of lamentation
  and woe in the voice of their guardian. He talked at them, over their heads
  at lunch and dinner, to this or that visitor. He also talked to them. But he
  had a great dread of preachments. They were aware of his general discontent
  with the education he was giving them, but as yet they had no standards by
  which to judge his charges. Over their heads his voice argued that the
  universities would give them no access worth considering to the thoughts and
  facts of India, Russia, or China, that they were ignoring something
  stupendous called America, that their political and economic science still
  neglected the fact that every problem in politics, every problem in the
  organization of production and social co-operation is a psychological
  problem; and that all these interests were supremely urgent interests, and
  how the devil was one going to get these things in? But one thing Joan and
  Peter did grasp from these spluttering dissertations that flew round and
  about them. They had to find out all the most important things in life for
  themselves.</p>

  <p>Perhaps the problem of making the teacher of youth an inspiring figure is
  an insoluble one. At any rate, there was no great stir evoked in Joan and
  Peter by the personalities of any of their university tutors, lecturers, and
  professors. These seemed to be for the most part little-spirited, gossiping
  men. They had also an effect of being underpaid; they had been caught early
  by the machinery of prize and scholarship, bred, "in the menagerie"; they
  were men who knew nothing of the world outside, nothing of effort and
  adventure, nothing of sin and repentance. Not that there were not whispers
  and scandals about, but such sins as the dons knew of were rather in the
  nature of dirty affectations, got out of Petronius and Suetonius and
  practised with a tremendous sense of devilment behind locked doors, than
  those graver and larger sins that really distress and mar mankind. As Joan
  and Peter encountered these master minds, they appeared as gowned and capped
  individuals, hurrying to lecture-rooms, delivering lectures that were often
  hasty and indistinct, making obscure but caustic allusions to rival teachers,
  parrying the troublesome inquiring student with an accustomed and often quite
  pretty wit. With a lesser subtlety and a greater earnestness the women dons
  had fallen in with this tradition. There were occasional shy personal
  contacts.</p>

  <p>But at his tea or breakfast the don was usually too anxious to impress
  Peter with the idea that he himself was really only a sort of overgrown
  undergraduate, to produce any other effect at all.</p>

  <p>Into the Cambridge lecture rooms and laboratories went Joan and Peter,
  notebook in hand, and back to digestion in their studies, and presently they
  went into examination rooms where they vindicated their claim to have
  attended to textbook and lecture. In addition Peter did some remarkably good
  sketches of tutors and professors and fellow students. This was their
  "grind," Joan and Peter considered, a drill they had to go through; it became
  them to pass these tests creditably&mdash;if only to play the game towards
  old Nobby. Only with Peter's specialization in biology did he begin to find
  any actuality in these processes. He found a charm in phylogenetic
  speculations; and above the narrow canons of formal "research" there were
  fascinating uplands of wisdom. Upon those uplands there lay a light in which
  even political and moral riddles took on a less insoluble aspect. But going
  out upon those uplands was straying from the proper work.... Joan got even
  less from her moral philosophy. Her principal teacher was a man shaped like a
  bubble, whose life and thought was all the blowing of a bubble. He claimed to
  have proved human immortality. It was, he said, a very long and severe
  logical process. About desire, about art, about social association, about
  love, about God&mdash;for he knew also that there was no God&mdash;it
  mattered not what deep question assailed him, this gifted being would dip
  into his Hegelian suds and blow without apparent effort, and there you
  were&mdash;as wise as when you started! And off the good man would float,
  infinitely self-satisfied and manifestly absurd.</p>

  <p>But even Peter's biology was only incidentally helpful in answering the
  fierce questions that life was now thrusting upon him and Joan. Nor had this
  education linked them up to any great human solidarity. It was like being
  guided into a forest&mdash;and lost there&mdash;by queer, absent-minded men.
  They had no sense of others being there too, upon a common adventure. ,</p>

  <p>"And it is all that I can get for them!" said Oswald. "Bad as it is, it is
  the best thin^ there is."</p>

  <p>He tried to find comfort in comparisons.</p>

  <p>"Has any country in the world got anything much better?"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 14</h3>

  <p class="first">One day Oswald found himself outside Cambridge on the
  Huntingdon road. It was when he had settled that Peter was to enter Trinity,
  and while he was hesitating between Newnham and Girton as Joan's destiny.
  There was a little difficulty in discovering Girton. Unlike Newnham, which
  sits down brazenly in Cambridge, Girton is but half-heartedly at Cambridge,
  coyly a good mile from the fountains of knowledge, hiding its blushes between
  tall trees. He was reminded absurdly of a shy, nice girl sitting afar off
  until father should come out of the public-house....</p>

  <p>He fell thinking about the education of women in Great Britain.</p>

  <p>At first he had been disposed to think chiefly of Peter's education and to
  treat Joan's as a secondary matter; but little by little, as he watched
  British affairs close at hand, he had come to measure the mischief feminine
  illiteracy can do in the world. In no country do the lunch and dinnerparty,
  the country house and personal acquaintance, play so large a part in politics
  as they do in Great Britain. And the atmosphere of all that inner world of
  influence is a woman-made atmosphere, and an atmosphere made by women who are
  for the most part untrained and unread. Here at Girton and Newnham, and at
  Oxford at Somerville, he perceived there could not be room for a tithe of the
  girls of the influential and governing classes. Where were the rest? English
  womanhood was as yet only nibbling at university life. Where were the girls
  of the peerage, the county-family girls and the like? Their brothers came up,
  but they stayed at home and were still educated scarcely better than his Aunt
  Charlotte had been educated forty years ago&mdash;by a genteel person, by a
  sort of mental maid who did their minds as their maids did their hair for the
  dinner-table.</p>

  <p>"No wonder," he said, "they poison politics and turn it all into personal
  intrigues. No wonder they want religion to be just a business of personal
  consolations. No wonder every sort of charlatan and spook dealer, fortune-
  teller and magic healer flourishes in London. Well, Joan anyhow shall have
  whatever they can give her here....</p>

  <p>"It's better than nothing. And she'll talk and read...."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 15</h3>

  <p class="first">But school and university are only the formal part of
  education. The larger part of the education of every human being is and
  always has been and must be provided by the Thing that Is. Every adult
  transaction has as its most important and usually most neglected aspect its
  effect upon the minds of the young. Behind school and university the Empire
  itself was undesignedly addressing Joan and Peter. It was, so to speak,
  gesticulating at them over their teachers' heads and under their teachers'
  arms. It was performing ceremonies and exhibiting spectacles of a highly
  suggestive nature.</p>

  <p>In a large and imposing form certain ideas were steadfastly thrust at Joan
  and Peter. More particularly was the idolization of the monarchy thrust upon
  them. In terms of zeal and reverence the press, the pulpit, and the world at
  large directed the innocent minds of Joan and Peter to the monarch as if that
  individual were the Reason, the Highest Good and Crown of the collective
  life. Nothing else in the world of Joan and Peter got anything like the same
  tremendous show. Their early years were coloured by the reflected glories of
  the Diamond Jubilee; followed the funeral pomps of Queen Victoria, with much
  mobbing of negligent or impecunious people not in black by the loyal London
  crowd; then came the postponed and then the actual coronation of King Edward,
  public prayings for his health, his stupendous funeral glories; succeeded by
  the coronation of King George, and finally, about the time that Joan followed
  Peter up to Cambridge, the Coronation Durbar. The multitude which could not
  go to India went at least to the Scala cinema, and saw the adoration in all
  its natural colours. Reverent crowds choked that narrow bystreet. Across all
  the life arid activities of England, across all her intellectual and moral
  effort, holding up legislation, interfering with industry, stopping the
  traffic, masking every reality of the collective life, these vast formalities
  trailed with a magnificent priority. Nothing was respected as they were
  respected! Sober statesmen were seen invested in strange garments that no
  sensible person would surely wear except for the gravest reasons; the
  archbishops and bishops were discovered bent with reverence, invoking the
  name of God freely, blessing the Crown with the utmost gravity, investing the
  Sovereign with Robe and Orb, Ring and Sceptre, anointing him with the Golden
  Coronation Spoon. Either the Crown was itself a matter of altogether supreme
  importance to the land or else it was the most stupendous foolery that ever
  mocked and confused the grave realities of a great people's affairs.</p>

  <p>The effect of it upon the minds of our two young people
  was&mdash;complicating. How complicating it is few people realize who have
  not closely studied the educational process of the British mind as a whole.
  Then it becomes manifest that the monarch, the state church, and the system
  of titles and social precedence centering upon the throne, constitute a
  system of mental entanglements against which British education struggles at
  an enormous disadvantage. The monarchy in Great Britain is a compromise that
  was accepted by a generation regardless of education and devoid of any sense
  of the future. It is now a mask upon the British face; it is a gaudy and
  antiquated and embarrassing wrapping about the energies of the nation.
  Because of it Britain speaks to her youth, as to the world, with two voices.
  She speaks as a democratic republic, just ever so little crowned, and also
  she speaks as a succulently loyal Teutonic monarchy. Either she is an
  adolescent democracy whose voice is breaking or an old monarchy at the
  squeaking stage. Now her voice is the full strong voice of a great people,
  now it pipes ridiculously. She perplexes the world and stultifies
  herself.</p>

  <p>That was why her education led up to no such magnificent exposition and
  consolidation of purpose as Oswald dreamt of for his wards. Instead, the
  track presently lost itself in a maze of prevarications and evasions. The
  country was double-minded, double-mindedness had become its habit, and it had
  lost the power of decision. Every effort to broaden and modernize university
  education in Britain encountered insurmountable difficulties because of this
  fundamental dispersal of aim. The court got in the way, the country clergy
  got in the way, the ruling-class families got in the way. It is impossible to
  turn a wandering, chance-made track into a good road until you know where it
  is to go. And that question of destination was one that no Englishman before
  the war could be induced to put into plain language. Double-mindedness had
  become his second nature. From the very outset it had taken possession of
  him. When a young American goes to his teacher to ask why he should serve his
  state, he is shown a flag of thirteen stripes and eight and forty stars and
  told a very plain and inspiring history. His relations to his country are
  thenceforward as simple and unquestionable as a child's to its mother. He may
  be patriotic or unpatriotic as a son may be dutiful or undutiful, but he will
  not be muddle-headed. But when Joan and Peter first began to realize that
  they belonged to the British Empire they were shown a little old German woman
  and told that reverence for her linked us in a common abjection with the
  millions of India. They were told also that really this little old lady did
  nothing of the slightest importance and that the country was the freest
  democracy on earth, ruled by its elected representatives. And each of these
  preposterously contradictory stories pursued them in an endless series of
  variations up to adolescence....</p>

  <p>To two naturally clear-headed young people it became presently as palpably
  absurd to have a great union of civilized states thus impersonated as it is
  to have Wall impersonated by Snout the Tinker in A Midsummer Night's Dream.
  They were already jeering at royalty and the church with Aunt Phyllis long
  before they went up to Cambridge. There they found plenty of associates to
  jeer with them. And there too they found a quite congenial parallel stream of
  jeering against Parliament, which pretended to represent the national mind
  and quality, but which was elected by a method that manifestly gave no chance
  to any candidate who was not nominated by a party organization. In times of
  long established peace, when the tradition of generations has established the
  illusion of the profoundest human security, men's minds are not greatly
  distressed by grotesqueness and absurdity in their political forms. It is all
  part of the humour and the good-humour of life. When one believes that all
  the tigers in the jungle are dead, it is quite amusing to walk along the
  jungle paths in a dressing-gown with a fan instead of a gun. Joan and Peter
  grew up to the persuasion that the crown above them was rather a good joke,
  and that Parliament and its jobs and party flummery were also a joke, and
  that the large, deep rottenness in this British world about them was perhaps
  in the nature of things and anyhow beyond their altering. They too were
  becoming double-minded according to the tradition of the land.</p>

  <p>Yet beneath this acquiescence in the deep-rooted political paradox of
  Britain they were capable of the keenest interest in a number of questions
  that they really believed were alive. It became manifest to them that this
  great golden preposterous world was marred by certain injustices and
  unkindnesses. Something called Labour they heard was unhappy and complained
  of unfair treatment, certain grumblings came from India and Ireland, and
  there was a curiously exciting subject which demanded investigation and
  reforming activities called the sex question. And generally there seemed to
  be, for no particular reason, a lot of restrictions upon people's
  conduct.</p>

  <p>In addition Peter had acquired from Oswald, rather by way of example than
  precept, a very definite persuasion, and Joan had acquired a persuasion that
  was perhaps not quite so clearly and deeply cut, that to make it respectable
  there ought to be something in one's life in the nature of special work. In
  Oswald's case it was his African interest. Peter thought that his own work
  might perhaps be biological. But that one's work ought to join on to the work
  of the people or that all the good work in the world should make one whole
  was a notion that had not apparently entered Peter's mind. Oswald with his
  dread of preachments was doubtful about any deliberate dissertations in the
  matter. He got Peter to begin the Martyrdom of Man, which had so profoundly
  affected his own life, but Peter expressed doubts about the correctness of
  Reade's Egyptian history, and put the book aside and did not go on reading
  it.</p>

  <p>At times Oswald tried to say something to Joan and Peter of his conception
  of the Empire as a great human enterprise, playing a dominating part in the
  establishment of a world peace and a world civilization, and giving a form
  and direction and pride to every life within it. But these perpetual noises
  of royalty in its vulgarest, most personal form, the loyalist chatter of
  illiterate women and the clamour of the New Imperialism to "tax the
  foreigner" and exploit the empire for gain, drowned his intention while it
  was still unspoken in his mind. There were moments when he could already ask
  himself whether this empire he had shaped his life to serve, this knightly
  empire of his, enlightened, righteous, and predominant, was anything better
  than a dream&mdash; or a lie.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 16</h3>

  <p class="first">When Joan left Highmorton she came into the marketplace of
  ideas. She began to read the newspaper. She ceased to be a leggy person with
  a skirt like a kilt and a dark shock of hair not under proper control;
  instead, she became visibly a young lady, albeit a very young young lady, and
  suddenly all adult conversation was open to her.</p>

  <p>Under the brotherly auspices of Peter she joined the Cambridge University
  Fabian Society. Peter belonged to it, but he explained that he didn't approve
  of it. He was in it for its own good. She also took a place in two suffrage
  organizations, and subscribed to three suffrage papers. Tel Wymark, who was
  also in Newton Hall, introduced her to the Club of Strange Faiths, devoted to
  "the impartial examination of all religious systems." And she went under
  proper escort to the First Wednesday in Every Month Teas in Bunny Cuspard's
  rooms. Bunny was an ex-collegiate student, he had big, comfortable rooms in
  Siddermorton Street, and these gatherings of his were designed to be
  discussions, very memorable discussions of the most advanced type, about this
  and that. As a matter of fact they consisted in about equal proportions of
  awkward silences, scornful treatment of current reputations, and Bunny, in a
  loose, inaccurate way, spilling your tea or handing-you edibles. Bunny's
  cakes and sandwiches were wonderful; in that respect he was a born hostess.
  Junior dons and chance visitors to Cambridge would sometimes drift in to
  Bunny's intellectual feasts, and here it was that Joan met young Winterbaum
  again.</p>

  <p>Young Winterbaum was rather a surprise. He had got his features together
  astonishingly since the days of Miss Murgatroyd's school; he had grown a
  moustache, much more of a moustache than Peter was to have for years yet, and
  was altogether remarkably grown up and a man of the world. "Funny lot," he
  remarked to Joan when he had sat down beside her. "Why do you come to
  Cambridge?"</p>

  <p>"My people make me come up here," he explained; "family considerations,
  duty to the old country, loyalty to the old college, and all that. But I'd
  rather be painting. It's the only live thing just now. You up to
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"Ears and eyes and mouth wide open," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"This show isn't worth it. Do you ever drift towards Chelsea?"</p>

  <p>Joan said she went to Hampstead now and then; she stayed sometimes with
  the Sheldricks, who were in a congested house on Downshire Hill now, and
  sometimes with Miss Jepson. Henceforth, now that she was no longer under the
  Highmorton yoke, she hoped to be in London oftener.</p>

  <p>"Did you see the Picasso show?" asked Winterbaum.</p>

  <p>She had not.</p>

  <p>"You missed something," said young Winterbaum, just like old times.
  "Picasso, Mancini; these are the gods of my idolatry...."</p>

  <p>Bunny Cuspard interrupted clumsily with some specially iced cakes. Joan,
  accepting a cake, discovered Wilmington talking absentmindedly to her
  chaperon and looking Pogroms at Winterbaum. So Joan, pleased rather than
  excited by this chance evidence of a continuing interest, lifted up a face of
  bright recognition and smiled and nodded to Wilmington.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 17</h3>

  <p class="first">It was the ambition of Mrs. Sheldrick and her remaining
  daughters&mdash;some of them had married&mdash;to make their home on
  Downshire Hill "a little bit of the London Quartier Latin."</p>

  <p>Mr. Sheldrick had worn out the large, loose, tweed suit that had held him
  together for so long, he had gone to pieces altogether and was dead and
  buried, and the Sheldricks were keeping a home together by the practice of
  decorative arts and promiscuous hospitalities. Mrs. Sheldrick was writing a
  little in the papers of the weaker among the various editors who lived within
  her social range; little vague reviews and poems she wrote, with a quiet
  smile, that were not so much allusive as with an air of having recently had a
  flying visit from an allusion that was unable to stay. Sydney Sheldrick was
  practising sculpture, and Babs was attending the London School of Dramatic
  Art, to which Adela Murchison had also found her way. Antonia, the eldest,
  was in business, making djibbah-like robes.</p>

  <p>There was downstairs and the passage and staircase and upstairs, a
  sitting-room in front, and a sort of oriental lounge (that later in the
  evening became the bedroom of Antonia and Babs) behind. It had all been
  decorated in the most modern style by Antonia in a very blue blue that seemed
  a little threadbare in places and very large, suggestive shapes of orange,
  with a sort of fringe of black and white chequers and a green ceiling with
  harsh pink stars. And the chairs, except for the various ottomans and cosy
  corners which were in faded blue canvas, had been painted bright pink or
  grey.</p>

  <p>Into this house they gathered, after nine and more particularly on
  Saturdays, all sorts of people who chanced to be connected by birth,
  marriage, misfortune, or proclivity with journalism or the arts. Hither came
  Aunt Phoebe Stubland, and read a paper called insistently: <i>Watchman, What
  of the Night?</i> What of it? and quite up to its title; and hither too came
  Aunt Phyllis Stubland, quietly observant. But quite a lot of writers came.
  And in addition there were endless conspirators. There was Mrs. O'Grady, the
  beautiful Irish patriot, who was always dressed like a procession of
  Hibernians in New York, and there was Patrick Lynch, a long, lax black
  object, ending below in large dull boots, and above in a sad white face under
  wiry black hair, grieving for ever that grief for Ireland&mdash;Cathteen ni
  Houlihan and all the rest of it&mdash;that only these long, black, pale
  Irishmen can understand. And there was Eric Schmidt, who was rare among Irish
  patriots because of his genuine knowledge of Erse. All these were great
  conspirators. Then there was Mrs. Punk, who had hunger-struck three times,
  and Miss Corcoran-Deeping the incendiary. And American socialists. And young
  Indians. And one saw the venerable figure of Mr. Woodjer, very old now and
  white and deaf and nervous and indistinct, who had advocated in several
  beautiful and poetical little volumes a new morality that would have put the
  wind up of the Cities of the Plain. And Winterbaum drifted in, but
  cautiously, as doubting whether it wasn't just "a bit too marginal," to bring
  away his two frizzy-haired sisters, very bright-eyed and eager,
  rapid-speaking and <i>au fait</i>, and wonderfully bejewelled for creatures
  so young. They were going in for dancing; they did Spanish dances,
  stupendously clicking down their red heels with absolute precision together;
  they took the Sheldricks on the way to the Contangos or the Mondaines or the
  Levisons, or even to the Hoggenheimers; they glittered at Downshire Hill like
  birds of Paradise, and had the loveliest necks and shoulders and arms.
  Outside waited young Winterbaum's coupé&mdash;a very smart little affair in
  black and cream, with an electric starter wonderfully fitted.</p>

  <p>Here too came young Huntley, who had written three novels before he was
  twenty-two, and who was now thirty and quite well known, not only as a
  novelist of reputation, but as a critic eminently unpopular with actor
  managers; a blond young man with a strong profile, a hungry, scornful
  expression and a greedy, large blue eye that wandered about the crush as if
  it sought something, until it came to rest upon Joan. Thereafter Mr.
  Huntley's other movements and conversation were controlled by a resolution to
  edge towards and overshadow and dominate Joan with the profile as much as
  possible.</p>

  <p>Joan, by various delicacies of perception, was quite aware of these
  approaches without seeming at any time to regard Huntley directly; and by a
  subtlety quite imperceptible to him she drifted away from each advance. She
  did not know who he was, and though the profile interested her, his steadfast
  advance towards her seemed to be premature. Until suddenly an apparently
  quite irrelevant incident spun her mind round to the idea of encouraging
  him.</p>

  <p>The incident was the arrival of Peter.</p>

  <p>Early in the afternoon he had vanished from Mrs. Jepson's, where he and
  Joan were staying; he had not come in to dinner, and now suddenly he appeared
  conspicuously in this gathering of the Sheldricks', conspicuously in the
  company of Hetty Reinhart, who was to Joan, for quite occult reasons, the
  most detestable of all his large circle of detestable friends. That alone was
  enough to tax the self-restraint of an exceedingly hot-tempered foster
  sister. (So this was what Peter had been doing with his time! This had been
  his reason for neglecting his own household! At the <i>Petit Riche</i>, or
  some such place&mdash;with her! A girl with a cockney accent! 'A girl who
  would stroke your arm as soon as speak to you!...) But though the larger
  things in life strain us, it is the smaller things that break us. What
  finally turned Joan over was a glance, a second's encounter with Peter's eye.
  Hetty had sailed forward with that extraordinary effect of hers of being a
  grown-up, experienced woman, to greet Mrs. Sheldrick, and Peter stood behind,
  disregarded. (His expression of tranquil self-satisfaction was maddening.)
  His eye went round the room looking, Joan knew, for two people. It rested on
  Joan.</p>

  <p>The question that Peter was asking Joan mutely across the room was in
  effect this: "Are you behaving yourself, Joan?"</p>

  <p>Then, not quite reassured by an uncontrollable scowl, Peter looked away to
  see if some one else was present. Some one else apparently wasn't present,
  and Joan was unfeignedly sorry.</p>

  <p>He was looking for Mir Jelalludin, the interesting young Indian with the
  beautifully modelled face, whom Joan had met and talked to at the Club of
  Strange Faiths. At the Club of Strange Faiths one day she had been suddenly
  moved to make a short speech about the Buddhist idea of Nirvana, which one of
  the speakers had described as extinction. Making a speech to a little meeting
  was not a very difficult thing for Joan; she had learnt how little terrible a
  thing is to do in the Highmorton debating society, where she had been
  sustained by a grim determination to score off Miss Frobisher. She said that
  she thought the real intention was not extinction at all, but the escape of
  the individual consciousness after its living pilgrimage from one incarnate
  self to another into the universal consciousness. That was the very
  antithesis of extinction; one lost oneself indeed, but one lost oneself not
  in darkness and non-existence, but in light and the fullness of existence.
  There was all the difference between a fainting fit and ecstasy between these
  two conceptions. And it was true of experience that one was least oneself,
  least self-conscious and egotistical at one's time of greatest
  excitement.</p>

  <p>Mir Jelalludin received these remarks with earnest applause. He made as if
  to speak after her, rose in his place, and then hastily sat down. Afterwards
  he came and spoke to her, quite modestly and simply, without the least
  impertinence.</p>

  <p>He explained, with a pleasant staccato accent and little slips in his
  pronunciation that suggested restricted English conversation and much reading
  of books, how greatly he had been wanting to say just what she had said, "so
  bew-ti-fully," but he had been restrained by "impafction of the pronunsation.
  So deefi'clt, you know." One heard English people so often not doing justice
  to Indian ideas so that it was very pleasant to hear them being quite
  sympathetically put.</p>

  <p>There was something very pleasing in the real intellectual excitement that
  had made him speak to her, and there was something very pleasing to the eye
  in the neat precision with which his brown features were chiselled and the
  decisive accuracy of every single hair on his brow. He was, he explained, a
  Moslem, but he was interested in every school of Indian thought. He was
  afraid he was not very orthodox, and he showed a smile of the most perfect
  teeth. There had always been a tendency to universalism in Indian thought,
  that affected even the Moslem. Did she know anything of the Brahmo Somaj? Had
  she read any novel of Chatterji's There was at least one great novel of his
  the English ought to read, the Ananda Math. No one could understand Indian
  thought properly who had not read it. He had a translation of it into
  English&mdash;which he would lend her.</p>

  <p>Would she be interested to read it?</p>

  <p>Might he send it to her?</p>

  <p>Joan's chaperon was a third year girl who put no bar upon these amenities.
  Joan accepted the book and threw out casually that she sometimes went to
  Bunny Cuspard's teas. If Mr. Jelalludin sent her Chatterji's book she could
  return it to Bunny Cuspard's rooms.</p>

  <p>It was in Bunny Cuspard's room that Peter had first become aware of this
  exotic friendship. He discovered his Joan snugly in a corner listening to an
  explanation of the attitude of Islam towards women. It had been enormously
  misrepresented in Christendom. Mr. Jelalludin was very earnest in his
  exposition, and Joan listened with a pleasant smile and regarded him
  pleasantly and wished that she could run her fingers just once along his
  eyebrow without having her motives misunderstood.</p>

  <p>But at the sight of his Joan engaged in this confabulation Peter suddenly
  discovered all the fiercest traits of race pride. He fretted about the room
  and was rude to other people and watched a book change hands, and waited
  scarcely twenty seconds after the end of Joan's conversation before he came
  up to her.</p>

  <p>"I say, Joan," he said, "you can't go chumming with Indians anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, "we've chummed with India."</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense! Not socially. Their standards are different."</p>

  <p>"I hope they are," said Joan. "The way you make these Indian boys here
  feel like outcasts is disgraceful."</p>

  <p>"They're different. The men aren't uncivil to them. But it isn't for
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's for all English people to treat them well. He's a charming young
  man."</p>

  <p>"It isn't <i>done</i>, Joan."</p>

  <p>"It's going to be, Petah."</p>

  <p>"You're meeting him again?"</p>

  <p>"If I think proper."</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said Peter, baffled for the time. "All right, Joan."</p>

  <p>A fierce exchange of notes followed. "Don't you understand the fellow's a
  polygamist?" Peter wrote. "He keeps his women in purdah. No decent woman
  could be talked to in India as he talked to you. Not even an introduction.
  Personally, I've no objection to any friends you make provided they are
  decent friends...."</p>

  <p>"He isn't a polygamist," Joan replied. "I've asked him. And every one says
  he's a first-rate cricketer. As for decent friends, Peter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The issue had been still undecided when they came down for the Christmas
  vacation.</p>

  <p>So far Joan had maintained her positions without passion. But now suddenly
  her indignation at Peter's interference flared to heaven. That he should come
  here, hot from Soho, to tyrannize over her! Indians indeed! As if Hetty
  Reinhart wasn't worse than a Gold Coast nigger!...</p>

  <p>The only outward manifestation of this wild storm of resentment had been
  her one instant's scowl at Peter. Thereafter Joan became again the quiet,
  intelligently watchful young woman she had been all that evening. But now she
  turned herself through an angle of about thirty degrees towards Huntley, who
  was talking to old Mrs. Jex, the wonder of Hampstead, who used to know George
  Eliot and Huxley, the while he was regarding Joan with sidelong covetousness.
  Joan lifted her eyes towards him with an expression of innocent interest. The
  slightly projecting blue eyes seemed to leap in response.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Jex was always rather inattentive to her listener when she was
  reciting her reminiscences, and Huntley was able to turn away from her
  quietly without interrupting the flow.</p>

  <p>The Sheldrick circle scorned the formalities of introductions. "Are you
  from the Slade school?" said Huntley.</p>

  <p>"Cambridge," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"My name's Gavan Huntley."</p>

  <p>But this was going to be more amusing than Joan had expected. This was a
  real live novelist&mdash;Joan's first. Not a fortnight ago she had read
  <i>The Pernambuco Bun-shop</i>, and thought it rather clever and silly.</p>

  <p>"Not <i>the</i> Gavan Huntley?" she said.</p>

  <p>His face became faintly luminous with satisfaction. "Just Gavan Huntley,"
  he said with a large smile.</p>

  <p>"<i>The Pernambuco Bun-shop</i>?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Guilty," he pleaded, smiling still more naively.</p>

  <p>One had expected something much less natural in a novelist.</p>

  <p>"I loved it," said Joan, and Huntley was hers to do what she liked with.
  Joan's idea of a proper conversation required it to be in a corner. "Do
  Sheldricks never sit down?" she asked. "I've been standing all the
  evening."</p>

  <p>"They can't," he said confidentially. "They're the other sort of Dutch
  doll, the cheap sort, that hasn't got joints at the knees."</p>

  <p>"Antonia sometimes leans against the wall."</p>

  <p>"Her utmost. The next thing would be to sit on the floor with her legs
  straight out. I've seen her do that. But there is a sort of bench on the
  staircase landing."</p>

  <p>Thither they made their way, and there presently Peter found them.</p>

  <p>He found them because he was making for that very corner in the company of
  Sydney Sheldrick. "Hullo!" said Sydney. "That you, Joan?"</p>

  <p>"We've taken this corner for the. evening," said Huntley, laying a
  controlling hand on Joan's pretty wrist.</p>

  <p>Joan and Peter regarded each other darkly.</p>

  <p>"There ought to be more seats about somewhere," said Sydney. "Come up to
  the divan, old Peter...."</p>

  <p>Of course Peter must object to Huntley. They were scarcely out of the
  Sheldricks' house when he began. "That man Huntley's a bad egg, Joan.
  Everybody knows it."</p>

  <p>For a time they disputed about Huntley. "Peter," said Joan, with affected
  calm, "is there any man, do you think, to whom so&mdash;so untrustworthy a
  girl as I am might safely talk?"</p>

  <p>Peter seemed to consider. "There's chaps like Troop," he said.</p>

  <p>"Troop!" said Joan, relying on her intonation.</p>

  <p>"It isn't that you're untrustworthy," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Fragile?"</p>

  <p>"It's the look and tone of things."</p>

  <p>"I wonder how you get these ideas."</p>

  <p>"What ideas?"</p>

  <p>"Of how I behave in a corner with Jelalludin or Gavan Huntley."</p>

  <p>"I haven't suggested anything."</p>

  <p>"You've suggested everything. Do you think I collect stray kisses like
  Sydney Sheldrick? Do you think I'm a dirty little&mdash;little&mdash;cocotte
  like Hetty Reinhart?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Joan</i>!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Well</i>," said Joan savagely, and said no more.</p>

  <p>Peter came to the defence of Hetty belatedly. "How can you say such things
  of Hetty?" he asked. "What can you know about her?"</p>

  <p>"Pah! I can smell what she is across a room. Do you think I'm an absolute
  young fool, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"You've got no right, Joan&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why argue, Peter, why argue? When things are plain. Can't you go your own
  way, Peter"&mdash;Joan was annoyed to find suddenly that she was weeping.
  Tears were running down her face. But the road was dark, and perhaps if she
  gave no sign Peter would not see. "You go your own way, Peter, go your own
  way, and let me go mine."</p>

  <p>Peter was silent for a little while. Then compunction betrayed itself in
  his voice.</p>

  <p>"It's you I'm thinking of, Joan. I can't bear to see you make yourself
  cheap."</p>

  <p>"Cheap! And <i>you</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I'm different. I'm altogether different. A man is."</p>

  <p>Silence for a time. Joan seemed to push back her hair, and so smeared the
  tears from her face.</p>

  <p>"We interfere with each other," she said at last. "We interfere with each
  other. What is the good of it? You've got to go your way and I've got to go
  mine. We used to have fun&mdash;lots of fun. Now....."</p>

  <p>She couldn't say any more for a while.</p>

  <p>"I'm going my own way, Peter. It's a different way&mdash; Leave me alone.
  Keep off!"</p>

  <p>They said no more. When they got in they found Miss Jepson sitting by the
  fire, and she had got them some cocoa and biscuits. The headache that had
  kept her from the Sheldrick festival had lifted, and Joan plunged at once
  into a gay account of the various people she had seen that
  evening&mdash;saving and excepting Gavan Huntley. But Peter stood by the
  fireplace, silent, looking down into the fire, sulking or grieving. All the
  while that Joan rattled on to Miss Jepson she was watching him with almost
  imperceptible glances and wondering whether he sulked or grieved. Did he feel
  as she felt? If he sulked&mdash;well, confound him! But what if this
  perplexing dissension hurt him as much as it was hurting her!</p><br>

  <h3>§ 18</h3>

  <p class="first">Joan had long since lost that happiness, that perfect
  assurance, that intense appreciation of the beauty in things which had come
  to her with early adolescence. She was troubled and perplexed in all her
  ways. She was full now of stormy, indistinct desires and fears, and a
  gnawing, indefinite impatience. No religion had convinced her of a purpose in
  her life, neither Highmorton nor Cambridge had suggested any mundane devotion
  to her, nor pointed her ambitions to a career. The only career these feminine
  schools and colleges recognized was a career of academic successes and High
  School teaching, intercalated with hunger strikes for the Vote, and Joan had
  early decided she would rather die than teach in a High School. Nor had she
  the quiet assurance her own beauty would have given her in an earlier
  generation of a discreet choice of lovers and marriage and living "happily
  ever afterwards." She had a horror of marriage lurking in her composition;
  Mrs. Pybus and Highmorton had each contributed to that; every one around her
  spoke of it as an entire abandonment of freedom. Moreover there was this
  queerness about her birth&mdash;she was beginning to understand better now in
  what that queerness consisted&mdash;that seemed to put her outside the
  customary ceremonies of veil and orange blossoms. "Why did they not tell her
  all about it&mdash;what her mother was and where her mother was? It must be a
  pretty awful business, if neither Aunt Phyllis nor Aunt Phoebe would ever
  allude to it. It would have to come out&mdash;perhaps some monstrous
  story&mdash;before she could marry. And who could one marry? She could not
  conceive herself marrying any of these boys she met, living somewhere cooped
  up in a little house with solemn old Troop, or under the pursuing eyes, the
  convulsive worship, of Wilmington. She had no object in life, no star by
  which to steer, and she was full of the fever of life. She was getting
  awfully old. She was eighteen. She was nineteen. Soon she would be
  twenty.</p>

  <p>All her being, in her destitution of any other aim that had the slightest
  hold upon her imagination, was crying out for a lover.</p>

  <p>It was a lover she wanted, not a husband; her mind made the clearest
  distinction between the two. He would come and unrest would cease, confusion
  would cease and beauty would return. Her lover haunted all her life, an
  invisible yet almost present person. She could not imagine his face nor his
  form, he was the blankest of beings, and yet she was so sure she knew him
  that if she were to see him away down a street or across a crowded room,
  instantly, she believed, she would recognize him. And until he came life was
  a torment of suspense. Life was all wrong and discordant, so wrong and
  discordant that at times she could have hated her lover for keeping her
  waiting so wretchedly.</p>

  <p>And she had to go on as though this suspense was nothing. She had to
  disregard this vast impatience of her being. And the best way to do that, it
  seemed to her, was to hurry from one employment to another, never to be
  alone, never without some occupation, some excitement. Her break with Peter
  had an extraordinary effect of release in her mind. Hitherto, whatever her
  resentment had been she had admitted in practice his claim to exact a certain
  discretion from her; his opinion had been, in spite of her resentment, a
  standard for her. Now she had no standard at all&mdash;unless it was a
  rebellious purpose to spite him. On Joan's personal conduct the thought of
  Oswald, oddly enough, had scarcely any influence at all. She adored him as
  one might a political or historical. hero; she wanted to stand well in his
  sight, but the idea of him did not pursue her into the details of her
  behaviour at all. He seemed preoccupied with ideas and unobservant. She had
  never had any struggle with him; he had never made her do anything. And as
  for Aunts Phyllis and Phoebe&mdash;while the latter seemed to make vague
  gestures towards quite unutterable liberties, the former maintained an
  attitude of nervous disavowal. She was a woman far too uncertain^minded for
  plain speaking. She was a dear. Clearly she hated cruelty and baseness;
  except in regard to such things she set no bounds.</p>

  <p>Hitherto Joan had had a very few flirtations; the extremest thing upon her
  conscience was Bunny Cuspard's kiss. She had the naturally shilly-shally of a
  girl; she was strongly moved to all sorts of flirtings and experimentings
  with love, and very adventurous and curious in these matters; and also she
  had a system of inhibitions, pride, hesitation, fastidiousness, and something
  beyond these things, a sense of some ultimate value that might easily be
  lost, that held her back. Rebelling against Peter had somehow also set her
  rebelling against these restraints. Why shouldn't she know this and that? Why
  shouldn't she try this and that? Why, for instance, was she always "shutting
  up" Adela whenever she began to discourse in her peculiar way upon the great
  theme? Just a timid prude she had been, but now....</p>

  <p>And all this about undesirable people and unseemly places, all this
  picking and choosing as though the world was mud; what nonsense it was! She
  could take care of herself surely!</p>

  <p>She began deliberately to feel her way through all her friendships to see
  whether this thing, passion, lurked in any of them. It was an interesting
  exercise of her wits to try over a youth like old Troop, for example; to lure
  him on by a touch of flattery, a betrayal of warmth in her interest, to
  reciprocal advances. At first Troop wasn't in the least in love with her, but
  she succeeded in suggesting to him that he was. But the passion in him
  released an unsuspected fund of egotistical discourse; he developed a
  disposition to explain himself and his mental operations in a large,
  flattering way both by word of mouth and by letter. Even when he was roused
  to a sense of her as lovable, he did not become really interested in her but
  only in his love for her. He arrived at one stride at the same unanalytical
  acceptance of her as of his God and the Church and the King and his parents
  and all the rest of the Anglican system of things. She was his
  girl&mdash;"the kid." He really wasn't interested in those other things any
  more than he was in her; once he had given her her role in relation to him
  his attention returned to himself. The honour, integrity, and perfection of
  Troop were the consuming occupations of his mind. This was an edifying thing
  to discover, but not an entertaining thing to pursue; and after a time Joan
  set herself to avoid, miss, and escape from Troop on every possible occasion.
  But Troop prided himself upon his persistence. He took to writing her
  immense, ill-spelt, manly letters, with sentences beginning: "You understand
  me very little if&mdash;" It was clear he was hers only until some simpler,
  purer, more receptive and acquisitive girl swam into his ken.</p>

  <p>Wilmington, on the other hand, was a silent covetous lover. Joan could
  make him go white, but she could not make him talk. She was a little afraid
  of him and quite sure of him. But he was not the sort of young man one can
  play with, and she marvelled greatly that any one could desire her so much
  and amuse her so little. Bunny Cuspard was a more animated subject for
  experiment, and you could play with him a lot. He danced impudently. He could
  pat Joan's shoulder, press her hand, slip his arm round her waist and bring
  his warm face almost to a kissing contact as though it was all nothing. Did
  these approaches warm her blood? Did she warm his? Anyhow it didn't matter,
  and it wasn't anything.</p>

  <p>Then there was Graham Prothero, a very good-looking friend of Peter's,
  whom she had met while skating. He had a lively eye, and jumped after a
  meeting or so straight into Joan's dreams, where he was still more lively and
  good-looking. She wished she knew more certainly whether she had got into his
  dreams.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Joan's curiosity had not spared Jelalludin.</p>

  <p>She had had him discoursing on the beauties of Indian love, and spinning
  for her imagination a warm moonlight vision of still temples reflected in
  water tanks, of silvery water shining between great lily leaves, of music
  like the throbbing of a nerve, of brown bodies garlanded with flowers. There
  had been a loan of Rabindranath Tagore's love poems. And once he had sent her
  some flowers.</p>

  <p>Any of these youths she could make her definite lover she knew, by an act
  of self-adaptation and just a little reciprocal giving. Only she had no will
  to do that. She felt she must not will anything of the sort. The thing must
  come to her; it must take possession of her. Sometimes, indeed, she had the
  oddest fancy that perhaps suddenly one of these young men would become
  transfigured; would cease to be his clumsy, ineffective self, and change
  right into that wonderful, that compelling being who was to set all things
  right. There were moments when it seemed about to happen. And then the
  illusion passed, and she saw clearly that it was just old Bunny or just
  staccato Mir Jelalludin.</p>

  <p>In Huntley, Joan found something more intriguing than this pursuit of the
  easy and the innocent. Huntley talked with a skilful impudence that made a
  bold choice of topics seem the most natural in the world. He presented
  himself as a leader in a great emancipation of women. They were to be freed
  from "the bondage of sex." The phrase awakened a warm response in Joan, who
  was finding sex a yoke about her imagination. Sex, Huntley declared, should
  be as incidental in a woman's life as it was in a man's. But before that
  could happen the world must free its mind from the "superstition of
  chastity," from the idea that by one single step a woman passed from the
  recognizable into an impossible category. We made no such distinction in the
  case of men; an artist or a business man was not suddenly thrust out of the
  social system by a sexual incident. A woman was either Mrs. or Miss; a gross
  publication of elemental facts that were surely her private affair. No one
  asked whether a man had found his lover. Why should one proclaim it in the
  case of a woman by a conspicuous change of her name? Here, and not in any
  matter of votes or economics was the real feminine grievance. His indignation
  was contagious. It marched with all Joan's accumulated prejudice against
  marriage, and all her growing resentment at the way in which emotional unrest
  was distracting and perplexing her will and spoiling her work at Cambridge.
  But when Huntley went on to suggest that the path to freedom lay in the
  heroic abandonment of the "fetish of chastity," Joan was sensible of a
  certain lagging of spirit. A complex of instincts that conspired to adumbrate
  that unseen, unknown, and yet tyrannous lover, who would not leave her m
  peace and yet would not reveal himself, stood between her and the extremities
  of Huntley 'a logic.</p>

  <p>There were moments when he seemed to be pretending to fill that oppressive
  void; moments when he seemed only to be hinting at himself as a possible
  instrument of freedom. Joan listened to him gravely enough so long as he
  theorized; when he came to personal things she treated him with the same
  experimental and indecisive encouragement that she dealt out to her
  undergraduate friends. Huntley's earlier pose of an intellectual friend was
  attractive and flattering; then he began to betray passion, as it were,
  unwittingly. At a fancy dress dance at Chelsea&mdash;and he danced almost as
  well as Joan&mdash;he became moody. He was handsome that night in black
  velvet and silver that betrayed much natural grace; Joan was a nondescript in
  black and red, with short skirts and red beads about her pretty neck. "Joan,"
  he said suddenly, "you're getting hold of me. You're disturbing me." He
  seemed to soliloquize. "I've not felt like this before." Then very
  flatteringly and reproachfully, "You're so damned intelligent, Joan. And you
  dance&mdash;as though God made you to make me happy." He got her out into an
  open passage that led from the big studio in which they had been dancing, to
  a yard dimly lit by Chinese lanterns, and at the dark turn of the passage
  kissed her more suddenly and violently than she had ever been kissed before.
  He kissed her lips and held her until she struggled out of his arms. Up that
  moment Joan had been playing with him, half attracted and half shamming; then
  once more came the black panic that had seized her with Bunny and Adela.</p>

  <p>She did not know whether she liked him now or hated him. She felt strange
  and excited. She made him go back with her into the studio. "I've got to
  dance with Ralph Winterbaum," she said.</p>

  <p>"Say you're not offended," he pleaded. She gave him no answer. She did not
  know the answer. She wanted to get away and think. He perceived her confused
  excitement and did not want to give her time to think. She found Winterbaum
  and danced with him, and all the time, with her nerves on fire, she was
  watching Huntley, and he was watching her. Then she became aware of Peter
  regarding her coldly, over the plump shoulder of a fashion-plate artist. She
  went to him as soon as the dance was over. "Peter," she said, "I want to go
  home." He surveyed her. She was flushed and ruffled, and his eyes and mouth
  hardened. "It's early."</p>

  <p>"I want to go home."</p>

  <p>"Right. You're a bit of a responsibility, Joan. "Don't, then," she said
  shortly, and turned round to greet Huntley as though nothing had happened
  between them.</p>

  <p>But she kept in the light and the crowd, and there was a constraint
  between them. "I want to talk to you more," he said, "and when we can talk
  without some one standing on one's toes all the time and listening hard. I
  wish ^you'd come to my flat and have tea with me one day. It's still and
  cosy, and I could tell you all sorts of things&mdash;things I can't tell you
  here."</p>

  <p>Joan's dread of any appearance of timid virtue was overwhelming. And she
  was now blind with rage at Peter-why, she would have been at a loss to say.
  She wanted to behave outrageously with Huntley. But in Peter's sight. This
  struck her as an altogether too extensive invitation.</p>

  <p>"I've never noticed much restraint in your conversation," she said.</p>

  <p>"It's the interruptions I don't like," he said. "You get me no ice, you
  get me no lemonade," she complained abruptly.</p>

  <p>"That's what my dear Aunt Adelaide used to call changing the subject."</p>

  <p>"It's the cry of outraged nature."</p>

  <p>"But I saw you having an ice&mdash;not half an hour ago."</p>

  <p>"Not the ice I wanted," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"Distracting Joan! I suppose I must get you that ice. But about the
  tea?"</p>

  <p>"I hate tea," said Joan, with a force of decision that for a time disposed
  of his project.</p>

  <p>Just for a moment he hovered with his eye on her, weighing just what that
  decision amounted to, and in that moment she decided that he wasn't handsome,
  that there was something unsound about his profile, that he was pressing her
  foolishly. And anyhow, none of it really mattered. He was nothing really. She
  had been a fool to go into that dark passage, she ought to have known her man
  better; Huntley had been amusing hitherto and now the thing had got into a
  new phase that wouldn't, she felt, be amusing at all; after this he would
  pester. She hated being kissed. And Peter was a beast. Peter was a hateful
  beast....</p>

  <p>Joan and Peter went home in the same taxi&mdash;in a grim silence. Yet
  neither of them could have told what it was that kept them hostile and
  silent.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 19</h3>

  <p class="first">But Joan and Peter were not always grimly silent with one
  another. The black and inexplicable moods came and passed again. Between
  these perplexing mute conflicts of will, they were still good friends. "When
  they were alone together they were always disposed to be good friends; it was
  the presence and excitement and competition of others that disturbed their
  relationship; it was when the species invaded their individualities and
  threatened their association with its occult and passionate demands. They
  would motor-cycle together through the lanes and roads of Hertfordshire,
  lunch cheerfully at wayside inns, brotherly and sisterly, relapse again into
  mere boy and girl playfellows, race and climb trees, or, like
  fellow-students, share their common room amicably, dispute over a multitude
  of questions, and talk to Oswald. They both had a fair share of scholarly
  ambition and read pretty hard. They had both now reached the
  newspaper-reading stage. Peter was beginning to take an interest in politics,
  he wanted to discuss socialism and economic organization thoroughly;
  biological work alone among all scientific studies carries a philosophy of
  its own that illuminates these questions, and Oswald was happy to try over
  his current interests in the light of these fresh, keen young minds. Peter
  was a discriminating advocate of the ideas of Guild socialism; Oswald was
  still a cautious individualist drifting towards Fabianism. The great labour
  troubles that had followed the Coronation of King George had been necessary
  to convince him that all was not well with the economic organization of the
  empire. Hitherto he had taken economic organization for granted; it wasn't a
  matter for Sydenhams.</p>

  <p>Pelham Ford at such times became a backwater from the main current of
  human affairs, the current that was now growing steadily more rapid and
  troubled. Thinking could go on at Pelham Ford. There were still forces in
  that old-world valley to resist the infection of intense impatience that was
  spreading throughout the world. The old red house behind its wall and iron
  gates seemed as stable as the little hills about it; the road and the row of
  great trees between the stream and the road, the high pathway and the ford
  and the village promised visibly to endure for a thousand years. It was when
  Aunt Phyllis or Aunt Phoebe descended upon the place to make a party, "get a
  lot of young people down and brighten things up," or when the two youngsters
  went to London together into the Sheldrick translation of the Quartier Latin,
  or when they met in Cambridge in some crowded chattering room that
  imagination grew feverish, fierce jealousies awoke, temperaments jarred, and
  the urge of adolescence had them in its clutch again.</p>

  <p>It was during one of these parties at Pelham Ford that Joan was to happen
  upon two great realizations, realizations of so profound an effect that they
  may serve to mark the end for her of this great process of emotional upheaval
  and discovery that is called adolescence. They left her shaped. They came to
  her in no dramatic circumstances, they were mere conversational incidents,
  but their effect was profound and conclusive.</p>

  <p>In the New Year of 1914 Oswald was to take Peter to Russia for three
  weeks. Before his departure, Aunt Phoebe had insisted that there should be a
  Christmas gathering of the young at Pelham Ford. They would skate or walk or
  toboggan or play hockey by day, and dress up and dance or improvize charades
  and burlesques in the evening. One or two Sheldricks would come, Peter and
  Joan could bring down any stray friends who had no home Christmas to call
  them, and Aunts Phyllis and Phoebe would collect a few young people in
  London.</p>

  <p>The gathering was from the first miscellaneous. Christmas is a homing time
  for the undergraduates of both sexes, such modern spirits as the home failed
  to attract used to go in those days in great droves to the Swiss winter
  sports, and Joan found nobody but an ambitious Scotch girl whom she knew but
  slightly and Miss Scroby the historian, who was rather a friend for Aunt
  Phyllis than herself. Peter discovered that Wilmington intensely preferred
  Pelham Ford to his parental roof, and brought also two other stray men,
  orphans. This selection was supplemented by Aunt Phoebe, who had latterly
  made Hetty Reinhart her especial protegee. She descanted upon the obvious
  beauty of Hetty and upon the courage that had induced Hetty to leave her home
  in Preston and manage for herself in a great lonely studio upon Haverstock
  Hill. "The bachelor woman," said Aunt Phoebe; "armed with a latchkey and her
  purity. A vote shall follow. Hetty is not one of the devoted yet. But I have
  my hopes. We need our Beauty Chorus. Hetty shall be our Helen, and Holloway
  our Troy."</p>

  <p>So with Peter's approval Hetty was added to the list before Joan could
  express an opinion, and appeared with a moderate sized valise that contained
  some extremely exiguous evening costumes, and a steadfast eye that rested
  most frequently on Peter. In addition Aunt Phoebe brought two Irish sisters,
  one frivolous, the other just recuperating from the hunger-strike that had
  ended her imprisonment for window-breaking in pursuit of the Vote, and a very
  shy youth of seventeen, Pryce, the caddie-poet. Huntley was to constitute a
  sort of outside element in the party, sharing apartments with young Sopwith
  Greene the musician, in the village about half a mile away. These two men
  were to work and keep away when they chose, and come in for meals and sports
  as they thought fit. At the eleventh hour had come a pathetic and
  irresistible telegram from Adela Murchison:</p>

  <p class="telegram"><tt>ALONE XMAS MAY I COME WIRE IF INCONVENIENT.</tt></p>

  <p>and she, too, was comprehended.</p>

  <p>The vicarage girls were available for games and meals except on Sunday and
  Christmas Day; there was a friendly family of five sons and two daughters at
  Braughing, a challenging hockey club at Bishop's Stortford, and a scratch
  collection at Newport available by motor-car for a pick-up match if the
  weather proved, as it did prove, too open for skating.</p>

  <p>Oswald commonly stood these Aunt parties for a day or so and then
  retreated to the Climax Club. Always beforehand he promised himself great
  interest and pleasure in the company of a number of exceptionally bright and
  representative youths and maidens of the modern school, but always the actual
  gathering fatigued him and distressed him. The youths and maidens wouldn't be
  representative, they talked too loud, too fast and too inconsecutively for
  him, their wit was too rapid and hard&mdash;and they were all over the house.
  It was hard to get mental contacts with them. They paired off when there were
  no games afoot, and if ever talk at table ceased to be fragmentary Aunt
  Phoebe took control of it. In a day or so he would begin to feel at Pelham
  Ford like a cat during a removal; driven out of his dear library, which was
  the only available room for dancing, he would try to work in his unaccustomed
  study, with vivid, interesting young figures passing his window in groups of
  two or three, or only too audibly discussing the world, each other, and their
  general arrangements, in the hall.</p>

  <p>His home would have felt altogether chaotic to him but for the presence,
  the unswerving, if usually invisible, presence of Mrs. Moxton, observing
  times and seasons, providing copious suitable meals, dominating by means of
  the gong, replacing furniture at every opportunity, referring with a calm
  dignity to Joan as the hostess for all the rules and sanctions she deemed
  advisable. From unseen points of view one felt her eye. One's consolation for
  the tumult lay in one's confidence in this discretion that lay behind it.
  Even Aunt Phoebe's way of speaking of "our good Moxton" did not mask the
  facts of the case. Pelham Ford was ruled. At Pelham Ford even Aunt Phoebe
  came down to meals in time. At Pelham Ford no fire, once lit, ever went out
  before it was right for it to do so. You might in pursuit of facetious ends
  choose to put your pyjamas outside your other clothes, wrap your window
  curtains about you, sport and dance, and finally, drawn off to some other
  end, abandon these wrappings in the dining-room, or on the settee on the
  landing. When you went to bed your curtains hung primly before your window
  again, and your pyjamas lay folded and reproved upon your bed.</p>

  <p>The disposition of the new generation to change its clothes, adopt
  fantastic clothes, and at any reasonable excuse get right out of its clothes
  altogether, greatly impressed Oswald. Hetty in particular betrayed a delight
  in the beauties of her own body with a freedom that in Oswald's youth was
  permitted only to sculpture. But Adela made no secrets of her plump shoulders
  and arms, and Joan struck him as insensitive. Skimpiness was the fashion in
  dress at that time. No doubt it was all for the best, like the frankness of
  Spartan maidens. And another thing that brought a flavour of harsh modernity
  into the house was the perpetual music and dancing that raged about it. There
  was a pianola in the common room of Joan and Peter, but when they were alone
  at home it served only for an occasional outbreak of Bach, or Beethoven, or
  Chopin. Now it was in a state of almost continuous eruption. Aunt Phyllis had
  ordered a number of rolls of dance music from the Orchestrelle library, and
  in addition she had brought down a gramophone. Never before had music been so
  easy in the world as it was in those days. In Oswald's youth music, good
  music, was the rare privilege of a gifted few, one heard it rarely and
  listened with reverence. Nowadays Joan could run through a big fragment of
  the Ninth Symphony, giving a rendering far better than any but a highly
  skilled pianist could play, while she was waiting for Peter to come to
  breakfast. And this Christmas party was pervaded with One Steps and Two
  Steps, pianola called to gramophone and gramophone to pianola, and tripping
  feet somewhere never failed to respond. Most of these young people danced
  with the wildest informality. But Hetty and the youngest Irish girl were
  serious propagandists of certain strange American dances, the Bunny Hug, and
  the Fox Trot; Sopwith Greene and Adela tangoed and were getting quite good at
  it, and Huntley wanted to teach Joan an Apache dance. Joan danced by rule and
  pattern or by the light of nature as occasion required.</p>

  <p>The Christmas dinner was at one o 'clock, a large disorderly festival.
  Gavan Huntley and Sopwith Greene came in for it. Oswald carved a turkey, Aunt
  Phyllis dispensed beef; the room was darkened and the pudding was brought in
  flaming blue and distributed in flickering flames. Mince-pies, almonds and
  raisins, Brazil nuts, oranges, tangerines, Carlsbad plums, crystallized
  fruits and candied peel; nothing was missing from the customary feast. Then
  came a mighty banging of crackers, pre-war crackers, containing elaborate
  paper costumes and preposterous gifts. Wilmington ate little and Huntley a
  great deal, and whenever Joan glanced at them they seemed to be looking at
  her. Hetty, flushed and excited, became really pretty in a paper cap of
  liberty, she waved a small tricolour flag and knelt up in her chair to pull
  crackers across the table; Peter won a paper cockscomb and was moved to come
  and group himself under her arm and crow as "<i>Vive la France!</i>" The two
  Irish girls started an abusive but genial argument with Sopwith Greene upon
  the Irish question. Aunt Phoebe sat near Aunt Phyllis and discoursed on
  whether she ought to go to prison for the Vote. "I try to assault policemen,"
  she said. "But they elude me." One of Peter's Cambridge friends, it came to
  light, had been present at a great scene in which Aunt Phoebe had figured. He
  emerged from his social obscurity and described the affair rather
  amusingly.</p>

  <p>It had been at an Anti-Suffrage meeting in West Kensington, and Aunt
  Phoebe had obtained access to the back row of the platform by some specious
  device. Among the notabilities in front Lady Charlotte Sydenham and her
  solicitor had figured. Lady Charlotte had entered upon that last great phase
  in a woman's life, that phase known to the vulgar observer as "old lady's
  second wind." It is a phase often of great Go and determination, a joy to the
  irreverent young and a marvel and terror to the middle-aged. She had taken to
  politics, plunged into public speaking, faced audiences. It was the Insurance
  Act of 1912 that had first moved her to such publicity. Stung by the
  outrageous possibility of independent-spirited servants she had given up her
  usual trip to Italy in the winter and stayed to combat Lloyd George. From
  mere subscriptions and drawing-room conversations and committees to
  drawing-room meetings and at last to public meetings had been an easy series
  of steps for her. At first a mere bridling indignation on the platform, she
  presently spoke. As a speaker she combined reminiscences of Queen Elizabeth
  at Tilbury and Marie Antoinette on the scaffold with vast hiatuses peculiar
  to herself. "My good people," she would say, disregarding the more
  conventional methods of opening, "have we neglected our servants or have we
  not? Is any shop Gal or factory Gal half so well off as a servant in a good
  house? Is she? I ask. The food alone! The morals I And now we are to be taxed
  and made to lick stamps like a lot of galley-slaves to please a bumptious
  little Welsh solicitor! For my part I shall discontinue all my charitable
  subscriptions until this abominable Act is struck off the Statute Book. Every
  one. And as for buying these</p>

  <p>Preposterous stamps Rather than lick a stamp I will eat</p>

  <p>skilly in prison. Stamps indeed. I'd as soon lick the man's boots. That's
  all I have to say, Mr. Chairman (or 'My Lord,' or 'Mrs. Chairman,' as the
  case might be). I hope it will be enough. Thank you." And she would sit down
  breathing heavily and looking for eyes to meet.</p>

  <p>For the great agitation against the Insurance Act that sort of thing
  sufficed, but when it came to testifying against an unwomanly clamour for
  votes, the argument became more complicated and interruptions difficult to
  handle, and after an unpleasant experience when she was only able to repeat
  in steadily rising tones, "I am not one of the Shrieking Sisterhood" ten
  times over to a derisive roomful, she decided to adopt the more feminine
  expedient of a spokesman. She had fallen back upon Mr. Grimes, who like all
  solicitors had his parliamentary ambitions, and she took him about with her
  in the comfortable brown car that had long since replaced the white horse,
  and sat beside him while he spoke and approved of him with both hands. Mr.
  Grimes had been addressing the meeting when Aunt Phoebe made her
  interruption. He had been arguing that the unfitness of women for military
  service debarred them from the Vote. "Let us face the facts," he said,
  drawing the air in between his teeth. "Ultimately&mdash;ultimately all social
  organization rests upon Force."</p>

  <p>It was just at this moment that cries of "Order, Order," made him aware of
  a feminine figure close beside him. He turned to meet the heaving wrath of
  Aunt Phoebe's face. There was just an instant's scrutiny. Then he remembered,
  he remembered everything, and with a wild shriek leapt clean off the platform
  upon the toes of the front row of the audience.</p>

  <p>"If you touch me!" he screamed....</p>

  <p>The young man told the incident briefly and brightly.</p>

  <p>"Thereby hangs a tale," said Aunt Phoebe darkly, and became an allusive
  Sphinx for the rest of the dinner.</p>

  <p>"I shook that man," she said at last to Pryce.</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;<i>him</i>?" said Pryce, staring round-eyed at the young man
  from Cambridge.</p>

  <p>"No, the man at the meeting."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;afterwards?" said Pryce, lost and baffled.</p>

  <p>"No," said Aunt Phoebe; "before."</p>

  <p>Pryce tried to look intelligent, and nodded his head very fast to conceal
  the fear and confusion in his mind.</p>

  <p>Amidst all these voices and festivities sat Oswald, with a vast paper cap
  shaped rather like the dome of a Russian church cocked over his blind side,
  listening distractedly, noting this and that, saying little, thinking many
  things.</p>

  <p>The banquet ended at last, and every one drifted to the library.</p>

  <p>Affairs hovered vaguely for a time. Peter handed cigarettes about. Some
  one started the gramophone with a Two Step that set every one tripping. Hetty
  with a flush on her cheek and a light in her eyes was keeping near Peter; she
  seized upon him now for a dance that was also an embrace. Peter laughed,
  nothing loath. "Oh! but this is glorious!" panted Hetty.</p>

  <p>"Come and dance, too, Joan," said Wilmington.</p>

  <p>"It's stuffy! "said Joan.</p>

  <p>Oswald, contemplating a retreat to his study armchair, found her presently
  in the hall dressed to go out with Huntley.</p>

  <p>"We're going over the hill to see the sunset," Joan explained. "It's too
  stuffy in there."</p>

  <p>Oswald met Huntley's large grey eye for a moment. He had an instinctive
  distrust of Huntley. But on the other hand, surely Joan had brains enough and
  fastidiousness enough not to lose her head with this&mdash;this
  phosphorescent fish of a novelist.</p>

  <p>"Right-o," said Oswald, and hovered doubtfully.</p>

  <p>Aunt Phoebe appeared on the landing above carrying off a rather reluctant
  Miss Scroby to her room for a real good talk; a crash and an unmistakable
  giggle proclaimed a minor rag in progress in the common room across the hall
  in which Sydney Sheldrick was busy. The study door closed on Oswald....</p>

  <p>Joan and Huntley passed by outside his window. He sat down in front of his
  fire, poked it into a magnificent blaze, lit a cigar and sat thinking. The
  beat of dancing, the melody of the gramophone and a multitude of less
  distinct sounds soaked in through the door to him.</p>

  <p>He was, he reflected, rather like a strange animal among all this youth.
  They treated him as something remotely old; he was one-and-fifty, and yet
  this gregarious stir and excitement that brightened their eyes and quickened
  their blood stirred him too. He couldn't help a feeling of envy; he had
  missed so much in his life. And in his younger days the pace had been slower.
  These young people were actually noisier, they were more reckless, they did
  more and went further than his generation had gone. In his time, with his
  sort of people, there had been the virtuous life which was, one had to admit
  it, slow, and the fast life which was noisily, criminally, consciously and
  vulgarly vicious. This generation didn't seem to be vicious, and was anything
  but slow. How far did they go? lie had been noting little things between
  Peter and this Reinhart girl. What were they up to between them? He didn't
  understand. Was she manoeuvring to marry the boy? She must be well on the way
  to thirty, twenty-six or twenty-seven perhaps, she hadn't a young girl's look
  in her eyes. Was she just amusing herself by angling for calf love? Was she
  making a fool of Peter? Their code of manners was so easy; she would touch
  his hands, and once Peter had stroked her bare forearm as it lay upon the
  table. She had looked up and smiled. Leaving her arm on the table. One could
  not conceive of Dolly permitting such things. Was this an age of daring
  innocence, or what was coming to the young people?</p>

  <p>Joan seemed more dignified than the others, but she, too, had her quality
  of prematurity. At her age Dolly had dressed in white with a pink sash. At
  least, Dolly must have been about Joan's age when first he had seen her.
  Eighteen&mdash;seventeen? Of course a year or so makes no end of difference
  just at this age....</p>

  <p>From such meditations Oswald was roused by the tumult of a car outside. He
  took a wary glimpse from his window at this conveyance, and discovered that
  it was coloured an unusual bright chocolate colour, and had its
  chauffeur&mdash;a depressed-looking individual&mdash;in a livery to match. He
  went out into the hall to discover the large presence, the square face, the
  "whisker," and the china-blue eyes of Lady Charlotte Sydenham. He knew she
  was in England, but he had had no idea she was near enough to descend upon
  them. She stood in the doorway surveying the Christmas disorder of the hall.
  Some one had adorned Oswald's stuffed heads with paper caps, the white
  rhinoceros was particularly motherly with pink bonnet-strings under its
  throat, a box of cigarettes had been upset on the table amidst various hats,
  and half its contents were on the floor, which was also littered with scraps
  of torn paper from the crackers; from the open door of the library came the
  raucous orchestration of the gramophone, and the patter and swish of
  dancers.</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd be away," said Aunt Charlotte, a little checked by the
  sight of Oswald. "I'm staying at Minchings on my way to sit on the platform
  at Cambridge. We 're raising money to get those brave Ulstermen guns.
  Something has to be done if these Liberals are not to do as they like with
  us. They and their friends the priests. But I knew there'd be a party here.
  And those aunts. So I came.... Who are all these young people you have
  about?"</p>

  <p>"Miscellaneous friends," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"You've got a touch of grey in your hair," she noted.</p>

  <p>"I must get a big blond wig," he said.</p>

  <p>"You might do worse."</p>

  <p>"You're looking as fresh as paint," he remarked, scrutinizing her
  steadfastly bright complexion. "Is that the faithful Unwin sitting and
  sniffing in the car? It's a rennet face."</p>

  <p>"She can sit," said Lady Charlotte. "I shan't stay ten minutes, and she's
  got a hot-water bottle and three rugs. But being so near I had to come and
  see what was being done with those wards of mine."</p>

  <p>"Former wards," Oswald interjected.</p>

  <p>"The Gal I passed. Where is Master Stubland? I'11 just look at him. Is he
  one of these people making a noise in here?"</p>

  <p>She went to the door of the library and surveyed the scene with an
  aggressive lorgnette. The furniture had been thrust aside with haste and
  indignity, the rugs rolled up from the parquet floor, and Babs Sheldrick was
  presiding over the gramophone and helping and interrupting Sydney in the
  instruction of Wilmington, of Peter and Hetty and of Adela and Sopwith Greene
  in some special development of the tango. All the young people still wore
  their paper caps and were heated and dishevelled. In the window-seat the
  convalescent suffragette was showing wrist tricks to one of the young men
  from Cambridge. "Party!" said Lady Charlotte. "Higgledy-piggledy I call it.
  Which is Peter?"</p>

  <p>Peter was indicated.</p>

  <p>"Well, he's grown! Who's that fast-looking girl he's hugging?"</p>

  <p>Peter detached himself from Hetty and came forward.</p>

  <p>His ancient terror of the whisker-woman still hung about him, but he made
  a brave show of courage. "Glad you've not forgotten us, Lady Charlotte," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Not much Stubland about him," she remarked to Oswald. "There's a
  photograph of you before you blew your face off&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It's his mother he's like," said Oswald, laying a hand on Peter's
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I never saw a family harp on themselves more than the Sydenhams," the
  lady declared. "It's like the Habsburg chin.... This one of the new improper
  dances, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"<i>Honi soit</i>," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"People have been whipped at the cart's tail for less. In my mother's time
  no decent woman waltzed. Even&mdash;in crinolines. Now a waltz isn't close
  enough for them."</p>

  <p>The gramophone came to an end and choked. "Thank goodness!" said Lady
  Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"Won't you dance yourself, Lady Charlotte?" said Peter, standing up to her
  politely.</p>

  <p>The hard blue eye regarded him with a slightly impaired disfavour, but the
  old lady made no reply.</p>

  <p>They heard the startled voice of the youth from Cambridge. "It's
  her!"...</p>

  <p>But the sting of the call was at its end.</p>

  <p>"So that's Peter," said Lady Charlotte, as the chauffeur and Oswald
  assisted her back into her liver-coloured car. "I told you I saw the
  Gal?"</p>

  <p>"Joan?"</p>

  <p>"I passed her on the road half a mile from here. Came upon her and her l
  gentleman friend'&mdash;I suppose she'd call him&mdash;as we turned a corner.
  A snap-shot so to speak. It's the walking-out instinct. Blood will tell. I
  saw her, but she didn't see me. Lost, she was, to things mundane. But it was
  plain enough how things were. A tiff. Some lovers' quarrel. Wake up,
  Unwin."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"What I say," said Lady Charlotte.</p>

  <p>"That fellow Huntley!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Ha</i>! So now you'll lock the stable door! What else was to be
  expected?"</p>

  <p>"But this is nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"I may be mistaken. I hope I am mistaken. I just give you my impression.
  I'm not a fool, Oswald, though it's always been your pleasure to treat me as
  one. Time shows."</p>

  <p>There was a pause while rugs with loud monograms were adjusted about
  her.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm glad I came over. I wanted to see the Great Experiment. I said
  at the time it can't end well. Bad in the beginnings. No woman to help
  him&mdash;except for those two Weird Sisters. No religion. You see? The boy's
  a young Impudence. The girl's in some mess already. What did I tell you!"</p>

  <p>Oswald was late with his recovery.</p>

  <p>"Look here, auntie! you keep your libellous mind off my wards."</p>

  <p>"Home, Parbury!" said Lady Charlotte to the chocolate-uniformed
  chauffeur.</p>

  <p>She fired a parting shot.</p>

  <p>"I warned you long ago, you'd get the Gal into a thoroughly false
  position...."</p>

  <p>She was getting away after her raid with complete impunity. Never before
  had she scored like this. Was Oswald growing* old? She made her farewell of
  him with a stately gesture of head and hand. She departed disconcertingly
  serene. A flood of belated repartee rushed into Oswald's mind. But except for
  a violent smell of petrol and a cloud of smoke and a kind of big scar of
  chocolate on the retina nothing remained now of Lady Charlotte.</p>

  <p>In the hall he paused before a mirror and examined that touch of
  grey.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 20</h3>

  <p class="first">But it had not been a lovers' quarrel that had blinded Joan
  to the passing automobile. It had been the astounding discovery of her real
  relationship to Peter. So astounding had that been that at the moment she was
  not only regardless of the passing traffic but oblivious of Huntley and every
  other circumstance of her world.</p>

  <p>Huntley was not one of those people who love; he was a pursuing egotist
  with an unwarrantable scorn for the intelligence of his fellow-creatures. He
  liked to argue and show people that they were wrong in a calm, scornful
  manner; The <i>Pernambuco Bun-shop</i> was a very sarcastic work. He was
  violently attracted by the feminine of all ages; it fixed his attention with
  the vast possibilities of admiration and triumph it offered him. And he had
  greedy desires. Joan attracted him at first because she was admired. He saw
  how Wilmington coveted her. She had a prestige in her circle. She had, too, a
  magnetism of her own. Before he realized the slope down which he slid, he
  wanted her so badly that he thought he was passionately in love. It kept him
  awake of nights, and distracted him from his work. He did not want to marry
  her. That was against his principles. That was the despicable way of ordinary
  human beings. He lived on a higher plane. But he wanted her as a monkey wants
  a gold watch&mdash;he wanted this new, fresh, lovely and beautiful thing just
  to handle and feel as his own.</p>

  <p>There was little charm about Huntley and less companionship. He was too
  arrogant for companionship. But he abounded in ideas, he knew much, and so he
  interested her. He talked. He pursued her with the steadfast scrutiny of his
  large grey eyes&mdash;and with arguments. He tried to argue and manoeuvre
  Joan into a passionate love for him.</p>

  <p>Well, Joan had a broad brow; she thought things over; she was amenable to
  ideas.</p>

  <p>He harped on "freedom." He carried freedom far beyond the tempered
  liberties of ordinary human association. Any ordinary belief was by his
  standards a limitation of freedom. There was a story that he had once been
  caught burgling a house in St. John's Wood and had been let off by the
  magistrate only because the crime seemed absolutely motiveless. No doubt he
  had been trying to convince himself of his freedom from prejudice about the
  rights of property. He had an obscure idea that he could induce Joan to
  plunge into wild depravities merely to prove himself free from her own decent
  instincts. But he was ceasing to care for his argument if only he could
  induce her.</p>

  <p>There was a moment when he said, "Joan, you are the one woman"&mdash;he
  always called her a woman&mdash;"who could make me marry her."</p>

  <p>"I'll spare you," said Joan succinctly.</p>

  <p>"Promise me that."</p>

  <p>"Promise."</p>

  <p>"Anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Anyhow."</p>

  <p>On this Christmas afternoon he discoursed again upon freedom. "You, Joan,
  might be the freest of the free, if only you chose. You are absolutely your
  own mistress. Absolutely.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I have a guardian," she said.</p>

  <p>"You 're of age."</p>

  <p>"No; I'm nineteen."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;it happens, were of age at eighteen, 'Joan." He watched her
  face. He had been burning to get to this point for weeks. "Even about your
  birth there was freedom."</p>

  <p>"So <i>you</i> know that."</p>

  <p>"Icy voice! To me it seems the grandest thing. When I reflect that I,
  alas! was born in loveless holy wedlock I grit my teeth."</p>

  <p>"Oh! I don't care. But how do you know?"</p>

  <p>"It's fairly well known, Joan. It's no very elaborate secret. I've got a
  little volume of your father's poetry."</p>

  <p>She hesitated. "I didn't know my father wrote poetry," she said.</p>

  <p>"It was all Will Sydenham ever did that was worth doing&mdash;except
  launch you into the world. He was a dramatic critic and something of a
  journalist, I believe. Stoner of the Post knew him quite well. But all this
  is ancient history to you."</p>

  <p>"It isn't. Nobody has told me.... I didn't know."</p>

  <p>"But what did you think?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind what I thought. Every one doesn't talk with your freedom. I've
  never been told. Who was my mother?"</p>

  <p>"Stoner says she died in hospital. Soon after you were born. He never knew
  her name."</p>

  <p>"Wasn't it Stubland?"</p>

  <p>"Lord, No! Why should it be?"</p>

  <p>"But then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That's one of the things that makes you so splendidly new, Joan. You
  start clean in the world&mdash;like a new Eve. Without even an Adam to your
  name. Fatherless, motherless, sisterless, brotherless. You fall into the
  world like a meteor!"</p>

  <p>She stood astonished at the way in which she had blundered. Brotherless!
  If Huntley had not drawn her back by the arm Lady Charlotte's car would have
  touched her....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 21</h3>

  <p class="first">That night some one tapped at the bedroom door of Aunt
  Phyllis. "Come in," she cried, slipping into her dressing-gown, and Joan
  entered. She was still wearing the dress of spangled black in which she had
  danced with Huntley and Wilmington and Peter. She went to her aunt's fire in
  silence and stood over it, thinking.</p>

  <p>"You're having a merry Christmas, little Joan?" said Aunt Phyllis, coming
  and standing beside her.</p>

  <p>"Ever so merry, Auntie. We go it&mdash;don't we?"</p>

  <p>Aunt Phyllis looked quickly at the flushed young face beside her, opened
  her mouth to speak and said nothing. There was a silence, it seemed a long
  silence, between them. Then Joan asked in a voice that she tried to make
  off-hand, "Auntie. Who was my father?"</p>

  <p>Aunt Phyllis was deliberately matter-of-fact. "He was the brother of
  Dolly&mdash;Peter's mother."</p>

  <p>"Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"He was killed by an omnibus near the Elephant and Castle when you were
  two years old."</p>

  <p>"And my mother?"</p>

  <p>"Died three weeks after you were born."</p>

  <p>Joan was wise in sociological literature. "The usual fever, I suppose,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Aunt Phyllis.</p>

  <p>"Do you know much about her?"</p>

  <p>"Very little. Her name was Debenham. Fanny Debenham."</p>

  <p>"Was she pretty?"</p>

  <p>"I never saw her. It was Dolly&mdash;Peter's mother&mdash;who went to
  her...."</p>

  <p>"So that's what I am," said Joan, after a long pause.</p>

  <p>"Only we love you. What does it matter? Dear Joan of my heart," and Aunt
  Phyllis slipped her arm about the girl's shoulder.</p>

  <p>But Joan stood stiff and intent, not answering her caress.</p>

  <p>"I knew&mdash;in a way," she said.</p>

  <p>The thought that consumed her insisted upon utterance. "So I'm not Peter's
  half-sister," she said.</p>

  <p>"But have you thought?..."</p>

  <p>Joan remained purely intellectual. "I've thought dozens of things. And I
  thought at last it was that.... Why was I called Stubland? I'm not a
  Stubland."</p>

  <p>"It was more convenient. It grew up."</p>

  <p>"It put me out. It has sent me astray...."</p>

  <p>She remained for a time taking in this new aspect of things so intently as
  to be regardless of the watcher beside her. Then she roused herself to mask
  her extravagant preoccupation. "You're no relation then of mine?" she
  said.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"You've been so kind to me. A mother...."</p>

  <p>Aunt Phyllis was weeping facile tears. "Have I been kind, dear? Have I
  seemed kind? I've always wanted to be kind. And I've loved you, Joan, my
  dear. And love you."</p>

  <p>"And Nobby?"</p>

  <p>"Nobby too."</p>

  <p>"You've been bricks to me, both of you. No end. Aunt</p>

  <p>Phoebe too. And Peter? Does Peter know? Does he know what I am?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I don't know what he knows, Joan."</p>

  <p>"If it hadn't been for the same surname. Joan Debenham.... I've had
  fancies. I've thought Nobby, perhaps, was my father.... Queer!... Why did you
  people bother yourselves about me?"</p>

  <p>"My dear, it was the most natural thing in the world."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it was&mdash;for you. You've been so decent&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Every woman wants a daughter," said Aunt Phyllis in a whisper, and then
  almost inaudibly; "you are mine."</p>

  <p>"And the tempers I've shown. The trouble I've been. All these years. I
  wonder what Peter knows? He must suspect. He must have ideas.... 'Joan
  Debenham&mdash;from outside."</p>

  <p>She stood quite still with the red firelight leaping up to light her face,
  and caressing the graceful lines of her slender form. She stood for a time as
  still as stone. Had she, after all, a stony heart? Aunt Phyllis stood
  watching her with a pale, tear-wet, apprehensive face. Then abruptly the girl
  turned and held out her arms.</p>

  <p>"Can I ever thank you?" she cried, with eyes that now glittered with big
  tears....</p>

  <p>Presently Aunt Phyllis was sitting in her chair stroking Joan's dark hair,
  and Joan was kneeling, staring intently at some strange vision in the fire.
  "Do you mind my staying for a time?" she asked. "I want to get used to it.
  It's just as though there wasn't anything&mdash;but just here. I've lost my
  aunt&mdash;and found a mother."</p>

  <p>"My Joan," whispered Aunt Phyllis. "My own dear Joan."</p>

  <p>"Always I have thought Peter was my brother&mdash;always. My half brother.
  Until today."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 22</h3>

  <p class="first">It was Adela who inflicted Joan's second shock upon her, and
  drove away the last swirling whispers of adolescent imaginations and moon
  mist from the hard forms of reality. This visit she had seemed greatly
  improved to Joan; she was graver. Visibly she thought, and no longer was her
  rolling eye an invitation to masculine enterprise. She came to Joan's room on
  Boxing Day morning to make up dresses with her for the night's dance, and she
  let her mind run as she stitched. Every one was to come in fancy dress; the
  vicarage girls would come and the Braughing people. Every one was to
  represent a political idea. Adela was going to be Tariff Reform. All her
  clothes were to be tattered and unfinished, she said, even her shoes were to
  have holes. She would wear a broken earring in one ear. "I don't quite see
  your point," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"Tariff Reform means work for all, dear," Adela explained gently.</p>

  <p>Days before Joan had planned to represent Indian Nationalism. It was a
  subject much in dispute between her and Peter, whose attitude to India and
  Indians seemed to her unreasonably reactionary&mdash;in view of all his other
  opinions. She could never let her controversies with Peter rest; the costume
  had been aimed at him. She was going to make up her complexion with a little
  brown, wear a sari, sandals on bare feet, and a band of tinsel across her
  forehead. She had found some red Indian curtain stuff that seemed to be
  adaptable for the sari. She worked now in a preoccupied manner, with her mind
  full of strange thoughts. Sometimes she listened to what Adela was saying,
  and sometimes she was altogether within herself. But every now and then Adela
  would pull her back to attention by a question.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think so, Joan?"</p>

  <p>"Think what!" asked Joan.</p>

  <p>"Love's much more our business than it is theirs."</p>

  <p>That struck Joan. "Is it?" she asked. She had thought the shares in the
  business were equal and opposite.</p>

  <p>"All this waiting for a man to discover himself in love with you; it's
  rot. You may wait till Doomsday."</p>

  <p>"Still, they do seem to fall in love."</p>

  <p>"With any one. A man's in love with women in general, but women fall in
  love with men in particular. We're the choosers. Naturally. We want a man,
  that man and no other, and all our own. They don't feel like that. And we
  have to hang about pretending they choose and trying to make them choose
  without seeming to try to make them. Well, we're altering all that. When I
  want a man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Adela's pause suggested a particular reference.</p>

  <p>"I'll get him somehow," she said intently.</p>

  <p>"If you mean to get him&mdash;if you don't mind much the little things
  that happen meanwhile&mdash;you'll get him," said Adela, as though she
  repeated a creed. "But, of course, you can't make terms. When a man knows
  that a woman is his, when he's sure of it&mdash;absolutely, then she's got
  him for good. Sooner or later he must come to her. I haven't had my eyes open
  just for show, Joan, this last year or so."</p>

  <p>"Good luck, Adela," said Joan.</p>

  <p>Adela attempted no pretences. "It stands to reason if you</p>

  <p>love a man " Her eyes filled with tears. "Love his</p>

  <p>very self. You can make him happy.and safe. Be his line of least
  resistance. But the meanwhile is hard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Adela stitched furiously.</p>

  <p>"That's why you came down here?" Joan asked.</p>

  <p>"You haven't seen?" Adela's preoccupation with Sop-with Greene had been
  the most conspicuous fact in the party. "Once or twice a gleam," said
  Joan.</p>

  <p>"Ask him to play tonight, dear," said Adela. "Some of his own things."</p>

  <p>But now the last checks upon Adela's talk were removed. She wanted to talk
  endlessly and unrestrainedly about love. She wanted to hear herself saying
  all the generosities and devotions she contemplated. "There's no bargain in
  love," said Adela. "You just watch and give." Running through all her talk
  was a thread of speculation; she was obsessed by the idea of the relative
  blindness and casualness of love in men. "We used to dream of lovers who just
  concentrated upon us," she said. "But there's something nimmy-pimmy in a man
  concentrating on a woman. He ought to have a Job, something Big, his Art, his
  Aim&mdash;Something. One wouldn't really respect a man who didn't do
  something Big. Love's a nuisance to a real man, a disturbance, until some
  woman takes care of him."</p>

  <p>"Couldn't two people&mdash;take care of each other?" asked Joan.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's Ideal, Joan," said Adela as one who puts a notion aside. "A
  man takes his love where he finds it. On his way to other things. The easier
  it is to get the better he likes it. That's why, so often, they take up with
  any&mdash; sort of creature. And why one needn't be so tremendously
  jealous...."</p>

  <p>Adela reflected. "I don't care a bit about him and Hetty."</p>

  <p>"Hetty Reinhart?"</p>

  <p>"Everybody talked about them. Didn't you hear? But of course you were
  still at school. Of course there's that studio of hers. You know about her?
  Yes. She has a studio. Most convenient. She does as she pleases. It amused
  him, I suppose. Men don't care as we do. They're just amused. Men can fall in
  love for an afternoon&mdash;and out of it again. He makes love to her and
  he's not even jealous of her. Not a bit. He doesn't seem to mind a rap about
  Peter."</p>

  <p>She babbled on, but Joan's mind stopped short.</p>

  <p>"Adela," she said, "what is this about Hetty and Peter?"</p>

  <p>"The usual thing, I suppose, dear. You don't seem to hear of anything at
  Cambridge."</p>

  <p>"But you don't mean!"</p>

  <p>"Well, I know something of Hetty. And I've got eyes."</p>

  <p>"You mean to say she's&mdash;she's got Peter?"</p>

  <p>"It shows plainly enough."</p>

  <p>"<i>My</i> Peter!" cried Joan sharply.</p>

  <p>"You're not an Egyptian princess," said Adela.</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;he's gone&mdash;Peter's gone&mdash;to her studio!
  That&mdash;things like that have happened?"</p>

  <p>Adela stared at her friend. "These things have to happen, Joan."</p>

  <p>"But he's only a boy yet."</p>

  <p>"She doesn't think he's a boy. Why! he's almost of age! Lot of boy about
  Peter!"</p>

  <p>"But do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mean anything, Joan, if you're going to look like that. You've
  got no right to interfere in Peter's love affairs. Why should you? Don't we
  all live for experience?"</p>

  <p>"But," said Joan, "Peter is different."</p>

  <p>"No. No one is different," said Adela.</p>

  <p>"But I tell you he's my Peter."</p>

  <p>"He's your brother, of course."</p>

  <p>"<i>No</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Your half brother then. Everybody knows that, Joan&mdash;thanks to the
  Sheldricks. A sister can't always keep her brothers away from other
  girls."</p>

  <p>Joan was on the verge of telling Adela that she was not even Peter's half
  sister, but she restrained herself. She stuck to the thing that most
  concerned her now.</p>

  <p>"It's spoiling him," she said. "It will make a mess of him. Why! he may
  think that is love, that!&mdash;slinking off to a studio. The nastiness! And
  she's had a dozen lovers. She's a common thing. She just strips herself here
  and shows her arms and shoulders because she's&mdash;just that."</p>

  <p>"She's really in love with him anyhow," said Adela. "She's gone on him.
  It's amusing."</p>

  <p>"Love! That&mdash;love! It makes me sick to think of it," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"A man isn't made like that," said Adela. "Peter has to go his own
  way."</p>

  <p>"Peter," said Joan, "who used to be the cleanest thing alive."</p>

  <p>"Good sisters always feel like that," said Adela. "I know how shocked I
  was when first I heard of Teddy.... It isn't the same thing to men, Joan. It
  isn't indeed...."</p>

  <p>"Dirty Peter," said Joan with intense conviction. "Of course I've known.
  Of course I've known. Any one could see. Only I wouldn't know."</p>

  <p>She thrust the striped red stuff for her Indian dress from her.</p>

  <p>"I shan't be Indian Nationalism, Adela, after all. Somehow I don't care to
  be. Why should I cover myself up in this way?"</p>

  <p>"You'd look jolly."</p>

  <p>"No. I want something with black in it. And red. And my arms and shoulders
  showing. Why shouldn't we all dress down to Hetty? She has the approval of
  the authorities. Aunt Phoebe applauds every stitch she takes off.
  Freedom&mdash;with a cap of Liberty."</p>

  <p>"Hetty said something about being Freedom," hesitated Adela.</p>

  <p>"Then I shall come as Anarchy-," said Joan, staring at the red stuff upon
  the table before her.</p>

  <p>Came a pause.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why Peter should have all the fun in life," said
  Joan.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 23</h3>

  <p class="first">Joan as Anarchy made a success that evening at Pelham Ford.
  In the private plans of Hetty Reinhart that success had not been meant for
  Joan. Hetty as Freedom gave the party her lithe arms, her slender neck, and
  so much of her back that the two vicarage girls, who had come very correctly
  in powder and patches as Whig and Tory, were sure that it was partly
  accidental. On Hetty's dark hair perched a Phrygian cap, and she had a
  tricolour skirt beneath a white bodice that was chiefly decolletage and lace.
  About her neck was a little band of black which had nothing to do with
  Freedom; it was there for the sake of her slender neck. She was much more
  like <i>La Vie Parisienne</i>. She was already dancing with Peter when Joan,
  who had delayed coming down until the music began, appeared in the doorway.
  Nobby, wrapped in a long toga-like garment of sun-gold and black that he
  alleged qualified him to represent Darkest Africa, was standing by the door,
  and saw the effect of Joan upon one of the Braughing boys before he
  discovered her beside him.</p>

  <p>Her profile was the profile of a savage. She lifted her clear-cut chin as
  young savage women do, and her steady eyes regarded Hetty and Peter. Her
  black hair was quite unbound and thrown back from her quiet face, and there
  was no necklace, no bracelet, not a scrap of adornment nor enhancement upon
  her arms or throat. It had not hitherto occurred to Oswald that his ward had
  the most beautiful neck and shoulders in the world, or that Joan was as like
  what Dolly once had been as a wild beast is like a cherished tame one. But he
  did presently find these strange ideas in his mind.</p>

  <p>Her dress was an exiguous scheme of slashes and tatters in black and
  bright red. She was bare ankled&mdash;these modern young people thought
  nothing of that&mdash;but she had white dancing shoes upon her feet.</p>

  <p>"Joan!" said Huntley, advancing with an air of proprietorship.</p>

  <p>"No," said Joan with a gesture of rejection. "I don't want to dance with
  any one in particular. I'm going to dance alone."</p>

  <p>"Well&mdash;dance!" said Huntley with a large courtly movement of a white
  velvet cloak all powdered with gold crosses and fleur-de-lys, that he
  pretended was a symbol of Reaction.</p>

  <p>"When I choose," said Joan. " And as I choose."</p>

  <p>Across the room Peter was staring at her, and she was looking at Peter. He
  tripped against Hetty, and for a little interval the couple was out of step.
  "Come on, Peter," said Hetty, rallying him.</p>

  <p>Joan appeared to forget Peter and every one.</p>

  <p>There was dancing in her blood, and this evening she meant to dance. Her
  body felt wonderfully light and as supple as a whip under her meagre costume.
  There was something to be said for this semi-nudity after all. The others
  were dancing a two-step with such variations as they thought fit, and there
  was no objection whatever at Pelham Ford to solo enterprises. Joan could
  invent dances. She sailed out into the room to dance as she pleased.</p>

  <p>Oswald watched her nimble steps and the whirling rhythms of her slender
  body. She made all the others seem overdressed and clumsy and heavy. Her face
  had a grave preoccupied expression.</p>

  <p>Huntley stood for a moment or so beside Oswald, and then stepped out after
  her to convert her dance into a duet. He too was a skilful and inventive
  dancer, and the two coquetted for a time amidst the other couples.</p>

  <p>Then Joan discovered Wilmington watching her and Huntley from the window
  bay. She danced evasively through Huntley's circling entanglements, and
  seized Wilmington's hand and drew him into the room.</p>

  <p>"I can't dance, Joan," he said, obeying her. "You know I can't dance."</p>

  <p>"You have to dance," she said, aglow and breathing swiftly. "Trust
  me."</p>

  <p>She took and left his hands and took them again and turned him about so
  skilfully that a wonderful illusion was produced in Wilmington's mind and in
  those about him that indeed he could dance. Huntley made a crouching figure
  of jealousy about them; he spread himself and his cloak into fantastic
  rhombs&mdash;and then the music ceased....</p>

  <p>"The Argentine Tango!" cried Huntley. "Joan, you must tango."</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"Dance Columbine to my Harlequin then."</p>

  <p>"And stand on your knee? I should break it."</p>

  <p>"Try me," said Huntley.</p>

  <p>"Kneel," said Joan. "Now take my hands. Prepare for the shock." And she
  leapt lightly to his knee and posed for a second, poised with one toe on
  Huntley's thigh, and was down again.</p>

  <p>"Do it again, Joan," he cried with enthusiasm. "Do it again."</p>

  <p>"Let us invent dances," cried Aunt Phyllis. "Let us invent dances.
  Couldn't we dance charades?"</p>

  <p>"Let them dance as nature meant them to," said Aunt Phoebe's deepest
  tones. "<i>Madly</i>!"</p>

  <p>"Shall we try that Tango we did the other night?" said Hetty, coming
  behind Peter.</p>

  <p>Peter had come forward to the group in the centre of the room. Old habits
  were strong in him, and he had a vague feeling that this was one of the
  occasions when Joan ought to be suppressed. "We're getting chaotic," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"You see, Peter, I'm Anarchy," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"An ordered Freedom is the best," said Peter without reflecting on his
  words.</p>

  <p>"Nobby, I want to dance with you," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"I've never danced anything but a Country Dance&mdash;you know the sort of
  thing in which people stand in rows&mdash;in my life,"said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"A country dance," cried Joan. "Sir Roger de Coverley."</p>

  <p>"We want to try a fox-trot we know," complained one of the Branching
  guests.</p>

  <p>Two parties became more and more distinctly evident in the party. There
  was a party which centred around Hetty and the Sheldrick girls, which was all
  for the rather elaborately planned freak dances they had more or less learnt
  in London, the Bunny-Hugs, the Fox-Trot, and various Tangoes. Most of the
  Londoners were of this opinion, Sopwith Greene trailed Adela with him, and
  Huntley was full of a passionate desire to guide Joan's feet along the Tango
  path. But Joan's mind by a kind of necessity moved contrariwise to Hetty's.
  Either, she argued, they must dance in the old staid ways&mdash;Oswald and
  the Vicarage girls applauding&mdash;or dance as the spirit moved them.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dance your old Fox-Trots," she cried, with a gesture that seemed to
  motion Huntley and Hetty together. "Have your music all rattle and rag-time
  like sick people groaning in trains. That's neither here nor there. I want to
  dance to better stuff than that. Come along, Willy."</p>

  <p>She seized on Wilmington's arm.</p>

  <p>"But where are you going?" cried Huntley.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to dance Chopin in the hall&mdash;to the pianola."</p>

  <p>"You're going to play," she told Wilmington.</p>

  <p>"But you can't," said Peter.</p>

  <p>Joan disappeared with her slave. A light seemed to go out from the big
  library as she went. "Now we can get on," said Hetty, laying hands on her
  Peter.</p>

  <p>For a time the Fox-Trot ruled. The Vicarage girls didn't do these things,
  and drifted after Joan. So did Oswald. Towards the end the dancers had a
  sense of a cross-current of sound in the air, of some adverse influence
  thrown across their gymnastics. When their own music stopped, they became
  aware of that crying voice above the thunder, the Revolutionary Etude.</p>

  <p>There was a brief listening pause. "Now, how the deuce," said Huntley,
  "can she be dancing <i>that</i>?"</p>

  <p>He led the way to the hall....</p>

  <p>"I'm tired of dancing," whispered Hetty. "Stay back. They're all going. I
  want you to kiss the little corner of my mouf."</p>

  <p>Peter looked round quickly, and seized his privilege with unseemly haste.
  "Let's see how Joan is dancing that old row," he said....</p>

  <p>Animation, boldness, and strict relegation of costume to its function of
  ornament had hitherto made Hetty the high light of this little gathering. She
  was now to realize how insecure is this feminine predominance in the face of
  fresher youth and greater boldness. And Joan was full of a pretty girl's
  discovery that she may do all that she dares to do. For a time&mdash;and
  until it is time to pay.</p>

  <p>Life had intoxicated Joan that night. A derision of seemliness possessed
  her. She was full of impulse and power. She felt able to dominate every one.
  At one time or other she swept nearly every man there except Oswald and Peter
  and Pryce into her dancing. Two of the Braughing youths fell visibly in love
  with her, and Huntley lost his head, badgered her too much to dance, and then
  was offended and sulked in a manner manifest to the meanest capacity. And she
  kissed "Wilmington.</p>

  <p>That was her wildest impulse. She came into the study where he was playing
  the pianola for her dancing. She wanted him to change the roll for the first
  part of the Kreutzer Sonata, and found herself alone with him. She loved him
  because he was so completely and modestly hers. She bent over him to take off
  the roll from the instrument, and found her face near his forehead. "Dear old
  Willy," she whispered, and put her hand on his shoulder and brushed his
  eyebrows with her lips.</p>

  <p>Then she was remorseful.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't mean anything, Willy," she said.</p>

  <p>"I know it doesn't," he said in a voice of the deepest melancholy.</p>

  <p>"Only you are a dear all the same," she said. "You are clean. You're
  right."</p>

  <p>"If it wasn't for my damned Virtues " said Wilmington. "But anyhow. Thank
  you, Joan&mdash;very much. Shall I play you this right through?"</p>

  <p>"A little slowly," she said. "It's marked too fast," and went towards the
  open door.</p>

  <p>Then she flitted back to him.... Her intent face came close to his. "I
  don't love any one, Willy," she said. "I'm not the sort. I just dance."</p>

  <p>They looked at each other.</p>

  <p>"I love <i>you</i>," said Wilmington, and watched her go.</p>

  <p>But she had made him ridiculously happy....</p>

  <p>She danced through the whole Kreutzer Sonata. The Kreutzer Sonata has
  always been a little dirty since Tolstoy touched it. Tolstoy pronounced it
  erotic. There are men who can find a lascivious import in a Corinthian
  capital. The Kreutzer Sonata therefore had a strong appeal to Huntley's mind.
  These associations made it seem to him different from other music, just as
  calling this or that substance a "drug" always dignified it in his eyes with
  the rich suggestions of vice. He read strange significances into Joan's
  choice of that little music as he watched her over the heads of the Braughing
  girls. But Joan just danced.</p>

  <p>At supper she found herself drifting to a seat near Peter. She left him to
  his Hetty, and went up the table to a place under Oswald's black wing. The
  supper at Pelham Ford was none of your stand-up affairs. Mrs. Moxton's ideas
  of a dance supper were worthy of Britannia. Oswald carved a big turkey and
  Peter had cold game pie, and Aunt Phyllis showed a delicate generosity with a
  sharp carver and a big ham. There were hot potatoes and various salads, and
  jugs of lemonade and claret cup for every one, and whisky for the mature.
  Joan became a sober enquirer about African dancing.</p>

  <p>"It's the West Coast that dances," said Oswald. "There's richer music on
  the West Coast than all round the Mediterranean,"</p>

  <p>"All this American music comes from the negro," he declared. "There's
  hardly a bit of American music that hasn't colour in its blood."</p>

  <p>After supper Joan was the queen of the party. Adela was in love with her
  again, as slavish as in their schooldays, and the Sheldricks and the
  Braughing boys and girls did her bidding. "Let's do something processional,"
  said Joan. "Let us dress up and do the Funeral March of a Marionette."</p>

  <p>Hetty didn't catch on to that idea, and Peter was somehow overlooked. Most
  of the others scampered off to get something black and cast aside anything
  too coloured. Aunt Phyllis knew of some black gauze and produced it. There
  were black curtains in the common room, and these were seized upon by Huntley
  and Wilmington. They made a coffin of the big black lacquered post-box in the
  hall, and a bier of four alpenstocks and a drying-board from the
  scullery.</p>

  <p>Joan was chief mourner, and after the Funeral March was over danced the
  sorrows of life before the bier to the first part of the Fifth Symphony.</p>

  <p>Hetty and Peter sat close together and yet unusually apart upon the broad
  window-seat. Hetty looked tired and Peter seemed inattentive. Perhaps they
  had a little overdone each other's charm that Christmas.</p>

  <p>And only once more that evening did it happen that Peter and Joan met face
  to face. Nearly everybody poured out into the garden to see the guests go
  off. The Braughing people crowded hilariously into a car; the others walked.
  The weather had suddenly hardened, a clear dry cold made the paths and road
  very like metal, and not the littlest star was missing from the quivering
  assembly in the sky.</p>

  <p>"We'll have skating yet," cried the Braughing party.</p>

  <p>Adela and Joan and Wilmington and Pryce came with Huntley and Greene and
  the vicarage girls along the road and over the ice-bound water-splash as far
  as the vicarage gate. "Too cooold to say good-bye," cried Joan. "Oh, my poor
  bare legs!" and led a race back.</p>

  <p>Adela was left far behind, but neither Wilmington nor Pryce would let Joan
  win without a struggle. The three shot in through the wide front door almost
  abreast, and Joan ran straight at Peter and stopped short within two feet of
  him.</p>

  <p>"I've won! "said Joan.</p>

  <p>Just for an instant the two looked at one another, and it seemed to Joan
  afterwards that she had seen something then in Peter's eyes, something
  involuntary that she had caught just once before in them&mdash;when she had
  come upon him by chance in Petty Cury when first she had gone up to
  Cambridge.</p>

  <p>A silly thing to think about! What did it matter? What did anything matter
  t Life was a dance, and Joan, thank heaven! could dance. Peter was just
  nothing at all. Nothing at all. Nothing at all.</p>

  <p>"I wonder, Joan, how many miles you have pranced tonight!" said Aunt
  Phyllis, kissing her good night.</p>

  <p>"Joan," said Adela, "you are The Loveliest."...</p>

  <p>For a minute or so Joan stood in front of her looking-glass, studying a
  flushed, candle-lit figure....</p>

  <p>"Pah!" she said at last. "<i>Hetty</i>!" and flung her scanty clothes
  aside.</p>

  <p>She caught the reflection of herself in the mirror again. She spread out
  her hands in a gesture to the pretty shape she saw there, and stood.</p>

  <p>"What's the Good of it!" she said at last.</p>

  <p>As soon as Joan's head touched the pillow that night she fell asleep, and
  she slept as soundly as a child that had been thoroughly naughty and all at
  sixes and sevens, and that has been well slapped and had a good cry to wind
  up with, and put to bed. In all the world there is no sounder sleep than
  that.</p>

     name="chap12">CHAPTER XII. &mdash; THE WORLD ON THE EVE OF WAR</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">OSWALD sat in the March sunshine that filled and warmed his
  little summerhouse, and thought about Joan and Peter....</p>

  <p>His sudden realization of Joan's mental maturity, the clear warning it
  brought to him that the task and opportunity of education was passing out of
  his hands, that already the reckoning of consequences was beginning for both
  his wards, set his mind searching up and down amidst the memories of his
  effort, to find where he could have slipped, where blundered and failed. He
  perceived now how vague had been the gesture with which he had started, when
  he proclaimed his intention to give them "the best education in the
  world."</p>

  <p>The best education in the world is still to seek, and while he had been
  getting such scraps of second best for them as he could, the world itself,
  nature, tradition, custom, suggestion, example and accident, had moulded them
  and made them. When he measured what had been done upon these youngsters by
  these outward things and compared it with their deliberate education, the
  schoolmaster seemed to him to be still no more than a half-hearted dwarf who
  would snare the white horses of a cataract with a noose of packthread.</p>

  <p>"The generations running to waste&mdash;like rapids."</p>

  <p>But there are stronger harnessings than packthreads, and there are already
  engineers in the world who, by taking thought and patient work, can tame the
  maddest torrent that ever overawed the mind of man. In the end perhaps all
  torrents will be tamed, and knowledge and purpose put an end to aimless
  adventure. The schoolmaster will not always be a dwarf....</p>

  <p>As our children grow beyond our control we begin to learn something of the
  reality of education. The world had Joan and Peter now; at the most Oswald
  could run and shout advice from the bank as they went down the rush. But he
  knew that he could have done more for them, and that with a different world
  he could have done infinitely more for them in their receptive years. They
  were the children of an age; their restless fever of impulse was but their
  individual share in a great fever. The whole world now was restless, out of
  touch with any standards, and manifestly drifting towards great changes.</p>

  <p>Neither Joan nor Peter seemed to have any Definite purpose in life. Their
  impulses were not focused. They were drawn hither and thither. That was the
  essential failure of their adolescence. Their education had done many good
  things for them, but it had left their wills as spontaneous, indefinite and
  unsocial as the will of a criminal. Physically Oswald and the world had done
  well by them; they were clean-blooded, well grown, well exercised animals;
  they belonged to a generation of youth measurably taller, finer, and more
  beautiful than any generation before them. They were swift-footed and nimble.
  Mentally, too, they were swift and clear. It was not that their ideas were
  confused but their wills. Each of them could speak and read and write three
  languages quite well, they could draw well and Peter could draw brilliantly,
  they were alive to art and music, they read widely, they had the
  dispassionate, wide, scientific vision of the world. But being so fine and
  clean it was all the more distressing to realize that these two young people
  now faced the world with no clear will in them about it or themselves, that
  Joan seemed consumed with discontents and this dark personal quarrel with
  Peter, and that Peter could be caught and held by a mere sensual adventure.
  Hetty Reinhart kept him busy with notes and situations; having created a
  necessity she went on to create a jealous rivalry. He would be sometimes
  excited and elated, sometimes manifestly angry and sulky; and his work at
  Cambridge, which for two years had been conspicuously brilliant, was falling
  away.</p>

  <p>Until Joan's angry outspokenness had forced these facts upon his
  attention, Oswald had shirked their realization. He had seen with his one
  watchful eye, but he had not willed to see. A score of facts had lain, like
  disagreeable letters that one hesitates to answer, uncorrelated in his mind.
  The disorders of the Christmas party had indeed left him profoundly uneasy.
  With the new year he went with Peter on a trip to Russia. He wanted the
  youngster to develop a vision of the European problem, for Peter seemed blind
  to the importance of international things. They had crossed to Flushing,
  travelled straight through to Berlin, gone about Berlin for a few days, run
  on to St. Petersburg&mdash;it was not yet Petrograd&mdash;visited a friendly
  house near the Valdai Hills, spent a busy week in and about Moscow, and
  returned by way of Warsaw. They saw Germany already trained like an athlete
  for the adventure of the coming war, and Russia great and disorderly,
  destined to be taken unawares. Then they returned to England to look again at
  their own country with eyes refreshed by these contrasts. And all the time
  Oswald watched Peter and speculated about the thoughts and ideas hidden in
  Peter's head.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">This Russian trip had been precipitated by a sudden
  opportunity. Originally Oswald had planned a Russian tour for his wards on a
  more considerable scale. Among the unsolved difficulties of this scheme had
  been his ignorance of Russian. He had thought of employing a
  courier&mdash;but a courier can be a tiresome encumbrance. His friend Bailey,
  who was an enthusiast for Russia and spoke Russian remarkably well for an
  Englishman, wrote from Petrograd offering to guide Oswald and Peter about
  that city, suggesting a visit to a cousin who had married a Russian landowner
  in Novgorod, and a week or so in Moscow, where some friends of Bailey's would
  keep a helpful eye on the travellers. It was too good a chance to lose. There
  was some hasty buying of fur-lined gloves, insertion of wadding under the fur
  of Oswald's fur coat, and the purchase of a suitable outfit for Peter.</p>

  <p>Bailey had his misogynic side, Oswald knew; he thought women troublesome
  millinery to handle; and he did not include Joan in the invitation. On the
  whole Oswald did not regret that omission, because it gave him so excellent a
  chance of being alone with Peter for long spells, and getting near his
  private thoughts.</p>

  <p>It was an expedition that left a multitude of vivid impressions upon the
  young man's memory; the still, cold, starry night of the departure from
  Harwich, the lit decks, the black waters, the foaming wake caught by the
  ship's lights, the neat Dutch landscape with its black and white cows growing
  visible as day broke, shivering workers under a chill, red-nosed dawn pouring
  down by a path near the railway into the factories of some industrial town;
  the long flat journey across Germany; the Sieges-Allee and the war trophies
  and public buildings of Berlin; the Sunday morning crowd upon Unter den
  Linden; the large prosperity of the new suburbs of Berlin; north Germany
  under an iron frost, a crowd of children sliding and skating near Königsberg;
  the dingier, vaster effects of Russia, streets in Petrograd with the shops
  all black and gold and painted with shining pictures of the goods on sale to
  a population of illiterates, the night crowd in the People's Palace; a sledge
  drive of ten miles along the ice of a frozen river, a wooden country house
  behind a great stone portico, and a merry house party that went scampering
  out after supper to lie on the crisp snow and see the stars between the tree
  boughs; the chanting service in a little green-cupolaed church and a pretty
  village schoolmistress in peasant costume; the great red walls of the Kremlin
  rising above the Moskva and the first glimpse of that barbaric caricature,
  the cathedral of St. Basil; the painted magnificence of the Troitzkaya
  monastery; a dirty, evil-smelling little tramp with his bundle and kettle,
  worshipping unabashed in the Uspenski cathedral; endless bearded priests,
  Tartar waiters with purple sashes, a whole population in furs and so looking
  absurdly wealthy to an English eye; a thousand such pictures, keen, bright
  and vivid against a background of white snow....</p>

  <p>The romanticism of the late Victorians still prevailed in Oswald's mind.
  The picturesqueness of Russia had a great effect upon him. From the passport
  office at Wirballen with its imposing green-uniformed guards and elaborate
  ceremonies onward into Moscow, he marked the contrast with the trim modernity
  of Germany. The wild wintry landscape of the land with its swamps and unkempt
  thickets of silver birch, the crouching timber villages with their cupolaed
  churches, the unmade roads, the unfamiliar lettering of the stations,
  contributed to his impression of barbaric greatness. After the plainly ugly,
  middle-class cathedral of Berlin he rejoiced at the dark splendours, the
  green serpentine and incense, of St. Isaac's; he compared the frozen Neva to
  a greater Thames and stood upon the Troitzki Bridge rejoicing over the masses
  of the fortress of St. Peter and St. Paul. In Petrograd he said, "away from
  here to the North Pole is Russia and the Outside, the famine-stricken north,
  the frozen fen and wilderness, the limits of mankind." Moscow made him talk
  of the mingling of east and west, western and eastern costumes jostled in the
  streets. He was surprised at the frequency of Chinamen. "Away from here to
  Vladivostok," he said, "is Russia and all Asia. North, west, east and south
  there is limitless land. We are an island people. But here one feels the land
  masses of the earth."</p>

  <p>Peter was preoccupied with a gallant attempt to master colloquial Russian
  in a fortnight by means of a <i>Russian Self-Taught</i> he had bought in
  London; he did not thrust his conversation between Bailey and Oswald, but
  sometimes when he was alone with his guardian and the mood took him he would
  talk freely and rather well. He had been reading abundantly and variously; it
  was evident that at Cambridge he belonged to a talking set. If he had no
  directive form in his mind he had at any rate something like a systematic
  philosophy.</p>

  <p>It was a profoundly sceptical philosophy. There were moments when Oswald
  was reminded of Beresford's "Hampdenshire Wonder," who read through all human
  learning and literature before the age of five, and turned upon its
  instructor with "Is this <i>all</i>?" Peter looked at the world into which he
  had come, at the Kings and Kaisers demanding devotion to "our person," at the
  gentlemen waving flags and talking of patriotism and service to empires and
  races and "nationality," at the churches and priests pursuing their
  "policies," and in effect he turned to Oswald with the same question. In the
  background of his imagination it was only too manifest that the
  nymphs&mdash;with a general family resemblance to Hetty
  Reinhart&mdash;danced, and he heard that music of the senses which the
  decadent young men of the <i>fin de siècle</i> period were wont to refer to
  as "the pipes of Pan."</p>

  <p>He and Oswald looked together at Moscow in the warm light of sunset. They
  were in the veranda of a hill-side restaurant which commanded the huge bend
  of the river between the Borodinski and the Kruimski bridges. The city lay,
  wide and massive, along the line of the sky, with little fields and a small
  church or so in the foreground. The six glittering domes of the great Church
  of the Redeemer rose in the centre against the high red wall and the
  clustering palaces and church cupolas of the Kremlin. Left and right of the
  Kremlin the city spread, a purple sea of houses and walls, flecked with snowy
  spaces and gemmed with red reflecting windows, through which the river
  twisted like a silver eel. Moscow is a city of crosses, every church has its
  bulbous painted cupola and some have five or six, and every cupola carries
  its brightly gilded two-armed cross. The rays of the setting sun was now
  turning all these crosses to pale fire.</p>

  <p>Oswald, in spite of his own sceptical opinions, was a little under the
  spell of the "Holy Russia" legend. He stood with his foot on a chair and
  rested his jaw on his hand, with the living side of his face turned as usual
  towards his ward, and tried to express the confused ideas that were stirring
  in his mind. "This isn't a city like the cities of western Europe, Peter," he
  said. "This is something different. Those western cities, they grow out of
  the soil on which they stand; they are there for ever like the woods and
  hills; there is no other place for London or Rouen or Rome except just where
  it stands; but this, Peter, is a Tartar camp, frozen. It might have been at
  Nijni-Novgorod or Yaroslav or Kazan. It might be anywhere upon the Russia
  plain; only it happens to be here. It's a camp changed to wood and brick and
  plaster. That's the headquarters camp there, the Tsar's pavilions. And all
  these crosses everywhere are like the standards outside the tents of the
  captains."</p>

  <p>"And where is it going?" said Peter, looking at Moscow over his fur
  collar, with his hands deep in his overcoat pockets.</p>

  <p>"Asia advancing on Europe&mdash;with a new idea.... One understands
  Dostoevsky better when one sees this. One begins to realize this Holy Russia,
  as a sort of epileptic genius among nations&mdash;like his Idiot, insisting
  on moral truth, holding up the cross to mankind."</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i> truth?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>"They seem to have the Christian idea. In a way we Westerns don't.
  Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and their endless schools of dissent have a character in
  common. Christianity to a Russian means Brotherhood."</p>

  <p>"If it means anything," said Peter.</p>

  <p>The youngster reflected.</p>

  <p>"I wonder, is there really this Russian idea? I don't believe very much in
  these national ideas."</p>

  <p>"Say national character then. This city with its end-less crosses is so in
  harmony with Russian music, Russian art, Russian literature."</p>

  <p>"Any city that had to be built here would have to look more or less like
  this," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"If it were built by Americans?"</p>

  <p>"If they'd lived here always," said Peter. "But we're arguing in a circle.
  If they'd lived here always the things that have made the Russians Russians,
  would have made them Russians. I've gone too far. Of course there is a
  Russian character. They're wanderers, body and brain. Men of an endless land.
  But&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Not much of a Russian idea to it.... I don't believe a bit in all these
  crosses."</p>

  <p>"You mean as symbols of an idea?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Of course the cross has meant something to people. It must have
  meant tremendous things to some people. But men imitate. One sticks up a
  cross because it means all sorts of deep things to him. Then the man down the
  road thinks he will have a cross too. And the man up the road doesn't quite
  see what it's all about but doesn't like to be out of it. So they go on,
  until sticking up crosses becomes a habit. It becomes a necessity. They'd be
  shocked to see a new church without four or five crosses on it. They organize
  a business in golden crosses. Everybody says, 'You must have a cross.' Long
  ago every one has forgotten that deep meaning...."</p>

  <p>"H'm," said Oswald, "you think that?"</p>

  <p>"It's just a crowd," said Peter, thinking aloud. "Underneath the crosses
  it's just a swarming and breeding of men.... Like any other men."</p>

  <p>"But don't you think that all that million odd down there is held together
  by a distinctive idea? Don't you feel sometimes the Russian idea about
  you&mdash;like the smell of burnt wood on the breeze?"</p>

  <p>"Well, call it a breeze," said Peter. "It's like a breeze blowing over
  mud. It blows now and then. It's forgotten before it is past. What does it
  signify?"</p>

  <p>He was thinking as he talked. Oswald did not want to interrupt him, and
  just smiled slightly and looked at Peter for more.</p>

  <p>"I don't think there's any great essential differences between cities,"
  said Peter. "It's easy to exaggerate that. Mostly the differences are
  differences of scenery. Beneath the differences it's the same story
  everywhere; men shoving about and eating and squabbling and multiplying. We
  might just as well be looking at London from Hampstead Bridge so far as the
  human facts go. Here things are done in red and black and gold against a
  background of white snow; there they are done in drab and grey and green.
  This is a land of dull tragedy instead of dull comedy, gold crosses on green
  onions instead of church spires, extremes instead of means, but it's all the
  same old human thing. Even the King and Tsar look alike, there's a state
  church here, dissenters, landowners...."</p>

  <p>"I suppose there is a sort of parallelism," Oswald conceded....</p>

  <p>"We're not big enough yet for big ideas, the Russian idea, or the
  Christian idea or any such idea," said Peter. "Why pretend we have them?"</p>

  <p>"Now that's just it," said Oswald, coming round upon him with an extended
  finger. "Because we want them so badly."</p>

  <p>"Does every one?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Consciously or not. That's where you and I are at issue, Peter."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't see the ideas at work!" cried Peter. "Except as a sort of
  flourish of the mind. But look at the everyday life. Wherever we have
  been&mdash;in London, Paris, Italy, Berlin, here, we see every man who can
  afford it making for the restaurants and going where there are women to be
  got. Hunger, indulgence, and sex, sex, sex, sex." His voice was suddenly
  bitter. He turned his face to Oswald for a moment. "We're too little. These
  blind impulses&mdash;I suppose there's a sort of impulse to Beauty in it.
  Some day perhaps these forces will do something&mdash;drive man up the scale
  of being. But as far as we've got!"</p>

  <p>He stared at Moscow again.</p>

  <p>He seemed to have done.</p>

  <p>"You think we're oversexed?" said Oswald after a pause.</p>

  <p>The youngster glanced at his guardian.</p>

  <p>"I'm not blind," he fenced.</p>

  <p>Then he laughed with a refreshing cheerfulness. "It's youthful pessimism,
  Nobby. My mind runs like this because it's the fashion. We get so dosed with
  Schopenhauer and Nietzsche&mdash;usually at second hand. We all try to talk
  like this. Don't mind me."</p>

  <p>Oswald smiled back.</p>

  <p>"Peter, you drive my spirit back to the Victorians," he said. "I want to
  begin quoting Longfellow to you. 'Life is real, life is earnest&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No!" Peter countered. "But it ought to be."</p>

  <p>"Well, it becomes so. We have Science, and out of Science comes a light.
  We shall see the Will plainer and plainer."</p>

  <p>"The Will?" said Peter, turning it over in his mind.</p>

  <p>"Our own will then," said Oswald. "Yours, mine, and every right sort of
  man's."</p>

  <p>Peter seemed to consider it.</p>

  <p>"It won't be a national will, anyhow," he said, coming back to Moscow. "It
  won't be one of these national ideas. No Holy Russia&mdash;or Old England for
  the matter of that. They're just&mdash;human accumulations. No. I don't know
  of this Will at all&mdash;any will, Nobby. I can't see or feel this Will. I
  wish I could...."</p>

  <p>He had said his say. Oswald turned again to the great spectacle of the
  city. Did all those heavenward crosses now sinking into the dusk amount to no
  more than a glittering emanation out of the fen of life, an unmeaning
  <i>ignis fatuus</i>, born of a morass of festering desires that had already
  forgotten it? Or were these crosses indeed an appeal and a promise? Out of
  these millions of men would Man at last arise?...</p>

  <p>Slowly, smoothly, unfalteringly, the brush of the twilight had been
  sweeping its neutral tint across the spectacle, painting out the glittering
  symbols one by one. A chill from outer space fell down through the thin
  Russian air, a dark transparent curtain. Oswald shivered in his wadded coat.
  Abruptly down below, hard by a ghostly white church, one lamp and then
  another pricked the deepening blue. A little dark tram-car that crept towards
  them out of the city ways to fetch them back into the city, suddenly became a
  glow-worm....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">Twenty years before Oswald would not have talked in this
  fashion of the Will. Twenty years before, the social and political order of
  the world had seemed so stable to an English mind that the thought of a
  sustaining will was superfluous. Queen Victoria and the whole system had an
  air of immortal inertia. The scientific and economic teachings under which
  Oswald's ideas had been shaped recognized no need for wilfully co-ordinated
  efforts. The end of education, they indicated, was the Diffusion of
  Knowledge. Victorian thought in England took good motives for granted, seemed
  indeed disposed to regard almost any motive as equally good for the common
  weal. Herbert Spencer, that philosopher who could not read Kant, most typical
  of all English intelligences in those days, taught that if only there were no
  regulation, no common direction, if every one were to pursue his own
  individual ends unrestrained, then by a sort of magic, chaos, freed from the
  interference of any collective direction, would produce order. His supreme
  gift to a generation of hasty profiteers was the discovery that the blind
  scuffle of fate could be called "Evolution," and so given an air of intention
  altogether superior to our poor struggles to make a decent order out of a
  greedy scramble. For some decades, whatever sections of British life had
  ceased to leave things to Providence and not bother&mdash;not
  bother&mdash;were leaving them to Evolution&mdash;and still not
  bothering....</p>

  <p>It was because of Oswald's discovery of the confused and .distressed
  motives of Joan and Peter and under the suggestions of the more kinetic
  German philosophy that was slowly percolating into English thought, that his
  ideas were now changing their direction. Formerly he had thought of nations
  and empires as if they were things in themselves, loose shapes which had
  little or nothing to do with the individual lives they contained; now he
  began to think that all human organizations, large and small alike, exist for
  an end; they are will forms; they present a purpose that claims the
  subordination of individual aims. He began to see states and nations as
  things of education, beings in the minds of men.</p>

  <p>The parallelism of Russia and Britain which Peter had made, struck Oswald
  as singularly acute. They had a closer parallelism with each other than with
  France or Italy or the United States or Germany or any of the great political
  systems of the world. Russia was Britain on land. Britain was Russia in an
  island and upon all the seas of the globe. One had the dreamy lassitude of an
  endless land horizon, the other the hardbitten practicality of the salt seas.
  One was deep-feeling, gross, and massively illiterate, the other was pervaded
  by a cockney brightness. But each was trying to express and hold on to some
  general purpose by means of forms and symbols that were daily becoming more
  conspicuously inadequate. And each appeared to be moving inevitably towards
  failure and confusion.</p>

  <p>One afternoon during their stay in Petrograd, Bailey took Oswald and Peter
  to see a session of the Duma. They drove in a sledge down the Nevski Prospekt
  and by streets of ploughed-up and tumbled snow, through which struggled an
  interminable multitude of sledges bringing firewood into the city, to the old
  palace of the favourite Potemkin, into which the Duma had in those days been
  thrust. The Duma was sitting in a big adapted conservatory, and the three
  visitors watched the proceedings from a little low gallery wherein the
  speakers were almost inaudible. Bailey pointed out the large proportion of
  priests in the centre and explained the various party groups; he himself was
  very sympathetic with the Cadets. They were Anglo-maniac; they idealized the
  British constitution and thought of a limited monarchy&mdash;in the land of
  extremes....</p>

  <p>Oswald listened to Bailey's exposition, but the thing that most gripped
  his attention was the huge portrait of the Tsar that hung over the gathering.
  He could not keep his eyes off it. There the figure of the autocrat stood,
  with its sidelong, unintelligent visage, four times as large as life, dressed
  up in military guise and with its big cavalry boots right over the head of
  the president of the Duma. That portrait was as obvious an insult, as
  outrageous a challenge to the self-respect of Russian men, as a gross noise
  or a foul gesture would have been.</p>

  <p>"You and all the empire exist for ME," said that foolish-faced portrait,
  with its busby a little on one side and its weak hand on its sword
  hilt....</p>

  <p>It was to that figure they asked young Russia to be loyal.</p>

  <p>That dull-faced Tsar and the golden crosses of Moscow presented themselves
  as Russia to the young. A heavy-handed and very corrupt system of repression
  sustained their absurd pretensions. They had no sanction at all but that they
  existed&mdash;through the acquiescences of less intelligent generations. The
  aged, the prosperous, the indolent, the dishonest, the mean and the dull
  supported them in a vast tacit conspiracy. Beneath such symbols could a land
  under the sting of modern suggestions ever be anything but a will welter, a
  confusion of sentiments and instincts and wilfulness? Was it so wonderful
  that the world was given the stories of Artzibachev as pictures of the will
  forms of the Russian young?</p><br>

  <h3>§4</h3>

  <p class="first">Through all that journey Oswald was constantly comparing
  Peter with the young people he saw. On two occasions he and Peter went to the
  Moscow Art Theatre. Once they saw <i>Hamlet</i> in Russian, and once
  Tchekhov's <i>Three Sisters</i>; and each was produced with a completeness of
  ensemble, an excellence of mechanism and a dramatic vigour far beyond the
  range of any London theatre. Here in untidy, sprawling, slushy Moscow shone
  this diamond of co-operative effort and efficient organization. It set Oswald
  revising certain hasty generalizations about the Russian character....</p>

  <p>But far more interesting than the play to him was the audience. They were
  mostly young people, and some of them were very young people; students in
  uniform, bright-faced girls, clerks, young officers and soldiers, a
  sprinkling of intelligent-looking older people of the commercial and
  professional classes; each evening showed a similar gathering, a very full
  house, intensely critical and appreciative. It was rather like the sort of
  gathering one might see in the London Fabian Society, but there were scarcely
  any earnest spinsters and many more young men. The Art Theatre, like a
  magnet, had drawn its own together out of the vast barbaric medley of western
  and Asiatic, of peasant, merchant, priest, official and professional, that
  thronged the Moscow streets. And they seemed very delightful young
  people.</p>

  <p>His one eye wandered from the brightly-lit stage to the rows and rows of
  faces in the great dim auditorium about him, rested on Peter, and then went
  back to those others. This, then, must be a sample of the Intelligentsia.
  These were the youth who figured in so large a proportion of recent Russian
  literature. How many bright keen faces were there! What lay before
  them?...</p>

  <p>A dark premonition crept into his mind of the tragedy of all this eager
  life, growing up in the clutch of a gigantic political system that now
  staggered to its end....</p>

  <p>This youth he saw here was wonderfully like the new generation that was
  now dancing its way into his house at Pelham Ford.</p>

  <p>It was curious to note how much more this big dim houseful of young
  Muscovites was like a British or an American audience than it was to a German
  gathering. Perhaps there were rather more dark types, perhaps more high
  cheekbones; it was hard to say....</p>

  <p>But all the other north temperate races, it seemed to Oswald, as
  distinguished from the Germans, had the same suggestion about them of
  unco-ordinated initiatives. Their minds moved freely in a great old system
  that had lost its hold upon them. But the German youths were co-ordinated.
  They were tremendously co-ordinated. Two Sundays ago he and Peter had been
  watching the Sunday morning parade along Unter den Linden. They had gone to
  see the white-trousered guards kicking their legs out ridiculously in the
  goose step outside the Guard House that stands opposite the Kaiser's Palace,
  they had walked along Unter den Linden to the Brandenburger Tor, and then,
  after inspecting that vainglorious trophy of piled cannon outside the
  Reichstag, turned down the Sieges-Allee, and so came back to the Adlon by way
  of the Leipziger Platz. Peter had been alive to many things, but Oswald's
  attention had been concentrated almost exclusively on the youngsters they
  were passing, for the most part plump, pink-faced students in corps caps,
  very erect in their bearing and very tight in their clothes. They were an
  absolutely distinct variety of the young human male. A puerile militarism
  possessed them all. They exchanged salutations with the utmost punctilio.
  While England had been taking her children from the hands of God, and not so
  much making them as letting them develop into notes of interrogation, Germany
  without halt or hesitation had moulded her gift of youth into stiff,
  obedient, fresh soldiers.</p>

  <p>There had been a moment like a thunderclap while Oswald and Peter had been
  near the Brandenburger Tor. A swift wave of expectation had swept through the
  crowd; there had been a galloping of mounted policemen, a hustling of traffic
  to the side of the road, a hasty lining up of spectators. Then with melodious
  tootlings and amidst guttural plaudits, a big white automobile carrying a
  glitter of uniforms had gone by, driven at a headlong pace. "Der Kaiser!"
  Just for a moment the magnificence hung in the eye&mdash;and passed.</p>

  <p>What had they seen? Cloaks, helmets, hard visages, one distinctive pallid
  face; something melodramatic, something eager and in a great hurry, something
  that went by like the sound of a trumpet, a figure of vast enterprise in
  shining armour, with mailed fist. This was the symbol upon which these young
  Germans were being concentrated. This was the ideal that had gripped them.
  Something very .modern and yet romantic, something stupendously resolute.
  Going whither? At any rate, going magnificently somewhere. That was the power
  of it. It was going somewhere. For good or "bad it was an infinitely more
  attractive lead than the cowardly and oppressive Tsardom that was failing to
  hold the refractory minds of these young Russians, or the current edition of
  the British imperial ideal, twangling its idiotic banjo and exhorting Peter
  and his generation to "tax the foreigner" as a worthy end and aim in
  life.</p>

  <p>Oswald, with his eye on the dim, preoccupied audience about him, recalled
  a talk that he and Peter had had with a young fellow-traveller in the train
  between Hanover and Berlin. It had been a very typical young German, glasses
  and all; and his clothes looked twice as hard as Peter's, and he sat up
  stiffly while Peter slouched on the seat. He evidently wanted to air his
  English, while Peter had not the remotest desire to air his German, and only
  betrayed a knowledge of German when it was necessary to explain some English
  phrase the German didn't quite grasp. The German wanted to know whether
  Oswald and Peter had been in Germany before, where they were going, what they
  thought of it, what they were going to think of Berlin.</p>

  <p>Responding to counter questions he said he had been twice to England. He
  thought England was a great country. "Yes&mdash;but not systematic. No!"</p>

  <p>"You mean undisciplined?"</p>

  <p>Yes, it was perhaps undisciplined he meant.</p>

  <p>Oswald said that as a foreigner he was most struck by the tremendous air
  of order in north Germany. The Germans were orderly by nature. The admission
  proved an attractive gambit.</p>

  <p>The young German questioned Oswald's view that the Germans were naturally
  orderly. Hard necessity had made them so. They had had to discipline
  themselves, they had been obliged to develop a <i>Kultur</i>&mdash;encircled
  by enemies. Now their <i>Kultur</i> was becoming a second nature. Every
  nation, he supposed, brought its present to mankind. Germany's was Order,
  System, the lesson of Obedience that would constantly make her more powerful.
  The Germans were perforce a thorough people. Thorough in all they did.
  Although they had come late into modern industrialism they had already
  developed social and economic organization far beyond that of any other
  people. <i>Nicht wahr?</i> Their work was becoming necessary to the rest of
  mankind. In Russia, for example, in Turkey, in Italy, in South America, it
  was more and more the German who organized, developed, led. "Though we are
  fenced round," he said, "still&mdash;we break out."</p>

  <p>There was something familiar and yet novel in all this to Oswald. It was
  like his first sensation upon reading Shakespeare in German. It was something
  very familiar&mdash;in an unfamiliar idiom. Then he recognized it. This was
  exactly his own Imperialism&mdash;Teutonized. The same assertion of an
  educational mission....</p>

  <p>"Everywhere we go," said the young German, "our superior science, our
  higher education, our better method prevails. Even in your India&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He smiled and left that sentence unfinished.</p>

  <p>"But your militarism, your sabre rule here at home: this Zabern business;
  isn't that a little incompatible with this idea of Germany as a great
  civilizing influence permeating the world?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said the young German, with the readiness of a word-perfect
  actor. "Behind our missionaries of order we must have ready the good German
  sword."</p>

  <p>"But isn't the argument of force apt to be a
  little&mdash;decivilizing?"</p>

  <p>The young German did not think so. "When I was in England I said, there
  are three things that these English do not properly understand to use, they
  are the map or index, the school, and&mdash;the sword. Those three things are
  the triangle of German life...."</p>

  <p>That hung most in Oswald's mind. He had gone on talking to the young
  German for a long time about the differences of the British and the German
  way. He had made Peter and the youngster compare their school and college
  work, and what was far more striking, the difference in pressure between the
  two systems. "You press too hard", he said. "In Alsace you have pressed too
  hard&mdash;in Posen."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps we sometimes press&mdash;I do not know," said the young German.
  "It is the strength of our determination. We are impatient. We are a young
  people." For a time Oswald had talked of the methods of Germany in the
  Cameroons and of Britain on the Gold Coast, where the German had been growing
  cacao by the plantation system, turning the natives into slaves, while the
  British, with an older experience and a longer view, had left the laud in
  native hands and built up a happy and loyal free cultivation ten times as
  productive mile for mile as the German. It seemed to him to be one good
  instance of his general conception of Germany as the land of undue urgency.
  "Your Wissmann in East Africa was a great man&mdash;but everywhere else you
  drive too violently. You antagonize." North Germany everywhere, he said, had
  the same effect upon him of a country "going hard."</p>

  <p>"Germany may be in too much of a hurry," he repeated.</p>

  <p>"We came into world-politics late," said the young German, endorsing
  Oswald's idea from his own point of view. "We have much to overtake
  yet."...</p>

  <p>The Germans had come into world-politics late. That was very true. They
  were naive yet. They could still feed their natural egotism on the story of a
  world mission. The same enthusiasms that had taken Russia to the
  Pacific&mdash;and to Grand Ducal land speculation in Manchuria&mdash;and the
  English to the coolie slavery of the Rand, was taking these Germans
  now&mdash;whither? Oswald did not ask what route to disillusionment Germany
  might choose. But he believed that she would come to disillusionment. She was
  only a little later in phase than her neighbours; that was all. In the end
  they would see that that white-cloaked heroic figure in the automobile led
  them to futility as surely as the skulking Tsar. Not that way must the
  nations go....</p>

  <p>Oswald saw no premonition of a world catastrophe in this German
  youngster's devotion to an ideal of militant aggression, nor in the whole
  broad spectacle of straining preparation across which he and Peter travelled
  that winter from Aix to Wirballen. He was as it were magically blind. He
  could stand on the Hanover platform and mark the largeness of the station,
  the broad spreading tracks, the endless sidings, the tremendous transport
  preparations, that could have no significance in the world but military
  intention, and still have no more to say than, " These Germans give
  themselves elbow-room on their railways, Peter. I suppose land is cheaper."
  He could see nothing of the finger of fate pointing straight out of all this
  large tidy preparedness at Peter and their fellow-passengers and all the
  youth of the world. He thought imperialistic monarchy was an old dead thing
  in Russia and in Britain and in Germany alike.</p>

  <p>In Berlin indeed in every photographer's was the touched -up visage of the
  Kaiser, looking heroic, and endless postcards of him and of his sons and of.
  the Kaiserin and little imperial grandchildren and the like; they were as
  dull and dreary-looking as any royalties can be, and it was inconceivable to
  Oswald that such figures could really rule the imagination of a great people.
  He did not realize that all the tragedy in the world might lie behind the
  words of that young German, "we came into world-politics late," behind the
  fact that the German imperialist system was just a little less decayed, a
  little less humorous, a little less indolent and disillusioned than either of
  its great parallels to the east and west. He did not reflect that no system
  is harmless until its hands are taken off the levers of power. He could still
  believe that he lived in an immensely stable world, and that these vast forms
  of kingdom and empire, with their sham reverences and unmeaning ceremonies
  and obligations, their flags and militancy and their imaginative senility,
  threatened nothing beyond the negative evil of uninspired lives running to
  individual waste. That was the thing that concerned him. He saw no collective
  fate hanging over all these intent young faces in the Moscow Art Theatre, as
  over the strutting innocents of patriotic Berlin; he had as yet no intimation
  of the gigantic disaster that was now so close at hand, that was to torment
  and shatter the whole youth of the world, that was to harvest the hope and
  energy of these bright swathes of life....</p>

  <p>He glanced at Peter, intent upon the stage.</p>

  <p>Peter lay open to every impulse. That was Oswald's supreme grievance then
  against Tsars, Kings, and Churches. They had not been good enough for Peter.
  That seemed grievance enough.</p>

  <p>He did not imagine yet that they could murder the likes of Peter by the
  hundred thousand, without a tremor.</p>

  <p>He loved the fine lines of the boy's profile, he marked his delicate
  healthy complexion. Peter was like some wonderful new instrument in perfect
  condition. And all these other youngsters, too, had something of the same
  clean fire in them....</p>

  <p>Was it all to be spent upon love-making and pleasure-seeking and play? Was
  this exquisite hope and desire presently to be thrown aside, rusted by base
  uses, corroded by self-indulgence, bent or broken? "The generations running
  to waste&mdash;like rapids...."</p>

  <p>He still thought in that phrase. The Niagara of Death so near to them all
  now to which these rapids were heading, he still did not hear, did not
  suspect its nearness....</p>

  <p>And Joan&mdash;. Prom Peter his thoughts drifted to Joan. Joan apparently
  could find nothing better to do in life than dance....</p>

  <p>Suddenly Peter took a deep breath, sat back, and began to clap. The whole
  house broke out into a pelting storm of approval.</p>

  <p>"Ripping!" said Peter. "Oh! ripping."</p>

  <p>He turned his bright face to Oswald. "They do it so well," he said,
  smiling. "I had forgotten it was in Russian. I seemed to understand every
  word."</p>

  <p>Oswald turned his eye again to <i>Hamlet</i> in Gordon Craig's fantastic
  setting&mdash;which Moscow in her artistic profusion could produce when
  London was too poor to do so.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">Very similar were the thoughts in Oswald's mind three months
  later, three months nearer the world catastrophe, as he sat in his
  summerhouse after Joan had told him of her quarrel with Peter.</p>

  <p>Her denunciation of Peter had had the curious effect upon him of making
  him very anxious about her. So far as Peter went, what she had told him had
  but confirmed and made definite what he had known by instinct since the
  Christmas party. His mind was used now to the idea of Peter being vicious.
  But he was very much shocked indeed at the discovery that Joan was aware of
  Peter's vices. That was a new jolt to his mind. In many things Joan and Peter
  had changed his ideas enormously, but so far he had retained not only his
  wardroom standards with regard to the morals of a youth, but also his
  romantic ideals of feminine purity with regard to a girl. He still thought of
  his own womenkind as of something innocent, immaculate and untouchable,
  beings in a different world from the girls who "didn't mind a bit of fun" and
  the women one made love to boldly.</p>

  <p>But now he had to face the fact&mdash;Joan had forced it upon
  him&mdash;this new feminine generation wasn't divided in that obvious way.
  The clean had knowledge, the bold were not outcast and apart. The new world
  of women was as mixed as the world of men. He sat in his summerhouse thinking
  of his Joan's flushed face, her indignant eyes, her outspoken words.</p>

  <p>"It was a woman's face," he whispered....</p>

  <p>And he was realizing too how much more urgent the ending of adolescence
  was becoming with a girl than it could ever be with a boy. Peter might tumble
  into a scrape or so and scramble out again, not very much the worse for it,
  as he himself had done. But Joan, with all the temerity of a youth, might be
  making experiments that were fatal. He had not been watching her as he had
  watched Peter. Suddenly he woke up to this realization of some decisive issue
  at hand. Why was she so whitely angry with Peter? Why did she complain of
  having to "stand too much" from Peter? Her abuse of his friends had the
  effect of a counter attack. Was there some mischief afoot from which Peter
  restrained her? What men were there about in Joan's world?</p>

  <p>There was something slimy and watchful about this fellow Huntley. Could
  there be more in that affair than one liked to think? ... Or was there some
  one unknown in London or in Cambridge?</p>

  <p>She and Peter were quarrelling about the Easter party. It would apparently
  be impossible to have any Easter party this year, since both wanted to bar
  out the other one's friends. And anyhow there mustn't be any more of this
  Hetty Rein hart business at Pelham Ford. That must stop. It ought never to
  have happened. ... He would take Peter over to Dublin. They could accept an
  invitation he had had from Graham Powys out beyond Foxrock, and they could
  motor into Dublin and about the country, and perhaps the Irish situation
  might touch the boy's imagination....</p>

  <p>Joan could go to her aunts at The Ingle-Nook....</p>

  <p>Should he have a talk to Aunt Phyllis about the girl?</p>

  <p>It was a pity that Aunt Phyllis always lost her breath and was shaken like
  an aspen leaf with fine feeling whenever one came to any serious discussion
  with her. If it wasn't for that confounded shimmer in her nerves and
  feelings, she would be a very wise and helpful woman....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">Oswald's thoughts ranged far and wide that morning.</p>

  <p>Now he would be thinking in the most general terms of life as he conceived
  it, now he would be thinking with vivid intensity about some word or phrase
  or gesture of Joan and Peter.</p>

  <p>He was blind still to the thing that was now so close to all his world;
  nevertheless a vague uneasiness about the trend of events was creeping into
  his mind and mixing with his personal solicitudes. Many men felt that same
  uneasiness in those feverish days&mdash;as if Death cast his shadow upon them
  before he came visibly into their lives.</p>

  <p>Oswald belonged to that minority of Englishmen who think systematically,
  whose ideas join on. Most Englishmen, even those who belong to what we call
  the educated classes, still do not think systematically at all; you cannot
  understand England until you master that fact; their ideas are in slovenly
  detached little heaps, they think in ready-made phrases, they are honestly
  capable therefore of the most grotesque inconsistencies. But Oswald had built
  up a sort of philosophy for himself, by which he did try his problems and
  with which he fitted in such new ideas as came to him. It was a very
  distinctive view of life he had; a number of influences that are quite
  outside the general knowledge of English people had been very powerful in
  shaping it. Biological science, for example, played a quite disproportionate
  part in it. Like the countrymen of Metchnikoff, most of the countrymen of
  Darwin and Huxley believe firmly that biological science was invented by the
  devil and the Germans to undermine the Established Church. But Oswald had
  been exceptional in the chances that had turned his attention to these
  studies. And a writer whose suggestions had played a large part in shaping
  his ideas about education and social and political matters was J. J.
  Atkinson. He thought Atkinson the most neglected of all those fine-minded
  Englishmen England ignores. He thought Lang and Atkinson's <i>Social
  Origins</i> one of the most illuminating books he had ever read since Winwood
  Reade's <i>Martyrdom Of Man</i>. No doubt it will be amusing to many English
  readers that Oswald should have mixed up theories of the origins and
  destinies of mankind with his political views and his anxieties about Joan's
  behaviour and Peter's dissipations but he did. It was the way of his mind. He
  perceived a connexion between these things.</p>

  <p>The view he had developed of human nature and human conditions
  was.saturated with the idea of the ancestral ape. In his instincts, he
  thought, man was still largely the creature of the early Stone Age, when,
  following Atkinson, he supposed that the human herd, sex linked, squatted
  close under the dominion of its Old Man, and hated every stranger. He did not
  at all accept the Aristotelian maxim that man is "a political animal." He was
  much more-inclined to Schopenhauer's comparison of human society to a
  collection of hedgehogs driven together for the sake of warmth. He thought of
  man as a being compelled by circumstances of his own inadvertent creation to
  be a political animal in spite of the intense passions and egotisms of his
  nature. Man he judged to be a reluctant political" animal. Man's prehensile
  hand has given him great possibilities of experiment, he is a restless and
  curious being, knowledge increases in him and brings power with it. So he
  jostles against his fellows. He becomes too powerful for his instincts. The
  killing of man becomes constantly more easy for man. The species must needs
  therefore become political and religious, tempering its intense lusts and
  greeds and hostilities, if it is to save itself from self-destruction. The
  individual man resists the process by force and subterfuge and passivity at
  every step. Nevertheless necessity still finds something in the nature of
  this fiercest of its creatures to work upon. In the face of adult resistance
  necessity harks back to plastic immaturity. Against the narrow and intense
  desires of the adult man, against the secretive cunning and dispersiveness of
  our ape heredity, struggle the youthful instincts of association.
  Individualism is after all a by-path in the history of life. Every mammal
  begins by being dependent and social; even the tiger comes out of a litter,
  me utter is brotherhood. Every mother is a collectivist for her brood. A
  herd, a tribe, a nation, is only a family that has delayed dispersal, stage
  by stage, in the face of dangers. All our education is a prolongation and
  elaboration of family association, forced upon us by the continually growing
  danger of the continually growing destructiveness of our kind.</p>

  <p>And necessity has laid hold of every device and formula that will impose
  self-restraint and devotion upon the lonely savagery of man, that will help
  man to escape race-suicide. In spite of ever more deadly and far-reaching
  weapons, man still escapes destruction by man. Religion, loyalty, patriotism,
  those strange and wonderfully interwoven nets of superstition, fear,
  flattery, high reason and love, have subjugated this struggling egotistical
  ape into larger and larger masses of co-operation, achieved enormous
  temporary securities. But the ape is still there, struggling subtly. Deep in
  every human individual is a fierce scepticism of and resentment against the
  laws that bind him, and the weaker newer instincts that would make him the
  servant of his fellow man.</p>

  <p>Such was Oswald's conception of humanity. It marched with all his
  experiences of Africa, where he had struggled to weave the net of law and
  teaching against warrior, slave-trader, disease and greed. It marched now
  with all the appearances of the time. So it was he saw men.</p>

  <p>It seemed to him that the world that lay behind the mask of his soft,
  sweet Hertfordshire valley, this modern world into which Joan and Peter had
  just rushed off so passionately, was a world in which the old nets of rule
  and convention which had maintained a sufficiency of peace and order in
  Europe for many generations of civilization, were giving way under the heavy
  stresses of a new time. Peoples were being brought too closely together, too
  great a volume of suggestions poured into their minds, criticism was vivid
  and destructive; the forms and rules that had sufficed in a less crowded time
  were now insufficient to hold imaginations and shape lives. Oswald could see
  no hope as yet of a new net that would sweep together all that was bursting
  out of the old. His own generation of the 'eighties and 'nineties, under a
  far less feverish urgency, had made its attempt to patch new and more
  satisfactory network into the rotting reticulum, but for the most part their
  patches had done no more than afford a leverage for tearing. He had built his
  cosmogony upon Darwin and Winwood Reade, his religion upon Cotter Morrison's
  <i>Service Of Man</i>; he had interwoven with that a conception of the Empire
  as a great civilizing service. That much had served him through the trying
  years at the end of adolescence, had in spite of strong coarse passions made
  his life on the whole a useful life. King, church, and all the forms of the
  old order he had been willing to accept as a picturesque and harmless
  paraphernalia upon these structural ideas to which he clung. He had been
  quite uncritical of the schoolmaster. Now with these studies of education
  that Joan and Peter had forced upon him, he was beginning to realize how
  encumbering and obstructive the old paraphernalia could be, how it let in
  indolence, stupidity, dishonesty, and treachery to the making of any modern
  system. A world whose schools are unreformed is an unreformed world. Only in
  the last year or so had he begun to accept the fact that for some reason
  these dominant ideas of his, this humanitarian religion which had served his
  purpose and held his life and the lives of a generation of liberal-minded
  Englishmen together, had no gripping power upon his wards. This failure
  perplexed him profoundly. Had his Victorian teachers woven prematurely, or
  had they used too much of the old material? Had they rather too manifestly
  tried to make the best of two worlds&mdash;leaving the schools alone? Must
  this breaking down of strands that was everywhere apparent, go still further?
  And if so, how far would the breaking down have to go before fresh nets could
  be woven?</p>

  <p>If Oswald in his summerhouse in the spring of 1914 could see no immediate
  catastrophe ahead, he could at least see that a vast disintegrate process had
  begun in the body of European civilization. This disintegration, he told
  himself, was a thing to go on by stages, to be replaced by stages; it would
  give place to a new order, a better order, "someday "; everything just and
  good was going to happen someday, the liberation of India, the contentment of
  Ireland, economic justice, political and military efficiency. It was all
  coming&mdash;always coming and never arriving, that new and better state of
  affairs. What did go on meanwhile was disintegration. The British mind hates
  crisis; it abhors the word "Now." It believes that you can cool water for
  ever and that it will never freeze, that you can saw at a tree for ever and
  that it will never fall, that there is always some sand left above in the
  hour-glass. When the English Belshazzar sees the writing on the wall, he
  welcomes the appearance of a new if rather sensational form of publication,
  and he sits back to enjoy it at his leisure....</p>

  <p>The nets were breaking, but they would never snap. That in effect was
  Oswald's idea in 1913. The bother, from his point of view, was that they had
  let out Joan and Peter to futility.</p>

  <p>There is a risk that the catastrophic events of 1914 may blind the
  historian to the significance of the spinning straws of 1913. But throughout
  Europe the sands were trickling before the avalanche fell. The arson of the
  suffragettes, the bellicose antics of the Unionist leaders in Ulster, General
  Gough's Curragh mutiny, were all parts of the same relaxation of bonds that
  launched the grey-clad hosts of Germany into Belgium. Only the habits of an
  immense security could have blinded Oswald to the scale and imminence of the
  disaster. The world had outgrown its ideas and its will. Already people are
  beginning to forget the queer fevers that ran through the British community
  in 1913. For example there was the violent unrest of the women. That may
  exercise the historian in the future profoundly. Probably he will question
  the facts. Right up to the very outbreak of the war there was not a week
  passed without some new ridiculous outrage on the part of the militant
  suffragettes. Now it was a fine old church would be burnt, now a well-known
  country house; now the mania would take the form of destroying the letters in
  pillar-boxes, now the attack was upon the greens of the golf links. Public
  meetings ceased to be public meetings because of the endless interruptions by
  shrill voices crying "Votes for women!" One great triumph of the insurgents
  was a raid with little hammers upon the west-end shop-windows. They burnt the
  tea pavilion in Kew Gardens, set fire to unoccupied new buildings,
  inaugurated a campaign of picture-slashing &gt; at the public exhibitions.
  For a time they did much mischief to the cushions and fittings of railway
  carriages. Churches had to be locked up and museums closed on account of
  them. Poor little Pelham Ford church had had to buy a new lock against the
  dangers of some wandering feminist. And so on and so on. But this revolt of
  the women was more than a political revolt. That concentration upon the Vote
  was the concentration of a vast confused insurgence of energy that could as
  yet find no other acceptable means of expression. New conditions had robbed
  whole strata of women of any economic importance, new knowledge had
  enormously diminished the need for their domestic services, the birth-rate
  had fallen, the marriage age had risen, but the heedless world had made no
  provision for the vitality thus let loose. The old ideals of a womanly life
  showed absurd in the light of the new conditions. Why be pretty and
  submissive when nobody wants you? Why be faithful with no one to be faithful
  to? Why be devoted in a world which has neither enough babies nor lovers nor
  even its old proportion of helpless invalids to go round? Why, indeed, to
  come to the very heart of the old ideal, keep chaste when there is no one to
  keep chaste for? Half the intelligent women in that world had stood as Joan
  had done, facing their own life and beauty and asking desperately "What is
  the Good of it?"</p>

  <p>But while the old nets rotted visibly, there were no new nets being woven.
  There was everywhere the vague expectation of new nets, of a new
  comprehensiveness, a new way of life, but there was no broad movement towards
  any new way of life. Everywhere the old traditions and standards and
  institutions remained, discredited indeed and scoffed at, but in possession
  of life. Energetic women were reaching out in a mood of the wildest
  experiment towards they knew not what. It was a time of chaotic trials. The
  disposition of the first generation of released women had been towards an
  austere sexlessness, a denial of every feminine weakness, mental and
  physical, and so by way of Highmorton and hockey to a spinsterish, bitter
  competition with men. A few still bolder spirits, and Aunt Phoebe Stubland
  was among these pioneers, carried the destructive "Why not!" still further.
  Grant Allen's <i>Woman Who Did</i> and Arthur's infidelities were but early
  aspects of a wide wave of philoprogenitive and eugenic sentimentality. The
  new generation carried "why not?" into the sphere of conduct with amazing
  effect.</p>

  <p>Women are the custodians of manners, and mothers and hostesses who did not
  dream of the parallelism of their impulse with militancy, were releasing the
  young to an unheard-of extravagance of dress and festival. Joan could wear
  clothes at a Chelsea dance that would have shocked a chorus girl half a
  century before; she went about London in the small hours with any casual male
  acquaintance; so far as appearances went she might have been the most
  disreputable of women. She yielded presently to Huntley's persistence and
  began dancing the tango with him. It was the thing to slip away from a dance
  in slippers and a wrap, and spend an hour or so careering about London in a
  taxi or wandering on Hampstead Heath. Joan's escapades fretted the sleeping
  tramps upon the Thames Embankment. London, which had hitherto dispersed its
  gatherings about eleven and got to bed as a rule by midnight, was aspiring in
  those days to become nocturnal. The restaurants were obliged to shut early,
  but a club was beyond such regulations. Necessity created the night club,
  which awoke about eleven and closed again after a yawning breakfast of
  devilled bones.</p>

  <p>A number of night clubs were coming into existence, to the particular
  delight of young Winterbaum. His boyish ambition for Joan was returning. He
  had seen her dance and heard her dancing praised. Vulgar people made wild
  vulgar guesses in his hearing at what lay behind her grave and sometimes
  sombre prettiness. He pretended to be very discreet about that. It became the
  pride of his life to appear at some crowded night club in possession of Joan;
  he did not know what people thought of her or of him but he hoped for the
  worst. He wore the most beautiful buttons on his white waistcoat and the most
  delicate gold chain you can imagine. In the cloakroom he left a wonderful
  overcoat and a wonderful cane. Sometimes he encouraged the ringlets in his
  hair and felt like Disraeli, and sometimes he restrained them and felt like a
  cold, cynical Englishman of the darker sort. He would sit swelling with pride
  beside Joan, and nod to painted women and heavy men; he knew no end of
  people. He did not care what sort of people they were so long as he knew
  them. It was always his ambition to be seen drinking champagne with Joan.
  Joan had no objection in the world, but she could not bring herself to
  swallow a drink that tasted, she thought, like weak vinegar mixed with a
  packet of pins and that went up your nose and made your brain swing slowly to
  and fro on its axis for the rest of the evening. So she just drank nothing at
  all.</p>

  <p>She would sit at her table with her pretty bare arms folded under her like
  the paws of a little cat, with her face, that still had the delicacy and
  freshness of a child's, as intent as any intelligent child's can be on the
  jumble of people before her, and her sombre eyes, calm and beautiful, looking
  at smart London trying at last to take its pleasures gaily. Perhaps some
  fortunate middle-aged gentleman of Winterbaum's circle would be attempting to
  charm her by brilliant conversation, as, for instance Sir Joseph Lystrom,
  with a full-mouthed German flavour in his voice, in this style: "Pretty cheap
  here this evening somehow, eh? <i>What</i>?" Somewhere in the back of Sir
  Joseph's mind was the illusion that by barking in this way and standing treat
  profusely, lay the road to a girl's young love. Somewhen perhaps&mdash;who
  knows?&mdash;he may have found justification for that belief. Joan had long
  since learnt how to turn a profile to these formal attentions, and appear to
  be interested without hearing or answering a word.</p>

  <p>Or sometimes it would be Huntley. Huntley had lately taken to dodging
  among the night clubs to which he had access, when Joan was in London.
  Usually such nights ended in futility, but occasionally he was lucky and
  found Joan. Then he would come and talk and suggest ideas to her. He still
  remained the most interesting personality in her circle. She pretended to
  Winterbaum and herself to be bored by his pursuit, but indeed she looked for
  it. Except for Winterbaum and Huntley and Winterbaum's transitory
  introductions, she remained a detached figure in these places. Sometimes
  quite good-looking strangers sat a little way off and sought to convey to her
  by suitable facial expression the growth of a passionate interest in her. She
  conveyed to them in return that they were totally invisible to her, resisting
  at times a macabre disposition to take sights at them suddenly and amazingly
  or put out her tongue. Sometimes women of the great Winterbaum circle would
  make a fuss of her. They called her a "dear child." They would have been
  amazed at the complete theoretical knowledge a dear child of unrestricted
  reading could possess of them and their little ways.</p>

  <p>"So this is the life of pleasure," thought the dear child.
  "<i>Well</i>!"</p>

  <p>And then that same question that Peter seemed always to be asking of
  Oswald: "Is this <i>all</i>?"</p>

  <p>When she danced in these places she danced with a sort of contempt. And
  the sage, experienced men who looked at her so knowingly never realized how
  much they imagined about her and how little they knew.</p>

  <p>She would sit and think how indecent it was to be at the same time old and
  dissipated. Some of these women here, she perceived, were older than her
  aunts Phoebe and Phyllis, years older. Their faces were painted and done most
  amazingly&mdash;Joan knew all about facial massage and the rest of
  it&mdash;and still they were old faces. But their poor bodies were not nearly
  so old as their faces, that was the tragedy of them. Joan regarded the
  tremendous V decolletage of a lively grandmother before her, and the skin of
  the back shone as young as her own. The good lady was slapping the young
  gentleman next to her with a quite smooth and shapely arm. Joan speculated
  whether the old fashion of the masked ball and the Venetian custom of masks
  which she had been reading about that day in Voltaire's <i>Princesse de
  Babylone</i>, might not have something to do with that. But&mdash;she
  reverted&mdash;only young people ought to make love at all. Her aunts didn't;
  Oswald didn't. And Oswald was years younger than some of the men here, and in
  Joan's eyes at least far more presentable. He had a scarred face indeed but a
  clean skin; some of the old men here had skins one would shiver to touch, and
  the expressions of evil gargoyles. She let her thoughts dwell&mdash;not for
  the first time&mdash;on Oswald and a queer charm he had for her. Never in all
  her life had she known him do or say a mean, dishonest, unjust, or unkind
  thing. In some ways he was oddly like Peter, but wise and gentle&mdash;and
  not exasperating....</p>

  <p>But all this playing with love in London was detestable, all of it. This
  was really a shameful place. It was shameful to be here. Love&mdash;mixed up
  with evening dress and costly clothes and jewellery and nasty laughter and
  cigars, strong cigars and drink that slopped about. It was disgusting. These
  people made love after their luncheons and dinners and suppers. Pigs! They
  were all pigs. They looked like pigs. If ever she made love it should be in
  the open air, in some lovely place with blue mountains in the distance, where
  there were endless wild flowers, where one could swim. No man she had ever
  talked with of love had really understood anything of the beauty of love and
  the cleanness of love&mdash;except Mir Jelaluddin. And he had a high-pitched
  voice and a staccato accent&mdash;and somehow.... One ought not to be
  prejudiced against a dark race, but somehow it was unthinkable....</p>

  <p>Joan sat in the night club dreaming of a lover, and the men about her
  glanced furtively at her face, asking themselves, "Can it be I?" men with red
  ears, men with greasy hair, men with unpleasing necks and clumsy gestures;
  bald men, fat men, watery-eyed men, cheats, profiteers, usurers, snobs,
  toadies, successful old men of every sort and young men who had done nothing
  and for the most part never would. "Can it be I?" they surmised dimly, seeing
  her pensive eyes. And she was dreaming of a lithe, white, slender figure,
  strong and clean. He would hunt among the mountains, he would swim swift
  rivers; he would never drink strong drink nor reek of smoke....</p>

  <p>At this moment young Winterbaum became urgent with his beautiful gold
  cigarette case. Joan took a cigarette and lighted it, and sat smoking with
  her elbows side by side on the table.</p>

  <p>"You're not bored?" said young Winterbaum.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. I'm watching people. I don't want to talk."</p>

  <p>"Oh! not at all?" said young Winterbaum.</p>

  <p>"So long as one has to talk," he said after reflection and with an air of
  cleverness, "one isn't really friends."</p>

  <p>"Exactly," said Joan, and blew smoke through her nose.</p>

  <p>What was it she had been thinking about? She could not remember, the
  thread was broken. She was sorry. She had a vague memory of something
  pleasant.... She fell into a fresh meditation upon Jews. All Jews, she
  thought, ought to grow beards. At least after they were thirty. They are too
  dark to shave, and besides there is a sort of indignity about their beaked
  shaven faces. A bearded old Jew can look noble, a moustached old Jew always
  looked like an imitation of a Norman gentleman done in cheaper material. But
  that of course was exactly what he was....</p>

  <p>Why did men of forty or fifty always want to dance with and make love to
  flappers? Some of these girls here must be two or three years younger than
  herself. What was the interest? They couldn't talk; they weren't beautiful;
  one could see they weren't beautiful. And they laughed, good God! how they
  laughed! Girls ought to be taught to laugh, or at any rate taught not to
  laugh offensively. Laughter ought to be a joyful, contagious thing, jolly and
  kind, but these shrieks! How few of these people looked capable of real
  laughter! They just made this loud chittering sound. Only human beings
  laugh....</p>

  <p>In this manner the mind of Joan was running on the evening when she saw
  Peter and Hetty come into the club which tried to live up to the name of "The
  Nest of the Burning Phoenix." Some tango experts had just relinquished the
  floor and there was a space amidst the throng when Hetty made her entry.
  Hetty had made a great effort, she was in full London plumage, and her effect
  was tremendous.</p>

  <p>About her little bold face was a radiant scheme of peacock's feathers, her
  slender neck carried a disc a yard and a quarter wide; her slender, tall body
  was sheathed in black and peacock satin; she wore enormous earrings and a
  great barbaric chain. Her arms were bare except for a score of bangles, and
  she had bare sandalled feet. She carried her arrow point of a chin
  triumphantly. Peter was not her only attendant. There was also another man in
  her train whom every one seemed to recognize, a big, square-faced, handsome
  man of thirty-five or so who made Peter look very young and flimsy. "She's
  got Fred Beevor!" said Winterbaum with respect, and dropped the word
  "Million." Peter's expression was stony, but Joan judged he was not enjoying
  himself.</p>

  <p>There were very few unoccupied chairs and tables, but opposite Joan were
  two gilt seats and another disengaged at a table near at hand. Hetty was too
  busy with her triumph to note Joan until Beevor had already chosen this
  place. With a slight awkwardness the two parties mingled. Young Winterbaum at
  least was elated. Beevor after a few civilities to Joan let it appear that
  Hetty preoccupied him. Peter was evidently not enjoying himself at all. Joan
  found him seated beside her and silent.</p>

  <p>Joan knew that it is the feminine role to lead conversation, but it seemed
  to her rather fun to have to encourage a tongue-tied Peter. A malicious idea
  came into her head.</p>

  <p>"Well, Petah," she said; "why don't you say I oughtn't to be here?"</p>

  <p>Peter regarded her ambiguously. He had an impulse.</p>

  <p>"No decent people ought to be here," he said quietly. "Let's go home,
  Joan."</p>

  <p>Her heart jumped at the suggestion. All her being said yes. And then she
  remembered that she had as much right to have a good time as Peter. If she
  went back with him it would be like giving in to him; it would be like
  admitting his right to order her about. And besides there was Hetty. He
  wasn't really disgusted. All he wanted to do really was to show off because
  he was jealous of Hetty. He didn't want to go home with Joan. She wasn't
  going to be a foil for Hetty anyhow. And finally, once somewhere he had
  refused her almost exactly the same request. She checked herself and
  considered gravely. A little touch of spite crept into her expression.</p>

  <p>"No," she said slowly. "No.... I've only just come, Petah."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Peter. "<i>I</i> don't mind. If you like this sort of
  thing&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He said no more, sulking visibly.</p>

  <p>Joan resolved to dance at the first opportunity, and to dance in a bold
  and reckless way&mdash;so as thoroughly to exasperate Peter. She looked about
  the room through the smoke-laden atmosphere in the hope of seeing
  Huntley....</p>

  <p>She and Peter sat side by side, feeling very old and experienced and
  worldly and up-to-date. But indeed they were still only two children who
  ought to have been packed off to bed hours before.</p><br>

  <h3>§7</h3>

  <p class="first">The disorder in the world of women, the dissolution of
  manners and restraints, was but the more intimate aspect of a universal drift
  towards lawlessness. The world of labour was seething also with the same
  spirit of almost aimless insurrection. In a world of quickened apprehensions
  and increasing stimulus women were losing faith in the rules of conduct that
  had sufficed in a less exacting age. Far pro-founder and more dangerous to
  the established order were the scepticisms of the workers. The pretensions of
  the old social system that trade unionism had scarcely challenged were now
  being subjected throughout all western Europe to a pitiless scrutiny by a new
  and more educated type of employee.</p>

  <p>The old British trade unionism had never sought much more than increased
  wages and a slightly higher standard of life; its acceptance of established
  institutions had been artlessly complete; it had never challenged the
  authority nor the profits of the proprietor. It had never proposed more than
  a more reasonable treaty with the masters, a fairer sharing of the good gifts
  of industry. But infatuated by the evil teachings of an extreme
  individualism, a system of thought which was indeed never more than a system
  of base excuses dressed up as a philosophy, the directing and possessing
  classes had failed altogether to agree with their possible labour adversary
  quickly while they were yet in the way with him. They had lacked the
  intelligence to create a sympathetic industrial mentality, and the conscience
  to establish a standard of justice. They left things alone until the grit of
  a formless discontent had got into every cog of the industrial machinery. Too
  late, the employers were now conceding the modest demands that labour had
  made in the 'eighties and 'nineties, they were trying to accept the offers of
  dead men; they found themselves face to face with an entirely less
  accommodating generation. This new labour movement was talking no longer of
  shorter hours and higher pay but of the social revolution. It did not demand
  better treatment from the capitalist; it called him a profiteer and asked him
  to vanish from the body politic. It organized strikes now not to alter the
  details of its working conditions as its predecessor had done, but in order
  to end the system by making it impossible. In Great Britain as on the
  Continent, the younger generation of labour was no longer asking to have the
  harness that bound it to the old order made easier and lighter; it was asking
  for a new world.</p>

  <p>The new movement seemed to men of Oswald's generation to come as
  thunderstorms will sometimes come, as the militant suffragette had seemed to
  come, suddenly out of a clear sky. But it was far more ominous than the
  suffragette movement, for while that.made one simple explicit demand, this
  demanded nothing short of a new economic order. It asked for everything and
  would be content with nothing. It was demanding from an old habitual system
  the supreme feat of reconstruction. Short of that vague general
  reconstruction it promised no peace. Higher wages would not pacify it;
  shorter hours would not pacify it. It threatened sabotage of every sort, and
  a steady, incessant broadening antagonism of master and man. Peter, half
  sympathetic and half critical, talked about it to Oswald one day.</p>

  <p>"They all say, 'I'm a Rebel!' " said Peter. "'Rebel' is their cant
  word."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but rebel against what?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! the whole system.,"</p>

  <p>"They have votes."</p>

  <p>"They get humbugged, they say. They do, you know. The party system is a
  swindle, and everybody understands that. Why don't we clean it up? P.R.'s the
  only honest method. They don't understand how it is rigged, but they know it
  is rigged. When you talk about Parliament they laugh."</p>

  <p>"But they have their Unions."</p>

  <p>"They don't trust their leaders. They say they are got at. They say they
  are old-fashioned and bluffed by the politicians.... They are...."</p>

  <p>"Then what do they want?"</p>

  <p>"Just to be out of all this. They are bored to tears by their work, by the
  world they have to live in, by the pinched mean lives they have to
  lead&mdash;in the midst of plenty and luxury&mdash;bored by the everlasting
  dullness and humbug of it all."</p>

  <p>"But how are they going to alter it?"</p>

  <p>"That's all vague. Altogether vague. Cole and Mellor and those Cambridge
  chaps preach Guild Socialism to them, but I don't know how far they take it
  in&mdash;except that they agree that profit is unnecessary. But the
  fundamental fact is just blind boredom and the desire to smash up things.
  Just on the off chance of their coming better. The employer has been free to
  make the world for them, and this is the world he has made. Damn him! That's
  how they look at it. They are bored by his face, bored by his automobile,
  bored by his knighthood, bored by his country house and his snob of a
  wife&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But what can they do?" "</p>

  <p>"Make things impossible."</p>

  <p>"They can't run things themselves."</p>

  <p>"They aren't convinced of that. Anyhow if they smash up things the
  employer goes first, and he's the chap they seem to be principally
  after&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Peter reflected. Then he gave a modern young Englishman's view of the
  labour conflict. "The employers have been pretty tidy asses not to see that
  their workpeople get a better, more amusing life than they do. It was their
  business and their interest to do so. It could have been managed easily. But
  they're so beastly disloyal. And so mean. They not only sweat labour
  themselves but they won't stir a finger to save it from jerry-built housing,
  bad provisioning, tally-men, general ugliness, bad investments, rotten
  insurance companies&mdash;every kind of rotten old thing. Any one may help
  kill their sheep. They've got no gratitude to their workers. They won't even
  amuse them. "Why couldn't they set up decent theatres for them, and things
  like that? It's so stupid of them. These employers are the most dangerous
  class in the community. There's enough for every one nowadays and over. It's
  the first business of employers to see workpeople get their whack. What good
  are they if they don't do that? But they never have. Labour is convinced now
  that they never will. They run about pretending to be landed gentry. They've
  got their people angry and bitter now, they've destroyed public confidence in
  their ways, and it serves them jolly well right if the workmen make things
  impossible for them. I think they will. I hope they will."</p>

  <p>"But this means breaking up the national industries," said Oswald. "Where
  is this sort of thing going to end?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! things want shaking up," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he added, "one must break up old things before one can hope for
  new. I suppose the masters won't let go while they think there's a chance of
  holding on...."</p>

  <p>He had not a trace left of the Victorian delusion that this might after
  all be the best of all possible worlds. He thought that our politicians and
  our captains of industry were very poor muddlers indeed. They drifted. Each
  one sat in his own works, he said, and ran them for profit without caring a
  rap whither the whole system was going. Compared with Labour even their
  poverty of general ideas was amazing. Peter, warming with his subject, walked
  to and fro across the Pelham Ford lawn beside Oswald, proposing to rearrange
  industrialism as one might propose to reshuffle a pack of cards.</p>

  <p>"But suppose things smash up," said Oswald. "Smash up," did not seem to
  alarm Peter.</p>

  <p>"Nowadays," said Peter, "so many people read and write, so much has been
  thought out, there is so big a literature of ideas in existence, that I think
  we could recover from a very considerable amount of smashing. I'm pro-smash.
  We have to smash. What holds us back are fixed ideas. Take Profit. We're used
  to Profit. Most business is done for profit still. But why should the world
  tolerate profit at all? It doesn't stimulate enterprise; it only stimulates
  knavery. And Capital, Financial Capital is just blackmail by gold&mdash;gold
  rent. We think the state itself even can't start a business going or employ
  people without first borrowing money. Why should it borrow money? Why not,
  for state purposes, create it? Yes. No money would be any good if it hadn't
  the state guarantee. Gold standard, fixed money fund, legitimate profits and
  so on; that's the sort of fixed idea that gets in the way nowadays. It won't
  get out of the way just for reason's sake. The employers keep on with these
  old fixed ideas, naturally, because so it is they have been made, but the
  workpeople believe in them less and less. There must be a smash of some
  sort&mdash;just to shake ideas loose...."</p>

  <p>Oswald surveyed his ward. So this was the young man's theory. Not a bad
  theory. Fixed Ideas!</p>

  <p>II There's something to be said for this notion of Fixed Ideas," he said.
  "Yes. But isn't this 'I'm a Rebel' business, isn't that itself a Fixed
  Idea?"</p>

  <p>"Oh certainly!" said Peter cheerfully. "We poor human beings are always
  letting our ideas coagulate. That's where the whole business seems to me so
  hopeless...."</p><br>

  <h3>§8</h3>

  <p class="first">In the 'eighties and 'nineties every question had been
  positive and objective. "People," you said, "think so and so. <i>Is it
  right</i>?" That seemed to cover the grounds for discussion in those days.
  One believed in a superior universal reason to which all decisions must
  ultimately bow. The new generation was beginning where its predecessors left
  off, with what had been open questions decided and carried beyond discussion.
  It was at home now on what had once been battlefields of opinion. The new
  generation was reading William James and Bergson and Freud and becoming more
  and more psychological. "People," it said, "think so and so. Why do they do
  so?"</p>

  <p>So when at last Oswald carried off Peter to Dublin&mdash;which he did not
  do at Easter as he had planned but at Whitsuntide for a mere long
  week-end&mdash;to see at close hand this perplexing Irish Question ^that
  seemed drifting steadily and uncontrollably towards bloodshed, he found that
  while he was asking "who is in the right and who is in the wrong here? Who is
  most to blame and who should have the upper hand?" Peter was asking with a
  terrible impartiality, "Why are all these people talking nonsense?" and "Why
  have they got their minds and affairs into this dangerous mess?" Sir Horace
  Plunkett, Peter had a certain toleration for; but it was evident he suspected
  A.E. Peter did not talk very much, but he listened with a bright scepticism
  to brilliant displays of good talk&mdash;he had never heard such good
  anecdotal talk before&mdash;and betrayed rather than expressed his conviction
  that Nationalism, Larkinism, Sinn Feinism, Ulsterism and Unionism were all
  insults to the human intelligence, material for the alienist rather than
  serious propositions.</p>

  <p>It wasn't that he felt himself to be in possession of any conclusive
  solution, or that he obtruded his disbelief with any sense of superiority. In
  spite of his extreme youth he did not for a moment assume the attitude of a
  superior person. Life was evidently troubling him profoundly, and he was
  realizing that there was no apparent answer to many of his perplexities. But
  he was at least trying hard to get an answer. What shocked him in the world
  of Dublin was its manifest disinclination to get any answer to anything. They
  jeered at people who sought solutions. They liked the fun of disorder; it
  gave more scope for their irrepressible passion for character study. He began
  to recognize one particular phrase as the keynote of Dublin's animation: "Hev
  ye hurrd the letest?"</p>

  <p>On the Sunday afternoon of their stay in Dublin, Powys motored them
  through the city by way of Donnybrook and so on round the bay to Howth to see
  the view from Howth Head. Powys drove with a stray guest beside him. Behind,
  Peter imparted impressions to Oswald.</p>

  <p>"I don't like these high walls," he said. "I've never seen such a lot of
  high walls.... It's just as if they all shut themselves in from one
  another,"</p>

  <p>"Fixed Ideas, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"They are rather like Fixed Ideas. I suppose high walls are fun to climb
  over and throw things over. But&mdash;it's uncivilized."</p>

  <p>"Everybody," grumbled Peter, "is given to fixed ideas, but the Irish have
  'em for choice. All this rot about Ireland a Nation and about the Harp, which
  isn't properly their symbol, and the dear old Green Flag which isn't properly
  their colour!... They can't believe in that stuff nowadays.... But can they!
  In our big world? And about being a Black Protestant and pretending Catholics
  are poison, or the other way round. What are Protestants and Catholics
  now?... Old dead squabbles.... Dead as Druids.... Keeping up all that
  bickering stuff, when a child of eight ought to know nowadays that the
  Christian God started out to be a universal, charitable God.... If Christ
  came to Dublin the Catholics and Protestants would have a free fight to
  settle which was to crucify Him...."</p>

  <p>"It's the way with them," said Oswald. "We've got to respect Irish
  opinion."</p>

  <p>"It doesn't respect itself. Everywhere else in the world, wherever we have
  been, there's been at least something like the germ of an idea of a new life.
  But here! When you get over here you realize for the first time that England
  is after all a living country trying to get on to something&mdash;compared
  with this merry-go-round.... It's exactly like a merry-go-round churning
  away. It's the atmosphere of a country fair. An Irishman hasn't any idea of a
  future at all, so far as I can see&mdash;except that perhaps his
  grandchildren will tell stories of what a fine fellow he was...."</p>

  <p>The automobile halted for a moment at cross roads, and the finger-post was
  in Erse characters.</p>

  <p>"Look at <i>that</i>!" said Peter with genuine exasperation. "And hardly a
  Dubliner knows fifty words of the language! It's foolery. If we were Irish I
  suppose we should smother London with black-letter. We should go on
  pretending that we, too, were still Catholics and Protestants. The
  pseudo-Protestants would hang Smithfield with black on account of the
  martyrs, and the pseudo-Catholics would come and throw the meat about on
  Fridays. Chesterton and Belloc would love it anyhow."...</p>

  <p>Oswald was not sure of the extent of Peter's audience. "The
  susceptibilities of a proud people, Peter," he whispered, with his eye on the
  back of their host.</p>

  <p>"Bother their susceptibilities. Much they care for our susceptibilities.
  The worst insult you can offer a grown-up man is to humour him," said Peter.
  "What's the good of pretending to be sympathetic with all this Wearing of the
  Green. It's like our White Rose League. Let 'em do it by all means if they
  want to, but don't let's pretend we think it romantic and beautiful and all
  the rest of it. It's just posing and dressing up, and it's a nuisance, Nobby.
  All Dublin is posing and dressing up and playing at rebellion, and so is all
  Ulster. The Volunteers of the eighteenth century all over again. It's like
  historical charades. And they've pointed loaded guns at each other. Only
  idiots point loaded guns. Why can't we English get out of it all, and leave
  them to pose and dress up and then tell anecdotes and anecdotes and anecdotes
  about it until they are sick of it? If ever they are sick of it. Let them
  have their Civil War if they want it; let them keep on with Civil Wars for
  ever; what has it got to do with us?"</p>

  <p>"You're a Home Ruler then," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"I don't see that we English do any good here at all. What are we here for
  anyhow? The Castle's just another Fixed Idea, something we haven't the mental
  vigour to clear away. Nobody does any good here. We're not giving them new
  ideas, we're not unifying them, we're not letting Ireland out into the
  world&mdash;which is what she wants&mdash;we're not doing anything but just
  holding on."</p>

  <p>"What's that?" said Powys suddenly over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Peter's declaring for Home Rule," said Oswald." After his glimpse of the
  slums of Dublin?" "It's out of malice. He wants to leave Irishmen to
  Irishmen."</p>

  <p>"Ulster says <i>No!</i>" said Powys. "Tell him to talk to Ulster," and
  resumed a conversation he had interrupted with the man beside him.</p>

  <p>At the corner where Nassau Street runs into Grafton Street they were held
  up for some lengthy minutes by a long procession that was trailing past
  Trinity College and down Grafton Street. It had several bands, and in the
  forefront of it went National Volunteers in green uniforms, obviously for the
  most part old soldiers; they were followed by men with green badges, and then
  a straggle of Larkinites and various Friendly Societies with their bands and
  banners, and then by a long dribble of children and then some workgirls, and
  then a miscellany of people who had apparently fallen in as the procession
  passed because they had nothing else to do. As a procession it was tedious
  rather than impressive. The warm afternoon&mdash;it was the last day in
  May&mdash;had taken the good feeling out of the walkers. Few talked, still
  fewer smiled. The common expression was a long-visaged discontent, a gloomy
  hostile stare at the cars and police cordon, an aimless disagreeableness.
  They were all being very stern and resolute about they did not quite know
  what. They meant to show that Dublin could be as stern and resolute as
  Belfast. Between the parts of the procession were lengthy gaps. It was a
  sunshiny, dusty afternoon, and the legs of the processionists were dusty to
  the knees, their brows moist, and their lips dry. There was an unhurried air
  about them of going nowhere in particular. It was evident that many of their
  banners were heavy. "What's it all about?" asked Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Lord knows," said Powys impatiently. "It's just a demonstration."</p>

  <p>"Is that all? Why don't we cut across now and get on?" "</p>

  <p>There's more coming. Don't you hear another band?"</p>

  <p>"But the police could hold it up for a minute and let all these tramcars
  and automobiles across."</p>

  <p>"There'd be a fight," said Powys. "They daren't."...</p>

  <p>"And I suppose this sort of thing is going on in the north too?" asked
  Oswald after a pause.</p>

  <p>"Oh! everywhere," said Powys. "Orange or Green. But they've got more guns
  up north."</p>

  <p>"These people don't really want Ireland a Nation and all the rest of it,"
  said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Oh?" said Powys, staring at him.</p>

  <p>"Well, look at them," said Peter. "You can see by their faces. They're
  just bored to death. I suppose most people are bored to death in Ireland.
  There's nothing doing. England just holds them up, I suppose. And it's an
  island&mdash; rather off the main line. There's nothing to get people's minds
  off these endless, dreary old quarrels. It's all they have. But they're bored
  by it...."</p>

  <p>"And that's why we talk nothing but anecdotes, Peter, eh?" Powys
  grinned.</p>

  <p>"Well, you do talk a lot of anecdote," said Peter, who hadn't realized the
  sharpness of his host's hearing.</p>

  <p>"Oh! we do. I don't complain of your seeing it. It isn't your discovery.
  Have you read or heard the truest words that were ever said of
  Ireland&mdash;by that man Shaw? In John Bull's Other Island.... That laughing
  scene about the pig. 'Nowhere else could such a scene cause a burst of
  happiness among the people.' That's the very guts of things here; eh?"</p>

  <p>"It's his best play," said Oswald, avoiding too complete an assent.</p>

  <p>"It gets there," Powys admitted, "anyhow. The way all them fools come into
  the shanty and snigger."...</p>

  <p>The last dregs of the procession passed reluctantly out of the way. It
  faded down Grafton Street into a dust cloud and a confusion of band noises.
  The policemen prepared to release the congested traffic. Peter leaned out to
  count the number of trams and automobiles that had been held up. He was still
  counting when the automobile turned the corner.</p>

  <p>They shook Dublin off and spun cheerfully through the sunshine along the
  coast road to Howth. It was a sparkling bright afternoon, and the road was
  cheerful with the prim happiness of many couples of Irish lovers. But that
  afternoon peace was the mask worn by one particular day. If the near future
  could have cast a phantom they would have seen along this road a few weeks
  ahead of them the gun-runners of Howth marching to the first foolish
  bloodshed in Dublin streets....</p>

  <p>They saw Howth Castle, made up now by Lutyens to look as it ought to have
  looked and never had looked in the past. The friend Powys had brought wanted
  to talk to some of the castle people, and while these two stayed behind
  Oswald and Peter went on, between high hedges of clipped beech and up a
  steep, winding path amidst great bushes of rhododendron in full flower to the
  grey rock and heather of the crest. They stood in the midst of one of the
  most beautiful views in the world. Northward they looked over Ireland's Eye
  at Lambay and the blue Mourne mountains far away; eastward was the lush green
  of Meath, southward was the long beach of the bay sweeping round by Dublin to
  Dalkey, backed by more blue mountains that ran out eastward to the Sugar
  Loaf. Below their feet the pale castle clustered amidst its rich greenery,
  and to the east, the level blue sea sustained one single sunlit sail. It was
  rare that the sense of beauty flooded Peter, as so often it flooded Joan, but
  this time he was transported.</p>

  <p>"But this is altogether beautiful," he said, like one who is taken by
  surprise.</p>

  <p>And then as if to himself: "How beautiful life might be! How splendid life
  might be!"</p>

  <p>Oswald was standing on a ledge below Peter, and with his back to him. He
  waited through a little interval to see if Peter would say any more. Then he
  pricked him with "only it isn't."</p>

  <p>"No," said Peter, with the sunlight gone out of his voice. "It isn't."</p>

  <p>He went on talking after a moment's reflection.</p>

  <p>"It's as if we were hypnotized and couldn't get away from mean things,
  beastly suspicions, and stale quarrels. I suppose we are still half apes. I
  suppose our brains set too easily and rapidly. I suppose it's easy to quarrel
  yet and</p>

  <p>420 still hard to understand. We take to jealousy and bitterness as
  ducklings take to water. Think of that stale, dusty procession away
  there!"</p>

  <p>Oswald's old dream vision of the dark forest came back to his mind. "Is
  there no way out, Peter?" he said.</p>

  <p>"If some great idea would take hold of the world!" said Peter....</p>

  <p>"There have been some great ideas," said Oswald....</p>

  <p>"If it would take hold of one's life," Peter finished his thought....</p>

  <p>"There has been Christianity," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Christianity!" Peter pointed at the distant mist that was Dublin. "Sour
  Protestants," he said, "and dirty priests setting simple people by the
  ears."</p>

  <p>"But that isn't true Christianity."</p>

  <p>"There isn't true Christianity," said Peter compactly....</p>

  <p>"Well, there's love of country then," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"That Dublin corporation is the most patriotic and nationalist in the
  world. Fierce about it. And it's got complete control there. It's green in
  grain. No English need apply.... From the point of view of administration
  that town is a muck heap&mdash;for patriotic Growings. Look at their dirty,
  ill-paved streets. Look at their filthy slums! See how they let their blessed
  nation's children fester and die!"</p>

  <p>"There are bigger ideas than patriotism. There are ideas of empire, the
  Pax Britannica."</p>

  <p>"Carson smuggling guns."</p>

  <p>"Well, is there nothing? Do you know of nothing?"</p>

  <p>Oswald turned on his ward for the reply.</p>

  <p>"There's a sort of idea, I suppose."</p>

  <p>"But what idea?"</p>

  <p>"There's an idea in our minds."</p>

  <p>"But what is it, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"Call it Civilization," Peter tried.</p>

  <p>"I believe," he went on, weighing his words carefully, "as you believe
  really, in the Republic of Mankind, in universal work for a common
  end&mdash;for freedom, welfare, and beauty. Haven't you taught me that?"</p>

  <p>"Have I taught you that?"</p>

  <p>"It seems to me to be the commonsense aim for all humanity. You're awake
  to it. You've awakened me to it and I believe in it. But most of this world
  is still deep in its old Fixed Ideas, walking in its sleep. And it won't wake
  up. It won't wake up.... What can we <i>do</i>? We've got to a sort of idea,
  it's true. But here are these Irish, for example, naturally wittier and
  quicker than you or I, hypnotized by Orange and Green, by Protestant and
  Catholic, by all these stale things&mdash;drifting towards murder. It's
  murder is coming here. You can smell the bloodshed coming on the
  air&mdash;and we can't do a thing to prevent it. Not a thing. The silliest
  bloodshed it will be. The silliest bloodshed the world has ever seen. We
  can't do a thing to wake them up....</p>

  <p>"We're in it," said Peter in conclusion. "We can't even save
  ourselves."</p>

  <p>"I've been wanting to get at your political ideas for a long time, 11 said
  Oswald. "You really think, Peter, there might be a big world civilization, a
  world republic, did you call it?&mdash;without a single slum hidden in it
  anywhere, with the whole of mankind busy and happy, the races living in
  peace, each according to its aptitudes, a world going on&mdash;going on
  steady and swift to still better things."</p>

  <p>"How can one believe anything else? Don't <i>you</i>!"</p>

  <p>"But how do we get there, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, how do we get there?" echoed Peter. "How do we get there?"</p>

  <p>He danced a couple of steps with vexation.</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Nobby," he cried. "I don't know. I can't find the way. I'm
  making a mess of my life. I'm not getting on with my work. You know I'm
  not.... Either we're mad or this world is. Here's all these people in Ireland
  letting a solemn humbug of a second-rate lawyer with a heavy chin and a
  lumpish mind muddle them into a civil war&mdash;and that's reality! That's
  life! The solemn League and Covenant&mdash;copied out of old history books!
  That's being serious! And over there in England, across the sea, muddle and
  muck and nonsense indescribable. Oh! and we're in it!"</p>

  <p>"But aren't there big movements afoot, Peter, social reform, the labour
  movement, the emancipation of women, big changes like that!"</p>

  <p>"Only big discontents."</p>

  <p>"But doesn't discontent make the change?"</p>

  <p>"It's just boredom that's got them. It isn't any disposition to make.
  Labour is bored, women are bored, all Ireland is bored. I suppose Russia is
  bored and Germany is getting bored. She is boring all the world with her
  soldiering. How bored they must be in India too&mdash;by us! The day bores
  its way round the earth now&mdash;like a mole. Out of sight of the stars. But
  boring people doesn't mean making a new world. It just means boring on to
  decay. It just means one sort of foolish old fixed idea rubbing and sawing
  against another, until something breaks down.... Oh! I want to get out of all
  this. I don't like this world of ours. I want to get into a world awake. I'm
  young and I'm greedy. I've only got one life to live, Nobby.... I want to
  spend it where something is being made. Made for good and all. Where clever
  men can do something more than sit overlong at meals and tell spiteful funny
  stories. Where there's something better to do than play about with one's
  brain and viscera!..."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">In the days when Peter was born the Anglican system held the
  Empire with apparently invincible feelings of security and self-approval; it
  possessed the land, the church, the army, the foreign office, the court. Such
  people as Arthur and Dolly were of no more account than a stray foreign gipsy
  by the wayside. When Peter came of age the Anglican system still held on to
  army, foreign office, court, land, and church, but now it was haunted by a
  sense of an impalpable yet gigantic antagonism that might at any time
  materialize against it. It had an instinctive perception of the near
  possibility of a new world in which its base prides could have no adequate
  satisfaction, in which its authority would be flouted, its poor learning
  despised, and its precedents disregarded. The curious student of the history
  of England in the decade before the Great War will find the clue to what must
  otherwise seem a hopeless tangle in the steady, disingenuous, mischievous
  antagonism of the old Anglican system to every kind of change that might
  bring nearer the dreaded processes of modernization. Education, and
  particularly university, reform was blocked, the most necessary social
  legislation fought against with incoherent passion, the lightest, most
  reasonable taxation of land or inheritance resisted.</p>

  <p>Wherever the old system could find allies it snatched at them and sought
  to incorporate them with itself. It had long since taken over the New
  Imperialism with its tariff schemes and its spirit of financial adventure. It
  had sneered aloof when the new democracy of the elementary schools sought to
  read and think; it had let any casual adventurer to supply that reading; but
  now the creator of Answers and Comic Cuts ruled the Times and sat in the
  House of Lords. It was a little doubtful still whether he was of the new
  order or the old, whether he was not himself an instalment of revolution,
  whether the Tories had bought him or whether he had bought them, but at any
  rate he did for a time seem to be serving the ends of reaction.</p>

  <p>To two sources of strength the Anglicans clung with desperate resolution,
  India and Ulster. From India the mass of English people were shut and barred
  off as completely as any foreigners could have been. India was the preserve
  of the "ruling class." To India the good Anglican, smitten by doubts, chilled
  by some disrespectful comment or distressed by some item of progress
  achieved, could turn, leaving all thoughts of new and unpleasant things
  behind him; there in what he loved to believe was the "unchanging East" he
  could recover that sense of walking freely and authoritatively upon an
  abundance of inferior people which was so necessary to his nature, and which
  was being so seriously impaired at home. The institution of caste realized
  his secret ideals. From India he and his womankind could return refreshed, to
  the struggle with Liberalism and all the powers of democratic irreverence in
  England. And Ulster was a still more precious stronghold for this narrow
  culture. From the fastness of Ulster they could provoke the restless
  temperament of the Irish to a thousand petty exasperations of the English,
  and for Ulster, "loyal Ulster", they could appeal to the generous
  partisanship of the English against their native liberalism. More and more
  did it become evident that Ulster was the key-stone of the whole Anglican
  ascendancy; to that they owed their grip upon British politics, upon army,
  navy, and education; they traded&mdash;nay! they existed&mdash;upon the open
  Irish sore. With Ireland healed and contented England would be lost to them.
  England would democratize, would Americanize. The Anglicans would vanish out
  of British life as completely as the kindred Tories vanished out of America
  at the close of the eighteenth century. And when at last, after years of
  confused bickering, a Home Rule Bill became law, and peace between the two
  nations in Ireland seemed possible, the Anglicans stepped at once from legal
  obstruction to open treason and revolt. The arming of Ulster to resist the
  decision of Parliament was incited from Great Britain, it was supported
  enthusiastically by the whole of the Unionist party in Great Britain, its
  headquarters were in the west end of London, and the refusal of General Gough
  to carry out the precautionary occupation of Ulster was hailed with wild joy
  in every Tory home. It was not a genuine popular movement, it was an
  artificial movement for which the landowning church people of Ireland and
  England were chiefly responsible. It was assisted by tremendous exertions on
  the part of the London yellow press. When Sir Edward Carson went about Ulster
  in that warm June of 1914, reviewing armed men, promising "more Mausers," and
  pouring out inflammatory speeches, he was manifestly preparing bloodshed. The
  old Tory system had reached a point where it had to kill men or go.</p>

  <p>And it did not mean to go; it meant to kill. It meant to murder men.</p>

  <p>If youth and the new ideas were to go on with the world, the price was
  blood.</p>

  <p>Ulster was a little country; altogether the dispute did not affect many
  thousands of men, but except for the difference in scale there was indeed
  hardly any difference at all between this scramble towards civil conflict in
  Ireland and the rush, swift and noiseless, that was now carrying central
  Europe towards immeasurable bloodshed. To kill and mutilate and waste five
  human beings in a petty riot is in its essence no less vile a crime than to
  kill and mutilate and waste twenty millions. While the British Tories counted
  their thousands, the Kaiser and his general staff reckoned in millions; while
  the British "loyalists" were smuggling a few disused machine-guns from
  Germany, Krupp's factories were turning out great guns by the hundred. But
  the evil thing was the same evil thing; a system narrow and outworn, full of
  a vague fear of human reason and the common sense of mankind, full of pride
  and greed and the insolent desire to trample upon men, a great system of
  false assumptions and fixed ideas, oppressed by a thirsty necessity for
  reassurance, was seeking the refreshment of loud self-assertion and preparing
  to drink blood. The militarist system that centred upon Potsdam had clambered
  to a point where it had to kill men or go. The Balkans were the Ulster of
  Europe. If once this Balkan trouble settled down, an age of peace might dawn
  for Europe, and how would Junkerdom fare then, and where would Frau Bertha
  sell her goods t How would the War Lord justify his glories to the social
  democrat?...</p>

  <p>But Oswald, like most Englishmen, was not attending very closely to
  affairs upon the Continent. He was preoccupied with the unreason of
  Ulster.</p>

  <p>Recently he had had a curious interview with Lady Charlotte Sydenham, and
  her white excited face and blazing blue eyes insisted now upon playing the
  part of mask to the Ulster spirit in his thoughts. She had had to call him in
  because she had run short of ready money through over-subscription to various
  schemes for arming the northern patriots. She had sat at her writing-desk
  with her cap a little over one eye, as though it was a military cap, and the
  tuft of reddish hair upon her cheek more like bristles than ever, and he had
  walked about the room contriving disagreeable things to say to her after his
  wont. He was disinclined to let her have more money, he confessed; she ought
  to have had more sense, he said, than to write off big cheques, cheques
  beyond her means, in support of this seditious mischief. If she asked these
  people who had taken her money, probably they would let her have some back to
  go on with.</p>

  <p>This enraged her nicely, as he had meant it to do. She scolded at him. A
  nice Sydenham he was, to see his King insulted and his country torn apart. He
  who had once worn the Queen's uniform. Thank God! she herself was a
  Par-minter and belonged to a sounder strain!</p>

  <p>"It's you who are insulting the King," Oswald interpolated, "trying to
  defy his Acts in Parliament."</p>

  <p>"<i>Oh!</i>" cried Lady Charlotte, banging the desk with her freckled
  fist. "Oh! Parliament! I'd shoot 'em down! First that vile Budget, then the
  attack on the Lords."</p>

  <p>"They passed the Parliament Act," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"To save themselves from being swamped in a horde of working-men
  peers&mdash;sitting there in their caps with their dirty boots on the
  cushions. Lord Keir Hardie! You'll want Lord Chimneysweep and Viscount
  Catsmeatman next.... Then came that abominable Insurance Act&mdash;one thing
  worse than another! Setting class against class and giving them ideas! Then
  we gave up South Africa to the Boers again! What did we fight for? Didn't we
  buy the country with our blood? Why, my poor cousin Rupert Parminter was a
  prisoner in Pretoria for a whole year&mdash;thirteen weary months! For
  nothing! And now Ireland is to be handed over to priests and rebels. To
  Irishmen! And I&mdash;I am not to lift a finger, not a finger, to save my
  King and my Country and my God&mdash;when they are all going straight to the
  Devil!"</p>

  <p>"H'm," said Oswald, rustling the counterfoils in his hand. "But you have
  been lifting your finger, you know!"</p>

  <p>"If I could give more&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You have given more."</p>

  <p>"I'd give it."</p>

  <p>"Won't Grimes make a friendly advance? But I suppose you're up to the neck
  with Grimes.... I wonder what interest that little swindler charges you."</p>

  <p>The old lady could not meet the mild scrutiny of his eye. "You come here
  and grin and mock while your country is being handed over to a gang of
  God-knows-whos!" she said, staring at her inkpot.</p>

  <p>"To whom probably it belongs as much as it does to me," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Thank God the army is sound," said Aunt Charlotte. "Thank God this
  doesn't end with your Parliaments! Mark my words, Oswald! On the day they
  raise their Home Rule flag in Ireland there will be men shot down&mdash;men
  shot down. A grim lesson."</p>

  <p>"Some perhaps killed by your own particular cheques," said Oswald. "Who
  knows?"</p>

  <p>"I hope so," said Lady Charlotte, with a quiver of deep passion in her
  voice. "I hope so sincerely. If I could think I had caused the death of one
  of those traitors.... If it could be Lloyd George!"...</p>

  <p>But that was too much apparently even for Lady Charlotte to hope for.</p>

  <p>Oswald, when he had come to her, had fully intended to let her have money
  to go on with, but now he was changing his mind. He had thought of her
  hitherto just as a grotesque figure in his life, part of the joke of
  existence, but now with this worry of the Irish business in his mind he found
  himself regarding her as something more than an individual. She seemed now to
  be the accentuated voice of a whole class, the embodiment of a class
  tradition. He strolled back from the window and stood with his hands deep in
  his trouser pockets&mdash;which always annoyed her&mdash;and his head on one
  side, focusing the lady.</p>

  <p>"My dear Aunt," he said, "what right have you to any voice in politics at
  all? You know, you're pretty&mdash;ungracious. The world lets you have this
  money&mdash;and you spend it in organizing murder."</p>

  <p>"<i>The world lets me have this money!</i>" cried Lady Charlotte, amazed
  and indignant. "Why!" she roared, "it's MY money!"</p>

  <p>In that instant the tenets of socialism, after a siege lasting a quarter
  of a century, took complete possession of Oswald's mind. In that same instant
  she perceived it. "Any one can see you're a Liberal and a Socialist
  yourself," she cried. "You'd shake hands with Lloyd George tomorrow. Yes, you
  would. Why poor foolish Vincent made you trustee-He might have known! You a
  sailor! A faddy invalid! Mad on blacks. I suppose you'd give your precious
  Baganda Home Rule next! And him always so sound on the treatment of the
  natives! Why! he kicked a real judge&mdash;a native judge&mdash;Inner Temple
  and all the rest of it&mdash;out of his railway compartment. Kicked him.
  Bustled him out neck and crop. Awayed with him! Oh, if he could see you now!
  Insulting me! Standing up for all these people, blacks, Irishmen, strikers,
  anything. Sneering at the dear old Union Jack they want to tear to
  pieces."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Oswald as she paused to take breath. "You've got yourself
  into this mess and you must get along now till next quarter day as well as
  you can. I can't help you and you don't deserve to be helped."</p>

  <p>"You'll not let me spend my own money?"</p>

  <p>"You've fired off all the money you're entitled to. You'll probably kill a
  constable&mdash;or some decent little soldier boy from Devon or Kent.... Good
  God! Have you no imagination?..."</p>

  <p>It was the most rankling encounter he had ever had with her. Either he was
  losing tolerance for her or she was indeed becoming more noisy and ferocious.
  She haunted his thoughts for a long time, and his thoughts of her, so
  intricate is our human composition, were all mixed up with sympathy and
  remorse for the petty cash troubles in which he had left her....</p>

  <p>But what a pampered, evil soul she had always been! Never in all her life
  had she made or grown or got one single good thing for mankind. She had lived
  in great expensive houses, used up the labour of innumerable people, bullied
  servants, insulted poor people, made mischief. She was like some gross pet
  idol that mankind out of whim kept for the sake of its sheer useless
  ugliness. He found himself estimating the weight of food and the tanks of
  drink she must have consumed, the carcases of oxen and sheep, the cartloads
  of potatoes, the pyramids of wine bottles and stout bottles she had emptied.
  And she had no inkling of gratitude to the careless acquiescent
  fellow-creatures who had suffered her so long and so abundantly. At the
  merest breath upon her clumsy intolerable dignity she clamoured for violence
  and cruelty and killing, and would not be appeased. An old idol! And she was
  only one of a whole class of truculent, illiterate harridans who were
  stirring up bad blood in half the great houses of London, and hurrying
  Britain on to an Irish civil war. No! She wasn't as funny as she seemed.</p>

  <p>Not nearly so funny. She was too like too many people for that. Too like
  most people?</p>

  <p>Did that go too far?</p>

  <p>After all there was a will for good in men; even this weary Irish business
  had not been merely a conflict of fixed ideas, there had been, too, real
  efforts on the part of countless people to get the tangle straightened out.
  There were creative forces at work in men&mdash;even in Ireland. And also
  there was youth.</p>

  <p>His thoughts came back to the figure of Peter, standing on the head of
  Howth and calling for a new world.</p>

  <p>"I'll pit my Peter," he said, "against all the Aunt Charlottes in
  creation.... In the long run, that is."</p>

  <p>He was blind&mdash;was not all Europe blind T&mdash;to the vast disaster
  that hung over him and his and the whole world, to the accumulated
  instability of the outworn social and political facade that now tottered to a
  crash. Massacre, famine, social confusion, world-wide destruction, long years
  of death and torment were close at hand; the thinnest curtain of time, a mere
  month of blue days now, hung between him and the thunderous overture of the
  world disaster.</p>

  <p>"I pit my Peter," he repeated, "against all the Aunt Charlottes in
  creation."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 10</h3>

  <p class="first">All novels that run through the years of the great war must
  needs be political novels and fragments of history. In August, 1914, that
  detachment of human lives from history, that pretty picaresque disorder of
  experiences, that existence like a fair with ten thousand different booths,
  which had gone on for thousands of years, came to an end. We were all brought
  into a common drama. Something had happened so loud and insistent that all
  lives were focused upon it; it became a leading factor in every life, the
  plot of every story, the form of all our thoughts. It so thrust itself upon
  mankind that the very children in the schools about the world asked "why has
  this thing happened?" and could not live on without some answer. The Great
  War summoned all human beings to become political animals, time would brook
  no further evasion. August, 1914, was the end of adventure and mental
  fragmentation for the species; it was the polarization of mankind.</p>

  <p>Other books have told, innumerable books that have yet to come will tell,
  of the rushing together of events that culminated in the breach of the
  Belgian frontier by the German hosts. Our story has to tell only of how that
  crisis took to itself and finished and crowned the education of these three
  people with whom we are concerned. Of the three, Oswald and Joan spent nearly
  the whole of July at Pelham Ford. Peter came down from Cambridge for a day or
  so and then, after two or three days in London for which he did not clearly
  account, he went off to the Bernese Oberland to climb with a party of three
  other Trinity men. There was a vague but attractive project at the back of
  his mind, which he did not confide to Oswald or Joan, of going on afterwards
  into north Italy to a little party of four or five choice spirits which Hetty
  was to organize. They could meet on the other side of the Simplon. Perhaps
  they would push on into Venezia. They would go for long tramps amidst sweet
  chestnut trees and ripening grapes, they would stay in the vast, roomy,
  forgotten inns of sleepy towns whose very stables are triumphs of
  architecture, they would bathe amidst the sunlit rocks of quiet lakes.
  Wherever they went in that land the snow and blue of the distant Alps would
  sustain the sweet landscape as music sustains a song.</p>

  <p>Hetty had made it all fantastically desirable. She had invented it and
  woven details about it one afternoon in her studio. She knew north Italy very
  well; it was not the first amusing journey in that soft, delicious land that
  she had contrived. Peter was tremendously excited to think of the bright
  possibilities of such an adventure, and yet withal there was a queer
  countervailing feeling gnawing amidst his lusty anticipations. Great fun it
  would be, tremendous fun, with a little spice of sin in it, and why not? Only
  somehow he had a queer unreasonable feeling that Joan ought to share his
  holidays. Old Joan who looked at him with eyes that held a shadow of sorrow;
  who made him feel that she knew more than she could possibly know. He wished
  Joan, too, had some spree in contemplation&mdash;not of course quite the same
  sort of spree. A decent girl's sort of spree. Just the tramp part. He wished
  he could tell Joan of what was in hand, that there wasn't this queer
  embarrassment between them. Joan had her car of course....</p>

  <p>Oswald had recently bought Joan a pretty little ten-horsepower Singer car,
  a two-seater, in which she was to run about the country at her own free will.
  It was one of several attempts he had recently made to brighten life for
  Joan. He was beginning to watch her very closely; he did not clearly
  understand the thoughts and imaginations that made her so grave and feverish
  at times, but he knew that she was troubled. The girl's family resemblance to
  his Dolly had caught his mind. He thought she was more like Dolly than she
  was because her image constantly before him was steadily replacing Dolly's in
  his mind. And he liked very much to sit beside her and watch her drive. At
  five-and-forty miles an hour her serene profile was divine. She had a good
  mechanical intelligence and her nerve was perfect; the little car lived in
  her hands and had the precision of movement of an animal.</p>

  <p>They ran across country to Warwick and Stratford-on-Avon, and slept the
  night in Warwick; they went to New market and round to Chelmsford and
  Dovercourt, which was also an over-night excursion. These were their longer
  expeditions. They made afternoon runs to St. Albans, Hitchin, Baldock,
  Bedford, Stevenage and Royston. Almost every fine day they made some trip.
  While she drove or while they walked about some unfamiliar town the cloud
  seemed to lift from Joan's mind, she became as fresh and bright as a child.
  And she talked more and more freely to Oswald. She talked more abundantly
  than Peter and much less about ideas. She talked rather of scenery and
  customs and atmospheres. She seemed to have a far more concrete imagination
  than Peter, to accept the thing that was with none of his reluctance. She
  would get books about Spain, about the South Sea Islands, about China, big
  books of travel and description, from the London Library, and so assimilate
  them that she seemed to be living imaginatively for days together in these
  alien atmospheres. She wanted to know about Uganda. She was curious about the
  native King. There were times when Oswald was reminded of some hungry and
  impatient guest in a restaurant reading over an over-crowded and perplexing
  menu.</p>

  <p>She did not read many plays or novels nor any poetry. She mentioned
  casually one day to Oswald that such reading either bored her or disturbed
  her. She read a certain amount of philosophy, but manifestly now as a task.
  And she was incessantly restless. She had no mother nor sisters, no feminine
  social world about her; she suffered from a complete lack of all those
  distracting and pacifying routines and all those restraints of habit and
  association that control the lives of more normally placed girls. Her
  thoughts, stimulated by her uncontrolled reading, ran wild. One morning she
  was up an hour before dawn, and let herself out of the house and walked over
  the hills nearly to Newport before breakfast, coming back with skirts and
  shoes wet with dew and speckled with grass seeds and little burrs. She spent
  that afternoon asleep in the hammock. And she would play fitfully at the
  piano or the pianola after dinner and then wander out, a restless white
  sprite, into the garden. One night early in the month she persuaded Oswald to
  go for a long moonlight walk with her along the road to Ware.</p>

  <p>There was a touch of dream quality in that walk for both of them. They had
  never been together in moonlight before. She ceased to be Joan and became at
  once something very strange and wonderful and very intimate, a magic phantom
  of womanhood, a creature no longer of flesh and blood but of pallor and
  shadow, whose hair was part of the universal dusk and her eyes two stars. And
  he, too, walking along and sometimes talking as if he talked to the lonely
  sky, and sometimes looking down out of the dimness closely at her, he had
  lost his age and his scars and become the utmost dignity of a man. They
  walked sometimes on a road of misty brightness and sometimes through deep
  pools of shadow and sometimes amidst the black bars and lace cast by tree
  stems and tree branches, and she made him talk of the vast spaces of Africa
  and the long trails through reed and forest, and of great animals standing
  still and invisible close at hand, hidden by the trickery of their
  colourings, and how he had gone all alone into the villages of savage people
  who had never before set eyes on a European. And she talked with a whisper
  and sigh in her voice of how she, too, would like to go into wild and remote
  lands&mdash;"if I could go off with a man like you." And it seemed to him for
  a time that this sweet voice beside him was not truly Joan's but another's,
  and that he walked once more with the dearest wish he had ever wished in his
  life.</p>

  <p>He talked to her of moonlight and starlight in the tropics, of a wonderful
  pale incandescence that shines out above the grave of the sunset when the day
  has gone, of fireflies and of phosphorescent seas, and of the distant sounds
  of drumming and chanting and the remote blaze of native bonfires seen through
  black tree stems in the night. He talked, too, of the howling of beasts at
  night, and of the sudden roaring of lions, and at that she drew closer to
  him.</p>

  <p>When at last it was time for her to turn she did not want to turn. "I have
  been happy," she said. "I have been happy. Let us go on. Why should we go
  back!"</p>

  <p>As if she was not always happy. She pulled at his arm like a child....</p>

  <p>And as they came home she came close to him, and for long spaces they said
  not a word to one another.</p>

  <p>But at the water splash in the village she had a queer impulse. The water
  splash appeared ahead of them, an incessant tumult of silver in which were
  set jewels of utter blackness and shining diamonds. She looked and tugged him
  by the arm.</p>

  <p>"Let us walk through the water, dear Nobby!" she said. "I want to feel it
  about my feet. Do! Do! Do! It will hardly cover our shoes...."</p>

  <p>A queer impulse that was of hers but, what was queerer, it found the
  completest response in him. "All right," he said, as though this was the most
  commonplace suggestion possible; and very gravely, and as if it was some sort
  of rite, he let her lead him through the water. They were indeed both very
  grave....</p>

  <p>They walked up to the house in silence....</p>

  <p>"Good night, Nobby dear," said Joan, leaning suddenly over by the newel of
  the stairs, and kissed him, as the moonlight kisses, a kiss as soft and cool
  as ever awakened Endymion....</p>

  <p>Life was at high tide in Joan that July, and everything in her was
  straining at its anchors. All her being was flooded with the emotional
  intimations that she was a woman, that she had to be beautiful and hasten to
  meet exquisite and profoundly significant experiences; none of her instincts
  told her that the affairs of the world drew to an issue that would maim and
  kill half the youths she knew and torment and alter her own and every life
  about her. She was haunted and distressed day and night&mdash;for the trouble
  got into her dreams&mdash;by Peter's evident love-making with Hetty and
  Huntley? s watchful eyes, and she saw nothing of the red eyes of war and the
  blood-lust that craved for all her generation. Peter was making
  love&mdash;making love to Hetty. Peter was making love to Hetty. And Joan was
  left at home in a fever of desertion. Her brotherhood with Peter which had
  been perhaps the greatest fact of her girlhood was breaking down under the
  exasperation of their separation and her jealousy, and Huntley was steadily
  and persistently invading her imagination....</p>

  <p>Women and men alike are love-hungry creatures; women even more so than
  men. It is not beauty nor strength nor goodness that hearts go to so much as
  attention. To know that another human being thinks of us, esteems us above
  all our secret estimates, has a steadfast and consuming need of us, is the
  supreme reassurance of life. And when women's hearts are distressed by vague
  passions and a friendless insecurity they will go out very readily even to a
  cripple who watches and waits.</p>

  <p>Huntley was one of those men for whom women are the sole interest in life.
  If he had been obliged to master a mathematical problem he would have thought
  he struggled with a Muse and so achieved it. He watched them and waylaid them
  for small and great occasions. He understood completely these states of wild
  impatience that possess the feminine mind. He had no brotherliness nor
  fatherliness in his composition: his sole conception of this trouble of the
  unmated was of an opportunity for himself. A little patience, a little
  thought&mdash;and it was very delightful thought, a little pleasant skill,
  and all this vague urgency would become a gift for him.</p>

  <p>But never before had Huntley met any one so fresh and youthfully beautiful
  as Joan. There were times when he could doubt whether he was the magnetizer
  or the magnetized. He had kissed her but he was not sure that she had kissed
  him. Some day she should kiss him of her own free will, lie thought now
  almost continuously of Joan. The only work he could get on with was a novel
  into which he put things he had imagined about Joan. He wrote her long
  letters and planned for days to get an hour's conversation with her. And he
  would go for long walks and spend all the time composing letters or scheming
  dramatic conversations that never would happen in reality because Joan missed
  all her cues.</p>

  <p>It was rather by instinct than by any set scheme that he did his utmost to
  convert her vague unrest into a discontent with all her circumstances, to
  shape her thoughts to the idea that her present life was a prison-house of
  which he held the key of escape. He suggested in a score of different ways to
  her mind that outside her present prison was a wonderland of beauty and
  excitement. He was clever enough to catch from her talk her love of the open,
  of fresh air and sunlight. He had more than a suspicion of Hetty Reinhart's
  plans; he conveyed them by shadowy hints. Why should not Joan too defy
  convention? She could tell Oswald a story of a projected walk with some other
  girl at Cambridge, and slip away to Huntley. They had always been the best of
  companions. Why shouldn't they take a holiday together?</p>

  <p>And why not?</p>

  <p>What was there to fear? Couldn't she trust Huntley? Couldn't she trust
  herself?</p>

  <p>To which something deep in Joan's composition replied that this was but
  playing with passion and romance, and she wanted passion and romance. She
  wanted a reality&mdash;unendurably. And it was clear as day to her that she
  did not want passion and romance with Huntley. He was a strange being to her
  really, not differing as man does from woman but as dog does from cat; hidden
  deep down perhaps was some mysterious difference of race; he could amuse her
  and interest her because he was queer and unexpected, but he was not of her
  kind. Like to like was the way of the Sydenham blood. He offered and pointed
  to all that seemed to her necessary to make life right and to end this aching
  suspense&mdash;except that he was a stranger....</p>

  <p>The long sunny days of June dragged by. Suppose after all she were to slip
  away to Huntley. It would be a spree, it would be an excitement. Did he
  matter so much after all?...</p>

  <p>Peter sent a postcard and said he thought he would go on "with some people
  into Italy."</p>

  <p>She had known&mdash;all along&mdash;that that was coming.</p>

  <p>She went out the night after that postcard came into the garden alone. It
  was a still and sultry evening, and she stifled even in the open air. She
  wanted to go up into the arbour and to sit there and think. She could not
  understand the quiver of anger that ran through her being like the shiver of
  the current on the surface of a stream. All the trees and bushes about her
  were dark and shapeless lumps of blackness and as she went up the path she
  trod on two snails.</p>

  <p>"Damn them!" she said at the second scrunch. "Phew! What a night. Full of
  things that crawl about in the darkness. Full of beastly things...."</p>

  <p>A little owl mewed and mocked wickedly among the trees.</p>

  <p>There was no view out of the black arbour, only the sense of a darkened
  world. A thin ineffectual moon crescent was sinking westward, and here and
  there were spiritless stars. A strange, huge shape of clouds, a hooded figure
  of the profoundest blue, brooded in a sky of luminous pale yellow over the
  land to the south and east, and along the under fringe of its skirts ever and
  again there ran a flicker of summer lightning. "And I am to live here! I am
  to live here while life runs by me," she said.</p>

  <p>She would go to Huntley. No brother and sister business though! She would
  go to Huntley and end all this torment.</p>

  <p>But she couldn't!...</p>

  <p>"Why have I no will?" she cried harshly.</p>

  <p>She did not love Huntley. That did not matter. She would make herself love
  Huntley....</p>

  <p>She went out upon the terrace and stood very still, looking down upon the
  house and thinking hard.</p>

  <p>Could she love no one? If so, then it might as well be Huntley she went to
  as any one? All these boys, Troop, Winterbaum, Wilmington&mdash;they were
  nothing to her. But she wanted to live. Was it perhaps that she did love some
  one&mdash;who stood, invisible and unregarded, possessing her heart?</p>

  <p>Her mind halted on that for a time and then seemed to force itself along a
  certain line that lay before it. Did she love Oswald? She did. More than any
  of them&mdash;far more. The other night most certainly she had been in love
  with him. When he walked through the water with her&mdash;absurdly</p>

  <p>grave! She could have flung her arms about him then.</p>

  <p>She could have clung to him and kissed him. Of course she must be in love
  with him.... But he was not in love with her!... And yet that moonlit evening
  it seemed?</p>

  <p>Suppose it were Oswald and not Huntley who beckoned.</p>

  <p>Love for Huntley&mdash;love him where you would&mdash;though you loved him
  in the most beautiful scenery in the world-would still be something vulgar,
  still be this dirty love of the studios, still a trite disobedience, a stolen
  satisfaction, after the fashion of the Reinhart affair. But Oswald was a
  great man, a kind and noble giant, who told no lies, who played no
  tricks....</p>

  <p>If he were to love one!...</p>

  <p>She stood upon the terrace looking down upon the lit house, trembling with
  this thought that she loved Oswald and holding fast to it&mdash;for fear of
  another thought that she dared not think, that lay dark and waiting outside
  her consciousness, a poor exile thought, utterly forbidden.</p><br>

  <h3>§11</h3>

  <p class="first">Joan stood in the darkness on the turf outside Oswald's open
  window, and watched him.</p>

  <p>He was so deep in thought that he had not noted the soft sounds of her
  approach. The only light in the room was his study lamp, and his face was in
  shadow while his hands rested on the open Atlas in front of him and were
  brightly lit. They were rather sturdy white hands with broad thumbs, exactly
  like Peter's. Presently he stirred and pulled the Atlas towards him, and
  turned the page over to another map. The fingers of his left hand drummed on
  the desk.</p>

  <p>He looked up abruptly, and she came to the window and leant forward into
  the room, with her arms folded on the sill.</p>

  <p>"You're as still as the night, Joan," he said.</p>

  <p>"There's thunder brewing."</p>

  <p>"There's war brewing, Joan."</p>

  <p>"Why do you sit poring over that map?"</p>

  <p>"Because there are various people called Croats and Slovenes and Serbs and
  they are beginning to think they are one people and ought to behave as one
  people, and some of them are independent and some are under the Austrians and
  some are under the Italians."</p>

  <p>"What has that got to do with us?" said Joan.</p>

  <p>She followed her question up with another. "Is it a fresh Balkan war?"</p>

  <p>"Something bigger than that," said Oswald. "Something very much
  bigger&mdash;unless we are careful."</p>

  <p>His tone was so grave that Joan caught something of his gravity. She
  stepped in through the window. "Where are all these people?" she said. She
  thought it was characteristic of him to trouble about these distant races and
  their entanglements. But she wished he could have a keener sense of the
  perplexities that came nearer him. She came and leant over him while he
  explained the political riddle of Austria and Eastern Europe to her....</p>

  <p>"We are too busy with the Irish trouble," he said. "I am afraid of
  Germany. If that fool Carson and these Pankhurst people had been paid to
  distract our minds from what is happening, they could not do the work better.
  Big things are happening&mdash;oh! big things."</p>

  <p>She tried to feel their bigness. But to her all such political talk was
  still as unreal as things one reads about in histories, something to do with
  maps and dates, something you can "get up" and pass examinations in, but
  nothing that touches the warm realities of personal life and beauty. Yet it
  pleased her to think that this Oswald she loved could reach up to these
  things, so that he partook of the nature of the great beings who cared for
  them like Gladstone or Lincoln, and was not simply a limited real person like
  Troop or Wilmington or Peter. (He was really like a great Peter, like what
  Peter ought to be.) He seemed preoccupied as if he did not feel how close she
  was about him, how close her beauty came to him. She sat now on the arm of
  his chair behind him, with her face over his shoulder. Her body touched his
  shoulders, by imperceptible degrees she brought her cheek against his crisp
  hair, where it pressed no heavier than a shadow.</p>

  <p>She had no suspicion how vividly he was aware of her near new.</p>

  <p>As he discoursed to her upon the text of the maps before th&lt;-m, a deep
  undercurrent of memories and feelings of quite a different quality ran
  contrariwise through his mind. "We are getting nearer than we have ever been
  to a big European war, a big break-up! People do not understand, do not begin
  to dream of the smash-up that that would be. There is scarcely a country that
  may not be drawn in."</p>

  <p>So he spoke. And below that level of thought he was irritated to feel that
  such thought could not wholly possess him. Far more real to him were the
  vague suggestions of love and the summer night and the dusky nearness of this
  Joan, this phantom of Dolly, for more and more were Joan and Dolly blending
  together in his emotional life, this dear-aess and sweetness that defied all
  reasoning and explanation. And cutting across both these streams of thought
  and feeling came a third stream of thought. Joan's intonations in every word
  she spoke betrayed her indifference to the great net of political forces in
  which the world struggled. She was no more deeply interested than if he had
  been discussing some problem at chess or some mathematical point. She was not
  deeply interested and he was not completely interested, ami yet this question
  that was slipping its hold on their attention might involve the lives and
  welfare of millions....</p>

  <p>He struggled with his conception of a world being hauled to its
  destruction in a net of vaguely apprehended ideas, of ordinary life being
  shattered not by the strength but by the unattractive feebleness of its
  political imaginings." People do not understand," he repeated, trying to make
  this thing real to himself. "All Europe is in danger."</p>

  <p>He turned upon her with a betrayal of irritation in his voice. "You think
  all this matters nothing to us," he said. "But it does. If Austria makes war
  in Serbia, Russia will come in. If Russia conies in, France comes in. That
  brings in Germany. We can't see France beaten again. We can't have that."</p>

  <p>But Joan had still the child's belief that somewhere, somehow, behind all
  the ostensible things of the world, wise adults in its interests have the
  affairs of mankind under control. "They won't let things go as far as that,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>Oswald reflected upon that. How sure this creature was of her world!</p>

  <p>"Until Death and Judgment come, Joan," he said, "there is neither Death
  nor Judgment."</p>

  <p>That saying and his manner of saying it struck hard on her mind. Before
  she went to sleep that night she found herself trying to imagine what war was
  really like....</p>

  <p>And next day she was thinking of war. Would Peter perhaps have to be a
  soldier if there was a real great war? Would all her young men go soldiering?
  Would Oswald go? And what was there for a girl to do in war-time? She hated
  the idea of nursing, but she supposed she would have to nurse. Far rather
  would she go under fire and rescue wounded men. Had modern war no use for a
  Joan of Arc?... She sank to puerile visions of a girl in a sort of
  Vivandi-ere uniform upholding a tattered flag under a heavy fire.... It
  couldn't last very long. ... It would be exciting.... But all this was
  nonsense; there would be no war. There would be a conference or an
  arbitration or something dull of that sort, and all this stir and unrest
  would subside and leave things again&mdash;as they had been....</p>

  <p>Swiftly and steadfastly now the world was setting itself to tear up all
  the scenery of Joan's world and to smash and burn its every property. If it
  had not been for the suggestion of Oswald's deepening preoccupation one may
  doubt whether Joan would have heeded the huge rush of events in Europe until
  the moment of the crash. But because of him she was drawn into the
  excitement. From the twenty-fifth of July, which was the day when the news of
  the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia appeared in the English newspapers, through
  the swift rush of events that followed, the failure of the Irish Conference
  at Buckingham Palace to arrive at any settlement upon the Irish question, the
  attempts of Sir Edward Grey to arrest the march of events in Eastern Europe,
  the unchallenged march of five thousand men with machine-guns through Belfast
  the shooting upon the crowd in Dublin after the Howth gun-running, the
  consequent encouragement of Germany and Austria to persist in a stiff c-ourse
  with Russia because of the apparent inevitability of civil war in Ireland,
  right up to the march of the Germans into Luxembourg on the first of August,
  Joan followed with an interest that had presently swamped her egotistical
  eroticism altogether.</p>

  <p>The second of August was a Sunday and brought no papers to Pelham Ford,
  but Joan motored to Bishop's Stortford to get an <i>Observer</i>. Monday was
  Bank Holiday; the belated morning paper brought the news of the massacre of
  Belgian peasants by the Germans at Visé. The Germans were pouring into
  Belgium, an incredible host of splendidly armed men. Tuesday was an immense
  suspense for Oswald and Joan. They were full of an uncontrollable indignation
  against Germany. They thought the assault on Belgium the most evil thing that
  had ever happened in history. But it seemed as though the Government and the
  country hesitated. <i>The Daily News</i> came to hand with a whole page
  advertisement in great letters exhorting England not to go to war for
  Belgium.</p>

  <p>"But this is Shame!" cried Oswald. "If once the Germans get Paris! It is
  Shame and Disaster!"</p>

  <p>The postman was a reservist and had been called up. All over the country
  the posts were much disorganized. It was past eleven on the sunniest of
  Wednesdays when Joan, standing restless at the gates, called to Oswald, who
  was fretfully pacing the lawn, that the papers were coming.</p>

  <p>She ran down the road to intercept the postman, and came back with a
  handful of letters and parcels. Newspapers were far more important than any
  personal letters that morning. She gave Oswald the newspaper package to tear
  open, and snatched up The Daily News as it fell out of the enveloping
  Times.</p>

  <p>There was a crisp rustling of the two papers.</p>

  <p>Oswald's fear of his country's mental apathy, muddle-headedness, levity,
  and absolute incapacity to grasp any great situation at all, had become
  monstrous under the stresses of these anxious days. Up to the end he feared
  some politicians' procrastination, some idiot dishonesty and betrayal, weak
  palterings with a challenge as high as heaven, with dangers as plain as
  daylight....</p>

  <p>"Thank God!" he cried. "It is War!"</p>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">CHAPTER XIII. &mdash; JOAN AND PETER GRADUATE</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">SO it was, with a shock like the shock of an unsuspected big
  gun fired suddenly within a hundred yards of her, that the education of Joan
  and her generation turned about and entered upon a new and tragic phase.
  Necessity had grown impatient with the inertia of the Universities and the
  evasions of politicians. Mankind must learn the duties of human brotherhood
  and respect for the human adventure, or waste and perish; so our stern
  teacher has decreed. If in peace time we cannot learn and choose between
  those alternatives, then through war we must. And if we will in no manner
  learn our lesson, then&mdash; The rocks are rich with the traces of
  ineffective creatures that the Great Experimenter has tried and thrown
  aside....</p>

  <p>All these young people who had grown up without any clear aims or any
  definite sense of obligations, found themselves confronted, without notice,
  without any preparation, by a world crisis that was also a crisis of life or
  death, of honour or dishonour for each one of them. They had most of them
  acquired the habit of regarding the teachers and statesmen and authorities
  set up over their lives as people rather on the dull side of things, as
  people addicted to muddling and disingenuousness in matters of detail; but
  they had never yet suspected the terrific insecurity of the whole
  system&mdash;until this first thunderous crash of the downfall. Even then
  they did not fully realize themselves as a generation betrayed to violence
  and struggle and death. All human beings, all young things, are born with a
  conviction that all is right with the world. There is mother to go to and
  father to go to, and behind them the Law; for most of the generation that
  came before Joan and Peter the delusion of a great safety lasted on far into
  adult life; only slowly, with maturity, came the knowledge of the flimsiness
  of all these protections and the essential dangerousness of the world. But
  for this particular generation the disillusionment came like an unexpected
  blow in the face. They were preparing themselves in a leisurely and critical
  fashion for the large, loose prospect of unlimited life, and then abruptly
  the world dropped its mask. That pampered and undisciplined generation was
  abruptly challenged to be heroic beyond all the precedents of mankind. Their
  safety, their freedom ended, their leisure ended. The first few days of
  August, 1914, in Europe, was a spectacle of old men planning and evading,
  lying and cheating, most of them so scared by what they were doing as
  completely to have lost their heads, and of youth and young men everywhere
  being swept from a million various employments, from a million divergent
  interests and purposes, which they had been led to suppose were the proper
  interests and purposes of life, towards the great military machines that were
  destined to convert, swiftly and ruthlessly, all their fresh young life into
  rags and blood and rotting flesh....</p>

  <p>But at first the young had no clear sense of the witless futility of the
  machine that was to crush their lives. They did not understand that there was
  as yet no conception of a world order anywhere in the world. They had taken
  it for granted that there was an informal, tacitly understood world order, at
  which these Germans&mdash;confound them!&mdash;had suddenly struck.</p>

  <p>Peter and his friends were so accustomed to jeer at the dignitaries of
  church and state and at kings and politicians that they could not realize
  that such dwarfish and comic characters could launch disaster upon a whole
  world. They sat about a little table in a twilit arbour on the way down from
  Bel-Alp&mdash;Peter was to leave the climbers and join the Italian party at
  Brigue&mdash;and devoured omelette and veal and drank Yvorne, and mocked over
  the Swiss newspapers.</p>

  <p>"Another ultimatum!" said one cheerful youth. "Holland will get it
  next."</p>

  <p>"He's squirting ultimatums. Like a hedgehog throwing quills."</p>

  <p>"I saw him in Berlin," said Peter. "He rushed by in an automobile. He
  isn't a human being. He's more like Mr. Toad in <i>The Wind in the
  Willows</i>...."</p>

  <p>"All the French have gone home; all the Germans," said Troop. "I suppose
  we ought to go."</p>

  <p>"I've promised to go to Italy," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"War is war," said Troop, and stiffened Peter's resolution.</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to have my holidays upset by a theatrical ass in a gilt
  helmet," said Peter.</p>

  <p>He got down to Brigue next day, and the little town was bright with
  uniforms, for the Swiss were mobilizing. He saw off his mountaineering
  friends in the evening train for Paris. "You'd better come," said Troop
  gravely, hanging out of the train.</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head. His was none of your conscript nations. No....</p>

  <p>He dined alone; Hetty and her two friends were coming up from Lausanne
  next day. In the reading-room he found the <i>Times</i> with the first news
  of the invasion of Belgium. Several of the villagers of Visé had turned out
  with shot guns, and the Germans had performed an exemplary massacre for the
  discouragement of franc-tireurs. Indignation had been gathering in Peter
  during the day. He swore aloud and flung down the paper. "Is there no one
  sane enough to assassinate a scoundrel who sets things loose like this?" he
  said. He prowled about the little old town in the moonlight, full of black
  rage against the Kaiser. He felt he must go back. But it seemed to him a
  terrible indignity that he should have to interrupt his holiday because of
  the ambition of a monarch. "Why the devil can't the Germans keep him on his
  chain?" he said, and then, "Shooting the poor devils&mdash;like rabbits!"</p>

  <p>Hetty and her friends arrived in the early train next morning, all agog
  about the war. They thought it a tremendous lark. They were not to get out at
  Brigue, it was arranged; Peter was to be on the platform with his rucksack
  and join them. He kept the appointment, but he was a very scowling Peter in
  spite of the fact that Hetty was gentle and tremulous at the sight of him in
  her best style. "This train is an hour late," said Peter, sitting down beside
  her. "That accursed fool at Potsdam is putting all our Europe out of
  gear."...</p>

  <p>For three days he was dark, preoccupied company. "Somebody ought to
  assassinate him," he said, harping on that idea. "Have men no self-respect at
  all?"</p>

  <p>He felt he ought to go back to England, and the feeling produced a bleak
  clearness in his mind. It was soft sunshine on the lake of Orta, but east
  wind in Peter's soul. He disliked Hetty's friends extremely; he had never met
  them before; they were a vulgar brace of sinners he thought, and they
  reflected their quality upon her. The war they considered was no concern of
  theirs; they had studio minds. The man was some sort of painter, middle-aged,
  contemptuous, and with far too much hair. He ought to have been past this
  sort of spree. The girl was a model and had never been in Italy before. She
  kept saying, "0, the sky!" until it jarred intolerably. The days are
  notoriously longer on the lake of Orta than anywhere else in the world; from
  ten o'clock in the morning to lunch time is about as long as a week's
  imprisonment; from two to five is twice that length; from five onward the
  course of time at Orta is more normal. Hetty was Hetty, in the tradition of
  Cleopatra, but could Cleopatra hold a young man whose mind was possessed by
  one unquenchable thought that he had been grossly insulted and deranged by an
  exasperating potentate at Potsdam who was making hay of his entire world, and
  that he had to go at once and set things right, and that it was disgraceful
  not to go?</p>

  <p>He broached these ideas to Hetty about eleven o'clock on their first
  morning upon the lake. They were adrift in a big tilted boat in the midst of
  a still, glassy symmetry of mountain-backed scenery and mountain-backed
  reflections, and the other couple was far away, a little white dot at the
  head of a V of wake, rowing ambitiously to the end of the lake.</p>

  <p>"You can't go," said Hetty promptly....</p>

  <p>"But I have come all the way to Italy for you!" cried Hetty....</p>

  <p>This was a perplexing problem for the honour of a young man of one-and-
  twenty. He argued the case&mdash;weakly. He had an audience of one, a very
  compelling one. He decided to remain. In the night he woke up and thought of
  Troop. Old Troop must be in England by now. Perhaps he had already enlisted.
  Ever since their school days he and Troop had had a standing dispute upon
  questions of morals and duty. There was something dull and stiff about old
  Troop that drove a bright antagonist to laxity, but after all&mdash;? Troop
  had cut off clean and straight to his duty.... Because Troop wasn't
  entangled. He had kept clear of all this love-making business.... There was
  something to be said for Troop's point of view after all....</p>

  <p>The second day Peter reopened the question of going as they sat on a stone
  seat under the big, dark trees on the Sacro Monte, and looked out under the
  drooping boughs upon the lake, and Hetty had far more trouble with him. He
  decided he could not leave her. But he spent the hours between tea and dinner
  in reading all the war news he could find&mdash;translating the Italian with
  the aid of a small conversation dictionary. Something had happened in the
  North Sea, he could not make out exactly what it was, but the Germans had
  lost a ship called the <i>Königin Luise</i>, and the British a
  battleship&mdash;was it a battleship?&mdash;the <i>Amphion</i>. Beastly
  serious that!&mdash;a battleship. There was something vague, too, about a
  fleet encounter, but no particulars. It was a bore getting no particulars.
  Here close at hand in the Mediterranean there had been, it was said, a naval
  battle in the Straits of Messina also; the <i>Panther</i> was sunk; and the
  Germans had had a great defeat at Liege. The British army was already landing
  in France....</p>

  <p>Upon his second decision to remain Peter reflected profoundly that
  night.</p>

  <p>The standing dispute between him and Troop upon the lightness or
  seriousness of things sexual returned to his mind. Troop, Peter held,
  regarded all these things with a portentous solemnity, a monstrous
  sentimentality. Peter, Troop maintained, regarded them with a dangerous
  levity. Troop declared that love, "true love," was, next to "honour," the
  most tremendous thing in life; he was emphatic upon "purity." Peter held that
  love was as light and pleasant and incidental a thing as sunshine. You said,
  "Here's a jolly person!" just as you said, "Here's a pretty flower!" There
  had been, he argued, a lot of barbaric "Taboos" in these matters, but the new
  age was dropping all that. He called Troop's idea of purity "ceremonial
  obsession." Both talked very freely of "cleanness" and meant very different
  things: Troop chiefly abstinence and Peter baths. Peter had had the courage
  of his opinions; but once or twice he had doubted secretly whether, after
  all, there weren't defilements beyond the reach of mere physical cleansing.
  One dismissed that sort of thing as "reaction." All these disputes were
  revived now in his memory in the light of this one plain, disconcerting fact:
  Troop had gone straight home to enlist and he himself was still in Italy.
  Weakening of moral fibre? Loss of moral fibre?</p>

  <p>The next day, in the boat, Peter reopened the question of his
  departure.</p>

  <p>"You see, Hetty," he said, "if there was conscription in England&mdash;I
  shouldn't feel so bound to go."</p>

  <p>"But then you would be bound to go."</p>

  <p>"Well, then I could be a decent deserter&mdash;for love's sake. But when
  your country leaves it to you to come back or not as you think
  fit&mdash;then, you know, you're bound&mdash;in honour."</p>

  <p>Hetty dabbled her hand over the side of the boat. "Oh&mdash;<i>go</i>!"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Peter over the oars, and as if ashamed, "I must go&mdash;I
  must. There is a train this afternoon which catches the express at Domo
  d'Ossola."</p>

  <p>He rowed for a while. Presently he stole a glance at Hetty. She was lying
  quite still on her cushion under the tilt, staring at the distant mountains,
  with tears running down her set face. They were real tears. "Three days," she
  said choking, and at that rolled over to weep noisily upon her arms.</p>

  <p>Peter sat over his oars and stared helplessly at her emotion.</p>

  <p>A familiar couplet came into his head, and remained unspoken because of
  its striking inappropriateness:</p>

  <p class="poem">"I could not love thee, dear, so much,<br>
  Loved I not honour more."</p>

  <p>Presently Hetty lay still. Then she sat up and wiped at a tear-stained
  face.</p>

  <p>"If you must go," said Hetty, "you must go. But why you didn't go from
  Brigue!"</p>

  <p>That problem was to exercise Peter's mind considerably in the extensive
  reflections of the next few days and nights.</p>

  <p>"And I have to stick in Italy with those two Bores!"...</p>

  <p>But the easy flexibility of Hetty's temperament was a large part of her
  charm.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you ought to go, Peter," she said, "really. I had no business
  to try and keep you. But I've had so little of you. And I love you."</p>

  <p>She melted. Peter melted in sympathy. But he was much relieved....</p>

  <p>She slipped into his bedroom to help him pack his rucksack, and she went
  with him to the station. "I wish I was a man, too," she said. "Then I would
  come with you. But wars don't last for ever, Peter. We'll come back
  here."</p>

  <p>She watched the train disappear along the curve above the station with
  something like a sense of desolation. Then being a really very stout-hearted
  young woman, she turned about and went down to the telegraph office to see
  what could be done to salvage her rent and shattered holiday.</p>

  <p>And Peter, because of these things, and because of certain delays at Paris
  and Havre, for the train and Channel services were getting badly
  disorganized, got to England six whole days later than Troop.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">This passion of indignation against Germany in which Peter
  enlisted was the prevailing mood of England during the opening months of the
  war. The popular mind had seized upon the idea that Europe had been at peace
  and might have remained at peace indefinitely if it had not been for the
  high-handed behaviour, first of Austria with Serbia, and then of Germany with
  Russia. The belief that on the whole Germany had prepared for and sought this
  war was no doubt correct, and the spirit of the whole nation rose high and
  fine to the challenge. But that did not so completely exhaust the moral
  factors in the case as most English people, including Peter, supposed at that
  time.</p>

  <p>Neither Peter nor Joan, although they were members of the best educated
  class in the community and had been given the best education available for
  that class, had any but the vaguest knowledge of what was going on in the
  political world. They knew practically nothing of what a modern imperial
  system consisted, had but the vaguest ideas of the role of Foreign Office,
  Press and Parliament in international affairs, were absolutely ignorant of
  the direction of the army and navy, knew nothing of the history of Germany or
  Russia during the previous half-century, or the United States since the
  Declaration of Independence, had no inklings of the elements of European
  ethnology, arid had scarcely ever heard such words, for example, as Slovene,
  or Slovak, or Ukrainian. The items of foreign intelligence in the newspapers
  joined on to no living historical conceptions in their minds. Between the
  latest history they had read and the things that happened about them and in
  which they were now helplessly involved, was a gap of a hundred years or
  more; the profound changes in human life and political conditions brought
  about during that hundred years by railways, telegraphs, steam shipping,
  steel castings and the like, were all beyond the scope of their ideas. For
  Joan history meant stories about Joan of Arc, Jane Shore, the wives of Henry
  the Eighth, James I. and his Steenie, Charles the Second, and suchlike
  people, winding up with the memoirs of Madame d'Arblay; Peter had ended his
  historical studies when he went on to the modern side at Caxton&mdash;it
  would have made little difference so far as modern affairs were concerned if
  he had taken a degree in history&mdash;and was chiefly conversant with such
  things as the pedigree of the Electress Sophia of Hanover, the Constitutions
  of Clarendon, the statute of Mortmain, and the claims of Edward the Third and
  Henry the Fifth to the crown of France. Neither of them knew anything at all
  of India except by way of Kipling's stories and the Coronation Durbar
  pictures. If the two of them had rather clearer ideas than most of their
  associates about the recent opening up and partition of Africa it was because
  Oswald had talked about those things. But the jostling for empire that had
  been going on for the past fifty years all over the world, and the succession
  of Imperialist theories from Disraeli to Joseph Chamberlain and from Bismarck
  to Treitschke, had no place in their thoughts. The entente cordiale was a
  phrase of no particular significance to them. The State in which they lived
  had never explained to them in any way its relations to them nor its fears
  and aims in regard to the world about it. It is doubtful, indeed, if the
  State in which they lived possessed the mentality to explain as much even to
  itself.</p>

  <p>How far the best education in America or Germany or any other country was
  better, it is not for us to discuss here, nor how much better education might
  be. This is the story of the minds of Joan and Peter and of how that vast
  system of things hidden, things unanalysed and things misrepresented and
  obscured, the political system of the European "empires" burst out into war
  about them. The sprawling, clumsy, heedless British State, which had troubled
  so little about taking Peter into its confidence, displayed now no hesitation
  whatever in beckoning him home to come and learn as speedily as possible how
  to die for it.</p>

  <p>The tragedy of youth in the great war was a universal tragedy, and if the
  German youths who were now, less freely and more systematically, beating
  Peter by weeks and months in a universal race into uniform, were more
  instructed than he, they were also far more thoroughly misinformed. If Peter
  took hold of the war by the one elemental fact that Belgium had been invaded
  most abominably and peaceful villagers murdered in their own fields, the
  young Germans on the other hand had been trained to a whole system of false
  interpretations. They were assured that they fought to break up a ring of
  threatening enemies. And that the whole thing was going to be the most
  magnificent adventure in history. Their minds had been prepared elaborately
  and persistently for this heroic struggle&mdash;in which they were to win
  easily. They had been made to believe themselves a race of blond aristocrats
  above all the rest of mankind, entitled by their moral and mental worth to
  world dominion. They believed that now they did but come to their own. They
  had been taught all these things from childhood; how could they help but
  believe them?</p>

  <p>Peter arrived, tired and dirty, at Pelham Ford in the early afternoon.
  Oswald and Joan were out, but he bathed and changed while Mrs. Moxton got him
  a belated lunch. As he finished this Joan came into the dining-room from a
  walk.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Petah," she said, with no display of affection.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, Joan."</p>

  <p>"We thought you were never coming."</p>

  <p>"I was in Italy," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"H'm," said Joan, and seemed to reckon in her mind.</p>

  <p>"Nobby is in London," she said. "He thinks he might help about East
  Africa. It's his country practically.... Are you going to enlist?"</p>

  <p>"What else?" said Peter, tapping a cigarette on the table. "It's a beastly
  bore."</p>

  <p>"Bunny's gone," said Joan. "And Wilmington."</p>

  <p>"They've written?"</p>

  <p>"Willy came to see me."</p>

  <p>"Heard from any of the others?"</p>

  <p>"Oh!... Troop."</p>

  <p>"Enlisted?"</p>

  <p>"Cadet."</p>

  <p>"Any one else?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Joan, and hovered whistling faintly for a moment and then
  walked out of the room....</p>

  <p>She had been counting the hours for four days, perplexed by his delay; his
  coming had seemed the greatest event in the world, for she had never doubted
  he would come back to serve, and now that he had come she met him like
  this!</p><br>

  <h3>§ 3</h3>

  <p class="first">They dressed for dinner that night because Oswald came back
  tired and vexed from London and wanted a bath before dining. "They seemed to
  be sending everybody to East Africa on the principle that any one who's been
  there before ought not to go again," he grumbled. "I can't see any other
  principle in it." He talked at first of the coming East African campaign
  because he hesitated to ask Peter what he intended to do. Then he went on to
  the war news. The Germans had got Liege. That was certain now. They had
  smashed the forts to pieces with enormous cannon. There had been a massacre
  of civilians at Dinant. Joan did not talk very much, but sat and watched
  Peter closely with an air of complete indifference.</p>

  <p>There was a change in him, and she could not say exactly what this change
  was. The sunshine and snow glare and wind of the high mountains had tanned
  his face to a hard bronze and he was perceptibly leaner; that made him look
  older perhaps; but the difference was more than that. She knew her Peter so
  well that she could divine a new thought in him.</p>

  <p>"And what are you going to do, Peter t" said Oswald, coming to it
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to enlist."</p>

  <p>"In the ranks, you mean?" Oswald had expected that.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You ought not to do that."</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"You have your cadet corps work behind you. You ought to take a
  commission. We shan't have too many officers."</p>

  <p>Peter considered that.</p>

  <p>"I want to begin in the ranks.... I want discipline."</p>

  <p>(Had some moral miracle happened to Peter? This was quite a new note from
  our supercilious foster brother.)</p>

  <p>"You'll get discipline enough in the cadet corps."</p>

  <p>"I want to begin right down at the bottom of the ladder."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you get a rotten drill sergeant, I'm told, it's
  disagreeable."</p>

  <p>"All the better."</p>

  <p>"They'll find you out and push you into a commission," said Oswald. "If
  not, it's sheer waste."</p>

  <p>"Well, I want to feel what discipline is like&mdash;before I give orders,"
  said Peter. "I want to be told to do things and asked why the devil I haven't
  done 'em smartly. I've been going too easy. The ranks will brace me up."</p>

  <p>(Yes, this was a new note. Had that delay of four or five days anything to
  do with this?... Joan, with a start, discovered that she was holding up the
  dinner, and touched the electric bell at her side for the course to be
  changed.)</p>

  <p>"I suppose we shall all have to brace up," said Oswald. "It still seems a
  little unreal. The French have lost Mülhausen again, they say, but they are
  going strong for Metz. There's not a word about our army. It's just crossed
  over and vanished...."</p>

  <p>(Queer to sit here, dining in the soft candlelight, and to think of the
  crowded roads and deploying troops, the thudding guns and bursting shells
  away there behind that veil of secrecy&mdash;millions of men in France and
  Belgium fighting for the world. And Peter would go off tomorrow. Presently he
  would be in uniform; presently he would be part of a marching column. He
  would go over&mdash;into the turmoil. Beyond that her imagination would not
  pass.)</p>

  <p>"I wish I could enlist," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"They're getting thousands of men more than they can handle as it is,"
  said Oswald. "They don't want you."</p>

  <p>"You'd have thought they'd have had things planned and ready for this,"
  said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Nothing is ready," said Oswald. "Nothing is planned. This war has caught
  our war office fast asleep. It isn't half awake even now."</p>

  <p>"There ought to be something for women to do," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"There ought to be something for every one to do," said Oswald bitterly,
  "but there isn't. This country isn't a State; it's a crowd adrift. Did you
  notice, Peter, as you came through London, the endless multitudes of people
  just standing about? I've never seen London like that before. People not
  walking about their business, but just standing."...</p>

  <p>Peter told of things he had seen on his way home. "The French are in a
  scowling state. All France scowls at you, and Havre is packed with bargains
  in touring cars&mdash;just left about&mdash;by rich people coming
  home...."</p>

  <p>So the talk drifted. And all the time Joan watched Peter as acutely and as
  unsuspectedly as a mother might watch a grown-up son. Tomorrow morning he
  would go off and join up. But it wasn't that which made him grave. New
  experiences always elated Peter. And he wouldn't be afraid; not he.... She
  had been let into the views of three other young men who had gone to war
  already; Troop had written, correctly and consciously heroic, "<i>Some of the
  chaps seem to be getting a lot of emotion into it,</i>" said Troop. "<i>It's
  nothing out of the way that I can see. One just falls into the line of one's
  uncles and cousins.</i>"</p>

  <p>Wilmington had said: "I just wanted to see you, Joan. I'm told I'll be
  most useful as a gunner because of my mathematics. When it comes to going
  over, you won't forget to think of me, Joan?"</p>

  <p>Joan answered truthfully. "I'll think of you a lot, Billy."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing in life like you, Joan," said Wilmington in his white
  expressionless way. "Well, I suppose I'd better be going."</p>

  <p>But Bunny had discoursed upon fear.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I've enlisted," he wrote, "chiefly because I'm afraid of
  going Pacifist right out&mdash;out of funk. But it's hell, Joan. I'm afraid
  in my "bones. I hate bangs, and they say the row of modern artillery is
  terrific. I've never seen a dead body, a human dead body, I mean, ever. Have
  you? I would go round a quarter of a mile out of my way any time to dodge a
  butcher's shop. I was sick when I found Peter dissecting a rabbit. You know,
  sick, à la Manche. No metaphors. I shall run away, I know I shall run away.
  But we've got to stop these beastly Germans anyhow. It isn't killing the
  Germans I shall mind&mdash;I'm fierce on Germans, Joan; but seeing the chaps
  on stretchers or lying about with all sorts of horrible injuries."</p>

  <p>Sheets of that sort of thing, written in an unusually bad
  handwriting&mdash;apparently rather to comfort himself than to sustain
  Joan.</p>

  <p>Well, it wasn't Peter's way to think beforehand of being "on stretchers or
  lying about," but Bunny's scribblings had got the stretchers into Joan's
  thoughts. And it made her wish somehow that Peter, instead of being unusually
  grave and choosing to be a ranker, was taking this job with his usual easy
  confidence and going straight and gaily for a commission.</p>

  <p>After dinner they all sat out in garden chairs, outside the library
  window, and had their coffee and smoked. Joan got her chair and drew it close
  to Peter's. Two hundred miles away and less was battle and slaughter, perhaps
  creeping nearer to them, the roaring of great guns, the rattle of rifle fire,
  the hoarse shouts of men attacking, and a gathering harvest of limp figures
  "on stretchers and lying about"; but that evening at Pelham Ford was a globe
  of golden serenity. Not a leaf stirred, and only the little squeaks and
  rustlings of small creatures that ran and flitted in the dusk ruffled the
  quiet air.</p>

  <p>Oswald made Peter talk of his climbing. "My only mountain is Kilimanjaro,"
  he said. "No great thing so far as actual climbing goes." Peter had begun
  with the Dolomites, had gone over to Adelboden, and then worked round by the
  Concordia Hut to Bel Alp. "Was it very beautiful?" asked Joan softly under
  his elbow.</p>

  <p>"You could have done it all. I wish you had come," said Peter.</p>

  <p>There was a pause.</p>

  <p>"And Italy?" said Joan, still more softly.</p>

  <p>"Where did you go in Italy, Peter?" said Oswald, picking up her
  question.</p>

  <p>Peter gave a travel-book description of Orta and the Isle of San
  Giulio.</p>

  <p>Joan sat as still and watchful as a little cat watching for a mouse.
  (Something had put Peter out in Italy.)</p>

  <p>"It's off the main line," said Peter. "The London and Paris papers don't
  arrive, and one has to fall back on the <i>Corriere della Sera</i>."</p>

  <p>"Very good paper too," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"News doesn't seem so real in a language you don't understand."</p>

  <p>He was excusing himself. So he was ashamed to that extent. That was what
  was bothering him. One might have known he wouldn't care for&mdash;those
  other things....</p>

  <p>Late that night Joan sat in her room thinking. Presently she unlocked her
  writing-desk and took out and re-read a letter. It was from Huntley in
  Cornwall, and it was very tender and passionate. "<i>The world has gone mad,
  dearest,</i>" it ran; "<i>but we need not go mad. The full moon is slipping
  by. I lay out on the sands last night praying for you to come, trying to will
  you to come. Oh&mdash;when are you coming?</i>"...</p>

  <p>And much more to the same effect....</p>

  <p>Joan's face hardened. "Po'try," she said. She took a sharpened pencil from
  the glass tray upon her writing-table and regarded it. The pencil was finely
  pointed&mdash;too finely pointed. She broke off the top with the utmost care
  and tested the blunt point on her blotting-paper to see if it was broad
  enough for her purpose. Then she scrawled her reply across his
  letter&mdash;in five words: "<i>You ought to enlist. Joan,</i>" and addressed
  an envelope obliquely in the same uncivil script.</p>

  <p>After which she selected sundry other letters and a snapshot giving a not
  unfavourable view of Huntley from her desk, and having scrutinized the latter
  for an interval, tore them all carefully into little bits and dropped them
  into her wastepaper basket. She stood regarding these fragments for some
  time. "I might have gone to him," she whispered at last, and turned away.</p>

  <p>She blew out her candle, hesitated by her bedside, and walked to the open
  window to watch the moon rise.</p>

  <p>She sat upon her window-sill like a Joan of marble for a long time. Then
  she produced one of those dark sayings with which she was wont to wrap rather
  than express her pro-founder thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Queer how suddenly one discovers at last what one has known all along....
  Queer....</p>

  <p>"Well, <i>I</i> know anyhow."...</p>

  <p>She stood up at last and yawned. "But I don't like war," said Joan.
  "Stretchers! Or lying about! Groaning. In the darkness. Boys one has danced
  with. Oh! beastly. <i>Beastly</i>!"</p>

  <p>She forgot her intention of undressing, put her foot on the sill, and
  rested chin on fist and elbow on knee, scowling out at the garden as though
  she saw things that she did not like there.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">So it was that Joan saw the beginning of the great winnowing
  of mankind, and Peter carne home in search of his duty.</p>

  <p>Within the first month of the war nearly every one of the men in Joan's
  world had been spun into the vortex; hers was so largely a world of young or
  unattached people, with no deep roots in business or employment to hold them
  back. Even Oswald at last, in spite of many rebuffs, found a use for himself
  in connection with a corps of African labourers behind the front, and
  contrived after a steady pressure of many months towards the danger zone, to
  get himself wounded while he was talking to some of his dear Masai at an
  ammunition dump. A Hun raider dropped a bomb, and some flying splinters of
  wood cut him deeply and extensively. The splinters were vicious splinters;
  there were complications; and he found himself back at Pelham Ford before the
  end of 1916, aged by ten years. The Woman's Legion captured Joan from the
  date of its formation, and presently had her driving a car for the new
  Ministry of Munitions, which came into existence in the middle of 1915.</p>

  <p>Her career as a chauffeuse was a brilliant one. She lived, after the free
  manner of the Legion, with Miss Jepson at Hampstead; she went down every
  morning to her work, she drove her best and her best continually improved, so
  that she became distinguished among her fellows. The Ministry grew aware of
  her and proud of her. A time arrived when important officials quarrelled to
  secure her for their journeys. Eminent foreign visitors invariably found
  themselves behind her.</p>

  <p>"But she drives like a man," they would say, a little breathlessly, after
  some marvellously skidded corner.</p>

  <p>"All our girls drive like this," the Ministry of Munitions would remark,
  carelessly, loyally, but untruthfully.</p>

  <p>Joan's habitual wear became khaki; she had puttees and stout boots and
  little brass letterings upon her shoulders and sleeves, arid the only
  distinctive touches she permitted herself were the fur of her overcoat collar
  and a certain foppery about her gauntlets....</p>

  <p>Extraordinary and profound changes of mood and relationship occurred in
  the British mind during those first two years of the war, and reflected
  themselves upon the minds of Joan and Peter. To begin with, and for nearly a
  year, there was a quality of spectacularity about the war for the British.
  They felt it to be an immense process and a vitally significant process; they
  read, they talked, they thought of little else; but it was not yet felt to be
  an intimateness. The habit of detachment was too deeply ingrained. Great
  Britain was an island of onlookers. To begin with the war seemed like
  something tremendous and arresting going on in an arena. "Business as usual,"
  said the business man, putting up the price of anything the country seemed to
  need. There was a profound conviction that British life and the British
  community were eternal things; they might play a part&mdash;a considerable
  part&mdash;in these foreign affairs; they might even have to struggle, but it
  was inconceivable that they should change or end. September and October in
  1914 saw an immense wave of volunteer enthusiasm&mdash;enthusiasm for the
  most part thwarted and wasted by the unpreparedness of the authorities for
  anything of the sort, but it was the enthusiasm of an audience eager to go on
  the stage; it was not the enthusiasm of performers in the arena and unable to
  quit the arena, fighting for life or death. To secure any sort of official
  work was to step out of the undistinguished throng. In uniform one felt
  dressed up and part of the pageant. Young soldiers were self-conscious in
  those early days, and inclined to pose at the ordinary citizen. The ordinary
  citizen wanted to pat young soldiers on the back and stand them drinks out of
  his free largesse. They were "in it," he felt, and he at most was a patron of
  the affair.</p>

  <p>That spectacularity gave way to a sense of necessary participation only
  very slowly indeed. The change began as the fresh, bright confidence that the
  Battle of the Marne had begotten gave place to a deepening realization of the
  difficulties on the road to any effective victory. The persuasion spread from
  mind to mind that if Great Britain was to fight this war as she had lived
  through sixty years of peace, the gentleman amateur among the nations, she
  would lose this war. The change of spirit that produced its first marked
  result in the creation of the Ministry of Munitions with a new note of quite
  unofficial hustle, and led on through a series of inevitable steps to the
  adoption of conscription, marks a real turning about of the British mind, the
  close of a period of chaotic freedom almost unprecedented in the history of
  communities. It was the rediscovery of the State as the necessary form into
  which the individual life must fit.</p>

  <p>To the philosophical historian of the future the efforts of governing and
  leading people in Great Britain to get wills together, to explain
  necessities, to supplement the frightful gaps in the education of every class
  by hastily improvised organizations, by speeches, press-campaigns, posters,
  circulars, cinema shows, parades and proclamations; hasty, fitful,
  ill-conducted and sometimes dishonestly conducted appeals though they were,
  will be far more interesting than any story of battles and campaigns. They
  remind one of a hand scrambling in the dark for something long neglected and
  now found to be vitally important; they are like voices calling in a dark
  confusion. They were England seeking to comprehend herself and her situation
  after the slumber of two centuries. But to people like Joan and Peter, who
  were not philosophical historians, the process went on, not as a process, but
  as an apparently quite disconnected succession of events. Imperceptibly their
  thoughts changed and were socialized. Joan herself had no suspicion of the
  difference in orientation between the Joan who stood at her bedroom window in
  August, 1914, the most perfect spectator of life, staring out at the darkness
  of the garden, dumbly resenting the call that England was making upon the
  free lives of all her friends, and the Joan of 1917, in khaki and a
  fur-collared coat, who slung a great car with a swift, unerring confidence
  through the London traffic and out to Woolwich or Hendon or Waltham or
  Aldershot or Chelmsford or what not, keen and observant of the work her
  passengers discussed, a conscious part now of a great and growing
  understanding and criticism and will, of a rediscovered unity, which was
  England&mdash;awakening.</p>

  <p>Youth grew wise very fast in those tremendous years. From the simple and
  spectacular acceptance of every obvious appearance, the younger minds passed
  very rapidly to a critical and intricate examination. In the first blaze of
  indignation against Germany, in the first enthusiasm, there was a disposition
  to trust and confide in every one in a position of authority and
  responsibility. The War Office was supposed&mdash;against every
  possibility&mdash;to be planning wisely and acting rapidly; the wisdom of the
  Admiralty was taken for granted, the politicians now could have no end in
  view but victory. It was assumed that Sir Edward Carson could become
  patriotic, Lord Curzon self-forgetful, Mr. Asquith energetic, and Mr. Lloyd
  George straightforward. It was indeed a phase of extravagant idealism.
  Throughout the opening weeks of the war there was an appearance, there was
  more than an appearance, of a common purpose and a mutual confidence. The
  swift response of the Irish to the call of the time, the generous loyalty of
  India, were like intimations of a new age. The whole Empire was uplifted; a
  flush of unwonted splendour suffused British affairs.</p>

  <p>Then the light faded again. There was no depth of understanding to sustain
  it; habit is in the long run a more powerful thing than even the supremest
  need. In a little time all the inglorious characteristics of Britain at
  peace, the double-mindedness, the slackness, were reappearing through the
  glow of warlike emotion. Fifty years of under-education are not to be atoned
  for in a week of crisis. The men in power were just the same men. The
  inefficient were still inefficient; the individualists still self-seeking.
  The party politicians forgot their good resolutions, and reverted to their
  familiar intrigues and manoeuvres. Redmond and Ireland learnt a bitter lesson
  of the value of generosity in the face of such ignorant and implacable
  antagonists as the Carsonites. Britain, it became manifest, had neither the
  greatness of education nor yet the simplicity of will to make war brilliantly
  or to sustain herself splendidly. At every point devoted and able people
  found themselves baffled by the dull inertias of the old system. And the
  clear flame of enthusiasm that blazed out from the youth of the country at
  the first call of the war was coloured more and more by disillusionment as
  that general bickering which was British public life revived again, and a
  gathering tale of waste, failure, and needless suffering mocked the
  reasonable expectation of a swift and glorious victory.</p>

  <p>The change in the thought and attitude of the youth of Britain is to be
  found expressed very vividly in the war poetry of the successive years. Such
  glowing young heroes as Julian Grenfell and Rupert Brooke shine with a faith
  undimmed; they fight consciously, confident of the nearness of victory; they
  sing and die in what they believe to be a splendid cause and for a splendid
  end. An early death in the great war was not an unmitigated misfortune. Three
  years later the young soldier's mind found a voice in such poetry as that of
  young Siegfried Sassoon, who came home from the war with medals and honours
  only to denounce the war in verse of the extremest bitterness. His song is no
  longer of picturesque nobilities and death in a glorious cause; it is a cry
  of anger at the old men who have led the world to destruction; of anger
  against the dull, ignorant men who can neither make war nor end war; the men
  who have lost the freshness and simplicity but none of the greed and egotism
  of youth. Germany is no longer the villain of the piece. Youth turns upon
  age, upon laws and institutions, upon the whole elaborate rottenness of the
  European system, saying: "<i>What is this to which you have brought us? What
  have you done with our lives?</i>"</p>

  <p>No story of these years can ever be true that does not pass under a
  shadow. Of the little group of youths and men who have figured in this story
  thus far, there was scarcely one who was not either killed outright or
  crippled or in some way injured in the Great War&mdash;excepting only
  Huntley. Huntley developed a deepening conscience against warfare as the war
  went on, and suffered nothing worse than some unpleasant half-hours with
  Tribunals and the fatigues of agricultural labour. Death, which had first
  come to Joan as a tragic end to certain "kittays," was now the familiar
  associate of her every friend. Her confidence in the safety of the world, in
  the wisdom of human laws and institutions, in the worth and dignity of
  empires and monarchs, and the collective sanity of mankind was withdrawn as a
  veil is withdrawn, from the harsh realities of life.</p>

  <p>Wilmington, with his humourless intensity, was one of the first to bring
  home to her this disillusionment and tragedy of the youth of the world. He
  liked pure mathematics; it was a subject in which he felt comfortable. He had
  worked well in the first part of the mathematical tripos, and he was working
  hard in the second part when the war broke out. He fluctuated for some days
  between an utter repudiation of all war and an immediate enlistment, and it
  was probably the light and colour of Joan in his mind that made Wilmington a
  warrior. War was a business of killing, he decided, and what he had to do was
  to apply himself and his mathematics to gunnery as efficiently as possible,
  learning as rapidly as might be all that was useful about shells, guns and
  explosives, and so get to the killing of Germans thoroughly, expeditiously,
  and abundantly. He was a particularly joyless young officer, white-faced and
  intent, with an appearance of scorn that presently developed from appearance
  into reality, for most of his colleagues. He was working as hard and as well
  as he could. At first with incredulity and then with disgust he realized that
  the ordinary British officer not doing so. They sang songs, they ragged, they
  left things to chance, they thought blunders funny, they condoned silliness
  and injustice in the powers above. He would not sing nor rag nor drink. He
  worked to the verge of exhaustion. But this exemplary conduct, oddly enough,
  did not make him unpopular either with the junior officers or with his
  seniors. The former tolerated him and rather admired him; the latter put work
  upon him and sought to promote him.</p>

  <p>In quite a little while as it seemed&mdash;for in those days, while each
  day seemed long and laborious and heavy, yet the weeks and months passed
  swiftly&mdash;he was a captain in France, and before the end of 1915 he wrote
  to say that his major had left him practically in command of his battery for
  three weeks. He had been twice slightly wounded by that time, but he got
  little leisure because he was willing and indispensable.</p>

  <p>He wrote to Joan very regularly. He was a motherless youth, and Joan was
  not only his great passion but his friend and confidante. His interest in his
  work overflowed into his letters; they were more and more about gunnery and
  the art of war, which became at last, it would seem, a serious rival to Joan
  in his affections. He described ill, but he would send her reasoned
  statements of unanswerable views. He could riot understand why considerations
  that were so plain as to be almost obvious, were being universally
  disregarded by the Heads and the War Office. He appealed to Joan to read what
  he had to say, and tell him whether he or the world was mad. When he came
  back on leave in the spring of 1916, she was astonished to find that he was
  still visibly as deeply in love with her as ever. The fact of it was he had
  words for his gunnery and military science, but he. had no words, and that
  was the essence of his misfortune, for his love for Joan.</p>

  <p>But the burthen of his story was bitter disillusionment at the levity with
  which his country could carry on a war that must needs determine the whole
  future of mankind. He would write out propositions of this sort: "It is
  manifest that success in warfare depends upon certain primary factors, of
  which generalship is one. No country resolute to win a war will spare any
  effort to find the best men, and make them its generals and leaders
  irrespective of every other consideration. No honourable patriots will permit
  generals to be appointed by any means except the <i>best selective
  methods</i>, and no one who cares for his country will obstruct (1) the
  <i>promotion</i>, (2) <i>trying over</i>, and (3) <i>prompt removal</i>, if
  they fail to satisfy the most exacting tests, of all possible men. And next
  consider what sort of men will be the best commanders. They must be
  <i>fresh-minded young men</i>. All the great generals of the world, the
  supreme cases, the Alexanders, Napoleons, and so on, have shown their quality
  before thirty even in the days when strategy and tactics did not change very
  greatly from year to year, and now when the material and expedients of war
  make warfare practically <i>a new thing</i> every few years, the need for
  fresh young commanders is far more urgent than ever it has been. But the
  British army is at present commanded by oldish men who are manifestly of not
  more than mediocre intelligence, and who have no knowledge of this new sort
  of war that has arisen. It is a war of guns and infantry&mdash;with
  aeroplanes coming in more and more&mdash;and most of the higher positions are
  held by cavalry officers; the artillery is invariably commanded by men unused
  to the handling of such heavy guns as we are using, who stick far behind our
  forward positions and decline any practical experience of our difficulties.
  They put us in the wrong positions, they move us about absurdly; young
  officers have had to work out most of the problems of gun-pits and so forth
  for themselves&mdash;against resistance and mere stupid interference from
  above. The Heads have no idea of the kind of work we do or of the kind of
  work we could do. They are worse than amateurs; they are unteachable fossils.
  But why is this sot If the country is serious about the war, why does it
  permit it? If the Government is serious about the war, why does it permit it?
  If the War Office is serious about the war, why does it permit it? If G.H.Q.
  is serious about the war, why does it permit it? What is wrong? There is a
  hitch here I don't understand. Am I over-serious, and is all this war really
  some sort of gross, grim joke, Joan? Do I take life too seriously?</p>

  <p>"Joan, in this last push this battery did its little job right; we cut all
  the wire opposite us and blew out every blessed stake. We made a nice tidy
  clean up. It was quite easy to do, given hard work. If I hadn't done it I
  ought either to have been shot for neglect or dismissed for incapacity. But
  on our left it wasn't done. Well, there were at least a hundred poor devils
  of our infantrymen on that wire, a hundred mothers' sons, hanging like rags
  on it or crumpled up below. I saw them. It made me sick. And I saw the chap
  who was chiefly responsible for that, Major Clutterwell, a little bit
  screwed, being the life and soul of a little party in Hazebrouck three days
  after! He ought to have been the life and soul of a hari kari party, but
  either he is too big a cad or too big a fool&mdash;or both. The way they shy
  away our infantrymen over here is damnable. They are the finest men in the
  world, I'm convinced; they will go at anything, and the red tabs send them
  into impossible jobs, fail to back them up&mdash;always they fail to back
  them up; they neglect them, Joan; they neglect them even when they are
  fighting and dying! There are men here, colonels, staff officers, I would
  like to beat about the head with an iron bar...."</p>

  <p>This was an unusually eloquent passage. Frequently his letters were mainly
  diagram to show for example how we crowded batteries to brass away at right
  angles to the trenches when we ought to enfilade them, or some such point.
  Sometimes he was trying to establish profound truths about the proper
  functions of field guns and howitzers. For a time he was gnawing a bitter
  grievance. "I was told to shell a line I couldn't reach. The contours
  wouldn't allow of it. You can do a lot with a shell, but you cannot make it
  hop slightly and go round a corner. There is a definite limit to the height
  to which a gun will lob a shell. I tried to explain these elementary
  limitations of gunfire through the telephone, and I was told I should be put
  under arrest if I did not obey orders. I wasn't up against a commander, I
  wasn't up against an intelligence; I was up against a silly old man in a
  temper. So I put over a barrage about fifty yards beyond the path&mdash;the
  nearest possible. Every one was perfectly satisfied&mdash;the Boche included.
  Thus it is that the young officer is subdued to the medium he works in."</p>

  <p>At times Wilmington would embark on a series of propositions to
  demonstrate with mathematical certitude that if the men and material wasted
  at Loos had been used in the Dardanelles, the war would have been decided by
  the end of 1915. But the topic to which his mind recurred time after time was
  the topic of efficient leadership. "Modern war demands continuity of idea,
  continuity of will, and continuous progressive adaptation of means and
  methods," he wrote&mdash;in two separate letters. In the second of these he
  had got on to a fresh notion." Education in England is a loafer education; it
  does not point to an end; it does not drive through; it does not produce
  minds that can hold out through a long effort. The young officers come out
  here with the best intentions in the world, but one's everyday life is shaped
  not by our intentions but our habits. Their habits of mind are loafing
  habits. They learnt to loaf at school. Caxton, I am now convinced, is one of
  the best schools in England; but even at Caxton we did not fully acquire the
  <i>habit of steadfast haste</i> which modern life demands. Everything that
  gets done out here is done by a spurt. With the idea behind it of presently
  doing nothing. The ordinary state of everybody above the non-commissioned
  ranks is loafing. At the present moment my major is shooting pheasants; the
  batteries to the left of us are cursing because they have to shift&mdash;it
  holds up their scheme for a hunt. Just as though artillery work wasn't the
  most intense sport in the world&mdash;especially now that we are going to
  have kite balloons and do really scientific observing. Even the conscientious
  men of the Kitchener-Byng school don't really seem to me to get on; they work
  like Trojans at established and routine stuff but they don't keep up inquiry.
  They are human, all too human. Man is a sedentary animal, and the
  schoolmaster exists to prevent his sitting down comfortably," This from
  Wilmington without a suspicion of jesting. "This human weakness for just
  living can only be corrected in schools. The more I scheme about increasing
  efficiency out here, the more I realize that it can't be done here, that one
  has to go right back to the schools and begin with a <i>more continuous
  urge</i>. When this war is over I shall try to be a schoolmaster. I shall
  hate it most of the time, but then I hate most things...."</p>

  <p>But Wilmington never became a schoolmaster. He got a battery of six-inch
  guns just before the Somme push in 1916, and he went forward with them into
  positions he chose and built up very carefully, only to be shifted against
  his wishes almost at once to a new and, he believed, an altogether inferior
  position. He was blown to nothingness by a German shell while he was
  constructing a gun pit.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">Wilmington was not the first of Joan's little company to be
  killed. Joan had the gift of friendship. She was rare among girls in that
  respect. She was less of an artist in egotism than most of her
  contemporaries; there were even times when she could be self-forgetful to the
  pitch of untidiness. Two other among that handful of young soldiers who were
  killed outright and who had been her friends, wrote to her with some
  regularity right up to the times of their deaths, and found a comfort in
  doing so. They wrote to her at first upon neat notepaper adorned with
  regimental crests, but their later letters as they worked their slow passages
  towards the place of death were pencilled on thin paper. She kept them all.
  She felt she could have been a good sister to many brothers.</p>

  <p>One of these two who died early was Winterbaum. She did not hear from this
  young man of the world for some weeks after the declaration of war. Then came
  a large photograph of himself in cavalry uniform, and a manly, worldly letter
  strongly reminiscent of Kipling and anticipatory of Gilbert Frankau. "There
  is something splendid about this life after all," he wrote. "It's good to be
  without one's little luxuries for a space, democratically undistinguished
  among one's fellows. It's good to harden up until nothing seems able to
  bruise one any more. I bathed yesterday, without water, Joan&mdash;just a dry
  towel, and that not over clean&mdash;was all that was available. After this
  is all over I shall have such an appetite for luxury&mdash;I shall be fierce,
  Joan."</p>

  <p>Those early days were still days of unrestricted plenty, and the
  disposition of the British world was to pet and indulge everything in khaki.
  Young Winterbaum wore his spurs and the most beautiful riding-breeches to
  night clubs and great feasts in the more distinguished restaurants. He took
  his car about with him, his neat little black-and-white car, fitted with
  ivory fopperies. He tried hard to take it with him to Prance. From France his
  scribbled letters became more and more heroic in tone. "Poor David has been
  done in," he said. "I am now only three from the Contango peerage. Heaven
  send I get no nearer! No Feudal dignities for me. I would give three gilded
  chambers at any time for one reasonably large and well-lit studio.
  And&mdash;I have a kind of affection for my cousins."</p>

  <p>His prayer was answered. He got no nearer to the Contango peerage. The
  powers above him decided that a little place called Loos was of such
  strategic value to the British army as to be worth the lives of a great
  number of young men, and paid in our generous British fashion even more than
  the estimate. Winterbaum was part of the price. No particulars of his death
  ever came to Joan and Peter. The attack began brightly, and then died away.
  There was a failure to bring up reserves and grasp opportunity. Winterbaum
  vanished out of life in the muddle&mdash;one of thousands. He was the first
  of the little company of Joan's friends to be killed.</p>

  <p>Bunny Cuspard spread a less self-conscious, more western, and altogether
  more complicated psychology before Joan's eyes. Like Wilmington he had
  faltered at the outset of the war between enlistment and extreme pacifism,
  but unlike Wilmington he had never reconciled himself to his decision. Bunny
  was out of sympathy with the fierceness of mankind; he wanted a kindly,
  prosperous, rather funny world where there is nothing more cruel than gossip;
  that was the world In* was fitted for. He repeated in his own person and
  quality the tragedy of Anatole France. He wanted to assure the world and
  himself that at heart everything was quite right and magnificent fun, to
  laugh gaily at everything, seeing through its bristling hostilities into the
  depth of genial absurdity beneath.</p>

  <p>And so often he could find no genial absurdity.</p>

  <p>He had always pretended that discovering novel sorts of cakes for his teas
  or new steps for dances was the really serious business of life. One of his
  holiday amusements had been "Little Wars," which he played with toy soldiers
  and little model houses and miniature woods of twigs and hills of boarding in
  a big room at his Limpsfield home. He would have vacation parties for days to
  carry out these wars, and he and his guests conducted them with a tremendous
  seriousness. He had elaborated his miniature battle scenery more and more,
  making graveyards, churches, inns, walls, fences&mdash;even sticking absurd
  notices and advertisements upon the walls, and writing epitaphs upon his
  friends in the graveyard. He had loved the burlesque of it. He had felt that
  it brought history into a proper proportion to humour. But one of the
  drawbacks had always been that as the players lay upon the floor to move
  their soldiers and guns about they crushed down his dear little toy houses
  and woods....</p>

  <p>His mind still fought desperately to see the war as a miniature.</p>

  <p>He got to a laugh ever and again by a great effort, but some of the things
  that haunted his imagination would not under any circumstances dissolve in
  laughter. Things that other people seemed to hear only to dismiss remained to
  suppurate in his mind. One or two of the things that were most oppressive to
  him he never told Joan. But she had a glimpse now and then of what was there,
  through the cracks in his laughter.</p>

  <p>He had heard a man telling a horrible story of the opening bombardment of
  Ypres by the Germans. The core of the story was a bricked tunnel near the old
  fortifications of the town, whither a crowd of refugees had fled from the
  bombardment, and into which a number of injured people had been carried. A
  shell exploded near the exit and imprisoned all those people in a half-light
  without any provisions or help. There was not even drinking-water for the
  wounded. A ruptured drain poured a foul trickle across the slimy floor on
  which the wounded and exhausted lay. Now quite near and now at a distance the
  shells were still bursting, and through that thudding and uproar, above all
  the crouching and murmuring distresses of that pit of misery sounded the low,
  clear, querulous voice of a little girl who was talking as she died, talking-
  endlessly of how she suffered, of how her sister could not come to help her,
  of her desire to be taken away; a little, scolding indignant spirit she was,
  with a very clear explicit sense of the vast impropriety of everything about
  her.</p>

  <p>"Why does not some one come?"</p>

  <p>"Be tranquil," an old woman's voice remonstrated time after time. "Help
  will come."</p>

  <p>But for most of the people in the tunnel help never came. Through a slow,
  unhurrying night of indescribable pain and discomfort, in hunger, darkness,
  and an evil stench, their lives ebbed away one by one....</p>

  <p>That dark, dreadful, stinking place, quivering to the incessant thunder of
  guns, sinking through twilight into night, lit by flashes and distant flames,
  and passing through an eternity of misery to a cold, starving dawn, threaded
  by the child's shrill voice, took a pitiless grip upon Bunny's imagination.
  He could neither mitigate it nor forget it.</p>

  <p>How could one laugh at the Kaiser with this rankling in his mind? He could
  not fit it into any merry scheme of things, and he could not bear any scheme
  that was not merry; and not to be able to fit dreadful things into a scheme
  that does at last prevail over them was, for such a mind as Bunny's, to begin
  to drift from sanity.</p>

  <p>The second story that mutely reinforced the shrill indictment of that
  little Belgian girl was a description he had heard of some poor devil being
  shot for cowardice at dawn. A perplexed, stupid youth of two- or
  three-and-twenty, with little golden hairs that gleamed on a pallid cheek,
  was led out to a heap of empty ammunition boxes in a desolate and mutilated
  landscape of mud and splintered trees under a leaden sky, and set down on a
  box to die. It was as if Bunny had seen that living body with his own eyes,
  the body that jumped presently to the impact of the bullets and lurched
  forward, and how the officer in command&mdash;who had been himself but a
  little child in a garden a dozen years or more ago&mdash;came up to the
  pitiful prostrate form and put his revolver to the head behind the ear that
  would never hear again and behind the eye that stared and glazed, and pulled
  the trigger "to make sure."</p>

  <p>Bunny could feel that revolver behind his own ear. It felt as a dental
  instrument feels in the mouth.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" cried Bunny; "oh, my God!" starting up from his sack of
  straw on the floor in his billet in the middle of the night.</p>

  <p>"Oh! <i>shut</i> it!" said the man who was trying to sleep beside him.</p>

  <p>"Sorry!" said Bunny.</p>

  <p>"You keep it for the Germans, mate."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Oh! If I could kill this damned Kaiser with ten thousand torments!"
  whispered Bunny, quieting down....</p>

  <p>These were not the only stories that tormented Bunny's mind, but they were
  the chief ones. Others came in and went again&mdash;stories of the sufferings
  of wounded men, of almost incredible brutalities done to women and children
  and helpless people, and of a hundred chance reasonless horrors; they came in
  with an effect of support and confirmation to these two principal
  figures&mdash;the shrill little girl making her bitter complaint against God
  arid the world which had promised to take care of her, and had scared her
  horribly and torn her limbs and thrust her, thirsty and agonized, into a
  stinking drain to die; and the poor puzzled lout, caught and condemned, who
  had to die so dingily and submissively because his heart had failed him.
  Against the grim instances of their sombre and squalid fates the soul of
  Bunny battled whenever, by night or day, thought overtook him in his
  essential and characteristic resolve to see life as "fun"&mdash;as "great
  fun."</p>

  <p>These two fellow-sufferers in life took possession of his imagination
  because of their intense kindred with himself. So far as he got his riddle
  clear it was something after this fashion: "Why, if the world is like this,
  why are we in it? What am I doing in this nightmare? Why are there little
  girls and simple louts&mdash;and me?"</p>

  <p>The days drew near when he would have to go to the front. He wrote
  shamelessly to Joan of his dread of that experience.</p>

  <p class="letter">"It's the mud and dirtiness and ugliness," he said. "I am a
  domestic cat, Joan &mdash;an indoor cat....</p>

  <p class="letter">"I've got a Pacifist temperament....</p>

  <p class="letter">"All the same, Joan, the Germans started this war. If we
  don't beat them, they will start others. They are intolerable
  brutes&mdash;the Junkers, anyhow. Until we get them down they will go on
  kicking mankind in the stomach. It is their idea of dignified behaviour. But
  we are casting our youth before swine.... Why aren't there more assassins in
  the world? Why can't we kill them by machinery&mdash; painlessly and cleanly?
  We ought to be cleverer than they are."</p>

  <p>There was extraordinarily little personal fear in Bunny. He was not nearly
  so afraid of the things that would happen to him as of the things that would
  happen about him. He hated the smashing even of inanimate things; a
  broken-down chair or a roofless shed was painful to him. Whenever he thought
  of the trenches he thought of treading and slipping in the dark on a torn and
  still living body....</p>

  <p>He stuck stoutly to his reasoning that England had to fight and that he
  had to fight; but hidden from Joan, hidden from every living soul, he kept a
  secret resolve. It was, he knew, an entirely illogical and treasonable
  resolve, and yet he found it profoundly comforting. He would never fire his
  rifle so that it would hurt any one even by chance, and he would never use
  his bayonet. He would go over the top with the best of them, and carry his
  weapons and shout.</p>

  <p>If it came to close fighting he would go for a man with his hands and try
  to disarm him.</p>

  <p>But this resolve was never put to the test. The Easter newspapers of 1916
  arrived with flaming headlines about an insurrection in Dublin and the
  seizure of the Post Office by the rebels. Oddly enough, this did not shock
  Bunny at all. It produced none of the effect of horror and brutality that the
  German invasion of Belgium had made upon his mind. It impressed him as a
  "rag"; as the sort of rag that they got up to at Cambridge during seasons of
  excitement. He was delighted by the seizure of the Post Office, by the
  appearance of a revolutionary flag and the issue of Republican stamps. It was
  as good as "Little Wars"; it was "Little Revolutions." He didn't like the way
  they had shot a policeman outside Trinity College, but perhaps that report
  wasn't true. The whole affair had restored that flavour of adventure and
  burlesque that he had so sadly missed from the world since the war began.</p>

  <p>He had always idealized the Irish character as the pleasantest combination
  of facetiousness and generosity. When he found himself part of a draft
  crossing to Dublin with his back to the grim war front, his spirits rose. He
  could forget that nightmare for a time. He was going to a land of wit and
  laughter which had rebelled for a lark. He felt sure that the joke would end
  happily and that he would be shaking hands with congenial spirits still
  wearing Sinn Fein badges before a fortnight was out. Perhaps he would come
  upon Mrs. O'Grady or Patrick Lynch, whom he had been accustomed to meet at
  the Sheldricks'. He had heard they were in it. And when the whole business
  had ended brightly and cheerfully then all those clever and witty people
  would grow grave and helpful, and come back with him to join in that
  temporarily neglected task of fighting on the western front against an iron
  brutality that threatened to overwhelm the world.</p>

  <p>He was still in this cheerful vein two days later as he was crossing St.
  Stephen's Green. His quaint, amiable face was smiling pleasantly and he was
  marching with a native ungainliness that no drill-sergeant could ever
  overcome, when something hit him very hard in the middle of the body.</p>

  <p>He knew immediately that he had been shot.</p>

  <p>He was not dismayed or shocked by this, but tremendously interested.</p>

  <p>All other feelings were swamped in his surprise at a curious
  contradiction. He had felt hit behind, he was convinced he had been hit
  behind, but what was queer about it was that he was spinning round as though
  he had been hit in front. It gave him a preposterous drunken feeling. His
  head was quite clear, but he was altogether incapable of controlling these
  spinning legs of his, which were going round backward. His facile sense of
  humour was aroused. It was really quite funny to be spinning backwards in
  this way. It was like a new step in dancing. His hilarity increased. It was
  like the maddest dancing they had ever had at Hampstead or Chelsea. The
  "backwards step." He laughed. He had to laugh; something was tickling his
  ribs and throat. His whole being laughed. He laughed a laugh that became a
  rush of hot blood from his mouth....</p>

  <p>The soul of Bunny, for all I know, laughs for ever among the stars; but it
  was a dead young man who finished those fantastic gyrations.</p>

  <p>He paused and swayed and dropped like an empty sack, and lay still in St.
  Stephen's Green, the modest contribution of one happy Sinn Fein sniper to the
  Peace of Mankind.</p>

  <p>Perhaps Bunny was well out of a life where there can be little room for
  Bunnyism for many years to come, and lucky to leave it laughing. And as an
  offset to his loss we have to count the pleasant excitement of Ireland in
  getting well back into the limelight of the world's affairs, and the bright
  and glowing gathering of the armed young heroes who got away, recounting
  their deeds to one another simultaneously in some secure place, with all the
  rich, tumultuous volubility of the Keltic habit.</p>

  <p>"Did ye see that red-haired fella I got in the square, boys?... Ah, ye
  should have seen that fella I got in the square."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">But not all the world of Joan was at war. The Sheldrick
  circle, for example, after some wide fluctuations during which Sydney almost
  became a nurse and Babs nearly enlisted into the Women's Legion, took a
  marked list under the influence of one of the sons-in-law towards pacifism.
  Antonia, who had taken two German prizes at school, was speedily provoked by
  the general denunciation of "Kultur" into a distinctly pro-German attitude.
  The Sheldrick circle settled down on the whole as a pro-German circle, with a
  poor opinion of President Wilson, a marked hostility to Belgians, and a
  disposition to think the hardships of drowning by U-boats much
  exaggerated.</p>

  <p>The Sheldricks were like seedlings that begin flourishing and then damp
  off. From amusing schoolfellows they had changed into irritating and
  disappointing friends. Energy leaked out of them at adolescence. They seemed
  to possess the vitality for positive convictions no longer, they displayed an
  instinctive hostility to any wave of popular feeling that threatened to swamp
  their weak but still obstinate individualities. Their general attitude
  towards life was one of protesting refractoriness. Whatever it was that
  people believed or did, you were given to understand by undertones and
  abstinencies that the Sheldricks knew better, and for the most exquisite
  reasons didn't. All their friends were protesters and rebels and seceders, or
  incomprehensible poets or inexplicable artists. And from the first the war
  was altogether too big and strong for them. Confronted by such questions as
  whether fifty years of belligerent preparation, culminating in the most cruel
  and wanton invasion of a peaceful country it is possible to imagine, was to
  be resisted by mankind or condoned, the Sheldricks fell back upon the counter
  statement that Sir Edward Grey, being a landowner, was necessarily just as
  bad as a German Junker, or that the Government of Russia was an
  unsatisfactory one.</p>

  <p>In a few months it was perfectly clear to the Sheldricks that they would
  have nothing to do with the war at all. They were going to ignore it. Sydney
  just went on quietly doing her little statuettes that nobody would buy,
  little portrait busts of her sisters and such-like things; now and then her
  mother contrived to get her a commission. Babs kept on trying to get a part
  in somebody's play; Antonia continued to produce djibbahs in chocolate and
  grocer's blue and similar tints. One saw the sisters drifting about London in
  costumes still trailingly pre-Raphaelite when all the rest of womankind was
  cutting its skirts shorter and shorter, their faces rather pained in
  expression and deliberately serene, ignoring the hopes and fears about them,
  the stir, the huge effort, the universal participation. It was not their
  affair, thank you. They were not going to wade through this horrid war; they
  were going round.</p>

  <p>Every time Joan went to see them, either they had become more phantomlike
  and incredible, or she had become coarser and more real. Would they ever get
  round? she asked herself; and what would they be like when at last they
  attempted, if ever they attempted, to rejoin the main stream of human
  interests again?</p>

  <p>They kept up their Saturday evenings, but their gatherings became thinner
  and less and less credible as the war went on. The first wave of military
  excitement carried off most of the sightly young men, and presently the more
  capable and enterprising of the women vanished one after another to nurse, to
  join the Women's Legion, to become substitute clerks and release men to
  volunteer, to work in canteens and so forth. There was, however, a certain
  coming and going of ambiguous adventurers, who in those early days went
  almost unchallenged between London and Belgium on ambulance work, on
  mysterious missions and with no missions at all. Belgian refugees drifted in
  and, when they found a lack of sympathy for their simple thirst for the
  destruction of Germans under all possible circumstances, out again. Then
  Ireland called her own, and Patrick Lynch went off to die a martyr's death
  with arms in his hands after three days of the most exhilarating mixed
  shooting in the streets of Dublin. Antonia discovered passionate memories as
  soon as he was dead, and nobody was allowed to mention the name of Bunny in
  the Sheldrick circle for fear of spoiling the emotional atmosphere. Hetty
  Reinhart, after some fluctuations, went khaki, flitted from one ministry to
  another in various sorts of clerical capacities, took such opportunities as
  offered of entertaining young officers lonely in our great capital, and was
  no more seen in Hampstead. What was left of this little group in the
  Hampstead Quartier Latin drew together into a band of resistance to the
  creeping approach of compulsory service.</p>

  <p>Huntley's lofty scorn of the war had intensified steadily; the harsh
  disappointment of Joan's patriotism had stung him to great efforts of self-
  justification, and he became one of the most strenuous writers in the extreme
  Pacifist press. Not an act or effort of the Allies, he insisted, that was not
  utterly vile in purpose and doomed to accelerate our defeat. Not an act of
  the enemy's that was not completely thought out, wisely calculated, and
  planned to give the world peace and freedom on the most reasonable terms. He
  was particularly active in preparing handbills and pamphlets of instruction
  for life-long Conscientious Objectors to war service who had not hitherto
  thought about the subject. Community of view brought him very close in
  feeling to both Babs and Sydney Sheldrick. There was much talk of a play he
  was to write which was to demonstrate the absurdity of Englishmen fighting
  Germans just because Germans insisted upon fighting Englishmen, and which was
  also to bring out the peculiarly charming Babsiness of Babs. He studied her
  thoroughly and psychologically and physiologically and intensively and
  extensively.</p>

  <p>By a great effort of self-control he abstained from sending his writings
  to Joan. Once however they were near meeting. On one of Joan's rare calls
  Babs told her that he was coming to discuss the question whether he should go
  to prison and hunger-strike, or consent to take up work of national
  importance. Babs was very full of the case for each alternative. She was
  doubtful which course involved the greatest moral courage. Moral courage, it
  was evident, was being carried to giddy heights by Huntley. It would be pure
  hypocrisy, he felt, to ignore the vital value of his writings, and while he
  could go on with these quite comfortably while working as a farm hand, with a
  little judicious payment to the farmer, their production would become
  impossible in prison. He must crucify himself upon the cross of harsh
  judgments, he felt, and take the former course. He wanted to make his views
  exactly clear to every one to avoid misunderstanding.</p>

  <p>Joan hesitated whether she should stay and insult him or go, and chose the
  seemlier course.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">Joan was already driving a car for the Ministry of Munitions
  before Peter got himself transferred from the ranks of the infantry to the
  Royal Flying Corps. Peter's career as an infantryman never took him nearer to
  the western front than Liss Forest. Then he perceived the error of his ways
  and decided to get a commission in the Royal Flying Corps. In those days the
  Flying Corps was still a limited and inaccessible force with a huge waiting
  list, and it needed a considerable exertion of influence to secure a footing
  in that select band.... But at last a day came when Peter, rather
  self-conscious in his new leather coat and cap, walked out from the mess past
  a group of chatting young pilots towards the aeroplane in which he was to
  have his first experience of flight.</p>

  <p>He had a sense of being scrutinized, but indeed hardly any one upon the
  aerodrome noted him. This sense of an audience made him deliberately casual
  in his bearing. He saluted his pilot in a manner decidedly offhand. He
  clambered up through struts and wire to the front seat as if he was a clerk
  ascending the morning omnibus, and strapped himself in as if it hardly
  mattered whether he was strapped in or not.</p>

  <p>"Contact, sir," said the mechanic. "Contact," came the pilot's voice from
  behind. The engine roared, a gale swept backwards, and Peter vibrated like an
  aspen leaf.</p>

  <p>The wheels were cleared, the mechanics jumped aside, and Peter was
  careering across the grass in a series of light leaps, and then his progress
  became smoother. He did not perceive at first the reason for this sudden
  steadying of the machine. He found himself tilting upward. He was off the
  ground. He had been off the ground for some seconds. He looked over the side
  and saw the grass fifty feet below, and the black shadow of the aeroplane, as
  if it fled before them, rushing at a hedge, doubling up at the hedge, and
  starting again in the next field. And up he went.</p>

  <p>Peter stared at fields, hedges, trees, sheds and roadways growing small
  below him. He noted cows in plan and an automobile in plan, in a lane, going
  it seemed very slowly indeed. It was a stagnant world below in comparison
  with his own forward sweep. His initial nervousness and self-consciousness
  had passed away. He was enormously interested and delighted. He was trying to
  remember when it was that Nobby had said: "I doubt if we'll see that in my
  lifetime&mdash;or yours." It was somewhen long ago at Limpsfield. Quite
  early....</p>

  <p>And then abruptly Peter was clutching the side with his thick-gloved hand:
  the aeroplane was coming round in a close curve and banking steeply, very
  steeply. For a moment it seemed as though there was nothing at all between
  him and England below. If he fell out&mdash;!</p>

  <p>He looked over his shoulder and met the hard regard of a pair of
  steel-blue eyes.</p>

  <p>He remembered that after all he was under observation. This was no mere
  civilian's joy ride. He affected a concentration upon the scenery. The
  aeroplane swung slowly back again to the level, and his hand left the
  side....</p>

  <p>They were going up very rapidly now. The world seemed to be rolling in at
  the edges of a great circle that grew constantly larger. Away to the left
  were broad spaces of brown sand, and grey rippled and smooth shining water
  channels, and beyond, the sapphire sea; beneath and to the right were fields,
  houses, villages, woods, and a distant range of hills that seemed to be
  coming nearer. The scale was changing and everything was becoming maplike.
  Cows were little dots now and men scarcely visible.... And then suddenly all
  the scenery seemed to be rushing upward before Peter's eyes and he had a
  feeling like the feeling one has in a lift when it starts&mdash;a down-borne
  feeling. He affected indifference, and gave the pilot his whistling profile.
  Down they swept, faster than a luge on the swiftest ice run, until one could
  see the ditches in the shadows beneath the hedges and cows were plainly cows
  again, and then once more they were heeling over and curving round. But Peter
  had been ready for that this time; he had been telling himself over and over
  again that he was strapped in. He betrayed no surprise. He was getting more
  and more exhilarated.</p>

  <p>And then they were climbing again and soaring straight out towards the
  sea. Up went this roaring dragonfly in which Peter was sitting, at a hundred
  and twenty miles or so per hour, leaving the dwindling land behind.</p>

  <p>Up they went and up, until the world seemed nearly all sea and the coast
  was far away; they mounted at last above a little white cloud puff and then
  above a haze of clouds, and when Peter looked down he saw at a vast distance
  below, through a clear gap in that filmy cloud fabric, three ships smaller
  than any toys. Of the men he could distinguish nothing. How sweet the cold
  clear air had become!</p>

  <p>And high above the world, in the lonely sky above the cloud fleece, the
  pilot saw fit to spring a surprise upon Peter.</p>

  <p>He was not of the genial and considerate order of teachers; he believed in
  weeding out duds as swiftly as possible. He had an open mind as to whether
  this rather over-intelligent-looking beginner might not, under certain
  circumstances, squeal. So he just tried him and, without a note of
  preparation, looped the loop with him.</p>

  <p>The propeller that span before the eyes of Peter dipped. Peter bowed in
  accord with it. It dipped more and more steeply, until the machine was almost
  nose down, until Peter was looking at the sea and the land as one sits and
  looks at a wall. He was tilted down and down until he was face downward. And
  then as abruptly he was tilted up; it was like being in a swing; the note of
  the engine altered as if a hand swept up a scale of notes; the sea and the
  land seemed to fall away below him as though he left them for ever, and the
  blue sky swept down across his field of vision like a curtain: he was, so to
  speak, on his back now with his legs in the air, looking straight at the sky,
  at nothing but sky, and expecting to recover. For a vast second he waited for
  the swing to end. This was surely the end of the swing....</p>

  <p>Only&mdash;most amazingly&mdash;he didn't recover! He wanted to say,
  "Ouch!" He was immensely surprised&mdash;too surprised to be frightened. He
  went over backwards&mdash;in an instant&mdash;and the sea and the land
  reappeared above the sky and also came down like curtains, too, and then
  behold! the aeroplane was driving down and the world was in its place again
  far below.</p>

  <p>"The Loop!" whispered Peter, a little dazed, and glanced back at his pilot
  and smiled. This was no perambulator excursion. "The Loop&mdash;first
  trip!"</p>

  <p>The blue eyes seemed a little less hard, the weather-red face was smiling
  faintly.</p>

  <p>Then gripped by an irresistible power, Peter found himself going down,
  down, down almost vertically. The pilot had apparently stopped the
  engine....</p>

  <p>Peter watched the majestic expansion of the landscape as they fell. They
  had come back over the land. Far away he could see the aerodrome like a
  scattered collection of little toy huts, and growing bigger and bigger every
  instant. He sat quite still, for it was all right&mdash;it must be all right.
  But now they were getting very near the ground, and it was still rushing up
  to meet them, and pouring outwardly as it rose. A cat now would be
  visible....</p>

  <p>It was all right. The engine picked up with a roar like a score of lions,
  and the pilot levelled out a hundred feet above the trees....</p>

  <p>Then presently they were dropping to the aerodrome again; down until the
  hedges were plain and the grazing cattle close and distinct; and then, with a
  sense of infinite regret, Peter perceived that they were back on the turf
  again and that the flight was over. They danced lightly over the turf. Their
  rush slowed down. They taxied gently up to the hangar and the engine
  shuddered and, with a pathetic drop to silence, stopped....</p>

  <p>A little stiffly, Peter unbuckled himself and stretched and set himself to
  clamber to the ground.</p>

  <p>His weather-bitten senior nodded to him and smiled faintly....</p>

  <p>Peter walked towards the mess. It was wonderful&mdash;and intensely
  disappointing in that it was so soon over. There were still great pieces of
  the afternoon left....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">The aerodrome was short of machines and instructors, and he
  had to wait a couple of weeks before he could get into the air a second
  time.</p>

  <p>He worked sedulously to gather knowledge during that waiting interval, and
  his first real lesson found him a very alert and ready pupil. This time the
  dual control was at his disposal, and for a straight or so the pilot left
  things to him altogether. Came half a dozen other lessons, and then Peter
  found himself sitting alone in a machine outside the great sheds, watched
  closely by a knot of friendly rivals, and, for the first time on his own
  account, conducting that duologue he had heard now so often on other lips.
  "Switch off. "... "Suck in." "Contact!"</p>

  <p>He started across the ground. His first sensations bordered on panic.
  Hitherto the machines he had flown in had been just machines; now this one,
  this one was an animal; it started out across the aerodrome like a demented
  ostrich, swerving wildly and trying to turn round. Always before this, the
  other man had done the taxi business on the ground. It had never occurred to
  Peter that it involved any difficulty. Peter's heart nearly failed him in
  that opening twenty seconds; he was convinced he was going to be killed; and
  then he determined to get up at any cost. At any rate he wouldn't smash on
  the ground. He let out the accelerator, touched his controls, and behold he
  was up&mdash;he was up! Instantly the machine ceased to resemble a
  floundering ostrich, and became a steady and dignified carinate, swaying only
  slightly from wing to wing. Up he went over the hedges, over the trees,
  beyond, above the familiar field of cows. The moment of panic passed, and
  Peter was himself again.</p>

  <p>He had got right outside the aerodrome and he had to bank and bring her
  round. Already he had done that successfully a number of times with an
  instructor to take care of him. He did it successfully now. His confidence
  grew. Back he buzzed and droned, a hundred feet over the aerodrome. He made
  three complete circuits, rose outside the aerodrome and came down, making a
  good landing. He was instantly smitten with the intensest regret that he had
  not made eight or nine circuits. It was a mere hop. Any man of spirit would
  have gone on. There were four hours of daylight yet. He might have gone up;
  he might have tried a spiral.... <i>Damn</i>!</p>

  <p>But the blue eyes of the master approved him.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't have made a better landing, Stubland," said the master. "Try
  again tomorrow. Follow it up close. Short and frequent doses. That's the
  way."</p>

  <p>Peter had made another stage on his way to France.</p>

  <p>Came other solo flights, and flights on different types of machines, and
  then a day of glory and disobedience when, three thousand feet above the
  chimneys of a decent farmhouse, Peter looped the loop twice. He had learnt by
  that time what it was to sideslip, and what air pockets can do to the unwary.
  He had learnt the bitter consequences of coming down with the engine going
  strong. He had had a smash through that all too common mistake, but not a bad
  smash; a few struts and wires of the left wing were all that had gone. A
  hedge and a willow tree had stopped him. He had had a forced landing in a
  field of cabbages through engine stoppage, and half an hour in a snowstorm
  when he had had doubts in an upward eddy whether he might not be flying
  upside down. That had been a nasty experience&mdash;his worst. He had several
  times taken his hands off the controls and let the old 'bus look after
  herself, so badly were the snowflakes spinning about in his mind. He dreamt a
  lot about flying, and few of his dreams were pleasant dreams. And then this
  fantastic old world of ours, which had so suddenly diverted his education to
  these things, and taught him to fly with a haste and intensity it had never
  put into any teaching before, decided that he was ripe for the air war, and
  packed him off to France. ,</p><br>

  <h3>§ 10</h3>

  <p class="first">Now, seeing that Joan had at last discovered that she was in
  love with Peter, it would be pleasantly symmetrical to record that Peter had
  also discovered by this time that he was in love with Joan.</p>

  <p>But as a matter of fact he had discovered nothing of the sort. He had been
  amazed and humiliated by his three days of hesitation and procrastination at
  Orta; the delay was altogether out of keeping with his private picture of
  himself; and he discovered that he was not in love with any one and that he
  did not intend again to be lured into any dangerous pretence that he was. He
  had done with Hetty, he was convinced; he did not mean to see her any more,
  and he led a life of exasperated Puritanism for some months, refusing to
  answer the occasionally very skilful and perplexing letters, with amusing and
  provocative illustrations, that she wrote him.</p>

  <p>The idea of "relaxing moral fibre" obsessed him, and our genial Peter for
  a time abandoned both smoking and alcohol, and was only deterred from further
  abstinences by their impracticability. The ordinary infantry mess, for
  example, caters ill and resentfully for vegetarians.... Peter's days in the
  ranks were days of strained austerity. He was a terribly efficient recruit, a
  fierce soldier, a wonderful influence on slackers, stripes gravitated towards
  him, and a prophetic corporal saw sergeant-major written on his forehead.
  Occasionally, when his imagination got loose or after a letter from Hetty, he
  would indulge privately in fits of violent rage, finding great relief in the
  smashing of light objects and foul and outrageous language. He found what he
  considered a convenient privacy for this idiosyncrasy in a disused cowshed
  near the camp, and only realized that he had an audience when a fellow
  recruit asked anxiously, "And how's Miss Blurry 'Etty?" Whereupon Peter
  discovered a better outlet for pentup nervous energy in a square fight.</p>

  <p>Joan saw hardly anything of him during those early and brutal days, but
  she thought about him mightily. She shared Oswald's opinion that he wasn't in
  his right place, and she wrote to him frequently. He answered perhaps half
  her letters. His answers struck her as being rather posed. The strain showed
  through them. Peter was trying very hard not to be Peter. "I'm getting down
  to elementals," was one of his experiments in the statement of his moral
  struggle.</p>

  <p>Then quite abruptly came his decision to get into the Royal Flying
  Corps.</p>

  <p>Neither Oswald nor Joan ventured any comment on this, because both of them
  had a feeling that Peter had, in a sense, climbed down by this decision to go
  up....</p>

  <p>In the Royal Flying Corps Peter's rather hastily conceived theories of
  moral fibre came into an uncongenial atmosphere. The Royal Flying Corps was
  amazingly young, swift, and confident, and "moral fibre" based on abstinence
  and cold self-control was not at all what it was after. The Royal Flying
  Corps was much more inclined to scrap with soda-water syphons and rag to the
  tunes of a gramophone. It was a body that had had to improvise a tradition of
  conduct in three or four swift years, and its tradition was still unstable.
  Mainly it was the tradition of the games and sports side of a public school,
  roughly adapted to the new needs of the service; it was an essentially boyish
  tradition, even men old enough to have gone through the universities were in
  a minority in it, and Peter at one-and-twenty was one of the more elderly
  class of recruits. And necessarily the tradition of the corps still varied
  widely with the dominant personalities and favourite heroes of each aerodrome
  and mess and squadron. It was a crowd of plastic boys, left amazingly to
  chance leads. Their seniors had no light for them, and they picked up such
  hints as they could from Kipling and the music-halls, from overheard
  conversations, and one another.</p>

  <p>Is it not an incredible world in which old men make wars and untutored
  young men have to find out how to fight them; in which tradition and the past
  are mere entanglements about the feet of the young? The flying services took
  the very flower of the youth of the belligerent nations; they took the young
  men who were most manifestly fitted to be politicians, statesmen, leaders of
  men, masters in industry, and makers of the new age; the boys of nerve,
  pluck, imagination, invention, and decision. And there is not a sign of any
  realization on the part of any one of the belligerent states of the fact that
  a large proportion of this most select and valuable mass of youth was
  destined to go on living after the war and was going to matter tremendously
  and be the backbone of the race after the war. They let all these boys
  specialize as jockeys specialize. The old men and rulers wanted these
  youngsters to fight and die for them; that any future lay beyond the war was
  too much for these scared and unteachable ancients to apprehend. The short
  way to immediate efficiency was to back the tradition of recklessness and
  gallantry, and so the short way was taken; if the brave lads were kept bold
  and reckless by women, wine and song, then by all means, said their elders,
  let them have these helps. "A short life and a merry one," said the British
  Empire to these lads of eighteen and nineteen encouragingly. "A short life
  and a merry one," said the Empire to its future.</p>

  <p>If the story of the air forces is a glorious and not a shameful thing it
  is because of the enduring hope of the world&mdash;the incessant gallantry of
  youth. These boys took up their great and cardinal task with the unquenchable
  hopefulness of boyhood and with the impudence and humour of their race. They
  brought in the irreverence and the Spartanism of their years. They made a
  language for themselves, an atrocious slang of facetious misnomers;
  everything one did was a "stunt"; everything one used was a "gadget"; the
  machines were "'buses" and "camels" and "pups"; the older men were
  perpetually pleading in vain for more dignity in the official reports. And
  these youngsters worked out their moral problems according to their own
  generous and yet puerile ideas. They argued the question of drink. Could a
  man fly better or worse if he was "squiffy"? Does funk come to the
  thoughtful? And was ever a man gallant without gallantries? After the death
  of Lord Kitchener there survived no man in Britain of the quality to speak
  plainly and authoritatively and honestly about chastity and drink to the
  young soldier. The State had no mind in these matters. In most matters indeed
  the State had no mind; it was a little old silly State. And the light side of
  the feminine temperament flamed up into shameless acquiescences in the heroic
  presence of the flying man. Youth instinctively sets towards romantic
  adventures, and the scales of chance for a considerable number of the flying
  men swung between mésalliance and Messalina.</p>

  <p>The code and the atmosphere varied from mess to mess and from squadron to
  squadron; young men are by nature and necessity hero-worshippers and
  imitative. Peter's lines fell among pleasant men of the " irresponsible "
  school. The two best flyers he knew, including him of the hard blue eyes who
  had first instructed him, were men of a physique that defied drink and
  dissipation. Vigours could smoke, drink, and dance in London, catch the last
  train back with three seconds to spare, and be flying with an unshaken nerve
  by half-past six in the morning; Vincent would only perform stunts when he
  was "tight," and then he seemed capable of taking any risk with impunity. He
  could be funny with an aeroplane then a thousand feet up in the air. He could
  make it behave as though it was drunk, as though it was artful; he could make
  it mope or wag its tail. Men went out to watch him. The mess was decorated
  with pictures from <i>La Vie Parisienne</i>, and the art and literature of
  the group was <i>Revue</i>. Now seeing that Peter's sole reason for his
  puritanism was the preservation of efficiency, this combination of a fast
  life and a fine record in the air was very disconcerting to him.</p>

  <p>If he had been naturally and easily a first-class flying man he might have
  stuck to his line of high austerity, but he was not. He flew well, but he had
  to fly with care; like many other airmen, he always felt a shadow of funk
  before going up, on two or three bad mornings it was on his conscience that
  he had delayed for ten minutes or so, and he was more and more inclined to
  think that he would fly better if he flew with a less acute sense of
  possibilities. It was the start and the uneventful flying that irked him
  most; hitherto every crisis had found him cool and able. But the slap-dash
  style, combined with the exquisite accuracy of these rakes, Vigours and
  Vincent, filled him with envious admiration.</p>

  <p>In the mess Peter met chiefly youths of his own age or a year or so
  younger; he soon became a master of slang; his style of wit won its way among
  them. He ceased to write of "getting down to elementals" to Joan, and he
  ceased to think of all other girls and women as inventions of the devil. Only
  they must be kept in their places. As Vigours and Vincent kept them. Just as
  one kept drink in its place. One must not, for example, lose trains on
  account of them....</p>

  <p>Through these months Joan maintained a strained watch upon the development
  and fluctuations of Peter. He wrote&mdash;variously; sometimes offhand duty
  notes and sometimes long and brotherly letters&mdash;incurably brotherly.
  Every now and then she had glimpses of him when he came to London on leave.
  Manifestly he liked her company and trusted her&mdash;as though she was a
  man. It was exasperating. She dressed for Peter as she had never dressed for
  any one, and he would take her out to dine at the <i>Rendezvous</i> or the
  <i>Petit Riche</i> and sit beside her and glance at common scraps of feminine
  humanity, at dirty little ogling bare-throated girls in patched-up raiment
  and with harsh and screaming voices, as though they were the most delicious
  of forbidden fruits. And he seemed to dislike being alone with her. If she
  dropped her hand to touch his on the table, he would draw his away.</p>

  <p>Was the invisible barrier between them invincible?</p>

  <p>For a time during his infantry phase he had shown a warm affection. In his
  early days in the flying corps it seemed that he drew still closer to her.
  Then her quick, close watch upon him detected a difference. Joan was getting
  to be a very shrewd observer nowadays, and she felt a subtle change that
  suddenly made him a little shame-faced in her presence. There had been some
  sort of spree in London with two or three other wild spirits, and there had
  been "girls" in the party. Such girls! He never told her this, but something
  told her. I am inclined to think it was her acute sense of smell detected a
  flavour of face powder or cheap scent about Peter when he came along one day,
  half an hour late, to take her to the Ambassadors. She was bad company that
  night for him.</p>

  <p>For a time Joan was bad company for any one.</p>

  <p>She was worse when she realized that Hetty was somehow reinstated in
  Peter's world. That, too, she knew by an almost incredible flash of
  intuition. Miss Jepson was talking one evening to Peter, and Peter suddenly
  displayed a knowledge of the work of the London Group that savoured of
  studio. This was the first art criticism he had talked since the war began.
  It was clear he had been to a couple of shows. Not with Joan. Not alone. As
  he spoke, he glanced at Joan and met her eye.</p>

  <p>It was astonishing that Miss Jepson never heard the loud shout of "Hetty 0
  that seemed to till the room.</p>

  <p>It was just after this realization that an elderly but still gallant
  colonel, going on an expedition for the War Office with various other
  technical authorities to suppress some disturbing invention that the Ministry
  of Munitions was pressing in a troublesome manner, decided to come back from
  Longmore to London on the front seat beside Joan. His conversational
  intentions were honourable and agreeable, but he shared a common error that a
  girl who wears khaki and drives a car demands less respect from old gentlemen
  and is altogether more playful than the Victorian good woman. Possibly he was
  lured on to his own destruction.</p>

  <p>When he descended at the Ministry, he looked pinched and aged. He was
  shaken to the pitch of confidences. "My word," he whispered. "That girl
  drives like the devil. But she's a vixen... snaps your head off.... Don't
  know whether this sort of thing is good for women in the long run.</p>

  <p>"Robs 'em of Charm," he said.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 11</h3>

  <p class="first">It was just in this phase of wrath and darkness that
  Wilmington came over to London for his last leave before he was killed, and
  begged Joan for all the hours she had to spare. She was quite willing to
  treat him generously. They dined together and went to various theatres and
  music-halls and had a walk over Hampstead Heath on Sunday. He was a silent,
  persistent companion for most of the time. He bored her, and the more he
  bored her the greater her compunction and the more she hid it from him. But
  Wilmington, if he had a slow tongue, had a penetrating eye.</p>

  <p>The last evening they had together was at the Criterion. They dined in the
  grill room, a dinner that was interspersed with brooding silences. And then
  Wilmington decided to make himself interesting at any cost upon this last
  occasion.</p>

  <p>"Joan," he said, knocking out a half-consumed cigarette upon the edge of
  his plate.</p>

  <p>"Billy?" said Joan, waking up.</p>

  <p>"Queer, Joan, that you don't love me when I love you so much."</p>

  <p>"I'd trust you to the end of the earth, Billy."</p>

  <p>"I know. But you don't love me."</p>

  <p>"I think of you as much as I do of any one."</p>

  <p>"No. Except&mdash;<i>one</i>."</p>

  <p>"Billy," said Joan weakly, "you're the straightest man on earth."</p>

  <p>Wilmington's tongue ran along his white lips. He spoke with an effort.</p>

  <p>"You've loved Peter since you were six years old. It isn't as
  though&mdash;you'd treated me badly. I can't grumble that you've had no room
  for me. He's always been there."</p>

  <p>Joan, after an interval, decided to be frank.</p>

  <p>"It's not much good, Billy, is it, if I do?"</p>

  <p>Wilmington said nothing for quite a long time. He sat thinking hard. "It's
  not much good pretending I don't hate Peter. I do. If I could kill
  him&mdash;and in your memory too.... He bars you from me. He makes you
  unhappy...."</p>

  <p>His face was a white misery. Joan glanced round at the tables about her,
  but no one seemed to be watching them. She looked at him again. Pity, so
  great that it came near to love, wrung her....</p>

  <p>"Joan," he said at last.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"It's queer.... I feel mean.... As though it wasn't right.... But look
  here, Joan." He tapped her arm. "Something&mdash;something that I suppose I
  may as well point out to you. Because in certain matters&mdash;in certain
  matters you are being a fool. It's astonishing But absolutely fool."</p>

  <p>Joan perceived he had something very important to say. She sat watching
  him, as with immense deliberation he got out another cigarette and lit
  it.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand this Peter business, Joan. I&mdash;I do. Mostly when
  I'm not actually planning out or carrying out the destruction of Germans, I
  think of you&mdash;and Peter. And all the rest of it. I've got nothing else
  much to think about. And I think I see things you don't see. I know I do....
  Oh damn it! Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>This last was to the waiter, who was making the customary warning about
  liqueurs on the stroke of half-past nine.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," said Wilmington to Joan, and leant forward over his folded arms
  and collected his thoughts with his eyes on the flowers before them.</p>

  <p>"It's like this, Joan. Peter isn't where we are. I&mdash;I'm very definite
  and clear about my love-making. I fell in love with you, and I've never met
  any other woman I'd give three minutes of my life to. You've just got me. As
  if I were the palm of your hand. I wish I were. And&mdash;oh! what's the good
  of shutting my eyes t&mdash;Peter has you. You've been thinking of Peter half
  the time we've been together. It's true, Joan. You've grown up in love. But!
  But Peter, you've got to understand, isn't in love. He doesn't know what love
  means. Perhaps he never will. Love with you and me is a thing of flesh and
  bone. He takes it like some skin disease. He's been spoilt. He's so damned
  easy and good-looking. He was got hold of. I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Wilmington flushed for a moment. "I'm a chaste man, Joan. It's a rare
  thing. Among our sort. But Peter&mdash; Loving a woman body and soul means
  nothing to him. He thinks love-making is a kind of amusement&mdash;Casual
  amusement. Any woman who isn't repulsive. You know, Joan, that's not the
  natural way. The natural way is love of soul and body. He's been perverted.
  But in this crowded world&mdash;like a monkey's cage... artificially heated
  ... the young men get made miscellaneous.... Lots of the girls even are
  miscellaneous...."</p>

  <p>He considered the word. "Miscellaneous? Promiscuous, I mean.... It hasn't
  happened to us. To you and me, I mean. I'm unattractive somehow. You're
  fastidious. He's neither. He takes the thing that offers. To grave people sex
  is a sacrament, something&mdash;so solemn and beautiful&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The tears stood in his eyes. "If I go on," he said.... "I can't go
  on...."</p>

  <p>For a time he said no more, and pulled his unconsumed cigarette to pieces
  over the ash-tray with trembling fingers. "That's all," he said at last.</p>

  <p>"All this is&mdash;rather true," said Joan. "But!"</p>

  <p>"What does it lead up to?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"It means Peter's the ordinary male animal. Under modern conditions. Lazy.
  Affectionate and all that, but not a scrap of emotion or love&mdash;yet
  anyhow. Not what you and I know as love. You may dress it up as you like, but
  the fact is that the woman has to make love to him. That's all. Hetty has
  made love to him. He has never made love to anybody&mdash;except as a sort of
  cheerful way of talking, and perhaps he never, never will.... He respects you
  too much to make love to you.... But he'd hate the idea of any one
  else&mdash;making love to you.... It's an idea It's outside of his conception
  of you. . . He'll never think of it for himself."</p>

  <p>Joan sat quite still. After what seemed a long silence she looked up at
  him.</p>

  <p>Wilmington was watching her face. He saw she understood his drift.</p>

  <p>"You could cut her out like that," said Wilmington, with a gesture that
  gained an accidental emphasis by knocking his glass off the table and
  smashing it.</p>

  <p>The broken glass supplied an incident, a distraction, with the waiters, to
  relieve the tension of the situation.</p>

  <p>"That's all I had to say," said Wilmington when that was all settled.
  "There's no earthly reason why two of us should be unhappy."</p>

  <p>"Billy," she said, after a long pause, "if I could only love
  <i>you</i>&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The face of gratitude that looked at him faded to a mask. "You're thinking
  of Peter already," said Wilmington, watching her face.</p>

  <p>It was true. She started, detected.</p>

  <p>He speculated cheerlessly.</p>

  <p>"You'11 marry me some day perhaps. When Peter's thrown you over.... It's
  men of my sort who get things like that...."</p>

  <p>He stood up and reached for her cloak. She, too, stood up.</p>

  <p>Then, as if to reassure her, he said: I shall get killed, Joan. So we
  needn't worry about that. I shall get killed. I know it. And Peter will
  live.... I always have taken everything too seriously. Always.... I shall
  kill a lot of Germans yet, but one day they will get me. And Peter will be up
  there in the air, like a cheerful midge&mdash;with all the Archies missing
  him...."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 12</h3>

  <p class="first">This conversation was a cardinal event in Joan's life.
  Wilmington's suggestions raised out of the grave of forgetfulness and
  incorporated with themselves a conversation she had had long ago with
  Adela&mdash;one Christmas at Pelham Ford when Adela had been in love with Sop
  with Greene. Adela too had maintained that it was the business of a woman to
  choose her man and not wait to be chosen, and that it was the woman who had
  to make love. "A man's in love with women in general," had been Adela's idea,
  "but women fall in love with men in particular." Adela had used a queer
  phrase, "It's for a woman to find her own man and keep him and take care of
  him." Men had to do their own work; they couldn't think about love as women
  were obliged by nature to think about love. "Love's just a trouble to a real
  man, like a mosquito singing in his ear, until some woman takes care of
  him."</p>

  <p>All those ideas came back now to Joan's mind, and she did her best to
  consider them and judge them as generalizations. But indeed she judged with a
  packed court, and all her being clamoured warmly for her to "get" Peter, to
  "take care"&mdash;most admirable phrase&mdash;of Peter. Her decision was
  made, and still she argued with herself. Was it beneath her dignity to set
  out and capture her Peter?&mdash;he was her Peter. Only he didn't know it.
  She tried to generalize. Had it ever been dignified for a woman to wait until
  a man discovered her possible love? Was that at best anything more than the
  dignity of the mannequin?</p>

  <p>Three-quarters at least of the art and literature of the world is
  concerned with the relations of the sexes, and yet here was Joan, after
  thirty centuries or so of human art and literature, still debating the
  elementary facts of her being. There is so much excitement in our art and
  literature and so little light. The world has still to discover the scope and
  vastness of its educational responsibilities. Most of its teaching in these
  matters hitherto has been less in the nature of enlightenment than strategic
  concealment; we have given the young neither knowledge nor training, we have
  restrained and baffled them and told them lies. And then we have inflamed
  them. We have abused their instinctive trust when they were children with
  stories of old Bogey designed to save us the bother that unrestrained
  youthful enterprise might cause, and with humorous mockery of their natural
  curiosity. Jocularities about storks and gooseberry bushes, sham indignations
  at any plainness of speech, fierce punishments of imperfectly realized
  offences, this against a background of giggles, knowing innuendo, arid
  careless, exciting glimpses of the mystery, have constituted the ordinary
  initiation of the youth of the world. Right up to full age, we still fail to
  provide the clear elemental facts. Our young men do not know for certain
  whether continence is healthy or unhealthy, possible or impossible; the sex
  is still assured with all our power of assurance, that the only pure and
  proper life for it is a sexless one. Until at last the brightest of the young
  have been obliged to get down to the bare facts in themselves and begin again
  at the beginning....</p>

  <p>So Joan, co-Heiress of the Ages with Peter, found that because of her
  defaulting trustees, because we teachers, divines, writers and the like have
  shirked what was disagreeable and difficult and unpopular, she inherited
  nothing but debts and dangers. She had not even that touching faith in Nature
  which sustained the generation of Jean Jacques Rousseau. She had to set about
  her problem with Peter as though he and she were Eve and Adam in a garden
  overrun with weeds and thorns into which God had never come.</p>

  <p>Joan was too young yet to have developed the compensating egotism of
  thwarted femininity. She saw Peter without delusions. He was a bigger and
  cleverer creature than herself; he compelled her respect. He had more
  strength, more invention, more initiative, and a relatively tremendous power
  of decision. And at the same time he was weak and blind and stupid. His
  flickering, unstable sensuousness, his light adventurousness and a certain
  dishonesty about women, filled her with a comprehensive pity and contempt.
  There was a real difference not merely in scale but in nature between them.
  It was clear to her now that the passionate and essential realities of a
  woman's life are only incidental to a man. But on the other hand there were
  passionate and essential realities for Peter that made her own seem narrow
  and self-centred. She knew far more of his mental life than Oswald did. She
  knew that he had an intense passion for clear statement, he held to
  scientific and political judgments with a power altogether deeper and greater
  than she did; he cared for them and criticized them and polished them, like
  weapons that had been entrusted to him. Beneath his debonair mask he was
  growing into a strong and purposeful social and mental personality. She
  perceived that he was only in the beginning of his growth&mdash;if he came on
  no misadventure, if he did not waste himself. And she did not believe that
  she herself had any great power of further growth except through him. But
  linked to him she could keep pace with him. She could capture his senses,
  keep his conscience, uphold him....</p>

  <p>She had convinced herself now that that was her chief business in
  life.</p>

  <p>Her mind was remarkably free from doubts about the future if once she
  could get at her Peter. Mountains and forests of use and wont separated them,
  she knew. Peter had acquired a habit of not making love to her and of
  separating her from the thought of love. But if ever Peter came over these
  mountains, if ever he came through the forest to her In the heart of the
  forest, she would keep him. She wasn't afraid that Peter would leave her
  again. Wilmington had been wrong there. That he had suggested in the
  bitterness of his heart. Men like Huntley and Winterbaum were always astray,
  but Peter was not "looking for women." He was just a lost man, distracted by
  desire, desire that was strong because he was energetic, desire that was
  mischievous and unmeaning because he had lost his way in these things.</p>

  <p>"I don't care so very much how long it takes, Peter; I don't care what it
  costs me," said Joan, getting her role clear at last. "I don't even
  care&mdash;not vitally anyhow&mdash;how you wander by the way. No. Because
  you're my man, Peter, and I am your woman. Because so it was written in the
  beginning. But you are coming over those mountains, my Peter, though they go
  up to the sky; you are coming through the forests though I have to make a
  path for you. You are coming to my arms, Peter.... coming to me...."</p>

  <p>So Joan framed her schemes, regardless of the swift approach of the day of
  battle for Peter. She was resolved to lose nothing by neglect or delay, but
  also she meant to do nothing precipitate. To begin with she braced herself to
  the disagreeable task of really thinking&mdash;instead of just
  feeling&mdash;about Hetty. She compared herself deliberately point by point
  with Hetty. Long ago at Pelham Ford she had challenged Hetty&mdash;and Peter
  had come out of the old library in spite of Hetty to watch her dancing. She
  was younger, she was fresher and cleaner, she was a ray of sunlight to
  Hetty's flames. Hetty was good company&mdash;perhaps. But Peter and Joan had
  always been good company for each other, interested in a score of common
  subjects, able to play the same games and run abreast. But Hetty was "easy."
  There was her strength. Between her and Peter there were no barriers, and
  between Joan and Peter was a blank wall, a stern taboo upon the primary among
  youthful interests, a long habit of aloofness, dating from the days when
  "soppy" was the ultimate word in the gamut of human scorn.</p>

  <p>"It's just like that," said Joan.</p>

  <p>Those barriers had to be broken down, without a shock.. And before that
  problem Joan maintained a frowning, unsuccessful siege. She couldn't begin to
  flirt with Peter. She couldn't make eyes at him. Such things would be
  intolerable. She couldn't devise any sort of signal. And so how the devil was
  this business ever to begin? And while she wrestled vainly with this
  perplexity she remained more boyish, more good-fellow and companion with
  Peter than ever....</p>

  <p>And while she was still meditating quite fruitlessly on this riddle of
  changing her relationship to Peter, he was snatched away from her to
  France.</p>

  <p>The thing happened quite unexpectedly. He came up to see her at Hampstead
  late in the afternoon&mdash;it was by a mere chance she was back early. He
  was full of pride at being chosen to go so soon. He seemed brightly excited
  at going, keen for the great adventure, the most lovable and animated of
  Peters&mdash;and he might be going to his death. But it was the convention of
  the time never to think of death, and anyhow never to speak of it. Some
  engagement held him for the evening, some final farewell spree; she did not
  ask too particularly what that was. She could guess only too well. Altogether
  they were about five-and-twenty minutes together, with Miss Jepson always in
  the room with them; for the most part they talked air shop; and then he
  prepared to leave with all her scheming still at loose ends in the air.
  "Well," he said, "good-bye, old Joan," and held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"No," said Joan, with a sudden resolution in her eyes. "This time we kiss,
  Peter."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Peter, astonished.</p>

  <p>She had surprised him. He stared at her for an instant with a half-framed
  question in his eyes. And then they kissed very gravely and carefully. But
  she kissed him on the mouth.</p>

  <p>For some seconds solemnity hung about them. Then Peter turned upon Miss
  Jepson. "Do you want a kiss?" said Peter....</p>

  <p>Miss Jepson was all for kissing, and then with a laugh and an effect of
  escape Peter had gone... into the outer world... into the outer
  air....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 13</h3>

  <p class="first">He flew to France the next day, above the grey and shining
  stretches of water and two little anxious ships, and he sent Joan a cheerful
  message on a picture-postcard of a shell-smashed church to tell of his safe
  arrival.</p>

  <p>Joan was dismayed. In war time we must not brood on death, one does not
  think of death if one can help it; it is the chance that wrecks all
  calculations; but the fear of death had fallen suddenly upon all her plans.
  And what was there left now of all her plans? She might write him
  letters.</p>

  <p>Death is more terrible to a girl in love than to any other living thing.
  "If he dies," said Joan, "I am killed. I shall be worse than a widow&mdash;an
  Indian girl widow. Suttee; what will be left of me but ashes?... Some poor
  dregs of Joan carrying on a bankrupt life.... No me. . ."</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but to write him letters. And Joan found those
  letters incredibly difficult to write. All lightness had gone from her touch.
  After long and tiring days with her car she sat writing and tearing up and
  beginning again. It was so difficult now to write to him, to be easy in
  manner and yet insidious. She wanted still to seem his old companion, and yet
  to hint subtly at the new state of things. "There's a dull feeling now you've
  gone out of England, Peter," she wrote. "I've never had company I cared for
  in all the world as I care for yours." And, "I shall count the days to your
  leave, Peter, as soon as I know how many to count. I didn't guess before that
  you were a sort of necessity to me." Over such sentences, sentences that must
  have an edge and yet not be too bold, sentences full of tenderness and above
  all suspicion of "soppiness," Joan pondered like a poet writing a
  sonnet....</p>

  <p>But letters went slowly, and life and death hustled along together very
  swiftly in the days of the great war....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 14</h3>

  <p class="first">Joan's mind was full of love and life and the fear of losing
  them, but Peter was thinking but little of love and life; he was secretly
  preoccupied with the thought, the forbidden thought, of death, and with the
  strangeness of war and of this earth seen from an aeroplane ten thousand feet
  or so above the old battlefields of mankind. He was seeing the world in plan,
  and realizing what a flat and shallow thing it was. On clear days the circuit
  of the world he saw had a circumference of hundreds of miles, night flying
  was a journey amidst the stars with the little black planet far away; there
  was no former achievement of the race that did not seem to him now like a
  miniature toy set out upon the floor of an untidy nursery. He had beaten up
  towards the very limits of life and air, to the clear thin air of twenty-two
  or twenty-three thousand feet; he had been in the blinding sunlight when
  everything below was still asleep in the blue of dawn.</p>

  <p>And the world of history and romance, the world in which he and all his
  ancestors had believed, a world seen in elevation, of towering frontages,
  high portals, inaccessible dignities, giddy pinnacles and frowning
  reputations, had now fallen as flat, it seemed, as the façade of the Cloth
  Hall at Ypres. (He had seen that one day from above, spread out upon the
  ground.) He was convinced that high above the things of the past he droned
  his liquid way towards a new sort of life altogether, towards a greater
  civilization, a world-wide life for men with no boundaries in it at all
  except the emptiness of outer space, a life of freedom and exaltation and
  tremendous achievement. But meanwhile the old things of the world were trying
  most desperately to kill him. Every day the enemy's anti-aircraft guns seemed
  to grow more accurate; and high above the little fleecy clouds lurked the
  braggart Markheimer and the gallant von Papen and suchlike German champions,
  with their decoys below, ready to swoop and strike. Never before had the
  world promised Peter so tremendous a spectacle as it seemed to promise now,
  and never before had his hope of living to see it been so insecure.</p>

  <p>When he had enlisted, and even after he had been transferred to the Flying
  Corps, Peter had thought very little of death. The thought of death only
  became prevalent in English minds towards the second year of the war. It is a
  hateful and unnatural thought in youth, easily dismissed altogether unless
  circumstances press it incessantly upon the attention. But even before Peter
  went to France two of his set had been killed under his eyes in a collision
  as they came down into the aerodrome, and a third he had seen two miles away
  get into a spiral nose dive, struggle out of it again, and then go down to be
  utterly smashed to pieces. In one day on Salisbury Plain he had seen three
  accidents, and two, he knew, had been fatal and one had left a legless thing
  to crawl through life. The messes in France seemed populous with young
  ghosts; reminiscences of sprees, talk of flying adventures were laced with,
  "dear old boy! he went west last May." "Went west" was the common phrase.
  They never said "killed." They hated the very name of death. They did their
  best, these dear gallant boys, to make the end seem an easy and familiar part
  of life, of life with which they were so joyously in love. They all knew that
  the dice was loaded against them, and that as the war went on the chances
  against them grew. The first day Peter was out in France he saw a man hit and
  brought down by a German Archie. Two days after, he found himself the centre
  of a sudden constellation of whoofing shells that left inky cloudbursts over
  him and under him and round about him; he saw the fabric of his wing jump and
  quiver, and dropped six hundred feet or so to shake the gunner off. But
  <i>whuff</i>... <i>whuff</i>... <i>whuff</i>, like the bark of a monstrous
  dog... the beast was on him again within a minute, and Peter did two or three
  loops and came about and got away with almost indecent haste. He was
  trembling; he hated it. And he hated to tremble.</p>

  <p>In the mess that evening the talk ran on the "Pigeon shooter." It seemed
  that there was this one German gunner far quicker and more deadly than any of
  his fellows. He had a knack of divining what an airman was going to do. Peter
  admitted his near escape and sought counsel.</p>

  <p>Peter's colleagues watched him narrowly and unostentatiously when they
  advised him. Their faces were masks and his face was a mask, and they were
  keen for the faintest intonation of what was behind it. They all hated death,
  they all tried not to think of death; they all believed that there were
  Paladins, other fellows, who never thought of death at all. When the tension
  got too great they ragged; they smashed great quantities of furniture and
  made incredible volumes of noise. Twice Peter got away from the aerodrome to
  let things rip in Amiens. But such outbreaks were usually followed by a deep
  depression of spirit. In the night Peter would wake up and find the thought
  of death sitting by his bedside.</p>

  <p>So far Peter had never had a fight. He had gone over the enemy lines five
  times, he had bombed a troop train in a station and a regiment resting in a
  village, he believed he had killed a score or more of Germans on each
  occasion and he felt not the slightest compunction, but he had not yet come
  across a fighting Hun plane. He had very grave doubts about the issue of such
  a fight, a fight that was bound to come sooner or later. He knew he was not
  such a quick pilot as he would like to be. He thought quickly, but he thought
  rather too much for rapid, steady decisions. He had the balancing, scientific
  mind. He knew that none of his flights were perfect. Always there was a
  conflict of intention at some point, a hesitation. He believed he might last
  for weeks or months, but he knew that somewhen he would be found
  wanting&mdash;just for a second perhaps, just in the turn of the fight. Then
  he would be killed. He hid quite successfully from all his companions, and
  particularly from his squadron commander, this conviction, just as he had
  previously hidden the vague funk that had invariably invaded his being
  whenever he walked across the grounds towards the machine during his days of
  instruction, but at the back of his mind the thought that his time was
  limited was always present. He believed that he had to die; it might be
  tomorrow or next week or next month, but somewhen within the year.</p>

  <p>When these convictions became uppermost in Peter's mind a black discontent
  possessed him. There are no such bitter critics of life as the young; theirs
  is a magnificent greed for the splendour of life. They have no patience with
  delays; their blunders and failures are intolerable. Peter reviewed his
  two-and-twenty years&mdash;it was now nearly three-and-twenty&mdash;with an
  intense dissatisfaction. He had wasted his time, and now he had got into a
  narrow way that led down and down pitilessly to where there would be no more
  time to waste. He had been aimless and the world had been aimless, and then
  it had suddenly turned upon him and caught him in this lobster-trap. He had
  wasted all his chances of great experience. He had never loved a woman or had
  been well loved because he had frittered away that possibility in a hateful
  sex excitement with Hetty&mdash;who did not even pretend to be faithful to
  him. And now things had got into this spin to death. It was exactly like a
  spin&mdash;like a spinning nose dive&mdash;the whole affair, his life, this
  war....</p>

  <p>He would lie and fret in his bed, and fret all the more because he knew
  his wakefulness wasted the precious nervous vigour that might save his life
  next day.</p>

  <p>After a black draught of such thoughts Peter would become excessively
  noisy and facetious in the mess tent. He was recognized and applauded as a
  wit and as a devil. He was really very good at Limericks, delicately
  indelicate, upon the names of his fellow officers and of the villages along
  the front&mdash;that was no doubt heredity, the gift of his Aunt
  Phyllis&mdash;and his caricatures adorned the mess. It was also understood
  that he was a rake....</p>

  <p>Peter's evil anticipations were only too well justified. He was put down
  in his very first fight, which happened over Dompierre. He had bad luck; he
  was struck by von Papen, one of the crack German fliers on that part of the
  front. He was up at ten thousand feet or so, more or less covering a
  low-flying photographer, when he saw a German machine coming over half a mile
  perhaps or more away as though it was looking for trouble. Peter knew he
  might funk a fight, and to escape that moral disaster, headed straight down
  for the German, who dropped and made off southward. Peter rejoicing at this
  flight, pursued, his eyes upon the quarry. Then from out of the sun came von
  Papen, swiftly and unsuspected, upon Peter's tail, and announced his presence
  by a whiff of bullets. Peter glanced over his shoulder to discover that he
  was caught.</p>

  <p>"Oh damn!" cried Peter, and ducked his head, and felt himself stung at the
  shoulder and wrist. Splinters were flying about him.</p>

  <p>He tried a side-slip, and as he did so he had an instant's vision of yet
  another machine, a Frenchman this time, falling like a bolt out of the blue
  upon his assailant. The biter was bit.</p>

  <p>Peter tried to come round and help, but he turned right over sideways and
  dropped, and suddenly found himself with the second Hun plane coming up right
  ahead of him. Peter blazed away, but God! how his wrist hurt him! He cursed
  life and death. He blazed away with his machine going over more and more, and
  the landscape rushing up over his head and then getting in front of him and
  circling round. For some seconds he did not know what was up and what was
  down. He continued to fire, firing earthward for a long second or so after
  his second enemy had disappeared from his vision.</p>

  <p>The world was spinning round faster and faster, and everything was moving
  away outward, faster and faster, as if it was all hastening to get out of his
  way....</p>

  <p>This surely was a spinning nose dive, the spinning nose dive&mdash;from
  within. Round and round. Confusing and giddy! Just as he had seen poor old
  Gordon go down.... But one didn't feel at all&mdash;as Peter had supposed one
  must feel&mdash;like an egg in an egg-whisk!...</p>

  <p>Down spun the aeroplane, as a maple fruit in autumn spins to the ground.
  Then this still living thing that had been Peter, all bloody and broken, made
  a last supreme effort. And his luck seconded his effort. The spin grew slower
  and flatter. Control of this lurching, eddying aeroplane seemed to come back,
  escaped again, mocked him. The ground was very near. Now! The sky swung up
  over the whirling propeller again and stayed above it, and again the machine
  obeyed a reasonable soul.</p>

  <p>He was out of it! Out of a nose dive! Yes. Steady! It is so easy when
  one's head is whirling to get back into a spin again. Steady!...</p>

  <p>He talked to himself. "Oh! good Peter! <i>Good</i> Peter! <i>Clever</i>
  Peter. Wonderful Mr. Toad! Stick it! Stick it!" But what a queer right hand
  it was! It was covered with blood. And it crumpled up in the middle when he
  clenched it! Never mind!</p>

  <p>He was in the lowest storey of the air. The Hun and the Frenchman up there
  were in another world.</p>

  <p>Down below, quite close&mdash;not five hundred feet now&mdash;were field-
  greys running and shooting at him. They were counting their chicken before he
  was hatched&mdash;no, smashed.... He wasn't done yet! Not by any manner of
  means! A wave of great cheerfulness and confidence buoyed up Peter. He felt
  equal to any enterprise. Should he drop and let the bawling Boche have a
  round or so?</p>

  <p>And there was a Hun machine smashed upside down on the ground. Was that
  the second fellow?</p>

  <p>Flick! a bullet!</p>

  <p>Wiser counsels came to Peter. This was no place for a sick and giddy man
  with a smashed and bleeding wrist. He must get away.</p>

  <p>Up! Which way was west? West? The sun rises in the east and sets in the
  west. But where had the sun got to? It was hidden by his wing. Shadows! The
  shadows would be pointing north-east, that was the tip.... Up! There were the
  Boche trenches. No, Boche reserve trenches.... Going west, going west....
  Rip! Snap! Bullet through the wing, and a wire flickering about. He ducked
  his head.... He put the machine up steeply to perhaps a thousand feet....</p>

  <p>He had an extraordinary feeling that he and the machine were growing and
  swelling, that they were getting bigger and bigger, and the sky and the world
  and everything else smaller. At last he was a monstrous man in a vast
  aeroplane in the tiniest of universes. He was as great as God.</p>

  <p>That wrist! And this blood! Blood! And great, glowing spots of blood that
  made one's sight indistinct....</p>

  <p>He coughed, and felt his mouth full of blood, and spat it out and
  retched....</p>

  <p>Then in an instant he was a little thing again, and the sky and the world
  were immense. He had a lucid interval.</p>

  <p>One ought to go up and help that Frenchman. Where were they fighting?...
  Up, anyhow!</p>

  <p>This must be No Man's Land. That crumpled little thing was a dead body
  surely. Barbed wire. More barbed wire.</p>

  <p>The engine was missing. Ugh! That fairly put the lid on!</p>

  <p>Peter was already asleep and dreaming. The great blood spots had returned
  and increased, but now they were getting black, they were black, huge black
  blotches; they blotted out the world!</p>

  <p>Peter, Peter as we have known him, discontinued existence....</p>

  <p>It was an automaton, aided by good luck, that dropped his machine half a
  mile behind the French trenches....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 15</h3>

  <p class="first">Peter had no memory of coming to again from his faint. For a
  long time he must have continued to be purely automatic. His flaming wrist
  was the centre of his being. Then for a time consciousness resumed, as
  abruptly as the thread of a story one finds upon the torn page of a
  novel.</p>

  <p>He found himself in the midst of a friendly group of pale blue uniforms;
  he was standing up and being very lively in spite of the strong taste of
  blood in his mouth and a feeling that his wrist was burning as a match burns,
  and that the left upper half of his body had been changed into a lump of raw
  and bleeding meat. He was talking a sort of French. "<i>C'est sacré bon
  stuff, cet eau-de-vie Française,</i>" he was saying gaily and rather
  loudly.</p>

  <p>"Haf some more," said a friendly voice.</p>

  <p>"Not half, old chap," said Peter, and felt at the time that this was not
  really good French.</p>

  <p>He tried to slap the man on the shoulder, but he couldn't.</p>

  <p>"<i>Bon</i>!" he said, "as we say in England," and felt that that remark
  also failed.</p>

  <p>Some one protested softly against his being given more brandy....</p>

  <p>Then this clear fragment ended again. There was a kind of dream of rather
  rough but efficient surgery upon a shoulder and arm that was quite probably
  his own, and some genially amiable conversation. There was a very nice
  Frenchman with a black beard and soft eyes, who wore a long white overall,
  and seemed to be looking after him as tenderly as a woman could do.</p>

  <p>But with these things mingled the matter of delirium. At one time the
  Kaiser prevailed in Peter's mind, a large, foolish, pompous person with waxed
  moustaches and distraught eyes, who crawled up to Peter over immense piles of
  white and grey and green rotting corpses, and began gnawing at his shoulder
  almost absent-mindedly. Peter struggled and protested. What business had this
  beastly German to come interfering with Peter's life? He started a vast
  argument about that, in which all sorts of people, including the nice-looking
  Frenchman in the white overall, took part.</p>

  <p>Peter was now making a formal complaint about the conduct of the universe.
  "No," he insisted time after time, "I will not deal with subordinates. I
  insist on seeing the Head," and so at last he found himself in the presence
  of the Lord God....</p>

  <p>But Peter's vision of the Lord God was the most delirious thing of all. He
  imagined him in an office, a little office in a vast building, and so out of
  the way that people had to ask each other which was the passage and which the
  staircase. Old men stood and argued at corners with Peter's girl-guide
  whether it was this way or that. People were being shown over the building by
  girl-guides; it was very like the London War Office, only more so; there were
  great numbers of visitors, and they all seemed to be in considerable hurry
  and distress, and most of them were looking for the Lord God to lodge a
  complaint and demand an explanation, just as Peter was. For a time all the
  visitors became wounded men, and nurses mixed up with the girl-guides, and
  Peter was being carried through fresh air to an ambulance train. His shoulder
  and wrist were very painful and singing, as it were, a throbbing duet
  together.</p>

  <p>For a time Peter did seem to see the Lord God; he was in his office, a
  little brown, rather tired-looking man in a kepi, and Peter was on a
  stretcher, and the Lord God or some one near him was saying: "Quel numéro?"
  But that passed away, and Peter was again conducting his exploration of the
  corridors with a girl-guide who was sometimes like Joan and sometimes like
  Hetty&mdash;and then there was a queer disposition to loiter in the
  passages.... For a time he sat in dishabillé while Hetty tried to explain
  God.... Dreams cross the scent of dreams.</p>

  <p>Then it seemed to Peter's fevered brain that he was siting, and had been
  sitting for a long time, in the little office of the Lord God of Heaven and
  Earth. And the Lord God had the likeness of a lean, tired,
  intelligent-looking oldish man, with an air of futile friendliness masking a
  fundamental indifference.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," the Lord God was saying, "do please put that cushion behind
  your poor shoulder. I can't bear to see you so uncomfortable. And tell me
  everything. Everything...."</p>

  <p>The office was the dingiest and untidiest little office it was possible to
  imagine. The desk at which God sat was in a terrible litter. On a side table
  were some grubby test tubes and bottles at which the Lord God had apparently
  been trying over a new element. The windows had not been cleaned for ages,
  they were dark with spiders' webs, they crawled with a buzzing nightmare of
  horrible and unmeaning life. It was a most unbusinesslike office. There were
  no proper files, no card indexes; bundles of dusty papers were thrust into
  open fixtures, papers littered the floors, and there were brass-handled
  drawers&mdash;. Peter looked again, and blood was oozing from these drawers
  and little cries came out of them. He glanced quickly at God, and God was
  looking at him. "But did you really make this world?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I <i>thought</i> I did,"said God.</p>

  <p>"But why did you do it? <i>Why</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, <i>there</i> you have me!" said the Lord God with bonhomie.</p>

  <p>"But why don't you exert yourself?" said Peter, hammering at the desk with
  his sound hand. "Why don't you exert yourself?"</p>

  <p>Could delirium have ever invented a more monstrous conception than this of
  Peter hammering on an untidy desk amidst old pen nibs, bits of sealing-wax,
  half-sheets of note-paper, returns of nature's waste, sample bones of
  projected animals, mineral samples, dirty little test tubes, and the like,
  and lecturing the Almighty upon the dreadful confusion into which the world
  had fallen? "Here was 1, sir, and millions like me, with a clear promise of
  life and freedom! And what are we now? Bruises, red bones, dead bodies! This
  German Kaiser fellow&mdash;an ass, sir, a perfect ass, gnawing a great hole
  in my shoulder! He and his son, stuffing themselves with a <i>Blutwurst</i>
  made out of all our lives and happiness! What does it mean, sir? Has it gone
  entirely out of your control? And it isn't as if the whole thing was
  ridiculous, sir. It isn't. In some ways it's an extraordinarily fine
  world&mdash;one has to admit that. That is why it is all so distressing, so
  unendurably distressing. I don't in the least want to leave it."</p>

  <p>"You admit that it's fine&mdash;in places," said the Lord God, as if he
  valued the admission.</p>

  <p>"But the management, sir! the management! <i>Yours</i>&mdash;ultimately.
  Don't you realize, sir? I had the greatest trouble in finding you. Half the
  messengers don't know where this den of yours is. It's forgotten. Practically
  <i>forgotten</i>. The Head Office! And now I'm here I can tell you everything
  is going to rack and ruin, driving straight to an absolute and final smash
  and break-up."</p>

  <p>"As bad as that?" said the Lord God.</p>

  <p>"It's the appalling waste," Peter continued. "The waste of material, the
  waste of us, the waste of everything. A sort of splendour in it, there is;
  touches of real genius about it, that I would be the last to deny; but that
  only increases the bitterness of the disorder. It's a good enough world to
  lament. It's a good enough life to resent having to lose it. There's some
  lovely things in it, sir; courage, endurance, and oh! many beautiful things.
  But when one gets here, when one begins to ask for you and hunt about for
  you, and finds this, this muddle, sir, then one begins to understand. Look at
  this room, consider it&mdash;as a general manager's room. No decency. No
  order. Everywhere the dust of ages, muck indescribable, bacteria! And
  that!"</p>

  <p>That was a cobweb across the grimy window pane, in which a freshly
  entangled bluebottle fly was buzzing fussily. "That ought not to be here at
  all," said Peter. "It really ought not to exist at all. Why does it? Look at
  that beastly spider in the corner! Why do you suffer all these cruel and
  unclean things?"</p>

  <p>"You don't like it?" said the Lord God, without any sign either of apology
  or explanation.</p>

  <p>"No," said Peter .</p>

  <p>"Then change it," said the Lord God, nodding his head as who should say
  "got you there."</p>

  <p>"But how are we to change it?"</p>

  <p>"If you have no will to change it, you have no right to criticize it,"
  said the Lord God, leaning back with the weariness of one who has had to
  argue with each generation from Job onward, precisely the same objections and
  precisely the same arguments.</p>

  <p>"After all," said the Lord God, giving Peter no time to speak further;
  "after all, you are three-and-twenty, Mr. Peter Stubland, and you've been
  pretty busy complaining of me and everything between me and you, your
  masters, pastors, teachers, and so forth, for the last half-dozen years.
  Meanwhile, is your own record good? Positive achievements, forgive me, are
  still to seek. You've been nearly drunk several times, you've soiled yourself
  with a lot of very cheap and greedy love-making&mdash;I gave you something
  beautiful there anyhow, and you knew that while you spoilt it&mdash;you've
  been a vigorous member of the consuming class, and really, you've got nothing
  clear and planned nothing at all. You complain of my lack of order; where's
  the order in your own mind? If I was the hot-tempered old autocrat some of
  you people pretend I am, I should have been tickling you up with a
  thunderbolt long ago. But I happen to have this democratic fad as badly as
  any one&mdash;Free Will is what they used to call it&mdash;and so I leave you
  to work out your own salvation. And if I leave you alone then I have to leave
  that other&mdash;that other Mr. Toad at Potsdam alone. He tries me, I admit,
  almost to the miracle pitch at times with the tone of his everlasting prepaid
  telegrams&mdash;but one has to be fair. What is sauce for the goose is sauce
  for the Kaiser. I've got to leave you all alone if I leave one alone. Don't
  you see that? In spite of the mess you are in. So don't blame me. Don't blame
  me. There isn't a thing in the whole of this concern of mine that Man can't
  control if only he chooses to control it. It's arranged like that. There's a
  lot more system here than you suspect, only it's too ingenious for you to
  see. It's yours to command. If you want a card index for the
  world&mdash;well, get a card index. I won't prevent you. If you don't like my
  spiders, kill my spiders. I'm not conceited about them. If you don't like the
  Kaiser, hang him, assassinate him. Why don't you abolish Kings? You could.
  But it was your sort, with your cheap and quick efficiency schemes, who set
  up Saul&mdash;in spite of my protests&mdash;ages ago.... Humanity either
  makes or breeds or tolerates all its own afflictions, great and small. Not my
  doing. Take Kings and Courts, Take dungheaps and flies. It's astonishing you
  people haven't killed off all the flies in the world long ago. They do no end
  of mischief, and it would be perfectly easy to do. They're purely
  educational. Purely. Even as you lie in hospital, there they are buzzing
  within an inch of your nose and landing on your poor forehead to remind you
  of what a properly organized humanity could do for its own comfort. But
  there's men in this world who want me to act as a fly-paper, simply because
  they are too lazy to get one for themselves. My dear Mr. Peter! if people
  haven't taught you properly, teach yourself. If they don't know enough, find
  out. It's all here. All here." He made a comprehensive gesture. "I'm not
  mocking you."</p>

  <p>"You're not mocking me?" said Peter keenly....</p>

  <p>"It depends upon you," said the Lord God with an enigmatic smile. "You
  asked me why I didn't exert myself. Well&mdash;why don't you exert
  yourself?</p>

  <p>"Why don't you exert yourself?" the Lord God repeated almost rudely,
  driving it home.</p>

  <p>"That pillow under your shoulder still isn't comfortable," said the Lord
  God, breaking off....</p>

  <p>The buzzing of the entangled fly changed to the drone of a passing
  aeroplane, and the dingy office expanded into a hospital ward. Some one was
  adjusting Peter's pillows....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 16</h3>

  <p class="first">If his shoulder-blade was to mend, Peter could not be moved;
  and for a time he remained in the French hospital in a long, airy room that
  was full mostly with flying men like himself. At first he could not talk very
  much, but later he made some friends. He was himself very immobile, but other
  men came and sat by him to talk.</p>

  <p>He talked chiefly to two Americans, who were serving at that time in the
  French flying corps. He found it much easier to talk English than French in
  his exhausted state, for though both he and Joan spoke French far above the
  average public school level, he found that now it came with an effort. It was
  as if his mind had for a time been pared down to its essentials.</p>

  <p>These Americans amused and interested him tremendously. He had met hardly
  any Americans before so as to talk to them at all intimately, but they
  suffered from an inhibition of French perhaps more permanent than his own,
  and so the three were thrown into an unlimited intimacy of conversation. At
  first he found these Americans rather fatiguing, and then he found them very
  refreshing because of their explicitness of mind. Except when they broke into
  frothy rapids of slang they were never allusive; in serious talk they said
  everything. They laid a firm foundation for all their assertions. That is the
  last thing an Englishman does. They talked of the war and of the prospect of
  America coming into the war, and of England and America and again of the war,
  and of the French and of the French and Americans and of the war, and of
  Taft's League to Enforce Peace and the true character of Wilson and Teddy and
  of the war, and of Sam Hughes and Hughes the Australian, and whether every
  country has the Hughes it deserves and of the war, and of going to England
  after the war, and of Stratford-on-Avon and Chester and Windsor, and of the
  peculiarities of English people. Their ideas of England Peter discovered were
  strange and picturesque. They believed ail Englishmen lived in a glow of
  personal loyalty to the Monarch, and were amazed to learn that Peter's
  sentiments were republican; and they thought that every Englishman dearly
  loved a lord. "We think that of Americans," said Peter. "That's our
  politeness," said they in a chorus, and started a train of profound
  discoveries in international relationships in Peter's mind.</p>

  <p>"The ideas of every country about every country are necessarily a little
  stale. What England is, what England thinks, and what England is becoming,
  isn't on record. What is on record is the England of the 'eighties and
  'nineties."</p>

  <p>"Now, that's very true," said the nearer American. "And you can apply it
  right away, with a hundred per cent. or so added, to all your ideas of
  America."</p>

  <p>As a consequence both sides in this leisurely discussion found how widely
  they had been out in their ideas about each other. Peter discovered America
  as not nearly so commercial and individualistic as he had supposed; he had
  been altogether ignorant of the increasing part the universities were playing
  in her affairs; the Americans were equally edified to find that the rampant
  imperialism of Cecil Rhodes and his group no longer ruled the British
  imagination. "If things are so," said the diplomatist in the nearer bed,
  "then I seem to see a lot more coming together between us than I've ever been
  disposed to think possible before. If you British aren't so keen over this
  king business&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>Keen</i>!" said Peter.</p>

  <p>"If you don't hold you are IT and unapproachable&mdash;in the way of
  Empires."</p>

  <p>"The Empire is yours for the asking," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Then all there is between us is the Atlantic&mdash;and that grows
  narrower every year. We're the same people."</p>

  <p>"So long as we have the same languages and literature," said Peter....</p>

  <p>From these talks onward Peter may be regarded as having a Foreign Policy
  of his own.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 17</h3>

  <p class="first">And it was in this hospital that Peter first clearly decided
  to become personally responsible for the reconstruction of the British
  Empire.</p>

  <p>This decision was precipitated by the sudden reappearance in his world of
  Mir Jelalludin, the Indian whom he had once thought unsuitable company for
  Joan.</p>

  <p>Peter had been dozing when Jelalludin appeared. He found him sitting
  beside the bed, and stared at the neat and smiling brown face, unable to
  place him, and still less able to account for the uniform he was wearing. For
  Jelalludin was wearing the uniform of the French aviator, and across his
  breast he wore four palms.</p>

  <p>"I had the pleasure of knowing you at Cambridge," said Mir Jelalludin in
  his Indian staccato. "Cha'med I was of use to you."</p>

  <p>An explanatory Frenchman standing beside the Indian dabbed his finger on
  the last of Jelalludin's decorations. "He killed von Papen after your crash,"
  said the Frenchman.</p>

  <p>"You were that Frenchman?" said Peter.</p>

  <p>"In your fight," said Mir Jelalludin.</p>

  <p>"He'd have finished me," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"I finished him," said the Indian, laughing with sheer happiness, and
  showing his beautiful teeth.</p>

  <p>Peter contemplated the situation. He made a movement and was reminded of
  his bandages.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could shake hands," he said.</p>

  <p>The Indian smiled with a phantom malice in his smile.</p>

  <p>Peter went bluntly to a question that had arisen in his mind. "Why aren't
  you in khaki?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The Brish' Gu'ment objects to Indian flyers," said Mir Jelalludin. "I
  tried. But Brish' Gu'ment thinks flying beyond us. And bad for Prestige.
  Prestige very important thing to Brish' Gu'ment. So I came to France."</p>

  <p>Peter continued to digest the situation.</p>

  <p>"Of course," said Jelalludin, "no commissions given in regular army to
  Indians. Brish' soldiers not allowed to s'lute Indian officers. Not part of
  the Great White Race. Otherwise hundreds of flyers could come from India,
  hundreds and hundreds. We play cricket&mdash;good horsemen. Many Indian
  gentlemen must be first-rate flying stuff. But Gu'ment says 'No."</p>

  <p>He continued to smile more cheerfully than ever.</p>

  <p>"Hundreds of juvenile Indians ready and willing to be killed for your
  Empire"&mdash;he rubbed it in&mdash;"but&mdash;No, Thank You. Indo-European
  people we are, Aryans, more consanguineous than Jews or Japanese. Ready to
  take our places beside you.... Well, anyhow, I rejoice to see that you are
  recovering to entire satisfaction. It was only when I descended after the
  fight that I perceived that it was you, and it seemed to me then that you
  were very seriously injured. I was anxious. And mem'ries of otha days. I felt
  I must see you."</p>

  <p>Peter and the young Indian looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Jelalludin," he said, "I must apologize."</p>

  <p>"But why?"</p>

  <p>"As part of the British Empire. No! don't interrupt. I do. But, I say, do
  they&mdash;do we really bar you&mdash;absolutely?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. Not only from the air force, but from any commission at all.
  The lowest little bazaar clerk from Clap-ham, who has got a commission, is
  over our Indian officers&mdash;over our princes. It is an everlasting
  humiliation. Necessary for Prestige."</p>

  <p>"The French have more sense, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"They take us on our merits.</p>

  <p>"If I had a British commission," said Jelalludin, "I should be made very
  uncomfortable. It is the way with British officers and gentlemen. The French
  are not so&mdash;particular."</p>

  <p>"At present," said Peter, "I can't be moved."</p>

  <p>"You improve."</p>

  <p>"But when I get up this is one of the things I have to see to. You see,
  Jelalludin, this Empire of ours&mdash;yours and mine&mdash;has got into the
  hands of a gang of gory Old Fools. Partly my negligence&mdash;as God
  said."</p>

  <p>"God? "said Jelalludin.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing! I mean we young men haven't been given a proper grasp of the
  Indian situation. Or any situation.</p>

  <p>No. This business of the commissions! after all that</p>

  <p>you fellows have done here in France! It's disgraceful. You see, we don't
  see or learn anything about India. Even at Cambridge&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You didn't see much of us there," smiled the Indian.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"I didn't come to talk about this," said Jelalludin, "it came out."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad it came out," said Peter.</p>

  <p>A pause.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't tire you," said Mir Jelalludin, and rose to go.</p>

  <p>Peter thanked him for coming.</p>

  <p>"And your cha'ming sister?" asked the Indian, as if by an
  afterthought.</p>

  <p>"Foster sister. She drives a big car about London," said Peter....</p>

  <p>Peter meditated profoundly upon that interview for some days.</p>

  <p>Then he tried over the opinions of the Americans about India. But
  Americans are of little help to the British about India. Their simple
  uncriticized colour prejudice covers all "Asiatics" except the inhabitants of
  Siberia. They had a more than English ignorance of ethnology, and Oswald had
  at least imparted some fragments of that important science to his ward. Their
  working classification of mankind was into Anglo-Saxons, Frenchmen, Sheenies,
  Irishmen, Dutchmen, Dagoes, Chinks, Coloured People, and black Niggers. They
  esteemed Mir Jelalludin a Coloured Person. Peter had to fall back upon
  himself again.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 18</h3>

  <p class="first">It contributed to the thoroughness of Peter's thinking that
  it was some time before he could be put into a position to read comfortably.
  And it has to be recorded in the teeth of the dictates of sentiments and the
  most sacred traditions of romance that the role played by both Joan and Hetty
  in these meditations was secondary and incidental. It was an attenuated and
  abstract Peter who lay in the French hospital, his chief link of sense with
  life was a growing hunger; he thought very much about fate, pain, the nature
  of things, and God, and very little about persons and personal
  incidents&mdash;and so strong an effect had his dream that God remained fixed
  steadfastly in his mind as that same intellectual non-interventionist whom he
  had visited in the fly-blown office. But about God's rankling repartee, "Why
  don't you exert yourself?" there was accumulating a new conception, the
  conception of Man taking hold of the world, unassisted by God but with the
  acquiescence of God, and in fulfilment of some remote, incomprehensible
  planning on the part of God. Probably Peter in thinking this was following
  one of the most ancient and well-beaten of speculative paths, but it seemed
  to him that it was a new way of thinking. And he was Man. It was he who had
  to establish justice in the earth, achieve unity, and rule first the world
  and then the stars.</p>

  <p>He lay staring at the ceiling, and quite happy now that healing and
  habituation had freed him from positive pain, thinking out how he was to
  release and co-operate with his India, which had invariably the face of Mir
  Jelalludin, how he was to reunite himself with his brothers in America, and
  how the walls and divisions of mankind, which look so high and invincible
  upon the ground and so trivial from twelve thousand feet above, were to be
  subdued to such greater ends.</p>

  <p>It was only as the blood corpuscles multiplied inside him that Peter
  ceased to be constantly Man contemplating his Destiny and Races and Empires,
  and for more and more hours in the day shrank to the dimensions and natural
  warmth of Mr. Peter Stubland contemplating convalescence in Blighty. He
  became eager first for the dear old indulgent and welcoming house at Pelham
  Ford, and then for prowls and walks and gossip with Joan and Oswald, and
  then, then for London and a little "fun." Life was ebbing back into what is
  understood to be the lower nature, and was certainly the most intimate and
  distinctive substance of Mr. Peter Stubland. His correspondence became of
  very great interest to him. Certain letters from Joan, faint but pursuing,
  had reached him, those letters over which Joan had sat like a sonneteer. He
  read them and warmed to them. He thought what luck it was that he had a Joan
  to be the best of sisters to him, to be even more than a sister. She was the
  best friend he had, and it was jolly to read so plainly that he was her best
  friend. He would like to do work with Joan better than with any man he knew.
  Driving a car wasn't half good enough for her. Some day he'd be able to show
  her how to fly, and he would. It would be great fun going up with Joan on a
  double control and letting her take over.</p>

  <p>There must be girls in the world who would fly as well as any man, or
  better.</p>

  <p>He scribbled these ideas in his first letter to Joan, and they pleased her
  mightily. To fly with Peter would be surely to fly straight into heaven.</p>

  <p>And mixed up with Joan's letters were others that he presently sorted out
  from hers and put apart, as though even letters might hold inconvenient
  communion. For the most part they came from Hetty Reinhart, and displayed the
  emotions of a consciously delicious female enamoured and enslaved by one of
  the heroes of the air. She had dreamt of him coming in through the skylight
  of her studio, Lord Cupid visiting his poor little Psyche&mdash;"but it was
  only the moonlight," and she thought of him now always with great
  overshadowing wings. Sometimes they were great white wings that beat above
  her, and sometimes they were thrillingly soft and exquisite wings, like the
  wings of the people in <i>Peter Wilkins</i>. She sent him a copy of <i>Peter
  Wilkins</i>, book beloved by Poe and all readers of the fantastic. Then came
  the news of his smash. She had been clever enough to link it with the death
  of von Papen, the Hun Matador. "Was that your fight, dear Peterkins? Did you
  begin on Goliath?" As the cordials of recovery raced through Peter's veins
  there were phases when the thought of visiting the yielding fair, Jovelike
  and triumphant in winged glory, became not simply attractive but insistent.
  But he wrote to Hetty modestly, "They've clipped one wing for ever."</p>

  <p>And so in a quite artless and inevitable way Peter found his first leave,
  when the British hospital had done with him, mortgaged up to hilt almost
  equally to dear friend Joan and to Cleopatra Hetty.</p>

  <p>The young man only realized the duplicity of his nature and the
  complications of his position as the hospital boat beat its homeward way
  across the Channel. The night was smooth and fine, with a high full moon
  which somehow suggested Hetty, and with a cloud scheme of great beauty and
  distinction that had about it a flavour of Joan. And as he meditated upon
  these complications that had been happening in his more personal life while
  his attention had been still largely occupied with divinity and politics, he
  was hailed by an unfamiliar voice and addressed as "Simon Peter."</p>

  <p>"Excuse me," said the stout young officer tucked up warmly upon the next
  deck chair between a pair of crutches, "but aren't you Simon Peter?"</p>

  <p>Peter had heard that name somewhere before. "My name's Stubland," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"Ah! Stubland! I forgot your surname. Of High Cross School?"</p>

  <p>Peter peered and saw a round fair face that slowly recalled memories.
  "Wait a moment!" said Peter.... "Ames!"</p>

  <p>"Guessed it in one. Probyn and I were chums."</p>

  <p>"What have you got?" said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Leg below the knee off, damn it!" said Ames. "One month at the front. Not
  much of a career. But they say they do you a leg now better than reality. But
  I'd have liked to have batted the pants of the unspeakable Hun a bit more
  before I retired. What have you got?"</p>

  <p>"Wrist chiefly and shoulder-blade. Air fight. After six weeks."</p>

  <p>"Does you out?"</p>

  <p>"For flying, I'm afraid. But there's lots of ground jobs. And
  anyhow&mdash;home's pleasant."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ames. "Home's pleasant. But I'd like to have got a scalp of
  some sort. Doubt if I killed a single Hun. D'you remember Probyn at
  school?&mdash;a dark chap."</p>

  <p>Peter found he still hated Probyn. "I remember him," he said.</p>

  <p>"He's killed. He got the M.M. and the V.C. He wouldn't take a commission.
  He was sergeant-major in my battalion. I just saw him, but I've heard about
  him since. His men worshipped him. Queer how men come out in a new light in
  this war."</p>

  <p>"How was he killed?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>"In a raid. He was with a bombing party, and three men straggled up a sap
  and got cornered. He'd taken two machine-guns and they'd used most of the
  bombs, and his officer was knocked out, so he sent the rest of his party back
  with the stuff and went to fetch his other men. One had been hit and the
  other two were thinking of surrendering when he came back to them. He stood
  right up on the parados, they say, and slung bombs at the Germans, a whole
  crowd of them, until they went back. His two chaps got the wounded man out
  and carried him back, and left him still slinging bombs. He'd do that. He'd
  stand right up and bung bombs at them until they seemed to lose their heads.
  Then he seems to have spotted that this particular bunch of Germans had gone
  back into a sort of blind alley. He was very quick at spotting a situation,
  and he followed them up, and the sheer blank recklessness of it seems to have
  put their wind up absolutely. They'd got bombs and there was an officer with
  them. But they held up their hands&mdash;nine of them. Panic. He got them
  right across to our trenches before the searchlights found him, and the
  Germans got him and two of their own chaps with a machine-gun. That was just
  the last thing he did. He'd been going about for months doing stunts like
  that&mdash;sort of charmed life business. The way he slung bombs, they say,
  amounted to genius.</p>

  <p>"They say he'd let his hair grow long&mdash;perfect golliwog. When I saw
  him it certainly was long, but he'd got it plastered down. And there's a
  story that he used to put white on his face like a clown with a great red
  mouth reaching from ear to ear Yes, painted on. It's put the Huns' wind up
  something frightful. Coming suddenly on a chap like that in the glare of a
  searchlight or a flare."</p>

  <p>"Queer end," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Queer chap altogether," said Ames....</p>

  <p>He thought for a time, and then went on to philosophize about Probyn.</p>

  <p>"Clever chap he was," said Ames, "but an absolute failure. Of course old
  High Cross wasn't anything very much in the way of a school, but whatever
  there was to be learnt there he learnt. He was the only one of us who ever
  got hold of speaking French. I heard him over there&mdash;regular fluent. And
  he'd got a memory like an encyclopaedia. I always said he'd do
  wonders...."</p>

  <p>Ames paused. "Sex was his downfall," said Ames.</p>

  <p>"I saw a lot of him altogether, off and on, right up to the time of the
  war," said Ames. "My people are furniture people, you know, in Tottenham
  Court Road, and his were in the public-house fitting line&mdash;in Highbury.
  We went about together. I saw him make three or four good starts, but there
  was always some trouble. I suppose most of us were a bit&mdash;well, keen on
  sex; most of us young men. But he was ravenous. Even at school. Always on it.
  Always thinking about it. I could tell you stories of him.... Rum place that
  old school was, come to think of it. They left us about too much. I don't
  know how far you....</p>

  <p>Of course you were about the most innocent thing that ever came to High
  Cross School," said Ames.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Peter. "I suppose I was."</p>

  <p>"Curious how it gnaws at you once it's set going," said Ames....</p>

  <p>Peter made a noise that might have been assent.</p>

  <p>Ames remained thinking for a time, watching the swish and surge of the
  black Channel waters. Peter pursued their common topic in silence.</p>

  <p>"What's the sense of it?" said Ames, plunging towards philosophy.</p>

  <p>"It's the system on which life goes&mdash;on this planet," Peter
  contributed, but Ames had not had a biological training, and was unprepared
  to take that up.</p>

  <p>"Too much of it," said Ames.</p>

  <p>"Over-sexed," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Whether one ought to hold oneself in or let oneself go," said Ames. "But
  perhaps these things don't bother you?"</p>

  <p>Peter wasn't disposed towards confidences with Ames. "I'm moderate in all
  things," he said.</p>

  <p>"Lucky chap! I've worried about this business no end. One doesn't want to
  use up all one's life like a blessed monkey. There's other things in
  life&mdash;if only this everlasting want-a-girl want-a-woman would let one
  get at them."</p>

  <p>His voice at Peter's shoulder ceased for a while, and then resumed. "It's
  the best chaps, seems to me, who get it worst. Chaps with imaginations, I
  mean, men of vitality. Take old Probyn. He could have done
  anything&mdash;anything. And he was eaten up. Like a fever...."</p>

  <p>Ames went down into a black silence for a couple of minutes or more, and
  came up again with an astonishing resolution. "I shall marry," he said.</p>

  <p>"Got the lady?" asked Peter. "Near enough," said Ames darkly.</p>

  <p>"St. Paul's method," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"I was talking to a fellow the other day," said Ames. "He'd got a curious
  idea. Something in it perhaps. He said that every one was clean-minded and
  romantic, that's how he put it, about sixteen or seventeen. Even if you've
  been a bit dirty as a schoolboy you sort of clean up then. Adolescence, in
  fact. And he said you ought to fall in love and pair off then. Kind of Romeo
  and Juliet business. First love and all that."</p>

  <p>"Juliet wasn't exactly Romeo's first love," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Young beggar!" said Ames. "But, anyhow, that was only by way of
  illustration. His idea was that we'd sort of put off marriage and all that
  sort of thing later and later. Twenty-eight. Thirty. Thirty-five even. And
  that put us wrong. We kind of curdled and fermented. Spoilt with keeping.
  Larked about with girls we didn't care for. Demi-vierge stunts and all that.
  Got promiscuous. Let anything do. His idea was you'd got to pair off with a
  girl and look after her, and she look after you. And keep faith. And stop all
  stray mucking about. * Settle down to a healthy sexual peace,' he said."</p>

  <p>Ames paused. "Something in it?"</p>

  <p>"Ever read the <i>Life of Lord Herbert of Cherbury</i>?" asked Peter.</p>

  <p>"Never."</p>

  <p>"He worked out that theory quite successfully. Married before he went up
  to Oxford. There's a lot in it. Sex. Delayed. Fretting. Overflowing. Getting
  experimental and nasty.... But that doesn't exhaust the question. The Old
  Experimenter sits there&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>What</i> experimenter?" "The chap who started it all. There's no way
  yet of fitting it up perfectly. We've got to make it fit."</p>

  <p>Peter was so interested that he forgot his aversion from confiding in
  Ames. The subject carried him on.</p>

  <p>"Any healthy young man," Peter generalized, "could be happy and contented
  with any pretty girl, so far as love-making goes. It doesn't strike
  you&mdash;as a particularly recondite art, eh? But you've got to be in love
  with each other generally. That's more difficult. You've got to talk together
  and go about together. In a complicated artificial world. The sort of woman
  it's easy and pleasant to make love to, may not be the sort of woman you
  really think splendid. It's easier to make love to a woman you don't
  particularly respect, who's good fun, and all that. Which is just the reason
  why you wouldn't be tied up with her for ever. No."</p>

  <p>"So we worship the angels and marry the flappers," said Ames.... "I shan't
  do that, anyhow. The fact is, one needs a kind of motherliness in a
  woman."</p>

  <p>"By making love too serious, we've made it not serious enough," said Peter
  with oracular profundity, and then in reaction, "Oh! <i>I</i> don't
  know."</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> don't know," said Ames.</p>

  <p>"Which doesn't in the least absolve us from the necessity of going on
  living right away."</p>

  <p>"I shall marry," said Ames, in a tone of unalterable resolve.</p>

  <p>They lapsed into self-centred meditations....</p>

  <p>"Why! there's the coast," said Ames suddenly. "Quite close, too.
  <i>Dark</i>. Do you remember, before the war, how the lights of Folkestone
  used to run along the top there like a necklace of fire?"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 19</h3>

  <p class="first">The powers that were set over Peter's life played fast and
  loose with him in the matter of leave. They treated him at first as though he
  was a rare and precious hero&mdash;who had to be saved from his friends. They
  put him to mend at Broadstairs, and while he was at Broadstairs he had three
  visits from Hetty, whose days were free, and only one hasty Sunday glimpse of
  Joan, who was much in demand at the Ministry of Munitions. And Oswald could
  not come to see him because Oswald himself was a casualty mending slowly at
  Pelham Ford. Hetty and Joan and returning health fired the mind of Peter with
  great expectations of the leave that was to come. These expectations were, so
  to speak, painted in panels. Forgetful of the plain fact that a Joan who was
  not available at Broadstairs would also not be available at Pelham Ford, the
  panels devoted to the latter place invariably included Joan as a principal
  figure, they represented leave as a glorious escape from war to the space,
  the sunshine, the endlessness of such a summer vacation as only schoolboys
  know. lie* would be climbing trees with Joan, "mucking about" in the boats
  with Joan, lying on the lawn just on the edge of the cedar's shadow with
  Joan, nibbling stems of grass. The London scenes were narrower and more
  intense. He wanted the glitter and fun of lunching in the Carlton grill-room
  or dining at the Criterion, in the company of a tremendous hat and
  transparent lace, and there were scenes in Hetty's studio, quite a lot of
  fantastic and elemental scenes in Hetty's studio.</p>

  <p>But the Germans have wiped those days of limitless leisure out of the life
  of mankind. Even our schoolboys stay up in their holidays now to make
  munitions. Peter had scarcely clambered past the approval of a medical board
  before active service snatched him again. He was wanted urgently. Peter was
  no good as a pilot any more, it was true; his right wrist was doomed to be
  stiff and weak henceforth, and there were queer little limitations upon the
  swing of his arm, but the powers had suddenly discovered other uses for him.
  There was more of Peter still left than they had assumed at first. For one
  particular job, indeed, he was just the man they needed. They docked him a
  wing&mdash;it seemed in mockery of the state of his arm&mdash;and replaced
  the two wings that had adorned him by one attached to the letter O, and they
  marked him down to join "balloons" at the earliest possible moment, for just
  then they were developing kite balloons very fast for artillery observation,
  and were eager for any available men. Peter was slung out into freedom for
  one-and-twenty days, and then told to report himself for special instruction
  in the new work at Richmond Park.</p>

  <p>One and-twenty days! He had never been so inordinately greedy for life,
  free to live and go as you please, in all his days before. Something must
  happen, he was resolved, something bright and intense, on every one of those
  days. He snatched at both sides of life. He went down to Pelham Ford, but he
  had a little list of engagements in town in his pocket. Joan was not down
  there, and never before had he realized how tremendously absent Joan could
  be. And then at the week-end she couldn't come. There were French and British
  G.H.Q. bigwigs to take down to some experiments in Sussex, but she couldn't
  even explain that, she had to send a telegram at the eleventh hour: "
  Week-end impossible." To Peter that seemed the most brutally offhand evasion
  in the world. Peter was disappointed in Pelham Ford. It was altogether
  different from those hospital dreams; even the weather, to begin with, was
  chilly and unsettled. Oswald had had a set-back with his knee, and had to
  keep his leg up on a deck chair; he could only limp about on crutches, lie
  seemed older and more distant from Peter than he had ever been before; Peter
  was obsessed by the idea that he ought to be treated with solicitude, and a
  further gap was opened between them by Peter's subaltern habit of saying
  "Sir" instead of the old familiar "Nobby." Peter sat beside the deck chair
  through long and friendly, but very impatient hours; and he talked all the
  flying shop he could, and Oswald talked of his Africans, and they went over
  the war and newspapers again and again, and they reverted to Africa and
  flying shop, and presently they sat through several silences, and at the end
  of one of them Oswald inquired: "Have you ever played chess, Peter&mdash;or
  piquet?"</p>

  <p>Now chess and piquet are very good pastimes in their way, but not good
  enough for the precious afternoons of a very animated and greedy young man
  keenly aware that they are probably his last holiday afternoons on earth.</p>

  <p>Sentiment requires that Peter should have gone to London and devoted
  himself to adorning the marginal freedom of Joan's days. He did do this once.
  He took her out to dinner to Jules', in Jermyn Street; he did her well there;
  but she was a very tired Joan that day; she had driven a good hundred and
  fifty miles, and, truth to tell, in those days Peter did not like Joan and
  she did not like herself in London, and more especially in smart London
  restaurants. They sat a little aloof from one another, and about them all the
  young couples warmed to another and smiled. She jarred with this atmosphere
  of meretricious ease and indulgence. She had had no time to get back to
  Hampstead and change; she was at a disadvantage in her uniform. It became a
  hair shirt, a Nessus shirt as the evening proceeded. It emphasized the
  barrier of seriousness between them cruelly. She was a policeman, a prig, the
  harshest thing in life; all those pretty little cocottes and flirts, with
  their little soft brightnesses and adornments, must be glancing at her
  coarse, unrevealing garments and noting her for the fool she was. She felt
  ugly and ungainly; she was far too much tormented by love to handle herself
  well. She could get no swing and forgetfulness into the talk. And about
  Peter, too, was a reproach for her. He talked of work and the war&mdash;as if
  in irony. And his eyes wandered. Naturally, his eyes wandered.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, old Peter," she said when they parted.</p>

  <p>She lay awake for two hours, exasperated, miserable beyond tears, because
  she had not said: "Good night, old Peter dear." She had intended to say it.
  It was one of her prepared effects. But she was a weary and a frozen young
  woman. Duty had robbed her of the energy for love. Why had she let things
  come to this pass? Peter was her business, and Peter alone. She damned the
  Woman's Legion, Woman's Part in the War, and all the rest of it, with fluency
  and sincerity.</p>

  <p>And while Joan wasted the hours of sleep in this fashion Peter was also
  awake thinking over certain schemes he had discussed with Hetty that
  afternoon. They involved some careful and deliberate lying. The idea was that
  for the purposes of Pelham Ford he should terminate his leave on the
  fourteenth instead of the twenty-first, and so get a clear week
  free&mdash;for life in the vein of Hetty.</p>

  <p>He lay fretting, and the hot greed of youth persuaded him, and the clean
  honour of youth reproached him. And though he knew the way the decision would
  go, he tossed about and damned as heartily as Joan.</p>

  <p>He could not remember if at Pelham Ford he had set a positive date to his
  leave, but, anyhow, it would not be difficult to make out that there had been
  some sort of urgent call.... It could be done.... The alternative was
  Piquet.</p>

  <p>Peter returned to Pelham Ford and put his little fabric of lies upon
  Oswald without much difficulty. Then at the week-end came Joan, rejoicing.
  She came into the house tumultuously; she had caught a train earlier than the
  one they had expected her to come by. "I've got all next week. Seven days,
  Petah! Never mind how, but I've got it. I've got it!"</p>

  <p>There was a suggestion as of some desperate battle away there in London
  from which Joan had snatched these fruits of victory. She was so radiantly
  glad to have them that Peter recoiled from an immediate reply.</p>

  <p>"I didn't seem to see you in London somehow," said Joan. "I don't think
  you were really there. Let's have a look at you, old Petah. Tenshun!... Lift
  the arm.... Rotate the arm.... It isn't so bad, Petah, after all. Is tennis
  possible?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to try."</p>

  <p>"Boats certainly. No reason why we shouldn't have two or three long walks.
  A week's a long time nowadays."</p>

  <p>"But I have to go back on Monday," said Peter.</p>

  <p>Joan stood stock still.</p>

  <p>"Pity, isn't it?" said Peter weakly.</p>

  <p>"But why?" she asked at last in a little flat voice.</p>

  <p>"I have to go back."</p>

  <p>"But your leave?:</p>

  <p>"Ends on Monday," lied Peter.</p>

  <p>For some moments it looked as though Joan meant to make that last week-end
  a black one. "That doesn't give us much time together," said Joan, and her
  voice which had soared now crawled the earth.... "I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>Just for a moment she hung, a dark and wounded Joan, downcast and
  thoughtful; and then turned and put her arms akimbo, and looked at him and
  smiled awry. "Well, old Peter, then we've got to make the best use of our
  time. It's your Birf Day, sort of; it's your Bank Holiday, dear; it's every
  blessed thing for you&mdash;such time as we have together. Before they take
  you off again. I think they're greedy, but it can't be helped. Can it,
  Peter?"</p>

  <p>"It can't be helped," said Peter. "No."</p>

  <p>They paused.</p>

  <p>"What shall we do?" said Joan. "The program's got to be cut down. Shall we
  still try tennis?"</p>

  <p>"I want to. I don't see why this wrist " He held it</p>

  <p>out and rotated it.</p>

  <p>"Good old arm!" said Joan, and ran a hand along it.</p>

  <p>"I'll go and change these breeches and things," said Joan. "And get myself
  female. Gods, Peter! the craving to get into clothes that are really flexible
  and translucent!"</p>

  <p>She went to the staircase and then turned on Peter.</p>

  <p>"Peter,"she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Go out and stand on the lawn and tighten up the net. Now."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Then I can see you from my window while I'm changing. I don't want to
  waste a bit of you."</p>

  <p>She went up four steps and stopped and looked at him over her
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I want as much as I can get of you, Petah," she said.</p>

  <p>"I wish I'd known about that week," said Peter stupidly.</p>

  <p>"<i>Exactly</i>!" said Joan to herself, and flitted up the
  staircase.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 20</h3>

  <p class="first">Joan, Mrs. Moxton perceived that afternoon, had a swift and
  angry fight with her summer wardrobe. Both the pink gingham and the white
  drill had been tried on and flung aside, and she had decided at last upon a
  rather jolly warm blue figured voile with a belt of cherry-coloured ribbon
  that suited her brown skin and black hair better than those weaker supports.
  She had evidently opened every drawer in her room in a hasty search for white
  silk stockings.</p>

  <p>When she came out into the sunshine of the garden Peter's eyes told her
  she had guessed the right costume.</p>

  <p>Oswald was standing up on his crutches and smiling, and Peter was throwing
  up a racquet and catching it again with one hand.</p>

  <p>"Thank God for a left-handed childhood!" said Peter. "I'm going to smash
  you, Joan."</p>

  <p>"I forgot about that," said Joan. "But you aren't going to smash me, old
  Petah."</p>

  <p>When tea-time came they were still fighting the seventh vantage game, and
  Joan was up.</p>

  <p>They came and sat at the tea-table, and Joan as she poured the tea
  reflected that a young man in white flannels, flushed and a little out of
  breath, with his white silk shirt wide open at the neck, was a more beautiful
  thing than the most beautiful woman alive. And her dark eyes looked at the
  careless and exhausted Peter, that urgent and insoluble problem, while she
  counted, "Twenty-four, thirty-six, forty-one&mdash;about forty-one hours. How
  the devil shall I do it?"</p>

  <p>It wasn't to be done at tennis anyhow, and she lost the next three games
  running without apparent effort, and took Peter by the arm and walked him
  about the garden, discoursing on flying. "I must teach you to fly," said
  Peter. "Often when I've been up alone I've thought, 'Some day I'll teach old
  Joan.'"</p>

  <p>"That's a promise, Petah."</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Peter, who had not suffered next to two Americans for
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"I've got it in writing," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather learn from you than any one," said she.</p>

  <p>Peter discoursed of stunts....</p>

  <p>They spent a long golden time revisiting odd corners in which they had
  played together. They went down the village and up to the church and round
  the edge of the wood, and there they came upon and devoured a lot of
  blackberries, and then they went down to the mill pond and sat for a time in
  Baker's boat. Then they got at cross purposes about dressing for dinner. Joan
  wanted to dress very much. She wanted to remind Peter that there were
  prettier arms in the world than Hetty Reinhart's, and a better modelled neck
  and shoulders. She had a new dress of ivory silk with a broad belt of velvet
  that echoed the bright softness of her eyes and hair. But Peter would not let
  her dress. He did not want to dress himself. "And you couldn't look prettier,
  Joan, than you do in that blue thing. It's so like you."</p>

  <p>And as Joan couldn't explain that the frock kept her a golly girl he knew
  while the dress would have shown him the beautiful woman he had to discover,
  she lost that point in the game. And tomorrow was Sunday, when Pelham Ford
  after the good custom of England never dressed for dinner.</p>

  <p>Afterwards she thought how easily she might have overruled him.</p>

  <p>Joan's plans for the evening were dashed by this costume failure. She had
  relied altogether on the change of personality into something rich and
  strange, that the ivory dress was to have wrought. She could do nothing to
  develop the situation. Everything seemed to be helping to intensify her
  sisterliness. Oswald was rather seedy, and the three of them, played Auction
  Bridge with a dummy. She had meant to sit up with Peter, but it didn't work
  out like that.</p>

  <p>"Good night, Petah dear," she said outside her bedroom door with the
  candle-light shining red between the fingers of her hand.</p>

  <p>"Good night, old Joan," he said from his door-mat, with an infinite
  friendliness in his voice.</p>

  <p>You cannot kiss a man good night suddenly when he is fifteen yards
  away....</p>

  <p>She closed the door behind her softly, put down her candle, and began to
  walk about her room and swear in an entirely unladylike fashion. Then she
  went over to the open window, wringing her hands. "How am I to do it?" she
  said. "How am I to do it? The situation's preposterous. He's mine. And I
  might be his sister!"</p>

  <p>"Shall I make a declaration?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose Hetty did."</p>

  <p>But all the cunning of Joan was unavailing against the invisible barriers
  to passion between herself and Peter. They spent a long Sunday of
  comradeship, and courage and opportunity alike failed. The dawn on Monday
  morning found a white and haggard Joan pacing her floor, half minded to
  attempt a desperate explanation forthwith in Peter's bedroom with a suddenly
  awakened Peter. Only her fear of shocking him and failing restrained her. She
  raved. She indulged in absurd soliloquys and still absurder prayers. "Oh,
  God, give me my Peter," she prayed. "<i>Give me my Peter!</i>"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 21</h3>

  <p class="first">Monday broke clear and fine, with a September freshness in
  the sunshine. Breakfast was an awkward meal; Peter was constrained, Oswald
  was worried by a sense of advice and counsels not given; Joan felt the
  situation slipping from her helpless grasp. It was with a sense of relief
  that at last she put on her khaki overcoat to drive Peter to the station. 11
  This is the end," sang in Joan's mind. "This is the end." She glanced at the
  mirror in the hall and saw that the fur collar was not unfriendly to her
  white neck and throat. She was in despair, but she did not mean to let it
  become an unbecoming despair&mdash;at least until Peter had departed. The end
  was still incomplete. She had something stern and unpleasant to say to Peter
  before they parted, but she did not mean to look stern or unpleasant while
  she said it. Peter, she noted with a gleam of satisfaction, was in low
  spirits. He was sorry to go. He was ashamed of himself, but also he was
  sorry. That was something, at any rate, to have achieved. But he was
  going&mdash;nevertheless.</p>

  <p>She brought round the little Singer to the door. She started the engine
  with a competent swing and got in. The maids came with Peter's portmanteau
  and belongings. "This is the end," said Joan to herself, touching her
  accelerator and with her hand ready to release the brake. "All aboard?" said
  Joan aloud.</p>

  <p>Peter shook hands with Oswald over the side of the car, and glanced from
  him to the house and back at him. "I wish I could stay longer, sir," said
  Peter.</p>

  <p>"There's many days to come yet," said Oswald. For we never mention death
  before death in war time; we never let ourselves think of it before it comes
  or after it has come.</p>

  <p>"So long, Nobby!"</p>

  <p>"Good luck, Peter!"</p>

  <p>Joan put the car into gear, and steered out into the road.</p>

  <p>"The water-splash is lower than ever I've seen it," said Peter.</p>

  <p>They ran down the road to the station almost in silence. "These poplars
  have got a touch of autumn in them already," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"It's an early year," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"The end, the end!" sang the song in Joan's brain. "But I'll tell him all
  the same."...</p>

  <p>But she did not tell him until they could hear the sound of the
  approaching train that was to cut the thread of everything for Joan. They
  walked together up the little platform to the end.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry you're going," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"I'm infernally sorry. If I'd known you'd get this week&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Would that have altered it?" she said sharply.</p>

  <p>"No. I suppose it wouldn't," he fenced, just in time to save himself.</p>

  <p>The rattle of the approaching train grew suddenly loud, It was round the
  bend.</p>

  <p>Joan spoke in a perfectly even voice. "I know you have been lying, Peter.
  I have known it all this week-end. I know your leave lasts until the twenty-
  first."</p>

  <p>He stared at her in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"There was a time.... It's to think of all this dirt upon you that hurts
  most. The lies, the dodges, the shuffling meanness of it. From <i>you</i>....
  Whom <i>I love</i>."</p>

  <p>A gap of silence came. To the old porter twelve yards off they seemed
  entirely well-behaved and well-disciplined young people, saying nothing in
  particular. The train came in with a sort of wink under the bridge, and the
  engine and foremost carriages ran past them up the platform.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could explain. I didn't know The fact is</p>

  <p>I got entangled in a sort of promise...."</p>

  <p>"<i>Hetty</i>!" Joan jerked out, and "There's an empty first for you."</p>

  <p>The train stopped.</p>

  <p>Peter put his hand on the handle of the carriage door.</p>

  <p>"You go to London&mdash;like a puppy that rolls in dirt. You go to
  beastliness and vulgarity.... You'd better get in, Peter."</p>

  <p>"But look here, Joan!"</p>

  <p>"<i>Get</i> in!" she scolded to his hesitation, and stamped her foot.</p>

  <p>He got in mechanically, and she closed the door on him and turned the
  handle and stood holding it.</p>

  <p>Then still speaking evenly and quietly, she said: "You're a blind fool,
  Peter. What sort of love can that&mdash;that&mdash;that miscellany give you,
  that / couldn't give? Have I no life? Have I no beauty? Are you afraid of me?
  Don't you see&mdash;don't you <i>see</i>? You go off to <i>that</i>! You
  trail yourself in the dirt and you trail my love in the dirt. Before a female
  hack!...</p>

  <p>"<i>Look</i> at me!" she cried, holding her hands apart. "Think of me
  tonight.... <i>Yours</i>! Yours for the taking!"</p>

  <p>The train was moving.</p>

  <p>She walked along the platform to keep pace with him, and her eyes held
  his. "Peter," she said; and then with amazing quiet intensity: "You
  <i>damned</i> fool!"</p>

  <p>She hesitated on the verge of saying something more. She came towards the
  carriage. It wasn't anything pleasant that she had in mind, to judge by her
  expression.</p>

  <p>"Stand away please, miss!" said the old porter, hurrying up to intervene.
  She abandoned that last remark with an impatient gesture.</p>

  <p>Peter sat still. The end of the station ran by like a scene in a panorama.
  Her Medusa face had slid away to the edge of the picture that the window
  framed, and vanished.</p>

  <p>For some seconds he was too amazed to move.</p>

  <p>Then he got up heavily and stuck his head out of the window to stare at
  Joan.</p>

  <p>Joan was standing quite still with her hands in the side pockets of her
  khaki overcoat; she was standing straight as a rod, with her heels together,
  looking at the receding train. She never moved....</p>

  <p>Neither of these two young people made a sign to each other, which was the
  first odd thing the old porter noted about them. They just stared. By all the
  rules they should have waved handkerchiefs. The next odd thing was that Joan
  stared at the bend for half a minute perhaps after the train had altogether
  gone, and then tried to walk out to her car by the little white gate at the
  end of the platform which had been disused and nailed up for three
  years....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 22</h3>

  <p class="first">After Oswald had seen the car whisk through the gates into
  the road, and after he had rested on his crutches staring at the gates for a
  time, he had hobbled back to his study. He wanted to work, but he found it
  difficult to fix his attention. He was thinking of Joan and Peter, and for
  the first time in his life he was wondering why they had never fallen in love
  with each other. They seemed such good company for each other....</p>

  <p>He was still engaged upon these speculations half an hour or so later,
  when he heard the car return and presently saw Joan go past his window. She
  was flushed, and she was staring in front of her at nothing in particular. He
  had never seen Joan looking so unhappy. In fact, so strong was his impression
  that she was unhappy that he doubted it, and he went to the window and craned
  out after her.</p>

  <p>She was going straight up towards the arbour. With a slight hurry in her
  steps. She had her fur collar half turned up on one side, her hands were deep
  in her pockets, and something about her dogged walk reminded him of some
  long-forgotten moment, years ago it must have been, when Joan, in hot water
  for some small offence, had been sent indoors at The Ingle-Nook.</p>

  <p>He limped back to his chair and sat thinking her over.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said at last, and turned to his work again....</p>

  <p>There was no getting on with it. Half an hour later he accepted defeat.
  "Peter has knocked us all crooked," he said. "There's no work for today.</p>

  <p>He would go out and prowl round the place and look at the roses. Perhaps
  Joan would come and talk. But at the gates he was amazed to encounter
  Peter.</p>

  <p>It was Peter, hot and dusty from a walk of three miles, and carrying his
  valise with an aching left arm. There was a look of defiance in the eyes that
  stared fiercely out from under the perspiration-matted hair upon his
  forehead. He seemed to find Oswald's appearance the complete confirmation of
  the most disagreeable anticipations. Thoughts of panic and desertion flashed
  upon Oswald's mind.</p>

  <p>"Good God, Peter!" he cried. "What brings you back?"</p>

  <p>"I've come back for another week," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"But your leave's up!"</p>

  <p>"I told a lie, sir. I've got another week."</p>

  <p>Oswald stared at his ward.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, sir," said Peter. "I've been making a fool of myself. I
  thought better of it. I got out of the train at Standon and walked back
  here."</p>

  <p>"What does it mean, Peter?" said Oswald.</p>

  <p>Peter's eyes were the.most distressed eyes he had ever seen. "If you'd
  just not ask, sir, now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It is a good thing to deal with one's own blood in a crisis. Oswald,
  resting thoughtfully on his crutches, leapt to a kind of understanding.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to hop down towards the village, Peter," said Oswald, becoming
  casual in his manner. "I want some exercise.... If you'll tell every one
  you're back."</p>

  <p>He indicated the house behind him by a movement of his head.</p>

  <p>Peter was badly blown with haste and emotion. "Thank you, sir," he said
  shortly.</p>

  <p>Oswald stepped past him and stared down the road.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Moxton's in the house," he said without looking at Peter again.
  "Joan's up the garden. See you when I get back, Peter.... Glad you've got
  another week, anyhow.... So long...."</p>

  <p>He left Peter standing in the gateway.</p>

  <p>Fear came upon Peter. He stood quite still for some moments, looking at
  the house and the cedars. He dropped his valise at the front door and mopped
  his face. Then he walked slowly across the lawn towards the terraces. He
  wanted to shout, and found himself hoarse. Then on the first terrace he got
  out: "Jo-un!" in a flat croak. He had to cry again: "Jo-un!" before it
  sounded at all like the old style.</p>

  <p>Joan became visible. She had come out of the arbour at the top of the
  garden, and she was standing motionless, regarding him down the vista of the
  central path. She was white and rather dishevelled, and she stood quite
  still.</p>

  <p>Peter walked up the steps towards her.</p>

  <p>"I've come back, Joan," he said, as he drew near. "I want to talk to
  you... Come into the arbour."</p>

  <p>He took her arm clumsily and led her back into the arbour out of sight of
  the house. Then he dropped her arm.</p>

  <p>"Joan," he said, "I've been the damndest of fools... as you said.... I
  don't know why."...</p>

  <p>He stood before her awkwardly. He was trembling violently. He thought he
  was going to weep.</p>

  <p>He could not touch her again. He did not dare to touch her.</p>

  <p>Then Joan spread out her arms straight and stood like a crucifix. Her
  face, which had been a dark stare, softened swiftly, became radiant,
  dissolved into a dusky glow of tears and triumph. "Oh! Petah my darling," she
  sobbed, and seized him and kissed him with tearsalt lips and hugged him to
  herself.</p>

  <p>The magic barrier was smashed at last. Peter held her close to him and
  kissed her....</p>

  <p>It was the second time they had kissed since those black days at High
  Cross school....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 23</h3>

  <p class="first">Those were years of swift marryings, and Peter was a young
  married man when presently he was added to the number of that select company
  attached to sausage-shaped observation balloons who were sent up in the
  mornings and pulled down at nights along the British front. He had had only
  momentary snatches of matrimony before the front had called him back to its
  own destructive interests, but his experiences had banished any lingering
  vestiges of his theory that there is one sort of woman you respect and
  another sort you make love to. There was only one sort of woman to love or
  respect, and that was Joan. He was altogether in love with Joan, he was sure
  he had never been in love before, and he was now also extravagantly in love
  with life. He wanted to go on with it, with a passionate intensity. It seemed
  to him that it was not only beginning for him, but for every one. Hitherto
  Man had been living down there, down on those flats&mdash;for all the world
  is flat from the air.</p>

  <p>Now, at last, men were beginning to feel how they might soar over all
  ancient limitations.</p>

  <p>Occasionally he thought of such things up in his basket, sitting like a
  spectator in a box at a theatre, with the slow vast drama of the western
  front spread out like a map beneath his eyes, with half Belgium and a great
  circle of France in sight, the brown, ruined country on either side of No
  Man's Land, apparently lifeless, with its insane tangle of trenches and
  communicating ways below, with the crumbling heaps of ruined towns and
  villages scattered among canals and lakes of flood water, and passing
  insensibly into a green and normal-looking landscape to the west and east,
  where churches still had towers and houses roofs, and woods were lumps and
  blocks of dark green, fields manifestly cultivated patches, and roads white
  ribbons barred by the purple poplar shadows. But these spectacular and
  speculative phases were rare. They came only when a thin veil of haze made
  the whole spacious prospect faint, so that beyond his more immediate circle
  Peter could see only the broad outlines of the land. Given worse conditions
  of the weather and he would be too uncomfortable for philosophy; given better
  and he would be too busy.</p>

  <p>He sat on a canvas seat inside the square basket with his instruments
  about him, or leant over the side scrutinizing the details of the eastward
  landscape. Upon his head, over his ears, he wore a telephone receiver, and
  about his body was a rope harness that linked him by a rope to the silk
  parachute that was packed neatly in a little swinging bucket over the side of
  his basket. Under his hand was his map board, repeating the shapes of wood
  and water and road below. The telephone wire that ran down his mooring rope
  abolished any effect of isolation; it linked him directly to his winch on a
  lorry below, to a number of battery commanders, to an ascending series of
  headquarters; he could always start a conversation if he had anything
  practical to say. He was, in fact, an eye at the end of a tentacle thread, by
  means of which the British army watched its enemies. Sometimes he had an
  illusion that he was also a kind of brain. "When distant visibility was good
  he would find himself hovering over the war as a player hangs over a
  chess-board, directing fire upon road movements or train movements,
  suspecting and watching for undisclosed enemy batteries, or directing
  counter-battery fire. Above him, green and voluminous, hung the great
  translucent lobes of his gas bag, and the loose ropes by which it was towed
  and held upon the ground swayed and trailed about his basket.</p>

  <p>It was on one of his more slack afternoons that Peter fell thinking of how
  acutely he now desired to live. The wide world was full of sunshine, but a
  ground haze made even the country immediately below him indistinct. The enemy
  gunners were inactive, there came no elfin voices through the telephone, only
  far away to the south guns butted and shivered the tranquil air. There was a
  faint drift in the air rather than a breeze, and the gas bag had fallen into
  a long, lazy rhythmic movement, so that sometimes he faced due south and
  sometimes south by east and so back. A great patch of flooded country to the
  north-east, a bright mirror with a kind of bloom upon it, seemed trying with
  an aimless persistency to work its way towards the centre of his field of
  vision and never succeeding.</p>

  <p>For a time Peter had been preoccupied with a distant ridge far away to the
  east, from which a long-range gun had recently taken to shelling the kite
  balloons towards evening as they became clear against the bright western sky.
  Four times lately this new gun had got on to him, and this clear and tranquil
  afternoon promised just the luminous and tranquil sunset that favoured these
  unpleasant activities. It was five hours to sunset yet, but Peter could not
  keep his mind off that gun. It was a big gun; perhaps a 42 centimetre; it was
  beyond any counter-battery possibility, and it had got a new kind of shell
  that the Germans seemed to have invented for the particular discomfort of
  Peter and his kind. It had a distinctive report, a loud crack, and then the
  "whuff" of high explosive, and at every explosion it got nearer and nearer to
  its target, with a quite uncanny certainty. It seemed to learn more than any
  gun should learn from each shot. It was this steadfast approach to a hit that
  Peter disliked. That and the long pause after the shell had started. Far away
  he would see the flash of the gun amidst the ridges in the darkling east.
  Then would come a long, blank pause of expectation. For all he could tell
  this might get him. Then the whine of the shell would become audible, growing
  louder and louder and lower and lower in note; Phee-whoo! <i>Crack</i>!
  <i>WHOOF</i>! Then Peter would get quite voluble to the men at the winch
  below. He could let himself up, or go down a few hundred feet, or they could
  shift his lorry along the road. Until it was dark he could not come down, for
  a kite balloon is a terribly visible and helpless thing on the ground until
  it has been very carefully put to bed. To come down in the daylight meant too
  good a chance for the nearer German guns. So Peter, by instructing his winch
  to lower him or let him up or shift, had to dodge about in a most undignified
  way, up and down and backwards and sideways, while the big gun marked him and
  guessed at his next position. Flash! "Oh, damn!" said Peter. "Another
  already!"</p>

  <p>Silence. Anticipations. Then: Phee&mdash;eee&mdash;eee&mdash;whoo.
  <i>Crack</i>! <i>WHOOF</i>! A rush of air would set the gas bag swinging.
  That was a near one!</p>

  <p>"Where am I?" said Peter.</p>

  <p>But that wasn't going to happen for hours yet. Why meet trouble half way?
  Why be tormented by this feeling of apprehension and danger in the still air?
  Why trouble because the world was quiet and seemed to be waiting? Why not
  think of something else? Banish this war from the mind.... Was he more afraid
  nowadays then he used to be? Peter was inclined to think that now he was more
  systematically afraid. Formerly he had funked in streaks and patches, but now
  he had a steady, continuous dislike to all these risks and dangers. He was
  getting more and more clearly an idea of the sort of life he wanted to lead
  and of the things he wanted to do. He was ceasing to think of existence as a
  rather aimless series of adventures, and coming to regard it as one large
  consecutive undertaking on the part of himself and Joan. This being hung up
  in the sky for Germans to shoot at seemed to him to be a very tiresome
  irrelevance indeed. He and Joan and everybody with brains&mdash;including the
  misguided people who had made and were now firing this big gun at
  him&mdash;ought to be setting to work to get this preposterous muddle of a
  world in order. "This sort of thing," said Peter, addressing the western
  front, his gas bag, and so much of the sky as it permitted him to see, and
  the universe generally, "is ridiculous. There is no sense in it at all. None
  whatever."</p>

  <p>His dream of God, as a detached and aloof personage, had taken a very
  strong hold upon his imagination. Or, perhaps, it would be truer to say that
  his fevered mind in the hospital had given a caricature personality to ideas
  that had grown up in his mind as a natural consequence of his training. He
  had gone on with that argument; he went on with it now, with a feeling that
  really he was just as much sitting and talking in that queer, untidy,
  out-of-the way office as swaying in a kite balloon, six thousand feet above
  Flanders, waiting to be shot at.</p>

  <p>"It is all very well to say 'exert yourself,'" said Peter. "But there is
  that chap over there exerting himself. And what he is doing with all his
  brains is just trying to wipe my brains out of existence. Just that. He
  hasn't an idea else of what he is doing. He has no notion of what he is up to
  or what I am up to. And he hasn't the sense or ability to come over here and
  talk about it to me. He's there&mdash;at that&mdash;and he can't help
  himself. And I'm here&mdash;and I can't help myself. But if I could only
  catch him within counter battery range!</p>

  <p>"There's no sense in it at all," summarized Peter, after some moments of
  grim reflection. "Sense hasn't got into it."</p>

  <p>"Is sense ever going to get into it?</p>

  <p>"The curious thing about you," said Peter, addressing himself quite
  directly to his Deity at the desk, "is that somehow, without ever positively
  promising it or saying anything plain and definite about it, you yet manage
  to convey in an almost irresistible manner, that there is going to be sense
  in it. You seem to suggest that my poor brain up here and the brains of those
  chaps over there, are, in spite of all appearance to the contrary, up to
  something jointly that is going to come together and make good some day. You
  hint it. And yet I don't get a scrap of sound, trustworthy reasoning to help
  me to accept that; not a scrap. Why should it be so? I ask, and you just keep
  on not saying anything. I suppose it's a necessary thing, biologically, that
  one should have a kind of optimism to keep one alive, so I'm not even
  justified in my half conviction that I'm not being absolutely fooled by
  life....</p>

  <p>"I admit that taking for example Joan, there is something about Joan that
  almost persuades me there must be something absolutely right about
  things&mdash;for Joan to happen at all. Yet isn't that again just another
  biologically necessary delusion?... There you sit silent. You seem to say
  nothing, and yet you soak me with a kind of answer, a sort of shapeless
  courage...."</p>

  <p>Peter's mind rested on that for a time, and then began again at another
  point.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," said Peter, "if that chap gets me tonight, what I shall
  think&mdash;in the moment&mdash;after he has got me...."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 24</h3>

  <p class="first">But the German gunner never got Peter, because something
  else got him first.</p>

  <p>He thought he saw a Hun aeroplane coming over very high indeed to the
  south of him, fifteen thousand feet up or more, a mere speck in the blue
  blaze, and then the gas bag hid it and he dismissed it from his mind. He was
  thinking that the air was growing clearer, and that if this went on guns
  would wake up presently and little voices begin to talk to him, when he
  became aware of the presence and vibration of an aeroplane quite close to
  him. He pulled off his telephone receivers and heard the roar of an engine
  close at hand. It was overhead, and the gas bag still hid it. At the same
  moment the British anti-aircraft gunners began a belated fire. "Damn!" said
  Peter in a brisk perspiration, and hastened to make sure that his parachute
  rope was clear.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps he's British," said Peter, with no real hope.</p>

  <p>"<i>Pap, pap, pap</i>!" very loud overhead.</p>

  <p>The gas bag swayed and billowed, and a wing with a black cross swept
  across the sky. "<i>Pap, pap, pap</i>."</p>

  <p>The gas bag wrinkled and crumpled more and more, and a little streak of
  smoke appeared beyond its edge. The German aeroplane was now visible, a
  hundred yards away, and banking to come round. He had fired the balloon with
  tracer bullets.</p>

  <p>The thing that Peter had to do and what he did was this. He had to step up
  on to a little wood step inside his basket. Then he had to put first one foot
  and then the other on to another little step outside his basket. This little
  step was about four inches wide by nine long. Below it was six thousand feet
  of emptiness, above the little trees and houses below. As he swayed on the
  step Peter had to make sure that the rope attached to his body was clear of
  all entanglements. Then he had to step off that little shelf, which was now
  swinging and slanting with the lurching basket to which it was attached, into
  the void, six thousand feet above the earth.</p>

  <p>He had not to throw himself or dive headlong, because that might lead to
  entanglement with the rope. He had just to step off into pellucid
  nothingness, holding his rope clear of himself with one hand. This rope
  looped back to the little swinging bucket in which his fine silk parachute
  was closely packed. He had seen it packed a week ago, and he wished now, as
  he stood on his step holding to his basket with one hand, that he had watched
  the process more meticulously. He became aware that the Hun, having disposed
  of the balloon, was now shooting at him. He did not so much step off the
  little shelf as slip off as it heeled over with the swing of the basket. The
  first instants of a leap or fall make no impression on the mind. For some
  seconds he was falling swiftly, feet foremost, through the air. He scarcely
  noted the faint snatch when the twine, which held his parachute in its
  basket, broke. Then his consciousness began to register again. He kept his
  feet tightly pressed together. The air whistled by him, but he thought that
  dreams and talk had much exaggerated the sensations of falling. He was too
  high as yet to feel the rush of the ground towards him.</p>

  <p>He seemed to fall for an interminable time before anything more happened.
  He was assailed by doubts&mdash;whether the twine that kept the parachute in
  its bucket would break, whether it would open. His rope trailed out above
  him.</p>

  <p>Still falling. Why didn't the parachute open? In another ten seconds it
  would be too late.</p>

  <p>The parachute was not opening. It was certainly not opening. Wrong
  packing? He tugged and jerked his rope, and tried to shake and swing the long
  silken folds that were following his fall. Why? Why the devil?</p>

  <p>The rope seemed to tighten abruptly. The harness tightened upon his body.
  Peter gasped, sprawled and had the sensation of being hauled up back again
  into the sky....</p>

  <p>It was all right, so far. He was now swaying down earthward with a
  diminishing velocity beneath an open parachute. He was floating over the
  landscape instead of falling straight into it.</p>

  <p>But the German had not done with Peter yet. He became visible beneath the
  edge of Peter's parachute, circling downward regardless of anti-aircraft and
  machine-guns. "<i>Pap, pap, pap, pap.</i>" The bullets burst and banged about
  Peter.</p>

  <p>Something kicked Peter's knee; something hit his neck; something rapped
  the knuckles of his wounded hand; the parachute winced and went sideways,
  slashed and pierced. Peter drifted down faster, helpless, his angry eyes upon
  his assailant, who vanished again, going out of sight as he rose up above the
  edge of the parachute.</p>

  <p>A storm of pain and rage broke from Peter.</p>

  <p>"Done in!" shouted Peter. "Oh! my leg! my leg!</p>

  <p>"I'm shot to bits. I'm shot to bloody bits!"</p>

  <p>The tree tops were near at hand. The parachute had acquired a rhythmic
  swing and was falling more rapidly.</p>

  <p>"And I've still got to land," wailed Peter, beginning to cry like a
  child.</p>

  <p>He wanted to stop just a moment, just for one little moment, before the
  ground rushed up to meet him. He wanted time to think. He didn't know what to
  do with this dangling leg. It became a monstrous, painful obstacle to
  landing. How was he to get a spring? He was bleeding. He was dying. It was
  cruel. Cruel.</p>

  <p>Came the crash. Hot irons, it seemed, assailed his leg and his shoulder
  and neck. He crumpled up on the ground in an agony, and the parachute, with
  slow and elegant gestures, folded down on the top of his floundering
  figure....</p>

  <p>The gunners who ran to help him found him, enveloped in silk, bawling and
  weeping like a child of four in a passion of rage and fear, and trying
  repeatedly to stand up upon a blood-streaked leg that gave way as repeatedly.
  "Damn!" cursed Peter in a stifled voice, plunging about like a kitten in a
  sack. "Damn you all! I tell you I <i>will</i> use my leg. I will have my leg.
  If I bleed to death. Oh! Oh!... You fool&mdash;you lying old <i>humbug</i>!
  You!"</p>

  <p>And then he gave a leap upward and forward, and fainted and fell, and lay
  still, with his head and body muffled in the silk folds of his parachute.</p>

     name="chap14">CHAPTER XIV. &mdash; OSWALD'S VALEDICTION</a></h2>

  <h3>§ 1</h3>

  <p class="first">IT was the third of April in 1918, the Wednesday after
  Easter, and the war had now lasted three years and eight months. It had
  become the aching habit of the whole world. Throughout the winter it had been
  for the most part a great and terrible boredom, but now a phase of acute
  anxiety was beginning. The "Kaiser's Battle" was raging in France; news came
  through sparingly; but it was known that General Gough had lost tens of
  thousands of prisoners, hundreds of guns, and vast stores of ammunition and
  railway material. It was rumoured that he had committed suicide. But the
  standards of Tory England differ from those of Japan. Through ten sanguinary
  days, in a vaster Inkerman, the common men of Britain, reinforced by the
  French, had fought and died to restore the imperilled line. It was by no
  means certain yet that they had succeeded. It seemed possible that the French
  and British armies would be broken apart, and Amiens and Paris lost. Oswald's
  mind was still dark with apprehension.</p>

  <p>The particular anxieties of this crisis accentuated the general worry and
  inconveniences of the time, and deepened Oswald's conviction of an incredible
  incompetence in both the political and military leadership of his country. In
  spite of every reason he had to the contrary, he had continued hitherto to
  hope for some bright dramatic change in the course of events; he had
  experienced a continually recurring disappointment with each morning's paper.
  His intelligence told him that all the inefficiency, the confusion, the cheap
  and bad government by press and intrigue, were the necessary and inevitable
  consequences of a neglect of higher education for the past fifty years; these
  defects were now in the nature of things, almost as much as the bleakness of
  an English February or the fogs of a London November, but his English
  temperament had refused hitherto to accept the decision of his intelligence.
  Now for the first time he could see the possibility of an ultimate failure in
  the war. To this low level of achievement, he perceived, a steadfast contempt
  for thought and science and organization had brought Britain; at this low
  level Britain had now to struggle through the war, blundering, talking, and
  thinking confusedly, suffering enormously&mdash;albeit so sound at heart. It
  was a humiliating realization. At any rate she could still hope to struggle
  through; the hard-won elementary education of the common people, the stout
  heart and sense of the common people, saved her gentlefolk from the fate of
  their brother inefficients in Russia. But every day he fretted afresh at the
  costly and toilsome continuance of an effort that a little more courage and
  wisdom in high places on the allied side, a little more knowledge and clear
  thinking, might have brought to an entirely satisfactory close in 1917.</p>

  <p>For a man of his age, wounded, disappointed, and a chronic invalid, there
  was considerable affliction in the steadily increasing hardships of the
  Fourth Year. A number of petty deprivations at which a healthy man might have
  scoffed, intensified his physical discomfort. There had been a complete
  restriction of his supply of petrol, the automobile now hung in its shed with
  its tyres removed, and the railway service to London had been greatly
  reduced. He could not get up to London now to consult books or vary his moods
  without a slow and crowded and fatiguing journey; he was more and more
  confined to Pelham Ford. He had been used to read and work late into the
  night, but now his home was darkened in the evening and very cheerless; there
  was no carbide for the acetylene installation, and a need for economy in
  paraffin. For a time he had been out of coal, and unable to get much wood
  because of local difficulties about cartage, and for some weeks he had had to
  sit in his overcoat and read and write by candlelight. Now, however, that
  distress had been relieved by the belated delivery of a truckload of coal.
  And another matter that may seem trivial in history, was by no means trivial
  in relation to his moods. In the spring of 1918 the food supply of Great
  Britain was at its lowest point. Lord Rhondda was saving the situation at the
  eleventh hour. The rationing of meat had affected Oswald's health
  disagreeably. He had long ago acquired the habit of living upon chops and
  cutlets and suchlike concentrated nourishment, and he found it difficult to
  adapt himself now to the bulky insipidity of a diet that was, for a time,
  almost entirely vegetarian. For even fish travels by long routes to
  Hertfordshire villages. The frequent air raids of that winter were also an
  added nervous irritation. In the preceding years of the war there had been
  occasional Zeppelin raids, the Zeppelins had been audible at Pelham Ford on
  several occasions and once Hertford had suffered from their bombs; but those
  expeditions had ended at last in a series of disasters to the invaders, and
  they had never involved the uproar and tension of the Gotha raids that began
  in the latter half of 1917. These latter raids had to be met by an immense
  barrage of anti-aircraft guns round London, a barrage which rattled every
  window at Pelham Ford, lit the sky with star shells, and continued
  intermittently sometimes for four or five hours. Oswald would lie awake
  throughout that thudding conflict, watching the distant star shells and
  searchlights through the black tree boughs outside his open window, and
  meditating drearily upon the manifest insanity of mankind....</p>

  <p>He was now walking up and down his lawn, waiting until it should be time
  to start for the station with Joan to meet Peter.</p>

  <p>For Peter, convalescent again and no longer fit for any form of active
  service&mdash;he was lamed now as well as winged&mdash;was to take up a minor
  administrative post next week at Adastral House, and he was coming down for a
  few days at Pelham Ford before carrying his wife off for good to a little
  service flat they had found in an adapted house in the Avenue Road. They had
  decided not to live at The Ingle-Nook, although Arthur had built it to become
  Peter's home, but to continue the tenancy of Aunts Phyllis and Phoebe. They
  did not want to disturb those two ladies, whose nervous systems, by no means
  stable at the best of times, were now in a very shaken condition. Aunt
  Phyllis was kept busy restraining Aunt Phoebe from inflicting lengthy but
  obscure prophetic messages upon most of the prominent people of the time. To
  these daily activities Aunt Phoebe added an increasing habit of sleep-walking
  that broke the nightly peace of Aunt Phyllis. She would wander through the
  moonlit living rooms gesticulating strangely, and uttering such phrases as
  "Blood! Blood! Seas of blood! The multitudinous seas incarnadine"; or "Murder
  most foul!"</p>

  <p>She had a fixed idea that it was her business to seek out the Kaiser and
  either scold him or kill him&mdash;or perhaps do both. She held that it was
  the duty of women to assassinate. Men might fight battles, it was their
  stupid way; but surely women were capable of directer things. If some woman
  were to kill any man who declared war directly he declared war, there would
  be a speedy end to war. She could not, she said, understand the inactivity of
  German wives and mothers. She would spend hours over her old school German
  grammar, with a view to writing an "Open Letter to German Womankind." But her
  naturally rich and very allusive prose was ill adapted to that sort of
  translation.</p>

  <p>Many over-sensitive people were suffering more or less as Aunt Phoebe was
  suffering&mdash;from a sense of cruelty, wickedness, and disaster that
  staggered their minds. They had lived securely in a secure world; they could
  not readjust. Even for so sane a mind as Oswald's, hampered as it was by the
  new poison his recent wound had brought info his blood, readjustment was
  difficult. He suffered greatly from insomnia, and from a haunting
  apprehension of misfortunes. His damaged knee would give him bouts of acute
  distress. Sometimes it would seem to be well and he would forget it. Then it
  would become painfully lame by day and a neuralgic pain at night. His moods
  seemed always exaggerated now; either he was too angry or too sorrowful or
  too hopeful. Sometimes he experienced phases of blank stupidity, when his
  mind became unaccountably sluggish and clumsy....</p>

  <p>Joan was indoors now packing up a boxful of books that were to go with her
  to the new home.</p>

  <p>He was feeling acutely&mdash;more acutely than he wanted to
  feel&mdash;that his guardianship was at an end. Joan, who had been the
  mistress of his house, and the voice that sang in it, the pretty plant that
  grew in it, was going now&mdash;to return, perhaps, sometimes as a
  visitor&mdash;but never more to be a part of it; never more to be its
  habitual presence. Peter, too, was severing the rope, a long rope it had
  seemed at times during the last three years, that had tethered him to Pelham
  Ford....</p>

  <p>Oswald did not want to think now of his coming loneliness. What he wanted
  to think about was the necessity of rounding off their relationship properly,
  of ending his educational task with some sort of account rendered. He felt he
  owed it to these young people and to himself to tell them of his aims and of
  what he considered the whole of this business of education amounted to. He
  had to explain what had helped and what had prevented him. "A Valediction,"
  he said. "A Valediction." But he could not plan out what he had to say that
  morning. He could not arrange his heads, and all the while that he tried to
  fix his thoughts upon these topics, he was filled with uncontrollable
  self-pity for the solitude ahead of him.</p>

  <p>He was ashamed at these personal distresses that he could not control. He
  disliked himself for their quality. He did not like to think he was thinking
  the thoughts in his mind. He walked up and down the lawn for a time like a
  man who is being pestered by uncongenial solicitations.</p>

  <p>In spite of his intense affection for both of them, he was feeling a real
  jealousy of the happiness of these two young lovers. He hated the thought of
  losing Joan much more than he hated the loss of Peter. Once upon a time he
  had loved Peter far more than Joan, but by imperceptible degrees his
  affection had turned over to her. In these war years he and she had been very
  much together. For a time he had been&mdash;it was grotesque, but
  true&mdash;actually in love with her. He had let himself dream&mdash;. It was
  preposterous to think of it. A moonlight night had made his brain swim.... At
  any rate, thank Heaven! she had never had a suspicion....</p>

  <p>She'd come now as a visitor&mdash;perhaps quite often. He wasn't going to
  lose his Joan altogether. But each time she would come changed, rather less
  his Joan and rather more a new Joan&mdash;Peter's Joan.</p>

  <p>Some day they'd have children, these two. Joan would sit over her child
  and smile down at it. He knew exactly how she would smile. And at the thought
  of that smile Joan gave place to Dolly. Out of the past there jumped upon him
  the memory of Peter bubbling in a cradle on the sunny verandah of The
  Ingle-Nook, and how he had remarked that the very sunshine seemed made for
  this fortunate young man.</p>

  <p>"It was made for him," Dolly had said, with that faintly mischievous smile
  of hers.</p>

  <p>How far off that seemed now, and how vivid still! He could remember
  Dolly's shadow on the roughcast wail, and the very things he had said in
  reply. He had talked like a fool about the wonderful future of
  Peter&mdash;and of the world. How long was that ago? Five-and-twenty years?
  (Yes, Peter would be five-and-twenty in June.) How safe and secure the
  European world had seemed then! It seemed to be loitering, lazily and basely
  indeed, but certainly, towards a sort of materialist's millennium. And what a
  vast sham its security had been! He had called Peter the "Heir of the Ages."
  And the Heritage of the Ages had been preparing even then to take Peter away
  from the work he had chosen and from all the sunshine and leisure of his life
  and to splinter his shoulder-blade, smash his wrist, snap his leg-bones with
  machine-gun bullets, and fling him aside, a hobbling, stiff, broken young man
  to limp through the rest of life....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 2</h3>

  <p class="first">That was what his mind had to lay hold of, that was what he
  had to talk about, this process that had held out such fair hopes for Peter
  and had in the end crippled him and come near to killing him and wasting him
  altogether. He had to talk of that, of an enormous collapse and breach of
  faith with the young. The world which had seemed to be the glowing promise of
  an unprecedented education and upbringing for Peter and his generation, the
  world that had been, so to speak, joint guardian with himself, had defaulted.
  This war was an outrage by the senior things in the world upon all the hope
  of the future; it was the parent sending his sons through the fires to
  Moloch, it was the guardian gone mad, it was the lapse of all educational
  responsibility.</p>

  <p>He had to keep his grasp upon that idea. By holding to that he could get
  away from his morbidly intense wish to be personal and intimate with these
  two. He loved them and they loved him, but what he wanted to say was
  something quite beyond that.</p>

  <p>What he had to talk about was Education, and Education alone. He had to
  point out to them that their own education had been truncated, was rough
  ended and partial. He had to explain why that was so. And he had to show that
  all this vast disaster to the world was no more and no less than an
  educational failure. The churches and teachers and political forms had been
  insufficient and wrong; they had failed to establish ideas strong and
  complete enough and right enough to hold the wills of men. Necessarily he had
  to make a dissertation upon the war. To talk of life now was to talk of the
  war. The war now was human life. It had eaten up all free and independent
  living.</p>

  <p>The war was an educational breakdown, that was his point; and in education
  lay whatever hope there was for mankind. He had to say that to them, and he
  had to point out how that idea must determine the form of their lives. He had
  to show the political and social and moral conclusions involved in it. And he
  had to say what he wanted to say in a large manner. <i>He had to keep his
  temper while he said it</i>.</p>

  <p>Oswald, limping slowly up and down his lawn in the April sunshine, with a
  gnawing pain at his knee, had to underline, as it were, that last proviso in
  his thoughts. That was the extreme difficulty of these urgent and tragic
  times. The world was in a phase of intense, but swift, tumultuous, and
  distracting tragedy. The millions were not suffering and dying in stateliness
  and splendour but in a vast uproar, amidst mud, confusion, bickering, and
  incoherence indescribable. While it was manifest that only great thinking,
  only very clear and deliberate thinking, could give even the forms of action
  that would arrest the conflagration, it was nevertheless almost impossible
  for any one anywhere to think clearly and deliberately, so universal and
  various were the compulsions, confusions, and distresses of the time. And
  even the effect to see and state the issue largely, fevered Oswald's brain.
  He grew angry with the multitudinous things that robbed him of his
  serenity.</p>

  <p>"Education," he said, as if he called for help; "education."</p>

  <p>And then, collapsing into wrath: "A land of uneducated blockheads!"</p>

  <p>No! It was not one of his good mornings. In a little while his steps had
  quickened and his face had flushed. His hands clenched in his pockets. "A
  universal dullness of mind," he whispered. "Obstinacy.... Inadaptability....
  Unintelligent opposition."</p>

  <p>Broad generalizations slipped out of his mind. He began to turn over one
  disastrous instance after another of the shortness of mental range, the
  unimaginative stupidity, the baseness and tortuousness of method, the dull
  suspicions, class jealousies, and foolish conceits that had crippled Britain
  through three and a half bitter years. With a vast fleet, with enormous
  armies, with limitless wealth, with the loyal enthusiasm behind them of a
  united people and with great allies, British admirals and generals had never
  once achieved any great or brilliant success, British statesmen had never
  once grasped and held the fluctuating situation. One huge disappointment had
  followed another; now at Gallipoli, now at Kut, now in the air and now
  beneath the seas, the British had seen their strength ill applied and their
  fair hopes of victory waste away. No Nelson had arisen to save the country,
  no Wellington; no Nelson nor Wellington could have arisen; the country had
  not even found an alternative to Mr. Lloyd George. In military and naval as
  in social and political affairs the Anglican ideal had been&mdash;to
  blockade. On sea and land, as in Ireland, as in India, Anglicanism was not
  leading but obstruction. Throughout 1917 the Allied armies upon the Western
  front had predominated over the German as greatly as the British fleet had
  predominated at sea, and the result on either element had been stagnation.
  The cavalry coterie who ruled upon land had demonstrated triumphantly their
  incapacity to seize even so great an opportunity as the surprise of the tanks
  afforded them; the Admiralty had left the Baltic to the Germans until, after
  the loss of Riga, poor Kerensky's staggering government had collapsed.
  British diplomacy had completed what British naval quiescence began; in
  Russia as in Greece it had existed only to blunder; never had a just cause
  been so mishandled; and before the end of 1917 the Russian debacle had been
  achieved and the German armies, reinforced by the troops the Russian failure
  had released, began to concentrate for this last great effort that was now in
  progress in the west. Like many another anxious and distressed Englishman
  during those darker days of the German spring offensive in 1918, Oswald went
  about clinging to one comfort: "Our men are tough stuff. Our men at any rate
  will stick it."</p>

  <p>In Oswald's mind there rankled a number of special cases which he called
  his "sores." To think of them made him angry and desperate, and yet he could
  scarcely ever think of education without reviving the irritation of these
  particular instances. They were his foreground; they blocked his vistas, and
  got between him and the general prospect of the world. For instance, there
  had been a failure to supply mosquito curtains in the East African hospitals,
  and a number of slightly wounded men had contracted fever and died. This fact
  had linked on to the rejection of the services he had offered at the outset
  of the war, and became a festering centre in his memory. Those mosquito
  curtains blew into every discussion. Moreover there had been, he believed,
  much delay and inefficiency in the use of African native labour in France,
  and a lack of proper organization for the special needs of the sick and
  injured among these tropic-bred men. And a shipload had been sunk in a
  collision off the Isle of Wight. He had got an irrational persuasion into his
  head that this collision could have been prevented. After his wound had
  driven him back to Pelham Ford he would limp about the garden thinking of his
  "boys" shivering in the wet of a French winter and dying on straw in cold
  cattle trucks, or struggling and drowning in the grey channel water, and he
  would fret and swear. "Hugger mugger," he would say, "hugger mugger! No care.
  No foresight.</p>

  <p>No proper grasp of the problem. And so death and torment for the men."</p>

  <p>While still so painful and feverish he had developed a new distress for
  himself by taking up the advocacy of certain novelties and devices that he
  became more and more convinced were of vital importance upon the Western
  front. He entangled himself in correspondence, interviews, committees, and
  complicated quarrels in connection with these ideas.... He would prowl about
  his garden, a baffled man, trying to invent some way of breaking through the
  system of entanglements that held back British inventiveness from the service
  of Great Britain. More and more clearly did his reason assure him that no
  sudden blow can set aside the deep-rooted traditions, the careless, aimless
  education of a negligent century, but none the less he raged at individuals,
  at ministries, at coteries and classes.</p>

  <p>His peculiar objection to the heads of the regular army, for example, was
  unjust, for much the same unimaginative resistance was evident in every
  branch of the public activities of Great Britain. Already in 1915 the very
  halfpenny journalists were pointing out the necessity of a great air
  offensive for the allies, were showing that in the matter of the possible
  supply of good air fighters the Germans were altogether inferior to their
  antagonists and that consequently they would be more and more at a
  disadvantage in the air as the air warfare was pressed. But the British mind
  was trained, so far that is as one can speak of it as being trained at all,
  to dread "over-pressure." The western allies having won a certain ascendancy
  in the air in 1916 became so self-satisfied that the Germans, in spite of
  their disadvantages, were able to recover a kind of equality in 1917, and in
  the spring of 1918 the British, with their leeway recovered, were going
  easily in matters aerial, and the opinion that a great air offensive might
  yet end the war was regarded as the sign of a froward and revolutionary
  spirit.</p>

  <p>The sea war had a parallel history. Long before 1914 Dr. Conan Doyle had
  written a story to illustrate the dangers of an unrestricted submarine
  attack, but no precaution whatever against such a possibility seemed to have
  been undertaken by the British Admiralty before the war at all; Great Britain
  was practically destitute of sea mines in the October of 1914, and even in
  the spring of 1918, after more than a year and a half of hostile submarine
  activity, after the British had lost millions of tons of shipping, after the
  people were on short commons and becoming very anxious about rations, the
  really very narrow channel of the North Sea&mdash;rarely is it more than
  three hundred miles wide&mdash;which was the only way out the Germans
  possessed, was still unfenced against the coming and going of these most
  vulnerable pests.</p>

  <p>It is hard not to blame individual men and groups when the affairs of a
  nation go badly. It is so much easier to change men than systems. The former
  satisfies every instinct in the fierce, suspicious hearts of men, the latter
  demands the bleakest of intellectual efforts. The former justifies the
  healthy, wholesome relief of rioting; the latter necessitates self-control.
  The country was at sixes and sevens because its education by school and
  college, by book and speech and newspaper, was confused and superficial and
  incomplete, and its education was confused and superficial and incomplete
  because its institutions were a patched-up system of traditions, compromises,
  and interests, devoid of any clear and single guiding idea of a national
  purpose. The only wrongs that really matter to mankind are the undramatic
  general wrongs; but the only wrongs that appeal to the uneducated imagination
  are individual wrongs. It is so much more congenial to the ape in us to say
  that if Mr. Asquith hadn't been lazy or Mr. Lloyd George disingenuous! Then
  out with the halter&mdash;and don't bother about yourself. As though the
  worst of individuals can be anything more than the indicating pustule of a
  systemic malaise. For his own part Oswald was always reviling schoolmasters,
  as though they, alone among men, had the power to rise triumphant over all
  their circumstances&mdash;and wouldn't. He had long since forgotten Mr.
  Mackinder's apology.</p>

  <p>He limped and fretted to and fro across the lawn in his struggle to get
  out of his jungle of wrathful thoughts, about drowned negroes and rejected
  inventions, and about the Baltic failure and about Gough of the Curragh and
  St. Quentin, to general and permanent things.</p>

  <p>"Education," he said aloud, struggling against his obsessions. "Education!
  I have to tell them what it ought to be, how it is more or less the task of
  every man, how it can unify the world, how it can save mankind...."</p>

  <p>And then after a little pause, with an apparent complete irrelevance,
  "<i>Damn</i> Aunt Charlotte!"</p><br>

  <h3>§ 4</h3>

  <p class="first">Nowadays quite little things would suddenly assume a
  tremendous and devastating importance to Oswald. In his pocket, not folded
  but crumpled up, was an insulting letter from Lady Charlotte Sydenham, and
  the thought of it was rankling bitterly in his mind.</p>

  <p>The days were long past when he could think of the old lady as of
  something antediluvian in quality, a queer ungainly megatherium floundering
  about in a new age from which her kind would presently vanish altogether. He
  was beginning to doubt more and more about her imminent disappearance. She
  had greater powers of survival than he had supposed; he was beginning to
  think that she might outlive him; there was much more of her in England than
  he had ever suspected. All through the war she, or a voice indistinguishable
  from hers, had bawled unchastened in the <i>Morning Post</i>; on many
  occasions he had seemed to see her hard blue eye and bristling whisker
  glaring at him through a kind of translucency in the sheets of the
  <i>Times</i>; once or twice in France he had recognized her, or something
  very like her, in red tabs and gilt lace, at G.H.Q. These were sick fancies
  no doubt; mere fantastic intimations of the stout resistances the Anglican
  culture could still offer before it loosened its cramping grip upon the
  future of England and the world, evidence rather of his own hypersensitized
  condition than of any perennial quality in her.</p>

  <p>The old lady had played a valiant part in the early stages of the war. She
  had interested herself in the persecution of all Germans not related to
  royalty, who chanced to be in the country; and had even employed private
  detectives in one or two cases that had come under her notice. She had been
  forced most unjustly to defend a libel case brought by a butcher named
  Sterne, whom she had denounced as of German origin and a probable poisoner of
  the community, in the very laudable belief that his name was spelt Stern. She
  felt that his indubitable British ancestry and honesty only enhanced the
  deception and made the whole thing more alarming, but the jury, being no
  doubt tainted with pacifism, thought, or pretended to think, otherwise. She
  had had a reconciliation with her old antagonists the Pankhurst section of
  the suffragettes, and she had paid twenty annual subscriptions to their loyal
  and outspoken publication Britannia, directing twelve copies to be sent to
  suitable recipients&mdash;Oswald was one of the favoured ones&mdash;and
  herself receiving and blue-pencilling the remaining eight before despatching
  them to such public characters as she believed would be most beneficially
  cowed or instructed by the articles she had marked. She also subscribed
  liberally to the British Empire Union, an organization so patriotic that it
  extended its hostility to Russians, Americans, Irishmen, neutrals, President
  Wilson, the League of Nations, and similar infringements of the importance
  and dignity of Lady Charlotte and her kind. She remained at Chastlands, where
  she had laid in an ample store of provisions quite early in the war&mdash;two
  sacks of mouldy flour and a side of bacon in an advanced state of
  decomposition had been buried at night by Cashel&mdash;all through the
  Zeppelin raids; and she played a prominent rather than a pacifying part in
  the Red Cross politics of that part of Surrey. She induced several rich
  Jewesses of Swiss, Dutch, German or Austrian origin to relieve the movement
  of their names and, what was still better, of the frequently quite
  offensively large subscriptions with which they overshadowed those who had
  the right to lead in such matters. She lectured also in the National Economy
  campaign on several occasions&mdash;for like most thoughtful women of her
  class and type, she was deeply shocked by the stories she had heard of
  extravagance among our over-paid munition workers. After a time the
  extraordinary meanness of the authorities in restricting her petrol obliged
  her in self-respect to throw up this branch of her public work. She was in
  London during one of the early Gotha raids, but she conceived such a disgust
  at the cowardice of the lower classes on this occasion that she left town the
  next day and would not return thither.</p>

  <p>The increasing scarcity of petrol and the onset of food rationing, which
  threatened to spread all over England, drove her to Ulster&mdash;in spite of
  the submarine danger that might have deterred a less stout-hearted woman. She
  took a small furnished house in a congenial district, and found herself one
  of a little circle of ultra-patriotic refugees, driven like herself from
  England by un-English restrictions upon the nourishment of the upper classes
  and the spread of the pacifist tendencies of Lord Lansdowne. "If the cowards
  must make peace," said Lady Charlotte, "at least give me leave to be put of
  it."</p>

  <p>Considering everything, Ulster was at that time as comfortably and
  honourably out of the war as any part of the world, and all that seemed
  needed to keep it safely out to the end was a little tactful firmness in the
  Dublin Convention. There was plenty of everything in the loyal province at
  that time&mdash;men, meat, butter, Dublin stout, and self-righteousness; and
  Lady Charlotte expanded again like a flower in the sun. She reverted to
  driving in a carriage; it was nice to sit once more behind a stout
  able-bodied coachman with a cockade, with a perfect excuse for neutrality,
  and she still did her best for old England from eleven to one and often from
  five to six by writing letters and dabbling in organization. Oswald she kept
  in mind continually. Almost daily he would get newspaper cuttings from her
  detailing Sinn Fein outrages, or blue-marked leading articles agitating for a
  larger share of the munition industries for Belfast, or good hot stuff,
  deeply underlined, from the speeches of Sir Edward Carson. One dastardly Sinn
  Feiner, Oswald learnt, had even starved himself to death in gaol, a most
  unnatural offence to Lady Charlotte. She warmed up tremendously over the
  insidious attempts of the Prime Minister and a section of the press to get
  all the armies in France and Italy under one supreme generalissimo and end
  the dislocated muddling that had so long prolonged the war. It was a change
  that might have involved the replacement of regular generals by competent
  ones, and it imperilled everything that was most dear to the old lady's
  heart.</p>

  <p>It was <i>"an insult to the King's uniform,"</i> she wrote. <i>"A
  revolution. I knew that this sort of thing would begin if we let those
  Americans come in. We ought not to have let them come in. What good are they
  to us? What can they know of war? A crowd of ignorant republican renegades!
  British generals to be criticized and their prospects injured by French Roman
  Catholics and Atheists and chewing, expectorating Yankees and every sort of
  low foreigner. What is the world coming to? Sir Douglas Haig has been exactly
  where he is for two years. Surely he knows the ground better than any one
  else can possibly do."</i></p>

  <p>Once the theme of Lady Charlotte got loose in Oswald's poor old brain, it
  began a special worry of its own. He found his mind struggling with
  assertions and arguments. As this involved trying to remember exactly what
  she had said in this letter of hers, and as it was in his pocket, he
  presently chose the lesser of two evils and took it out to read
  over:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">"I suppose you have read in the papers what is happening in
  Clare. The people are ploughing up grass-land. It is as bad as that man
  Prothero. They raid gentlemen's houses to seize arms; they resist the police.
  That man Devil-era&mdash; so I must call him&mdash;speaks openly of a
  republic. Devil-era and Devil-in; is it a coincidence merely? All this comes
  of our ill-timed leniency after the Dublin rebellion. When will England learn
  the lesson Cromwell taught her? He was a wicked man, he made one great
  mistake for which he is no doubt answering to his Maker throughout all
  eternity, but he certainly did know how to manage these Irish. If he could
  come back now he would be on our side. He would have had his lesson. Your
  Bolshevik friends go on murdering and cutting throats, I see, like true
  Republicans. Happily the White Guards seem getting the upper hand in Finland.
  In the end I suppose we shall be driven to a peace with the Huns as the worst
  of two evils. If we do, it will only be your Bolsheviks and pacifists and
  strikers and Bolos who will be to blame.</p>

  <p class="letter">"The whining and cowardice of the East Enders disgusts me
  more and more. You read, I suppose, the account of the disgraceful panic
  during the air raid the other day in the East End, due entirely to foreigners
  of military age, mostly, no doubt, your Russian Bolsheviks. I am well away
  from such a rabble. I suffer from rheumatism here. I know it is rheumatism;
  what you say about gout is nonsense. In spite of its loyalty Ulster is damp.
  I pine more and more for the sun and warmth of Italy. Unwin must needs make
  herself very tiresome and peevish nowadays. These are not cheerful times for
  me. But one must do one's bit for one's country, I suppose, unworthy though
  it be.</p>

  <p class="letter">"So Mr. Peter is back in England again wounded after his
  flying about in the air. I suppose he is tasting the delights of matrimony,
  such as they are! What an affair! Something told me long ago that it would
  happen. I tried to separate them. My instincts warned me, and my instincts
  were right. Breed is breed, and the servant strain came out in her. You can't
  say I didn't warn you. Why you let them marry I cannot imagine!!! I am sure
  the young lady could have dispensed with that ceremony!!!! I still think at
  times of that queer scene I passed on the road when I came to Pelham Ford
  that Christmas. A second string, &mdash;no doubt of it. But Peter was her
  great chance, of course, thanks to your folly. Well, let us hope that in the
  modern way they won't have any children, for nothing is more certain than
  that these inter-breeding marriages are most harmful, and whether we like it
  or not you have to remember they are first cousins, if not in the sight of
  the law at any rate in the sight of God, which is what matters in this
  respect. Mr. Grimes, who has studied these things in his leisure time, tells
  me that there is a very great probability indeed that any child will be blind
  or malformed or consumptive, let us hope the latter, if not actually
  still-born, which, of course, would be the best thing that could possibly
  happen...."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 5</h3>

  <p class="first">At this point Oswald became aware of Joan coming out of the
  house towards him.</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch. "Much too early yet, Joan," he said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but I want to be meeting him," said Mrs. Joan....</p>

  <p>So they walked down to the station and waited for a long time on the
  platform. And Joan said very little to Oswald because she was musing
  pleasantly.</p>

  <p>When the train came in neither Joan nor Peter took much notice of Oswald
  after the first greeting. I do not see what else he could have expected; they
  were deeply in love and they had been apart for a couple of weeks, they were
  excited by each other and engrossed in each other. Oswald walked beside them
  up the road&mdash;apart. "I've got some work," he said abruptly in the hall.
  "See you at lunch," and went into his study and shut the door upon them,
  absurdly disappointed.</p><br>

  <h3>§ 6</h3>

  <p class="first">Peter came on Wednesday. It was not until Friday that Oswald
  found an opportunity to deliver his valediction. But he had rehearsed it, or
  rather he had been rehearsing experimental fragments of it for most of the
  night before. On Thursday night the cloudy malaise of his mind broke and
  cleared. Things fell into their proper places in his thoughts, and he could
  feel that his ideas were no longer distorted and confused. The valediction
  appeared, an ordered discourse. If only he could hold out through a long talk
  he felt he would be able to make himself plain to them....</p>

  <p>He lay in the darkness putting together phrase after phrase, sentence
  after sentence, developing a long and elaborate argument, dipping down into
  parentheses, throwing off footnotes, resuming his text. For the most part
  Joan and Peter remained silent hearers of this discourse; now his
  ratiocination glowed so brightly that they were almost forgotten, now they
  came into the discussion, they assisted, they said helpful and understanding
  things, they raised simple and obvious objections that were beautifully
  overcome.</p>

  <p>"What is education up to?" he would begin. "What is education?"</p>

  <p>Then came a sentence that he repeated in the stillness of his mind quite a
  number of times. "Consider this beast we are, this thing man!" He did not
  reckon with Peter's tendency to prompt replies.</p>

  <p>He would begin in the broadest, most elementary way. "Consider this beast
  we are, this thing man!" so he framed his opening: "a creature restlessly
  experimental, mischievous and destructive, as sexual as a monkey, and with no
  really strong social instincts, no such tolerance of his fellows as a deer
  has, no such instinctive self-devotion as you find in a bee or an ant. A
  solitary animal, a selfish animal. And yet this creature has now made for
  itself such conditions that it must be social. Must be. Or destroy itself.
  Continually it invents fresh means by which man may get at man to injure him
  or help him. That is one view of the creature, Peter, from your biological
  end." Here Peter was to nod, and remain attentively awaiting the next
  development. "And at the same time, there grows upon us all a sense of a
  common being and a common interest. Biologically separate, we unify
  spiritually. More and more do men feel, 'I am not for myself! There is
  something in me&mdash;that belongs to a greater being than myself&mdash;of
  which I am a part.'... I won't philosophize. I won't say which may be in the
  nature of cause and which of effect here. You can put what I have said in a
  dozen different ways. We may say, 'The individual must live in the species
  and find his happiness there'&mdash;that is&mdash;Biologese. <i>Our</i>
  language, Peter. Or we can quote, 'I am the True Vine and ye are the
  Branches.'" Oswald's mind rested on that for a time. "That is not <i>our</i>
  language, Peter, but it is the same idea. Essentially it is the same idea. Or
  we can talk of the 'One and the Many.' We can say we all live in the mercy of
  Allah, or if you are a liberal Jew that we are all a part of Israel. It seems
  to me that all these formulas are so much spluttering and variation over one
  idea. Doesn't it to you? Men can quarrel mortally even upon the question of
  how they shall say 'Brotherhood.'..." Here for a time Oswald's mind
  paused.</p>

  <p>He embarked upon a great and wonderful parenthesis upon religious
  intolerance in which at last he lost himself completely.</p>

  <p>"I don't see that men need fall out about religion," was his main
  proposition.</p>

  <p>"There was a time when I was against all religions. I denounced
  priestcraft and superstition and so on.... That is past. That is past. I want
  peace in the world.... Men's minds differ more about initial things than they
  do about final things. Some men think in images, others in words and abstract
  ideas&mdash;but yet the two sorts can think out the same practical
  conclusions. A lot of these chapels and churches only mean a difference in
  language.... Difference in dialect.... Often they don't mean the same things,
  those religious people, by the same words, but often contrariwise they mean
  the same things by quite different words. The deaf man says the dawn is
  bright and red, and the blind man says it is a sound of birds. It is the same
  dawn. The same dawn.... One man says 'God' and thinks of a person who is as
  much of a person as Joan is, and another says 'God' and thinks of an idea
  more abstract than the square root of minus one. That's a tangle in the
  primaries of thought and not a difference in practical intention. One can
  argue about such things for ever.... One can make a puzzle with a bit of wire
  that will bother and exasperate people for hours. Is it any wonder, then, if
  stating what is at the root of life bothers and exasperates people?...</p>

  <p>"Personally, I should say now that all religions are right, and none of
  them very happy in the words and symbols they choose. And none of them are
  calm enough&mdash;not calm enough. Not peaceful enough. They are all
  floundering about with symbols and metaphors, and it is a pity they will not
  admit it.... Why will people never admit their intellectual limitations in
  these matters?... All the great religions have this in common, this idea is
  common; they profess to teach the universal brotherhood of man and the
  universal reign of justice. Why argue about phrases? Why not put it in this
  fashion?"...</p>

  <p>For a long time Oswald argued about phrases before he could get back to
  the main thread of his argument....</p>

  <p>"Men have to be unified. They are driven to seek Unity. And they are still
  with the individualized instincts of a savage.... See then what education
  always has to be! The process of taking this imperfectly social, jealous,
  deeply savage creature and socializing him. The development of education and
  the development of human societies are one and the same thing. Education
  makes the social man. So far as schooling goes, it is quite plainly that. You
  teach your solitary beast to read and write, you teach him to express himself
  by drawing, you teach him other languages perhaps, and something of history
  and the distribution of mankind. What is it all but making this creature who
  would naturally possess only the fierce, narrow sociability of a savage
  family in a cave, into a citizen in a greater community? That is how I see
  it. That primarily is what has been done to you. An uneducated man is a man
  who can talk to a few score familiar people with a few hundred words. You two
  can talk to a quarter of mankind. With the help of a little translation you
  can get to understandings with most of mankind.... As a child learns the
  accepted language and the accepted writing and the laws and rules of life it
  learns the community. Watching the education of you two has made me believe
  more and more in the idea that, over and above the enlargement of expression
  and understanding, education is the state explaining itself to and
  incorporating the will of the individual....</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;but what state? What state? Now we come to it...."</p>

  <p>Oswald began to sketch out a universal history. There is no limit to these
  intellectual enterprises of the small hours.</p>

  <p>"All history is the record of an effort in man to form communities, an
  effort against resistance&mdash;against instinctive resistance. There seems
  no natural and proper limit to a human community. (That's my great point,
  that. That is what I have to tell them.) That is the final teaching of
  History, Joan and Peter; the very quintessence of History; that limitlessness
  of the community. As soon as men get a community of any size organized, it
  begins forthwith to develop roads, wheels, writing, ship-building, and all
  manner of things which presently set a fresh growth growing again. Let that,
  too, go on. Presently comes steam, mechanical traction, telegraphy, the
  telephone, wireless, aeroplanes; and each means an extension of ran.ire, and
  each therefore demands a larger community.... There seems no limit to the
  growth of states. I remember, Peter, a talk we had; we agreed that this
  hackneyed analogy people draw between the life and death of animals and the
  life and death of states was bad and silly. It isn't the same thing, Joan, at
  all. An animal, you see, has a limit of size; it develops no new organs for
  further growth when it has reached that limit, it breeds its successors, it
  ages naturally; when it dies, it dies for good and all and is cleared away.
  Exactly the reverse is true of a human community. Exactly? Yes, exactly. If
  it can develop its educational system steadily&mdash;note that&mdash;if it
  can keep up communications, a State can go on indefinitely, conquering,
  ousting, assimilating. Even an amoeba breaks up after growth, but a human
  community need not do so. And so far from breeding successors it kills them
  if it can&mdash;like Frazer's priest&mdash;where was it?&mdash;Aricia? The
  priest of Diana. The priest of <i>The Golden Bough</i>....</p>

  <p>Oswald picked up his thread again after a long, half dreaming excursion in
  Frazer-land.</p>

  <p>"It is just this limitlessness, this potential immortality of States that
  makes all the confusion and bloodshed of history. What is happening in the
  world today? What is the essence of it all? The communities of today are
  developing <i>range</i>, faster than ever they did: aeroplanes, guns, swifter
  ships, everywhere an increasing range of action. That is the most important
  fact to grasp about the modern world. It is the key fact in politics. From
  the first dawn of the human story you see man in a kind of a puzzled
  way&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;<i>pursuing the boundary of his possible
  community</i>. Which always recedes. Which recedes now faster than ever.
  Until it brings him to a fatal war and disaster. Over and over again it is
  the same story. If you had a coloured historical atlas of the world, the maps
  would be just a series of great dabs of empire, spreading,
  spreading&mdash;coming against resistances&mdash;collapsing. Each dab tries
  to devour the world and fails. There is no natural limit to a human
  community, no limit in time or space&mdash;except one.</p>

  <p>"Genus <i>Homo</i>, species <i>Sapiens</i>, Mankind, that is the only
  limit." (Peter, perhaps, might be led up to saying that.)...</p>

  <p>"What has the history of education always been? A series of little
  teaching chaps trying to follow up and fix the fluctuating boundaries of
  communities"&mdash;an image came into Oswald's head that pleased him and led
  him on&mdash;"like an insufficient supply of upholsterers trying to overtake
  and tack down a carpet that was blowing away in front of a gale. An
  insufficient supply of upholsterers... And the carpet always growing as it
  blows. That's good.... They were trying to fix something they hadn't clearly
  defined. And you have a lot of them still hammering away at their tacks when
  the edge of the carpet has gone on far ahead.... That was really the state of
  education in England when I took you two young people in hand; the carpet was
  in the air and most of the schoolmasters, schoolmistresses, writers,
  teachers, journalists, and all who build up and confirm ideas were hammering
  in tacks where the carpet had been resting the day before yesterday.... But a
  lot were not even hammering. No. They just went easy. Yes, that is what I
  mean when I say that education was altogether at loose ends.... But Germany
  was different; Germany was teaching and teaching in schools, colleges, press,
  everywhere, this new Imperialism of hers, a sort of patriotic melodrama, with
  Britain as Carthage and Berlin instead of Rome. They pointed the whole
  population to that end. They taught this war. All over the world a thousand
  other educational systems pointed in a thousand directions....</p>

  <p>"So Germany set fire to the Phoenix....</p>

  <p>"Only one other great country had any sort of state education. Real state
  education that is. The United States was also teaching citizenship, on a
  broader if shallower basis; a wider citizenship&mdash;goodwill to all
  mankind. Shallower. Shallower certainly. But it was there. A republican
  culture. Candour... generosity.... The world has still to realize its debt to
  the common schools of America....</p>

  <p>"This League of Free Nations, of which all men are dreaming and talking,
  this World Republic, is the rediscovered outline, the proper teaching of all
  real education, the necessary outline now of human life.... There is nothing
  else to do, nothing else that people of our sort can do at all, nothing but
  baseness, grossness, vileness, and slavery unless we live now as a part of
  that process of a world peace. Our lives have got to be political lives. All
  lives have to be made political lives. We can't run about loose any more.
  This idea of a world-wide commonwealth, this ideal of an everlasting
  world-peace in which we are to live and move and have our being, has to be
  built up in every school, in every mind, in every lesson. 'You belong. You
  belong. And the world belongs to you.'...</p>

  <p>What ought one to teach when one teaches geography, for instance, but the
  common estate of mankind? Here, the teacher should say, are mountains and
  beautiful cities you may live to see. Here are plains where we might grow
  half the food of mankind! Here are the highways of our common life, and here
  are pleasant byeways where you may go! All this is your inheritance. Your
  estate. To rejoice in&mdash;and serve. But is that how geography is
  taught?...</p>

  <p>"We used to learn lists of the British possessions, with their total
  exports and imports in money. I remember it as if it were yesterday.... Old
  Smugs&mdash;a hot New Imperialist&mdash;new then....</p>

  <p>"Then what is history but a long struggle of men to fin peace and safety,
  and how they have been prevented by baseness and greed and folly? Is that
  right? No, folly and baseness&mdash;and hate.... Hate certainly.... All
  history is one dramatic story, of man blundering his way from the lonely ape
  to the world commonwealth. All history is each man's adventure. But what
  teacher makes history much more than a dwarfish twaddle about boundaries and
  kings and wars? Dwarfish twaddle. History! It went nowhere. It did nothing.
  Was there ever anything more like a crowd of people getting into an omnibus
  without wheels than the History Schools at Oxford? Or your History Tripos?"
  Oswald repeated his image and saw that it was good....</p>

  <p>"What is the teaching of a language again but teaching the knowledge of
  another people&mdash;an exposition of the soul of another people&mdash;a work
  of union? . . . But you see what I mean by all this; this idea of a great
  world of co-operating peoples; it is not just a diplomatic scheme, not
  something far off that Foreign Offices are doing; it is an idea that must
  revolutionize the lessons of a child in the nursery and alter the maps upon
  every schoolroom wall. And frame our lives altogether. Or be nothing. The
  World Peace. To that we all belong. I have a fancy&mdash;As though this idea
  had been hovering over the world, unsubstantial, unable to exist&mdash;until
  all this blood-letting, this torment and disaster gave it a body....</p>

  <p>"What I am saying to you the University ought to have said to you.</p>

  <p>"Instead of Universities"&mdash;he sought for a phrase and produced one
  that against the nocturnal dark seemed brilliant and luminous. "Instead of
  the University <i>passant regardant</i>, we want the University militant. We
  want Universities all round and about the world, associated, working to a
  common end, drawing together all the best minds and the finest wills, a
  myriad of multi-coloured threads, into one common web of a world
  civilization."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 7</h3>

  <p class="first">Also that night Oswald made a discourse upon the
  English.</p>

  <p>"Yours is a great inheritance, Joan and Peter," he said to the darkness.
  "You are young; that is a great thing in itself. The world cries out now for
  the young to enter into possession. And also&mdash;do you ever think of
  it?&mdash;you are English, Joan and Peter....</p>

  <p>"Let me say something to you before we have done, something out of my
  heart. Have I ever canted patriotism to you! No! Am I an aggressive
  Imperialist? Am I not a Home Ruler? For Ireland. For India. The best years of
  my life have been spent in saving black men from white&mdash;and mostly those
  white men were of our persuasion, men of the buccaneer strain, on the loot.
  But now that we three are here together with no one else to hear us, I will
  confess. I tell you there is no race and no tradition in the whole world that
  I would change for my English race and tradition. I do not mean the brief
  tradition of this little Buckingham Palace and Westminster system here that
  began yesterday and will end tomorrow, I mean the great tradition of the
  English that is spread all over the earth, the tradition of Shakespeare and
  Milton, of Newton and Bacon, of Runnymede and Agincourt, the tradition of the
  men who speak fairly and act fairly, without harshness and without fear, who
  face whatever odds there are against them and take no account of Kings. It is
  in Washington and New York and Christchurch and Sydney, just as much as it is
  in Pelham Ford.... Well, upon us more than upon any other single people rests
  now for a time the burthen of human destiny. Upon us and France. France is
  the spear head but we are the shaft. If we fail, mankind may fail. We English
  have made the greatest empire that the world has ever seen; across the
  Atlantic we have also made the greatest republic. And these are but phases in
  our task. The better part of our work still lies before us. The weight is on
  us now. It was Milton who wrote long ago that when God wanted some task of
  peculiar difficulty to be done he turned to his Englishmen. And he turns to
  us today. Old Milton saw English shine clear and great for a time and then
  pass into the darkness. ... He didn't lose his faith.... Church and crown are
  no part of the real England which we inherit....</p>

  <p>"We have no reason to be ashamed of our race and country, Joan and Peter,
  for all the confusion and blundering of these last years. Our generals and
  politicians have missed opportunity after opportunity. I cannot talk yet of
  such things.... The blunderings.... The slackness.... Hanoverian England with
  its indolence, its dullness, its economic uncleanness, its canting
  individualism, its contempt for science and system, has been an England
  darkened, an England astray. Young England has had to pay at last for all
  those wasted years&mdash;and has paid.... My God! the men we have expended
  already in fighting these Germans, the brave, beautiful men, the jesting
  common men, the fresh boys, so cheerful and kind and gallant!... And the
  happiness that has died! And the shame of following after clumsy, mean
  leadership in the sight of all the world!... But there rests no stain on our
  blood. For our people here and for the Americans this has been a war of
  honour. We did not come into this war for sordid or narrow ends. Our
  politicians when they made base treaties had to hide them from our people....
  Even in the face of the vilest outrages, even now the English keep a balanced
  justice and will not hate the German common men for things they have been
  forced to do. Yesterday I saw the German prisoners who work at Stanton
  getting into the train and joking with their guard. They looked well fed and
  healthy and uncowed. One carried a bunch of primroses. No one has an ill word
  for these men on all the country-side.... Does any other people in the world
  treat prisoners as we treat them?...</p>

  <p>"Well, the time has come for our people now to go on from Empire and from
  Monroe doctrine, great as these ideas have been, to something still greater;
  the time has come for us to hold out our hands to every man in the world who
  is ready for a disciplined freedom. The German has dreamt of setting up a
  Caesar over the whole world. Against that we now set up a disciplined world
  freedom. For ourselves and all mankind....</p>

  <p>"Joan and Peter, that is what I have been coming to in all this wandering
  discourse. Yours is a great inheritance. You and your generation have to
  renew and justify England in a new world. You have to link us again in a
  common purpose with our kind everywhere. You have to rescue our destinies,
  the destinies of the world, from these stale quarrels; you have to take the
  world out of the hands of these weary and worn men, these old and oldish men,
  these men who can learn no more. You have to reach back and touch the England
  of Shakespeare, Milton, Raleigh, and Blake&mdash;and that means you have to
  go forward. You have to take up the English tradition as it was before church
  and court and a base imperialism perverted it. You have to become political.
  Now. You have to become responsible. Now. You have to create. Now. You, with
  your fresh vision, with the lessons you have learnt still burning bright in
  your minds, you have to remake the world. Listen when the old men tell you
  facts, for very often they know. Listen when they reason, they will teach you
  many twists and turns. But when they dogmatize, when they still want to rule
  unquestioned, and, above all, when they say '<i>impossible</i>,' even when
  they say '<i>wait&mdash;be dilatory and discreet,</i>' push them aside. Their
  minds squat crippled beside dead traditions.... That England of the Victorian
  old men, and its empire and its honours and its court and precedences, it is
  all a dead body now, it has died as the war has gone on, and it has to be
  buried out of our way lest it corrupt you and all the world
  again...."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 8</h3>

  <p class="first">We underrate the disposition of youth to think for
  itself.</p>

  <p>Oswald set himself to deliver this Valediction of his after dinner on
  Friday evening....</p>

  <p>Joan was hesitating between a game of Demon Patience with Peter&mdash;in
  which she always played thirteen to his eleven and usually won in spite of
  the handicap&mdash;and an inclination for Bach's <i>Passacaglia</i> upon the
  pianola in the study. Peter expressed himself ready for whatever she chose;
  he would play D.P. or read <i>Moll Flanders</i>&mdash;he had just discovered
  the delight of that greatest of all eighteenth century novels. He was sitting
  on the couch in the library and Joan was standing upon the hearthrug,
  regarding him thoughtfully, when Oswald came in. He stopped to hear what
  Peter was saying, with his one eye intent on Joan's pretty gravity.</p>

  <p>"No," he interrupted. "This is my evening.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, coming up to the fire; "I want to talk to you young
  people. I want to know some things&mdash; I want to know what you make of
  life.... I want... an exchange of views."</p>

  <p>He stood with his back to the fire and smiled at Joan's grave face close
  to his own. "I've got to talk to you," he said, "very seriously. It's
  necessary."</p>

  <p>Having paralysed them by this preface he sat down in his deep armchair,
  pulled it an inch or so towards the fire, and leaning forward, with his eye
  on the spitting coals, began.</p>

  <p>"I wish I could talk better, Joan and Peter.... I know I've never been a
  good talker&mdash;it's been rather a loss between us all. And now
  particularly.... I want to talk. You must let me get it out in my own
  way....</p>

  <p>"You see," he went on after a moment or so to rally his forces, "I've been
  your guardian, I've had you the affairs go, Sycamore, you know We won't go
  into that. That's all plain sailing. But it's the education I want to talk
  about&mdash;and your future. You are now both of age. Well past. You're on
  the verge of twenty-five, Peter&mdash;in a month or so. You're both off
  now&mdash;housekeeping. You're dropping the pilot. It's high time, I
  suppose...."</p>

  <p>Joan glanced at Peter, and then sank noiselessly into a crouching attitude
  close to Oswald's knee. He paused to stroke her hair.</p>

  <p>"I've been trying to get you all that I could get you.... Education....
  I've had to blunder and experiment. I ought to tell you what I've aimed at
  and what I've done, take stock with you of the world I've educated you for
  and the part you're going to play in it. Take stock.... It's been a badly
  planned undertaking, I know. But then it's such a surprising and unexpected
  world. All the time I've been learning, and most things I've learnt more or
  less too late to use the knowledge properly...."</p>

  <p>He paused.</p>

  <p>Peter looked at his guardian and said nothing. Oswald patted the head at
  his knee in return for a caress. It was an evasive, even apologetic pat, for
  he did not want to be distracted by affection just then.</p>

  <p>"This war has altered the whole world," he went on. "Life has become stark
  and intense, and when I took this on&mdash;when I took up the task of
  educating you&mdash;our world here seemed the most wrapped up and comfortable
  and secure world you can possibly imagine. Comfortable to the pitch of
  stuffiness. Most English people didn't trouble a bit about the shape of human
  life; they thought it was&mdash;well, rather like a heap of down cushions.
  For them it was. For most of Europe and America.... They thought it was all
  right and perfectly safe&mdash;if only you didn't bother. And education had
  lost its way. Yes. That puts the case. <i>Education had lost its
  way</i>."</p>

  <p>Oswald paused again. He fixed his one eye firmly on a glowing cavity in
  the fire, as though that contained the very gist of his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"What is education up to?" he asked. "What is education?..."</p>

  <p>Thereupon of course he ought to have gone on to the passage beginning,
  "Consider this beast we are, this thing man!" as he had already rehearsed it
  overnight. But Peter had not learnt his part properly.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it's fitting the square natural man into the round hole of
  civilized life," Peter threw out.</p>

  <p>This reply greatly disconcerted Oswald. "Exactly," he said, and was for
  some moments at a loss.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, rallying. "But what is civilized life?"</p>

  <p>"Oh!... Creative activities in an atmosphere of helpful goodwill," Peter
  tried in the brief pause that followed.</p>

  <p>Oswald had a disagreeable feeling that he was getting to the end of his
  discourse before he delivered its beginning. "Yes," he said again. "Yes. But
  for that you must have a political form."</p>

  <p>"The World State," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"The League of Free Nations," said Oswald, "to enforce Peace throughout
  the earth."</p>

  <p>The next remark that came from Peter was still more unexpected and
  embarrassing.</p>

  <p>"Peace is nothing," said Peter.</p>

  <p>Oswald turned his red eye upon his ward, in profound amazement.</p>

  <p>Did they differ fundamentally in their idea of the human future?</p>

  <p>"Peace, my dear Peter, is everything," he protested.</p>

  <p>"But, sir, it's nothing more than the absence of war. It's a negative. In
  itself it's&mdash;vacuum. You can't live in a vacuum."</p>

  <p>"But I mean an active peace."</p>

  <p>"That would be something more than peace. War is an activity. Peace is
  not. If you take war out of the world, you must have some other
  activity."</p>

  <p>"But doesn't the organization of the World Peace in itself constitute an
  activity?"</p>

  <p>"That would be a diminishing activity, sir. Like a man getting himself
  morphia and taking it and going to sleep. A World Peace would release energy,
  and as the energy was released, if the end were merely peace, there would be
  less need for it. Until things exploded."</p>

  <p>Great portions of Oswald's Valediction broke away and vanished for ever
  into the limbo of unspoken discourses.</p>

  <p>"But would you have war go on, Peter?"</p>

  <p>"Not in its present form. But struggle and unification, which is the end
  sought in all struggles, must go on in some form, sir," said Peter, "while
  life goes on. We have to get the World State and put an end to war. I agree.
  But the real question is what are you going to do with our Peace? What
  struggle is to take the place of war? What is mankind going to do? Most wars
  have come about hitherto because somebody was bored. Do you remember how
  bored we all were in 1914? And the rotten way we were all going on then? A
  World State or a League of Nations with nothing to do but to keep the peace
  will bore men intolerably.... That's what I like about the Germans."</p>

  <p>"What you like about the Germans!" Oswald cried in horror.</p>

  <p>"They did get a move on, sir," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"We don't want a preventive League of Nations," Peter expanded. "It's got
  to be creative or nothing. Or else we shall be in a sort of perpetual
  Coronation year&mdash;with nothing doing on account of the processions.
  Horrible!"</p>

  <p>For a little while Oswald made no reply. He could not recall a single
  sentence of the lost Valediction that was at all appropriate here, and he was
  put out and distressed beyond measure that Peter could find anything to
  "like" about the Germans.</p>

  <p>"A World Peace for its own sake is impossible," Peter went on. "The Old
  Experimenter would certainly put a spoke into that wheel."</p>

  <p>"Who is the Old Experimenter?" asked Oswald.</p>

  <p>"He's a sort of God I have," said Peter. "Something between theology and a
  fairy tale. I dreamt about him. When I was delirious. He doesn't rule the
  world or anything of that sort, because he doesn't want to, but he keeps on
  dropping new things into it. To see what happens. Like a man setting himself
  problems to work out in his head. He lives in a little out-of-the-way office.
  That's the idea."</p>

  <p>"You haven't told me about him," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"I shall some day," said Peter. "When I feel so disposed...."</p>

  <p>"This is very disconcerting," said Oswald, much perplexed. He scowled at
  the fire before him. "But you do realize the need there is for some form of
  world state and some ending of war? Unless mankind is to destroy itself
  altogether."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," said Peter. "But we aren't going to do that on a peace
  proposition simply. It's got to be a positive proposal. You know,
  sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd call me Nobby," said Oswald.</p>

  <p>"It's a vice contracted in the army, this Sir-ing," said Peter. "It's
  Nobby in my mind, anyhow. But you see, I've got a kind of habit, at night and
  odd times, of thinking over my little misadventure with that balloon and my
  scrap with von Papen. They are my stock dreams, with extra details worked in,
  nasty details some of them... and then I wake up and think about them. I
  think over the parachute affair more than the fight, because it lasted longer
  and I wasn't so active. I felt it more. Especially being shot in the legs....
  That sort of dream when you float helpless.... But the thing that impresses
  me most in reflecting on those little experiences is the limitless amount of
  intelligence that expended itself on such jobs as breaking my wrist,
  splintering my shoulder-blade and smashing up my leg. The amount of ingenuity
  and good workmanship in my instruments and the fittings of my basket, for
  example, was extraordinary, having regard to the fact that it was just one
  small item in an artillery system for blowing Germans to red rags. And the
  stuff and intelligence they were putting up against me, that too was
  wonderful; the way the whole problem had been thought out, the special clock
  fuse and so on. Well, my point is that the chap who made that equipment
  wasn't particularly interested in killing me, and that the chaps who made my
  outfit weren't particularly keen on the slaughter of Germans. But they had
  nothing else to do. They were brought up in a pointless world. They were
  caught by a vulgar quarrel. What did they care for the Kaiser? Old ass! What
  they were interested in was making the things...."</p>

  <p>Peter became very earnest in his manner. "No peace, as we have known peace
  hitherto, offers such opportunities for good inventive work as war does.
  That's my point, Nobby. There's no comparison between the excitement and the
  endless problems of making a real, live, efficient submarine, for example,
  that has to meet and escape the intensest risks, and the occupation of
  designing a great, big, safe, upholstered liner in which fat swindlers can
  cross the Atlantic without being seasick. War tempts imaginative, restless
  people, and a stagnant peace bores them. And you've got to reckon with
  intelligence and imagination in this world, Nobby, more than anything. They
  aren't strong enough to control perhaps, but they will certainly upset.
  Inventive, restless men are the particular instruments of my Old
  Experimenter. He prefers them now to plague, pestilence, famine, flood and
  earthquake. They are more delicate instruments. And more efficient. And they
  won't stand a passive peace. Under no circumstances can you hope to induce
  the chap who contrived the clock fuse and the chap who worked out my gas bag
  or the chap with a new aeroplane gadget, and me&mdash;me, too&mdash;to stop
  cerebrating and making our damndest just in order to sit about safely in
  meadows joining up daisy chains&mdash;like a beastly lot of figures by Walter
  Crane. The Old Experimenter finds some mischief still for idle brains to do.
  He insists on it. That's fundamental to the scheme of things."</p>

  <p>"But that's no reason," interrupted Oswald, "why you and the inventors who
  were behind you, and the Germans who made and loaded and fired that shell,
  shouldn't all get together to do something that will grow and endure. Instead
  of killing one another."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that's it!" said Peter. "But the word for that isn't Peace."</p>

  <p>"Then what is the word for it?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Peter. "The Great Game, perhaps."</p>

  <p>"And where does it take you?"</p>

  <p>Peter threw out his hands. "It's an exploration," he said. "It will take
  man to the centre of the earth; it will take him to the ends of space,
  between the atoms and among the stars. How can we tell beforehand? You must
  have faith. But of one thing I am sure, that man cannot stagnate. It is
  forbidden. It is the uttermost sin. Why, the Old Man will come out of his
  office himself to prevent it! This war and all the blood and loss of it is
  because the new things are entangled among old and dead things, worn-out and
  silly things, and we've not had the vigour to get them free. Old idiot
  nationality, national conceit&mdash;expanding to imperialism, nationality in
  a state of megalomania, has been allowed to get hold of the knife that was
  meant for a sane generation to carve out a new world with. Heaven send he
  cuts his own throat this time! Or else there may be a next time.... I'm all
  for the one world state, and the end of flags and kings and custom houses.
  But I have my doubts of all this talk of making the world safe&mdash;safe for
  democracy. I want the world made one for the adventure of mankind, which is
  quite another story. I have been in the world now, Nobby, for five-and-twenty
  years, and I am only beginning to suspect the wonder and beauty of the things
  we men might know and do. If only we could get our eyes and hands free of the
  old inheritance. What has mankind done yet to boast about? I despise human
  history&mdash;because I believe in God. Not the God you don't approve of,
  Nobby, but in my Old Experimenter, whom I confess I don't begin to
  understand, and in the far-off, eternal scheme he hides from us and which he
  means us to develop age by age. Oh! I don't understand him, I don't begin to
  explain him; he's just a figure for what I feel is the reality. But he is
  right, he is wonderful. And instead of just muddling about over the surface
  of his universe, we have to get into the understanding of it to the very
  limits of our ability, to live our utmost and do the intensest best we
  can."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Oswald; "yes." This was after his own heart, and yet it did
  not run along the lines of the Valedictory that had flowered with such
  Corinthian richness overnight. He had been thinking then of world peace; what
  Peter was driving at now was a world purpose; but weren't the two after all
  the same thing? He sat with his one eye reflecting the red light of the fire,
  and the phrases that had come in such generous abundance overnight now
  refused to come at all.</p>

  <p>Peter, on the couch, continued to think aloud.</p>

  <p>"Making the world safe for democracy," said Peter. "That isn't quite it.
  If democracy means that any man may help who can, that school and university
  will give every man and woman the fairest chance, the most generous
  inducement to help, to do the thing he can best do under the best conditions,
  then, Yes; but if democracy means getting up a riot and boycott among the
  stupid and lazy and illiterate whenever anything is doing, then I say No!
  Every human being has got to work, has got to take part. If our laws and
  organization don't insist upon that, the Old Experimenter will. So long as
  the world is ruled by stale ideas and lazy ideas, he is determined that it
  shall flounder from war to war. Now what does this democracy mean? Does it
  mean a crowd of primitive brutes howling down progress and organization?
  because if it does, I want to be in the machine-gun section. When you talk of
  education, Nobby, you think of highly educated people, of a nation instructed
  through and through. But what of democracy in Russia, where you have a
  naturally clever people in a state of peasant ignorance&mdash;who can't even
  read? Until the schoolmaster has talked to every one for ten or twelve years,
  can you have what President Wilson thinks of as democracy at all?"</p>

  <p>"Now there you meet me," said Oswald. "That is the idea I have been trying
  to get at with you." And for some minutes the palatial dimensions of the lost
  Valedictory loomed out. Where he had said "peace" overnight, however, he now
  said progress.</p>

  <p>But the young man on the couch was much too keenly interested to make a
  good audience. When presently Oswald propounded his theory that all the great
  world religions were on the side of this World Republic that he and Peter
  desired, Peter demurred.</p>

  <p>"But is that true of Catholicism for instance?" said Peter.</p>

  <p>Oswald quoted, "I am the Vine and ye are the Branches."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Peter. "But look at the Church itself. Don't look at the
  formula but at the practice and the daily teaching. Is it truly a growing
  Vine?" The reality of Catholicism, Peter argued, was a traditional,
  sacramental religion, a narrow fetish religion with a specialized priest, it
  was concerned primarily with another world, it set its face against any
  conception of a scheme of progress in this world apart from its legend of the
  sacrifice of the Mass.</p>

  <p>"All good Catholics sneer at progress," said Peter. "Take Belloc and
  Chesterton, for example; they hate the idea of men working steadily for any
  great scheme of effort here. They hold by stagnant standards, planted deep in
  the rich mud of life. What's the Catholic conception of human
  life?&mdash;guzzle, booze, call the passion of the sexes unclean and behave
  accordingly, confess, get absolution, and at it again. Is there any
  recognition in Catholicism of the duty of keeping your body fit or your brain
  active? They're worse than the man who buried his talent in a clean napkin;
  they bury it in wheezy fat. It's a sloven's life. What have we in common with
  that? Always they are harking back to the thirteenth century, to the peasant
  life amidst dung and chickens. It's a different species of mind from ours,
  with the head and feet turned backward. What is the good of expecting the
  Pope, for instance, and his Church to help us in creating a League of
  Nations? His aim would be a world agreement to stop progress, and we want to
  release it. He wants peace in order to achieve nothing, and we want peace in
  order to do everything. What is the good of pretending that it is the same
  peace? A Catholic League of Nations would be a conspiracy of stagnation,
  another Holy Alliance. What real world unity can come through them? Every
  step on the way to the world state and the real unification of men will be
  fought by the stagnant men and the priests. Why blind ourselves to that?
  Progress is a religion in itself. Work and learning are our creed. We cannot
  make terms with any other creed. The priest has got his God and we seek our
  God for ever. The priest is finished and completed and self-satisfied, and
  we&mdash;we are beginning...."</p><br>

  <h3>§ 9</h3>

  <p class="first">There were two days yet before Peter went back to his work
  in London. Saturday dawned blue and fine, and Joan and he determined to spend
  it in a long tramp over the Hertfordshire hills and fields. He meant to stand
  no nonsense from his foot. "If I can't walk four miles an hour then I must do
  two," he said. "And if the pace is too slow for you, Joan, you must run round
  and round me and bark." They took a long route by field and lane through
  A1bury and Furneaux Pelham to the little inn at Stocking Pelham, where they
  got some hard biscuits and cheese and shandygaff, and came home by way of
  Patmore Heath, and the golden oaks and the rivulet. And as they went Peter
  talked of Oswald.</p>

  <p>"Naturally he wants to know what we are going to do," said Peter, and
  then, rather inconsequently, "He's ill."</p>

  <p>"This war is like a wasting fever in the blood and in the mind," said
  Peter. "All Europe is ill. But with him it mixes with the old fever. That
  splinter at Fricourt was no joke for him. He oughtn't to have gone out. He's
  getting horribly lean, and his eye is like a garnet."</p>

  <p>"I love him," said Joan.</p>

  <p>But she did not want to discuss Oswald just then.</p>

  <p>"About this new theology of yours, Peter," she said....</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Peter.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by this Old Experimenter of yours? Is
  he&mdash;<i>God</i>?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. I thought he was. He's&mdash;He's a Symbol. He's just a
  Caricature I make to express how all this"&mdash;Peter swept his arm across
  the sunlit world&mdash;"seems to stand to me. If one can't draw the thing any
  better, one has to make a caricature."</p>

  <p>Joan considered that gravely.</p>

  <p>"I thought of him first in my dream as the God of the Universe," Peter
  explained.</p>

  <p>"You couldn't love a God like that," Joan remarked.</p>

  <p>"Heavens, no! He's too vast, too incomprehensible. I love you&mdash;and
  Oswald&mdash;and the R.F.C., Joan, and biology. But he's above and beyond
  that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>"Could you pray to him?" asked Joan.</p>

  <p>"Not to <i>him</i>," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"I pray," said Joan. "Don't you?"</p>

  <p>"And swear," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"One prays to something&mdash;it isn't oneself."</p>

  <p>"The fashion nowadays is to speak of the God in the Heart and the God in
  the Universe."</p>

  <p>"Is it the same God?"</p>

  <p>"Leave it at that," said Peter. "We don't know. All the waste and muddle
  in religion is due to people arguing and asserting that they are the same,
  that they are different but related, or that they are different but opposed.
  And so on and so on. How can we know? What need is there to know? In view of
  the little jobs we are doing. Let us leave it at that."</p>

  <p>Joan was silent for a while. "I suppose we must," she said.</p>

  <p>"And what are we going to do with ourselves," asked Joan, "when the war is
  over?"</p>

  <p>"They can't keep us in khaki for ever," Peter considered. "There's a
  Ministry of Reconstruction foozling away in London, but it's never said a
  word to me of the some-day that is coming. I suppose it hasn't learnt to talk
  yet."</p>

  <p>"What do you think of doing?" asked Joan.</p>

  <p>"Well, first&mdash;a good medical degree. Then I can doctor if I have to.
  But, if I'm good enough, I shall do research. I've a sort of feeling that
  along the border line of biology and chemistry I might do something useful.
  I've some ideas.... I suppose I shall go back to Cambridge for a bit. We
  neither of us need earn money at once. It will be queer&mdash;after being a
  grown-up married man&mdash;to go back to proctors and bulldogs. What are you
  going to do, Joan, when you get out of uniform?"</p>

  <p>"Look after you first, Petah. Oh! it's worth doing. And it won't take me
  all my time. And then I've got my own ideas...."</p>

  <p>"Out with 'em, Joan."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Petah, I shall learn plumbing."</p>

  <p>"Jobbing?"</p>

  <p>"No. And bricklaying and carpentry. All I can. And then I am going to
  start building houses."</p>

  <p>"Architect?"</p>

  <p>"As little as possible," said Joan. "No. No beastly Architecture for Art's
  sake for me! Do you remember how people used to knock their heads about at
  The Ingle-Nook?</p>

  <p>I've got some money. Why shouldn't I be able to build houses as well as
  the fat builder men with big, flat thumbs who used to build houses before the
  war?"</p>

  <p>"Jerry-building?"</p>

  <p>"High-class jerry-building, if you like. Cottages with sensible insides,
  real insides, and not so much waste space and scamping to make up for it.
  They're half a million houses short in this country already. There's
  something in building appeals to my sort of imagination. And I'm going to
  make money, Petah."</p>

  <p>"I love the way you carry your tail," said Peter. "Always."</p>

  <p>"Well, doing running repairs hardens a woman's soul."</p>

  <p>"You'll make more money than I shall, perhaps. But now I begin to
  understand all these extraordinary books you've been studying.... I might
  have guessed.... Why not?"</p>

  <p>He limped along, considering it. "Why shouldn't you?" he said. "A service
  flat will leave your hands free.... I've always wondered secretly why women
  didn't plunge into that sort of business more."</p>

  <p>"It's been just diffidence," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"<i>Click</i>!" said Peter. "That's gone, anyhow. If a lot of women do as
  you do and become productive for good, this old muddle of a country will sit
  up in no time. It doubles the output.... I wonder if the men will like
  working under you?"</p>

  <p>"There'll be a boss in the background," said Joan. "Mr. John Debenham.
  Who'll never turn up. Being, in fact, no more than camouflage for Joan of
  that ilk. I shall be just my own messenger and agent.</p>

  <p>"One thing I know," said Joan, "and that is, that I will make a cottage or
  a flat that won't turn a young woman into an old one in ten years' time.
  Living in that Jepson flat without a servant has brightened me up in a lot of
  ways.... And a child will grow up in my cottages without being crippled in
  its mind by awkwardness and ugliness.... This sort of thing always has been
  woman's work really. Only we've been so busy chittering and powdering our
  silly noses &mdash;and laying snares for our Peters. Who didn't know what was
  good for them."</p>

  <p>Peter laughed and was amused. He felt a pleasant assurance that Joan
  really was going to build houses.</p>

  <p>"Joan," he said, "it's a bleak world before us&mdash;and I hate to think
  of Nobby. He's so ill. But the work&mdash;the good hard work&mdash;there's
  times when I rather like to think of that.... They were beastly years just
  before the war."</p>

  <p>"I hated them," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"But what a lot of stuff there was about!" said Peter. "The petrol! Given
  away, practically, along the roadside everywhere. And the joints of meat. Do
  you remember the big hams we used to have on the sideboard? For breakfast. A
  lot of sausages going sizzle! Eggs galore! Bacon! Haddock. Perhaps cutlets.
  And the way one could run off abroad!"</p>

  <p>"To Italy," said Joan dangerously.</p>

  <p>"God knows when those times will come back again! Not for years. Not for
  our lifetimes."</p>

  <p>"If they came back all at once we'd have indigestion," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"Orgy," said Peter. "But they won't."...</p>

  <p>Presently their note became graver.</p>

  <p>"We've got to live like fanatics. If a lot of us don't live like fanatics,
  this staggering old world of ours won't recover. It will stagger and then go
  flop. And a race of Bolshevik peasants will breed pigs among the ruins. We
  owe it to ourselves, we owe it to the world to prevent that."</p>

  <p>"And we owe it to the ones who have died," said Joan.</p>

  <p>She hesitated, and then she began to tell him something of the part
  Wilmington had played in their lives.</p>

  <p>They went through field after field, through gates and over stiles and by
  a coppice spangled with primroses, while she told him of the part that
  Wilmington had played in bringing them together; Wilmington who was now no
  more than grey soil where the battle still raged in France. Many were the
  young people who talked so of dead friends in those days. Their voices became
  grave and faintly deferential, as though they had invoked a third presence to
  mingle with their duologue. They were very careful to say nothing and to
  think as little as possible that might hurt Wilmington's self-love.</p>

  <p>Presently they found themselves speculating again about the kind of world
  that lay ahead of them&mdash;whether it would be a wholly poor world or a
  poverty-struck world infested and devastated by a few hundred millionaires
  and their followings. Poor we were certain to be. We should either be sternly
  poor or meanly poor. But Peter was disposed to doubt whether the war
  millionaires would "get away with the swag."</p>

  <p>"There's too much thinking and reading nowadays for that," said Peter.
  "They won't get away with it. This is a new age, Joan. If they try that game
  they won't have five years' run."</p>

  <p>No, it would be a world generally poor, a tired but chastened world
  getting itself into order again.... Would there be much music in the years
  ahead? Much writing or art? Would there be a new theatre and the excitement
  of first nights again? Should we presently travel by aeroplane, and find all
  the world within a few days' journey? They were both prepared to resign
  themselves to ten years' of work and scarcity, but they both clung to the
  hope of returning prosperity and freedom after that.</p>

  <p>"Well, well, Joan," said Peter, "these times teach us to love. I'm
  crippled. We've got to work hard. But I'm not unhappy. I'm happier than I was
  when I had no idea of what I wanted in life, when I lusted for everything and
  was content with nothing, in the days before the war. I'm a wise old man now
  with my stiff, wrist and my game leg. You change everything, Joan. You make
  everything worth while."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to think it was me," said Joan idiomatically.</p>

  <p>"It's you....</p>

  <p>"After all there must be some snatches of holiday. I shall walk with you
  through beautiful days&mdash;as we are doing today&mdash;days that would only
  be like empty silk purses if it wasn't that they held you in them. Scenery
  and flowers and sunshine mean nothing to me&mdash;until you come in. I'm
  blind until you give me eyes. Joan, do you know how beautiful you are? When
  you smile? When you stop to think? Frowning a little. When you
  look&mdash;yes, just like that."</p>

  <p>"<i>No</i>!" said Joan, but very cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"But you are&mdash;you are endlessly beautiful. Endlessly. Making love to
  Joan&mdash;it's the intensest of joys. Every time&mdash; As if one had just
  discovered her."</p>

  <p>"There's a certain wild charm about Petah," Joan admitted, "for a coarse
  taste."</p>

  <p>"After all, whether it's set in poverty or plenty," said Peter; "whether
  it's rational or irrational, making love is still at the heart of us
  humans."...</p>

  <p>For a time they exulted shamelessly in themselves. They talked of the good
  times they had had together in the past. They revived memories of Bungo Peter
  and the Sagas that had slumbered in silence since the first dawn of
  adolescence. She recalled a score of wonderful stories and adventures that he
  had altogether forgotten. She had a far clearer and better memory for such
  things than he. "D'you remember lightning slick, Petah? And how the days went
  faster? D'you remember how he put lightning slick on his bicycle?"...</p>

  <p>But Peter had forgotten that.</p>

  <p>"And when we fought for that picshua you made of Adela," Joan said. "When
  I bit you.... It was my first taste of you, Petah. You tasted dusty...."</p>

  <p>"I suppose we've always had a blind love for each other," said Peter,
  "always."</p>

  <p>"I hated you to care for any one but myself," said Joan, "since ever I can
  remember. I hated even Billy."</p>

  <p>"It's well we found out in time," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"I found out," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"Ever since we stopped being boy and girl together," said Peter, "I've
  never been at peace in my nerves and temper till now.... Now I feel as though
  I swung free in life, safe, sure, content."</p>

  <p>"Content," weighed Joan suspiciously. "But you're still in love with me,
  Petah?"</p>

  <p>"Not particularly in love," said Peter. "No. But I'm loving you&mdash;as
  the June sun loves an open meadow, shining all over it. I shall always love
  you, Joan, because there is no one like you in all the world. No one at all.
  Making love happens, but love endures. How can there be companionship and
  equality except between the like?&mdash;who can keep step, who can climb
  together, joke broad and shameless, and never struggle for the upper hand?
  And where in all the world shall I find that, Joan, but in you? Listen to
  wisdom, Joan! There are two sorts of love between men and women, and only
  two&mdash;love like the love of big carnivores who know their mates and stick
  to them, or love like some man who follows a woman home because he's never
  seen anything like her before. I've done with that sort of love for ever.
  There's men who like to exaggerate every difference in women. They pretend
  women are mysterious and dangerous and wonderful. They like sex served up
  with lies and lingerie.... Where's the love in that! Give me my old brown
  Joan."</p>

  <p>"Not so beastly brown," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"Joan <i>nature</i>."</p>

  <p>"Tut, tut!" said Joan.</p>

  <p>"There's people who scent themselves to make love," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Experienced Petah," said Joan.</p>

  <p>"I've read of it," said Peter, and a little pause fell between
  them....</p>

  <p>"Every one ought to be like us," said Joan sagely, with the spring
  sunshine on her dear face.</p>

  <p>"It takes all sorts to make a world," said Peter.</p>

  <p>"Everybody ought to have a lover," said Joan. "Everybody. There's no clean
  life without it."...</p>

  <p>"We've been through some beastly times, Joan. We've run some beastly
  risks.... We've just scrambled through, Joan, to love&mdash;as I scrambled
  through to life. After being put down and shot at."...</p>

  <p>Presently Joan suspected a drag in Peter's paces and decided at the sight
  of a fallen tree in a little grass lane to profess fatigue. They sat down
  upon the scaly trunk, just opposite to where a gate pierced a budding hedge
  and gave a view of a long, curved ridge of sunlit blue, shooting corn with
  red budding and green-powdered trees beyond, and far away a woldy upland
  rising out of an intervening hidden valley. And Peter admitted that he, too,
  felt a little tired. But each was making a pretence for the sake of the
  other.</p>

  <p>"We've rediscovered a lot of the old things, Joan," said Peter. "The war
  has knocked sense into us. There wasn't anything to work for, there wasn't
  much to be loyal to in the days of the Marconi scandals and the Coronation
  Durbar. Slack times, more despair in them by far than in these red days.
  Rotten, aimless times.... Oh! the world's not done for....</p>

  <p>"I don't grudge my wrist or my leg," said Peter. "I can hop. I've still
  got five and forty years, fifty years, perhaps, to spend. In this new
  world."...</p>

  <p>He said no more for a time. There were schemes in his head, so immature as
  yet that he could not even sketch them out to her.</p>

  <p>He sat with his eyes dreaming, and Joan watched him. There was much of the
  noble beast in this Peter of hers. In the end now, she was convinced, he was
  going to be an altogether noble beast. Through her. He was hers to cherish,
  to help, to see grow.... He was her chosen man.... Depths that were only
  beginning to awaken in Joan were stirred. She would sustain Peter, and also
  presently she would renew Peter. A time would come when this dear spirit
  would be born again within her being, when the blood in her arteries and all
  the grace of her body would be given to a new life&mdash;to new lives, that
  would be beautiful variations of this dearest tune in the music of the
  world.... They would have courage; they would have minds like bright, sharp
  swords. They would lift their chins as Peter did.... It became inconceivable
  to Joan that women could give their bodies to bear the children of unloved
  men. "Dear Petah," her lips said silently. Her heart swelled; her hands
  tightened. She wanted to kiss him....</p>

  <p>Then in a whim of reaction she was moved to mockery.</p>

  <p>"Do you feel so very stern and strong, dear Petah?" she whispered close to
  his shoulder.</p>

  <p>He started, surprised, stared at her for a moment, and smiled into her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Old Joan," he said and kissed her....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 10</h3>

  <p class="first">When he returned to the house on Monday morning after he had
  seen the two young people off, a burthen of desolation came upon Oswald.</p>

  <p>It was a loneliness as acute as a physical pain. It was misery. If they
  had been dead, he could not have been more unhappy. The work that had been
  the warm and living substance of fifteen years was now finished* and done.
  The nest was empty. The road and the stream, the gates and the garden, the
  house and the hall, seemed to ache with emptiness and desertion. He went into
  their old study, from which they had already taken a number of their most
  intimate treasures, and which was now as disordered as a room after a sale.
  Most of their remaining personal possessions were stacked ready for removal;
  discarded magazines and books and torn paper made an untidy heap beside the
  fireplace. "I could not feel a greater pain if I had lost a son," he thought,
  staring at these untidy vestiges.</p>

  <p>He went to his own study and sat down at his desk, though he knew there
  was no power of attention in him sufficient to begin work.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Moxton, for reasons best known to herself, was interested in his
  movements that morning. She saw him presently wander into the garden and then
  return to the hall. He took his cap and stick and touched the bell. "I'll not
  be back to lunch, Mrs. Moxton," he called.</p>

  <p>"Very well, sir," said Mrs. Moxton, unseen upon the landing above, nodding
  her head approvingly.</p>

  <p>At first the world outside was as lonely as his study.</p>

  <p>He went up the valley along the high road for half a mile, and then took a
  winding lane under almost overhanging boughs&mdash;the hawthorn leaves now
  were nearly out and the elder quite&mdash;up over the hill and thence across
  fields and through a wood until he came to where the steep lane runs down to
  Braughing. And by that time, although the spring-time world was still
  immensely lonely and comfortless, he no longer felt that despairful sense of
  fresh and irremediable loss with which he started. He was beginning to
  realize now that he had always been a solitary being; that all men, even in
  crowds, carry a certain solitude with them; and loneliness thus lifted to the
  level of a sustained and general experience ceased to feel like a dagger
  turning in his heart.</p>

  <p>Down the middle of Braughing village, among spaces of grass, runs the
  little Quin, now a race of crystalline water over pebbly shallows and now a
  brown purposefulness flecked with foam, in which reeds bend and recover as if
  they kept their footing by perpetual feats of dexterity. There are two fords,
  and midway between them a little bridge with a handrail on which Oswald
  stayed for a time, watching the lives and adventures of an endless stream of
  bubbles that were begotten thirty feet away where the eddy from the depths
  beneath a willow root dashed against a bough that bobbed and dipped in the
  water. He found a great distraction and relief in following their adventures.
  On they came, large and small, in strings, in spinning groups, busy bubbles,
  quiet bubbles, dignified solitary bubbles, and passed a dangerous headland of
  watercress and ran the gauntlet between two big stones and then, if they
  survived, came with a hopeful rush for the shadow under the bridge and
  vanished utterly....</p>

  <p>For all the rest of the day those streaming bubbles glittered and raced
  and jostled before Oswald's eyes, and made a veil across his personal
  desolation. His mind swung like a pendulum between two ideas; those bubbles
  were like human life; they were not like human life....</p>

  <p>Philosophy is the greatest of anodynes.</p>

  <p>"Why is a man's life different from a bubble? Like a bubble he is born of
  the swirl of matter, like a bubble he reflects the universe, he is driven and
  whirled about by forces he does not comprehend, he shines here and is
  darkened there and is elated or depressed he knows not why, and at last
  passes suddenly out into the darkness...."</p>

  <p>In the evening Oswald sat musing by his study fire, his lamp unlit. He sat
  in an attitude that had long become habitual to him, with the scarred side of
  his face resting upon and 'hidden by his hand. His walk had wearied him, but
  not unpleasantly, his knee was surprisingly free from pain, and he was no
  longer acutely unhappy. The idea, a very engaging idea, had come into his
  head that it was not really the education of Joan and Peter that had come to
  an end, but his own. They were still learners&mdash;how much they had still
  to learn! At Peter's age he had not yet gone to Africa. They had finished
  with school and college perhaps, but they were but beginning in the
  university of life. Neither of them had yet experienced a great
  disillusionment, neither of them had been shamed or bitterly disappointed;
  they had each other. They had seen the great war indeed, and Peter knew now
  what wounds and death were like&mdash;but he himself had been through that at
  one-and-twenty. Neither had had any such dark tragedy as, for example, if one
  of them had been killed, or if one of them had betrayed and injured the
  other. Perhaps they would always have fortunate lives.</p>

  <p>But he himself had had to learn the lesson to the end. His life had been a
  darkened one. He had loved intensely and lost. He had had to abandon his
  chosen life work when it was barely half done. He had a present sense of the
  great needs of the world, and he was bodily weak and mentally uncertain. He
  would spend days now of fretting futility, unable to achieve anything. He
  loved these dear youngsters, but the young cannot give love to the old
  because they do not yet understand. He was alone. And yet, it was strange, he
  kept on. With such strength as he had he pursued his ends. Those two would go
  on, full of hope, helping one another, thinking together, succeeding. The
  lesson he had learnt was that without much love, without much vitality, with
  little hope of seeing a single end achieved for which he worked, he could
  still go on.</p>

  <p>He drifted through his memories, seeking for the motives that had driven
  him on from experience to experience. But while he could remember the
  experiences it was very hard now to recover any inkling of his motives. He
  remembered himself at school as a violent egotist, working hard, openly and
  fairly, for his ascendancy in the school games, working hard secretly for his
  school position. It seemed now as though all that time he had been no more
  than a greed and a vanity.... Was that fair to himself! Or had he forgotten
  the redeeming dreams of youth?...</p>

  <p>The scene shifted to the wardroom of his first battleship, and then to his
  first battle. He saw again the long low line of the Egyptian coast, and the
  batteries of Alexandria and Kamleh spitting fire and the <i>Condor</i>
  standing in. He recalled the tense excitement of that morning, the boats
  rowing to land, but strangely enough the incident that had won him the
  Victoria Cross had been blotted completely from his mind by his injury. He
  could not recover even the facts, much less the feel of that act.... Why had
  he done what he had done? Did he himself really do it?... Then very vividly
  came the memory of his first sight of his smashed, disfigured face. That had
  been horrible at the time&mdash;in a way it was horrible still&mdash;but
  after that it seemed as though for the first time he had ceased then to be an
  egotism, a vanity. After that the memories of impersonal interests began. He
  thought of his attendance at Huxley's lectures at South Kensington and the
  wonder of making his first dissections. About that time he met Dolly, but
  here again was a queer gap; he could not remember anything very distinctly
  about his early meetings with Dolly except that she wore white and that they
  happened in a garden.</p>

  <p>Yet, in a little while, all his being had been hungry for Dolly!</p>

  <p>With his first journey into Africa all his memories became brighter and
  clearer and as if a hotter sun shone upon them. Everything before that time
  was part of the story of a young man long vanished from the world, young
  Oswald, a personality at least as remote as Peter&mdash;very like Peter. But
  with the change of scene to Africa Oswald became himself. The man in the
  story was the man who sat musing in the study chair, moved by the same
  motives and altogether understandable. Already in Nyasaland he was working
  consciously for "civilization" even as he worked today. Everything in that
  period lived still, with all its accompanying feelings alive. He fought again
  in his first fight in Nyasaland, and recalled with complete vividness how he
  had loaded and fired and reloaded and fired time after time at the rushes of
  the Yao spearmen; he had fought leaning against the stockade because he was
  too weary to stand upright, and with his head and every limb aching. One man
  he had hit had wriggled for a long time in the grass, and that memory still
  distressed him. It trailed another memory of horror with it. In his campaign
  about Lake Kioga, years later, in a fight amidst some ant hills he had come
  upon a wounded Sudanese being eaten alive by swarms of ants. The poor devil
  had died with the ants still upon him.... Oswald could still recall the sick
  anguish with which he had tried in vain to save or relieve this man.</p>

  <p>The affair was in the exact quality of his present feelings; the picture
  was painted from the same palette. He remembered that then, as now, he felt
  the same helpless perplexity at apparently needless and unprofitable human
  agony. And then, as now, he had not despaired. He had been able to see no
  reason in this suffering and no excuse for it; he could see none now, and yet
  he did not despair. Why did not that and a hundred other horrors overwhelm
  him with despair? Why had he been able to go on with life after that? And
  after another exquisite humiliation and disappointment? He had loved Dolly
  intensely, and here again came a third but less absolutely obliterated gap in
  his recollections. For years he had been resolutely keeping his mind off the
  sufferings of that time, and now they were indistinct. His memory was
  particularly blank now about Arthur; he was registered merely as a blonde
  sort of. ass with a tenor voice who punched copper. That faint hostile
  caricature was all his mind had tolerated. But still sharp and clear, as
  though it had been photographed but yesterday upon his memory, was the
  afternoon when he had realized that Dolly was dead. That scene was life-size
  and intense; how in a shady place under great trees, he had leant forwards
  upon his little folding table and wept aloud.</p>

  <p>What had carried him through all those things? Why had he desired so
  intensely? Why had he worked so industriously? Why did he possess this
  passion for order that had inspired his administrative work? Why had he given
  his best years to Uganda? Why had he been so concerned for the welfare and
  wisdom of Joan and Peter? Why did he work now to the very breaking-point,
  until sleeplessness and fever forced him to rest, for this dream of a great
  federation in the world&mdash;a world state he would certainly never live to
  see established? If he was indeed only a bubble, then surely he was the most
  obstinately opinionated of bubbles. But he was not merely a bubble. The
  essential self of him was not this thing that spun about in life, that felt
  and reflected the world, that missed so acutely the two dear other bubbles
  that had circled about him so long and that had now left him to eddy in his
  backwater while they hurried off into the midstream of life. His essential
  self, the self that mused now, that had struggled up through the egotisms of
  youth to this present predominance, was something deeper and tougher and more
  real than desire, than excitement, than pleasure or pain. That was the lesson
  he had been learning. There was something deeper in him to which he had been
  getting down more and more as life had gone on, something to which all the
  stuff of experience was incidental, something in which there was endless
  fortitude and an undying resolution to do. There was something in him
  profounder than the stream of accidents....</p>

  <p>He sat now with his distresses allayed, his mind playing with fancies and
  metaphors and analogies. Was this pro-founder contentment beneath his pains
  and discontents the consciousness of the bubble giving way to the underlying
  consciousness of the stream? That was ingenious, but it was not true. Men are
  not bubbles carried blindly on a stream; they are rather like bubbles, but
  that is all. They are wills and parts of a will that is neither the slave of
  the stream of matter nor a thing indifferent to it, that is paradoxically
  free and bound. They are parts of a will, but what this great will was that
  had him in its grasp, that compelled him to work, that saved him from
  drowning in his individual sorrows and cares, he could not say. It was easy
  to draw the analogy that a man is an atom in the life of the species as a
  cell is an atom in the life of a man. But this again was not the complete
  truth. Where was this alleged will of the species? If there was indeed such a
  will in the species, why was there this war? And yet, whatever it might be,
  assuredly there was something greater than himself sustaining his life.... To
  him it felt like a universal thing, but was it indeed a universal thing? It
  was strangely bound up with preferences. Why did he love and choose certain
  things passionately? Why was he indifferent to others?</p>

  <p>Why were Dolly and Joan more beautiful to him than any other women; why
  did he so love the sound of their voices, their movements, and the subtle
  lines of their faces; why did he love Peter, standing upright and when
  enthusiasm lit him; and why did he love the lights on polished steel and the
  darknesses of deep waters, the movements of flames, and of supple, feline
  animals, so intensely? Why did he love these things more than the sheen on
  painted wood, or the graces of blonde women, or the movements of horses? And
  why did he love justice and the revelation of scientific laws, and the
  setting right of disordered things? Why did this idea of a League of Nations
  come to him with the effect of a personal and preferential call? All these
  lights and matters and aspects and personal traits were somehow connected in
  his mind, and had a compelling power over him. They could make him forget his
  safety or comfort or happiness. They had something in common among
  themselves, he felt, and he could not tell what it was they had in common.
  But whatever it was, it was the intimation of the power that sustained him.
  It was as if they were all reflections or resemblances of some overruling
  spirit, some Genius, some great ruler of the values that stood over his
  existence and his world. Yet that again was but a fancy&mdash;a plagiarism
  from Socrates....</p>

  <p>There was a light upon his life, and the truth was that he could not
  discover the source of the light nor define its nature; there was a presence
  in the world about him that made all life worth while, and yet it was
  Nameless and Incomprehensible. It was the Essence beyond Reality; it was the
  Heart of All Things.... Metaphors! Words! Perhaps some men have meant this
  when they talked of Love, but he himself had loved because of this, and so he
  held it must be something greater than Love. Perhaps some men have intended
  it in their use of the word Beauty, but it seemed to him that rather it made
  and determined Beauty for him. And others again have known it as the living
  presence of God, but the name of God was to Oswald a name battered out of all
  value and meaning. And yet it was by this, by this Nameless, this
  Incomprehensible, that he lived and was upheld. It did so uphold him that he
  could go on, he knew, though happiness were denied him; though defeat and
  death stared him in the face....</p><br>

  <h3>§ 11</h3>

  <p class="first">At last he sighed and rose. He lit his reading lamp by means
  of a newspaper rolled up into one long spill&mdash;for there was a famine in
  matches just then&mdash;and sat down to the work on his desk.</p>
