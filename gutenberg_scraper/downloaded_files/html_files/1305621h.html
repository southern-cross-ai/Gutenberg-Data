  <h2><a id="story1"
     name="story1"></a>I. &mdash; THE ORATOR</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Aug 1927</h3>

  <p class="first">THEY called Chief Inspector Oliver Rater &ldquo;The
  Orator&rdquo; for obvious reasons. Less obvious to those who have no sense of
  English humour is the fact that such a name stuck to him, less because of the
  fortuitous circumstance of his initials and surname than because of his
  extraordinary silence. Mr. Rater said very little, but was believed, with
  excellent reason, to think a great deal.</p>

  <p>He was a tall, broad-shouldered man, with a large, expressionless face.
  And when you spoke to him you had the impression all the time that you were
  being disbelieved. You left him with the idea that here was a man who had a
  vocabulary of about ten words. Many a criminal had been marched into the
  Orator&rsquo;s presence with an alibi so complete that it seemed ridiculous
  to detain him, but under the deadening influence of his taciturnity had grown
  desperate and truthful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He has one vice,&rdquo; the Assistant Commissioner used to say:
  &ldquo;he is a very heavy thinker.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator was indulging in this pet weakness of his one afternoon in
  February, as he stood in the corner of a large room, which seemed to be
  entirely filled with wedding presents, and watched a very fashionable
  gathering, most of whom were looking for the silver clock they gave to the
  bride and comparing it unfavourably with the silver clocks that other people
  had given.</p>

  <p>You do not as a rule invite a chief inspector to watch wedding presents,
  but the Orator had volunteered for the job, and was himself a guest, for the
  bride&rsquo;s dead father had been a great personal friend of his, as Angela
  Marken remembered when she was making out a list of invitees.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said her mother sharply, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t ask
  a policeman. Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Angela sighed and leaned back in her chair, biting at the end of her pen
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why we shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, a
  little wearily. &ldquo;He will be one of the few respectable people
  present.&rdquo; She hesitated a little, and then: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I invite
  Donald Grey?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Marken&rsquo;s aristocratic nose wrinkled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly not! Be decent, Angela! Donald&rsquo;s a very nice boy
  and I like him tremendously&mdash;but&mdash;you can&rsquo;t afford to grow
  sentimental over a young man with three hundred pounds a year.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose not,&rdquo; said the girl quietly, and addressed an
  envelope to Chief Inspector Rater. &ldquo;Perhaps he will look after the
  jewellery for us; that would be rather nice&mdash;and save us a couple of
  guineas,&rdquo; said Angela, a little bitterly.</p>

  <p>Why she should be bitter at all, very few of her guests would understand.
  Lord Eustace Lightley was rich, the prospective heir to a dukedom, good
  looking, something of a poet&mdash; in every way a most satisfactory match
  for the daughter of an impecunious field-marshal with a passion for the
  theory of strategy.</p>

  <p>Angela was slim and pretty in a pale way, immensely self-possessed. The
  Orator saw her come in her bridal costume and slightly approved of her. He
  approved of so very few people that this attitude of his might be accounted
  as enthusiasm. Later he saw the bridegroom, and did not approve of him at
  all. A lanky, thin-faced, rather narrow-headed man, with the complexion of a
  girl in spite of his thirty-five years, Lord Eustace Lightley was not the
  type that appealed to the Orator. He mused, in his fantastic way, that if he
  had been commissioned by the Almighty to fashion man, Lord Eustace Lightley
  would not have occurred to him.</p>

  <p>His lordship was irritable to a point of rudeness, and their first and
  last encounter did not leave the Orator any too happy.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you the detective fellow?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>The Orator nodded, which was quite a long speech for him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then what the devil are you standing over there in the corner for?
  You can see nothing, my dear good chap. Why not go up into the
  gallery?&rdquo; He pointed to a little minstrel gallery overlooking the
  room.</p>

  <p>The Orator scratched his nose.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely useless here,&rdquo; his lordship went on,
  with growing wrath. &ldquo;You might as well be in Grosvenor
  Square.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; said the Orator, and
  left his enraged host without another word.</p>

  <p>That was the first and last time he saw Lord Eustace Lightley, but he
  learnt quite a lot about him in the ten minutes he stood on the sidewalk
  before the house, for there came to him a young and respectable man, carrying
  in his hand a small, neatly wrapped brown paper parcel, who consulted with
  the Orator the best method of reaching his lordship. Evidently he knew Mr.
  Rater by sight, which was not remarkable, for the Orator&rsquo;s picture had
  a frequent appearance in the popular press.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it queer, Mr. Rater, what romances there are in real
  life?&mdash;things you wouldn&rsquo;t believe were possible. We&rsquo;ve been
  chemists to his lordship&rsquo;s family for the past hundred years &mdash;he
  gets everything from us, toothpaste, soap, everything. Even when he was in
  Syria, years and years ago&mdash;he had a lung or something, but he&rsquo;s
  cured now&mdash;we used to send him every week....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater listened and was really interested in all that the
  chemist&rsquo;s young man had to tell him.</p>

  <p>A year and a few months later Mr. Rater was spending his annual holiday at
  Ostend. He was a bachelor, and therefore could afford expensive holidays, and
  he chose Ostend because it was pretty certain that he would meet there quite
  a number of staggered men who imagined him to be a hundred or so miles away.
  He did not read the newspapers, and it was a little conversation heard by
  chance at the Hippodrome between races that brought him back to search the
  files of the newspaper.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;We regret to announce the death of Lord Eustace
  Lightley. His lordship has been ill for some months, and died suddenly at his
  residence in Hart Street, Mayfair, last night.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mr. Rater.</p>

  <p>Had he followed his own inclination, he would have sent a wire of
  congratulation to the widow. Instead he was reminded of the conversation he
  had had with the chemist&rsquo;s young man, and wrote it down in his diary
  for future reference; and there the matter went out of his mind, for he was
  occupied during the next three days with interminable conferences with the
  Ostend police. There had been a number of robberies at the big hotels; jewels
  to a great value had been abstracted whilst their owners were at dinner or in
  the Casino; and the Orator woke up to take an active interest in such of his
  fellow-countrymen as were sojourning in Ostend.</p>

  <p>There were five, so far as he could trace; but the man for whom he was
  looking was not there. The robberies were typical Osawold jobs, and he was a
  little disappointed to learn, as he did by telephone, that William was in
  London, and had been in London, practically under police observation, for the
  past month.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; said the voice at the telephone, &ldquo;he was
  nearly pinched on the day you say the robberies were committed... a uniformed
  man saw him coming out of a house in the West End and recognised him. But it
  seems he was called in from the street by a lady whose husband was taken ill.
  The telephone had gone wrong and she was sending him for a doctor.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bad luck!&rdquo; was the Orator&rsquo;s comment.</p>

  <p>The very next day the real thief was caught, an American citizen named
  Lavinsky, and there was the end of that mystery.</p>

  <p>The Orator came back to town, a giant refreshed, so full of good spirits
  that he agreed with a fellow passenger who remarked that it was a fine
  day.</p>

  <p>London offered him very full occupation for his talents. For three months
  he followed remorselessly on the trail of Honoré de Youre, the Bath murderer,
  and he had returned one early morning from a grisly little ceremony at
  Wandsworth Prison (the Orator always saw the hangings for which he was
  responsible) and was walking through Hyde Park when a harsh voice hailed him
  a little derisively.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo, inspector, come and have a spiel!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He turned his head slowly and gazed upon an astonishing sight. In a large
  and beautiful limousine, supplied, he guessed, by a hiring company, was a
  resplendently dressed man. The white derby hat was an offence; the diamond
  ring that glittered on his finger an outrage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Step inside, inspector,&rdquo; said Bill Osawold brightly.</p>

  <p>Evidently he did not expect the invitation to be accepted, for there was a
  momentary look of alarm in his small eyes when the Orator opened the door of
  the carriage gravely and, stepping in, sat opposite to one whom he had on
  three separate occasions sent to penal servitude.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Business looking up, Bill?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>The man coughed and moved uneasily in his cushioned seat, under the
  scrutiny of the detective.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never seen anybody looking so lovely, Bill,&rdquo; murmured the
  Orator.</p>

  <p>And indeed Mr. Osawold&rsquo;s raiment was particularly fine. The
  shepherd&rsquo;s plaid suit, the glossy silk shirt with violet stripes
  (collar to match), the diamond stick-pin, the patent shoes and livid silk
  socks, were very impressive.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going straight now, inspector,&rdquo; said Bill huskily.
  &ldquo;An aunt died and left me a lot of money. You must come round and see
  me in my apartment.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator&rsquo;s eyes were passing over him with the thoroughness of a
  vacuum cleaner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aunt, eh? I&rsquo;ll bet she&rsquo;s looking down from heaven,
  pleased with herself! Australian aunt, Bill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;American,&rdquo; said Bill, and his shapeless features twisted into
  what was intended to be an ingratiating smile. &ldquo;Any time you want a
  drink, inspector, just pop in to 107 Bloomsbury Mansions.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I do all my popping at soda fountains, Bill,&rdquo; said the Orator
  gently.</p>

  <p>The admiration in his face was unaffected.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And to think that the last time we met was when I pinched you
  red-handed on the roof of Albemarle Mansions and got you five for carrying a
  gun!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other wriggled in his embarrassment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all done with now, inspector,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;Since my uncle died&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You told me about her,&rdquo; murmured the Orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Aunt, I mean&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been going straight. I&rsquo;ve kept
  away from low company.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater scrutinised his companion as an accountant might scrutinise a
  faked balance sheet. He found him wanting in several particulars. Not all Mr
  William Osawold&rsquo;s offences had been associated with burglary. There was
  a raw streak in him that was so near to primitive savagery that in certain
  moments it was not distinguishable. The Orator remembered one particularly
  atrocious crime that had been responsible for Bill&rsquo;s absence from his
  usual haunts for four years and three months. This episode he called to the
  mind of the plutocratic Mr. Osawold.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must have been mad to do a thing like that,&rdquo; said the
  other, shaking his head. &ldquo;Anyway, the girl told a lot of lies about me,
  and you didn&rsquo;t do me any good, inspector.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I seldom do,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Rater.</p>

  <p>By this time the car had reached the Marble Arch entrance to the park, and
  Osawold tapped on the window.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be dropping you here, inspector. I&rsquo;ve got an
  engagement with a friend of mine,&rdquo; he said, and was relieved when his
  enemy was out of his sight.</p>

  <p>He certainly had an engagement; a very pretty shopgirl who had misguidedly
  accepted his invitation to a <i>tête-à-tête</i> lunch at his flat was waiting
  for him when he arrived home.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater was neither perturbed nor puzzled by the sudden accession to
  wealth of a well-known and highly disrespected criminal. The phenomenon was
  by no means uncommon. Did not Harry Gay, the confidence man, take a whole
  floor of the Splendide Hotel on the proceeds of a wonder-coup, and
  didn&rsquo;t Clew Remmi celebrate a scientific burglary by driving down
  Oxford Street drinking beer on the roof of the most expensive limousine in
  London?</p>

  <p>At five o&rsquo;clock that afternoon a divisional call came through to
  headquarters and was plugged into Mr. Rater&rsquo;s room. It was all about
  Bill Osawold&mdash;or as much about him as a hysterical, half-crazy shopgirl
  could tell between spasms of hysteria.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said the Orator softly.</p>

  <p>It was, and yet it was not, a coincidence that, coming out of Scotland
  Yard into Whitehall, almost the first person Mr. Rater should see was Bill
  Osawold. It was not a coincidence because the direct route between Bloomsbury
  and Waterloo Station passes along Whitehall and across Westminster Bridge,
  and Bill was on his way to the railway terminus and was making a permanent
  flit, if the trunk and the two bags on the top of his taxi meant anything. He
  flashed past the inspector&mdash;into a traffic block opposite the Houses of
  Parliament.</p>

  <p>Before the phlegmatic constable signalled the traffic to move, the Orator
  was standing by the open door of the cab.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Step out,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and step lively.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bill obeyed; his face was white and puckered with rage. With a gesture the
  Orator had summoned a uniformed policeman.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fan him,&rdquo; he said briefly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a
  gat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The burly policeman &ldquo;fanned&rdquo; the prisoner scientifically. Five
  minutes later Bill was standing before the sergeant&rsquo;s desk at Cannon
  Row station, describing himself flatteringly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trumped up charge,&rdquo; he vociferated. &ldquo;What
  this girl says about me is lies. She came of her own free will; she&rsquo;s
  been chasing me for weeks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No girl has been mentioned&mdash;yet,&rdquo; said the Orator.</p>

  <p>Bill&rsquo;s ugly face contorted in a sneer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You think you&rsquo;ve got me, don&rsquo;t you? But I&rsquo;ll tell
  you something, Rater&mdash;there&rsquo;s money behind me. I could have your
  coat off your back if I wanted to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Put him in a nice hard cell,&rdquo; said the Orator gently.
  &ldquo;If he gives you any trouble, give him a punch on the nose.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bill&rsquo;s belongings lay on the sergeant&rsquo;s desk : they included
  some £1,750 in banknotes, a small automatic pistol fully loaded, several
  diamond rings, and the brilliant stick-pin before mentioned. Mr. Rater
  regarded these thoughtfully, had the numbers of the banknotes taken and sent
  three men making enquiries.</p>

  <p>In the intervening days between the appearance of Bill Osawold before a
  magistrate and his arrival at the Central Criminal Court, the Orator learnt
  many things, but he could not connect William with any act of robbery or
  larceny which could justify a further charge. What he did learn&mdash;and
  this was before the man&rsquo;s appearance at the Old Bailey&mdash;was that
  the prisoner was to be well and truly defended. Not only was he represented
  at the police court by one of the greatest solicitors in London, but when the
  case was called, there rose from the counsel&rsquo;s table an eminent leader
  at the Bar, and with him were two of the best known common law juniors. And
  in consequence this trial, which should have lasted a few hours, dragged
  itself out to three days. There were all manner of witnesses called to tear
  to pieces the character of the chief witness, and it was not a particularly
  difficult job.</p>

  <p>But, fortunately for justice, the prosecuting counsel was a man of great
  genius, and slowly but surely the net was woven about the man in the dock. It
  was on the second day that the Orator saw in the front seat of the public
  gallery a lady whose face seemed familiar. And then with a start he
  recognised Lady Angela Lightley. She was following the case with
  extraordinary intensity, and yet it was not morbid curiosity that had brought
  her. He saw her wince, not once but many times, at the recital of some
  unpleasant detail. The end of the trial came : the jury, without leaving the
  box, returned a verdict of guilty. The thin-faced old judge fixed his
  pince-nez, glanced for a moment at the prisoner and then at the jury.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is anything known against this man?&rdquo; he asked, in his hard,
  dry voice.</p>

  <p>The Orator stepped up into the box, raised his hand as the oath was
  administered, and spoke briefly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;... a thief and an associate of thieves. He was convicted of a
  similar offence in 1921. He has a very bad reputation and is one of the most
  dangerous criminals known to Scotland Yard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Bill Osawold leapt to his feet, livid with fury.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you, Rater... you...!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The judge dipped his pen in the ink and wrote leisurely upon the paper
  before him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will be kept in penal servitude for twelve years,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>It took four warders to remove the demented man from the dock.</p>

  <p>Rater waited outside in the marble waiting hall near the entrance of the
  public galleries, and presently he saw the girl and stepped directly in her
  path. This time she could not avoid him. He saw her face go white and pink,
  and white again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Rater, whatever will you think of me?... I&rsquo;m writing
  a book on crime. It was a horrible case, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her embarrassment was almost pitiable. She was trembling in every limb
  from the shock of this meeting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You saw me before? I didn&rsquo;t think you would recognise
  me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Writing a book, are you, my lady?&rdquo; said the Orator quietly,
  and then remembered to offer his condolences.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; she said hurriedly; &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t a very
  happy marriage, you know. He was rather&mdash;difficult. I am being married
  again in three months&rsquo; time to Mr. Donald Grey. He&rsquo;s at the
  Foreign Office.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked round as though she were seeking some way of escape. He fell in
  by her side and walked down the stairs with her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve never seen that fellow before?&rdquo; he
  asked, and she stopped, her face bloodless.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That man Osawold? No, of course not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pretty bad man,&rdquo; mused the Orator, speaking half to himself.
  &ldquo;Got quite a lot of money, too, when we arrested him. 1 have been
  wondering how he came by it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t help you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was breathless, spoke with difficulty. He might have been hopelessly
  wrong, but he could have sworn that she was on the verge of collapse.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s been paying for his defence. There&rsquo;s been no
  demand for his money, so I suppose he&rsquo;s got influential friends,&rdquo;
  he said. &ldquo;May I come along and see you, Lady Angela?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said at last, and gave him her address. It was an
  exclusive West End hotel.</p>

  <p>She was calmer when they reached the street, and succeeded in getting back
  to something near normal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you are so used to such cases as these that they do not
  distress you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It has reduced me to a rag! One
  didn&rsquo;t realise there was such nastiness in the world. Will he
  appeal?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It seemed to Mr. Rater that it required an extraordinary effort for her to
  ask this question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Appeal? This fellow Osawold? I suppose so. He seems to have all the
  money in the world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you think he will succeed... that there was any question of
  misdirection? Somebody was saying that the judge had made comments which were
  prejudicial to the prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Rater, watching her closely, shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t got a ghost of a chance.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That was all she said, but there was something so desperate, so despairing
  in that word that even he was shocked, and it took quite a great deal to
  shock the Orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish you would tell me something, Lady Angela.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on your mind? I might be able to help you. Your father
  was a great friend of mine, you remember, and I&rsquo;d go a long way to be
  of service to his daughter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She forced a smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you can&rsquo;t help me, unless you can write my
  book!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He saw her beckon her waiting car, and stood on the edge of the sidewalk
  long after she had disappeared.</p>

  <p>Duty took him to Pentonville Prison to interview the man on a matter
  connected with one of the diamond rings which had proved to be stolen
  property. That Osawold was the thief he never for one moment imagined, and
  Osawold&rsquo;s story of how he came to acquire this trinket was
  convincing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I got it from Louis Rapover. I bought it for forty-three pounds. If
  it was pinched, I know nothing about it. You can&rsquo;t get that on me,
  Rater.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Appealing, aren&rsquo;t you, Bill?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m going to get out, don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got friends who have got to get me out, or they&rsquo;ll
  know all about it. Twelve years... that old swine! Say a good word for me
  when I come up, Rater, and I&rsquo;ll drop you a monkey.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never keep monkeys, Bill,&rdquo; said Mr. Rater, who was in no
  sense offended by this offered bribe. &ldquo;Only cocker spaniels, and you
  can&rsquo;t drop me one of those because I breed &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The appeal was heard at the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand. Bill
  Osawold was brought to the Court two hours before it sat. He came in a
  taxicab, accompanied by the usual guard of warders, and was put into a small,
  cell-like room beneath the Courts. At ten o&rsquo;clock his breakfast was
  brought up on a tray from the refreshment-room below.</p>

  <p>A policeman accompanied the girl, but his idea of accompanying was to go
  down the narrow stairs ahead, and he had passed out of sight before the
  waitress had reached the landing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The waitress turned her head. A lady was standing behind her. She was
  dressed in black, the rather elaborate mourning of a Frenchwoman, and a heavy
  black veil drooped over the brim of the hat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you taking Mr. Osawolds breakfast?&rdquo; she asked in broken
  English.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that man with you?&rdquo; The stranger pointed down the stairs,
  and the girl turned her head. There was nobody in sight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which man, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought I saw a policeman,&rdquo; said the woman in black.</p>

  <p>That was all the conversation. The Frenchwoman turned and almost collided
  with Rater, an interested spectator. She brushed past him with a muttered
  apology, keeping her head down, and moved so quickly that it almost seemed as
  though she expected to be followed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater looked after her and then went quickly in pursuit of the
  waitress. He stopped her outside the guarded door of the detention room. He
  took the cup of steaming coffee from her hand, gazed at it meditatively, and
  then, to her amazement and wrath, let the cup drop. It smashed to fragments
  on the stone floor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry&mdash;I&rsquo;m a bit awkward this morning,&rdquo; said the
  Orator. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see about clearing this up, young lady. You dash
  back and get another cup. Tell them Chief Inspector Rater will pay for the
  breakage.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He waited with the custodian of the door till the girl returned. She was
  not allowed to enter the room; one of the warders took the remainder of the
  prisoner&rsquo;s breakfast in to him, and Mr. Rater walked slowly up the
  stairs into the central hall. He was present in court when three judges
  dismissed the appeal, and sent William Osawold to Dartmoor for what was
  tantamount to a life sentence.</p>

  <p>It was four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon when the telephone bell in Lady
  Angela&rsquo;s sitting room tinkled. Grave-faced, she had been sitting
  waiting for that message; at her feet were a dozen editions of the evening
  newspapers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell him to come up,&rdquo; she said, in a voice so low that her
  message had to be repeated.</p>

  <p>For once in his life the Orator was really talkative. He talked about the
  weather, the noise of traffic in the street, the high cost of hotel living,
  and then:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your friend&rsquo;s appeal failed, Lady Angela.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why do you call him my friend?&rdquo; she asked, not meeting his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We could hardly call him that, could we?&rdquo; said the Orator,
  smiling comfortably. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not <i>my</i> friend, at any rate. In
  fact, I suspected him of a number of jewel thefts in Ostend.... Funny thing,
  I called up London, and they told me he had been seen coming out of your
  house the very morning your husband died.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She made no reply.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The trouble with me,&rdquo; the Orator went on, &ldquo;is that
  I&rsquo;m a theorist. I&rsquo;m always making up stories of what happens
  behind closed doors. And I&rsquo;ve been trying to get a story that would fit
  your interest in Bill Osawold, and I think I&rsquo;ve found it. Some things
  &ldquo;&mdash;Mr. Rater shook his head sadly&mdash;&rdquo; one can never get
  definitely. For instance, what was the stuff that mad Frenchwoman put in
  Osawold&rsquo;s coffee this morning? I saw her empty her little bottle when
  the waitress&rsquo;s head was turned. She might not have been French at all;
  she was certainly crazy-mad. That&rsquo;s not the way to stop a man talking.
  If you knew as much about criminals as I do, Lady Angela, you&rsquo;d know
  that their bark doesn&rsquo;t amount to a row of pins. Bill Osawold&rsquo;s
  not going to get anything out of betraying the lady who helped him, and
  he&rsquo;s not going to live any too long, if what the prison doctor told me
  is true. If he ever writes to you, I&rsquo;d like you to send the letters on
  to me; but somehow I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll write.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took up his hat, stared out of the window for a few minutes, and
  then:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be getting along now, Lady Angela. Perhaps one of these
  days you&rsquo;ll write me a letter, and tell me just how that arsenic-eating
  husband of yours got you into such serious trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was on her feet now, white and shaking.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Arsenic eating... did you know that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That was his trouble He&rsquo;d lived some years in Syria, and
  it&rsquo;s one of the queer habits that some Europeans acquire. The day you
  were married I met a young man from the chemist&rsquo;s who had a packet for
  him. Arsenic eaters start with a small dose and work up till they can take
  enough to poison a regiment of soldiers, and I should think he&rsquo;d got to
  that stage.&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The letter she promised did not come till three months
  later.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">... I was horrified when I discovered he had this terrible
  habit I couldn&rsquo;t believe it was possible.... Our life was a very
  unhappy one. He was irritable, meanly cruel. Twice he struck me in one of his
  childish frenzies. I wanted to tell the doctor,&mdash;&mdash;threatened if I
  did that he would deny that he had ever taken arsenic and would tell the
  doctor that I was poisoning him. Then he fell ill with bronchial trouble, and
  I had to procure the arsenic. His own chemist refused to supply him with any
  more. One night I withheld it from him, and there was a terrible scene in his
  room. At last I gave him a dose, and he wanted more. He screamed out at me
  from the bed: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell them you&rsquo;re poisoning me. You want
  my money&mdash;you murderess!&rdquo; It was at that minute I heard something,
  and, looking round, saw a rough-looking man, a stranger, standing in the
  doorway, between my room and my husband&rsquo;s, and at that moment Eustace
  made a horrible sound and fell back on his pillow. You can guess who the
  stranger was. It was Osawold. He had broken into the house and had overheard.
  Can&rsquo;t you guess what happened? He really believed I had killed Eustace.
  If I could have thought rationally I should have called in a doctor and told
  him the truth. It would have been easy to prove that he had been an arsenic
  eater for years, but I was crazy with fear; I gave the man some money, and
  later sent him more. You will never know what I endured all the days of that
  trial. He managed to get word out to me that unless I got him off the charge
  he would betray me, and my madness culminated that horrible day at the Law
  Courts.</p><br>

  <p>The Orator read the letter twice before he put it into the fire.</p>

  <h2><a id="story2"
     name="story2"></a>II. &mdash; THE MIND-READERS</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Oct 1927</h3>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;THERE is no police force in the world that can
  counter the intelligent law-breaker,&rdquo; wrote that remarkable man Len
  Witlon, in an article he once contributed to the American Press,
  &ldquo;providing he lays his plans carefully and skilfully and carries them
  through without deviation.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Len Witlon knew five languages perfectly, and had friends and sometimes
  confederates in at least a dozen European prisons. He himself had certainly
  been under detention, but had never been dishonoured by a conviction.</p>

  <p>You met him at the American bar of Claridge&rsquo;s in Paris, or dining at
  Armonvillier; occasionally he took a cure at Vichy or Baden-Baden&mdash;there
  were certain mud baths in Czechoslovakia that he visited regularly. He was a
  vain and brilliant man, very jealous of his reputation for gallantry.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To be successful in robbery one must be something of a
  psychologist. It is not sufficient to know where material danger is to be
  found: one must be able to read the mind of one&rsquo;s opponent. That is the
  art of generalship: success comes when the operator combines with his powers
  of organisation a loyal and unswerving loyalty to his comrades.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Inspector O. Rater read this interesting article so often that he could
  almost quote it word for word. He had cut out the article soon after its
  publication, had pasted it in an exercise book against the day when Len would
  commence operations in England.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tell that friend of yours,&rdquo; said the Orator, to a familiar of
  the great man, &ldquo;that if he ever puts his nose inside of London he
  won&rsquo;t be giving interviews for fourteen years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>One day Len took up the challenge....</p>

  <p>A policeman came through Burford Square at a leisurely pace, moving
  towards the corner of Canford Street. He had arranged with the constable
  patrolling the next beat to meet him there at eleven and finish the
  interrupted story of a brother-in-law&rsquo;s shortcomings, and the problem
  of the wife and three children who had been left unsupported by the aforesaid
  brother-in-law&rsquo;s hasty departure for Canada.</p>

  <p>He came to the rendezvous at almost the same moment as his mate appeared.
  And the serial was continued :</p>

  <p>&ldquo;...&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I says to my sister, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve
  only got yourself to blame...&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stopped dead.</p>

  <p>The scream came from one of the dark houses of the square, and not very
  far away.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Murder... murder!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two police officers were already running.... On the doorstep of No. 95
  a girl was standing. They saw the white of her nightgown in the dim light of
  a street lamp.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Help... please! Oh, thank God you&rsquo;ve come!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She retreated before them through the open door into the dark hall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I heard him scream... and the struggle... and I tried to get into
  his room...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She had been feeling for the switch, and she found it. A big glass lantern
  suspended from the high ceiling glowed with a golden light.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is it, miss? Which room?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her trembling fingers pointed to the stairway.</p>

  <p>She was very pretty, though as white as chalk, the officer observed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Put a coat on the lady, Harry&rdquo;&mdash;he indicated a little
  alcove where hats and coats were hanging. &ldquo;Now, miss, you&rsquo;ll have
  to show us the room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head; her eyes were wide with horror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, no, no! I can&rsquo;t.... It is the first landing&mdash;the
  room overlooking the square&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The two uniformed men raced up the stairs; as they reached the square
  landing, a light came on, probably controlled from the hall below, for there
  was a push-button switch on the wall of the landing and nobody could have
  touched that. Facing them was a polished mahogany door with an ornamental
  gilt and enamelled door knob.</p>

  <p>P.C. Simpson (he of the wronged sister) turned the handle. The door was
  locked from the inside. He shook the handle vigorously and called out:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Open this door!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A futile invitation, and laughable in any other state of affairs. More
  futile, since when he turned the knob the door opened.</p>

  <p>It was a large room, running the whole width of the house. Light came from
  a crystal chandelier. P.C. Simpson saw a big gilt and mahogany writing-table;
  behind that was a carved marble fireplace, and on the white hearth an
  electric fire glowed redly. Until they passed round the table, they did not
  see the quiet figure that lay, face upwards. It was in evening dress; one
  hand gripped the edge of the marble curb that surrounded the fireplace; the
  other was half raised, as though to ward off a blow.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead&mdash;shot... look!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Simpson&rsquo;s companion pointed to the patch of blood above the
  heart.</p>

  <p>P.C. Simpson stared down at his first murder, all too aware of the
  tremendous importance to him and to his career; he had a confused memory of
  instructions he had received as to what a policeman should do in such
  circumstances.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let nobody come in,&rdquo; he said huskily, and gaped
  round the room. A long window was open&mdash;he stepped out on to a balcony,
  flashing his electric lamp along the rails.</p>

  <p>A rope was knotted to the balcony rail and trailing down&mdash;as he saw
  by the rays of his lamp&mdash;to the front steps. It had not been there when
  they had come in or they must have knocked against it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got away since we came in, Harry. Come down with
  me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They flew down the stairs into the silent square; they did not see the
  girl; she must have gone to her room.</p>

  <p>The front door was closed. P.C. Simpson jerked at it with confidence, but
  this door did not open. He twisted the handle and pulled again, but it was a
  very heavy door, steel-lined, and did not budge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been double-locked on the inside,&rdquo; he said,
  truthfully. &ldquo;That girl must have done it, Harry. Go and see her and get
  the key.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Harry tried the nearest door; that was locked, and the second door was
  locked, but the door leading into the back of the house was open. It took him
  down to a kitchen, and his electric lamp showed him yet another door wide
  open. He guessed it was the garage; the big gates leading to the mews were
  swinging idly in the breeze.</p>

  <p>He went back to his companion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wait here,&rdquo; said P.C. Simpson, flew down the stairs, and
  in a few seconds was in the mews.</p>

  <p>With shaking hand he dragged his police whistle from his pocket, and sent
  out a shrill warning, circumnavigated the house in time to see three
  policemen running, and ahead of them a stolid, tall figure.</p>

  <p>Inspector Rater had business of his own in the neighbourhood that night,
  but had surrendered all other interest at the alarm. Breathlessly the
  police-constable told his story as he half ran, half walked back to the
  mews.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, all right,&rdquo; said the Orator, impatiently.
  &ldquo;One of you fellows stand in front of the door and don&rsquo;t
  move.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He followed Simpson into the house, up to the ground floor. Harry the
  policeman stood rigidly to attention at the foot of the stairs.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the lady? Have you seen her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Harry had not seen her or heard her. He ventured the suggestion that she
  must be &ldquo;in a faint,&rdquo; for he was a family man, and knew the
  effects of such events upon the weak frame of womanhood.</p>

  <p>The Orator was half-way up the stairs, and missed the plausible
  explanation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the room, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Inspector Rater turned the handle and pushed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Locked,&rdquo; he said and, stooping, squinted through the
  keyhole.</p>

  <p>He could see that the door to the balcony was open, and asked a
  question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I left it like that, sir. There was a rope tied to the rails of the
  balcony. The man who done it must have got out that way,
  sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lend your shoulders to the door,&rdquo; said the Orator.</p>

  <p>Two strong men pushed together&mdash;and again. The lock broke with a
  snap, the door flew open...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your body?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>P.C. Simpson stared: where the dead man had lain there was no dead man.
  The room was entirely empty.</p>

  <p>The Orator looked at the policemen, at the floor and then at the window;
  and then his mind instantly moved to the house of the Marquis Perello, which
  was on the opposite side of the square. He thought of the Marquis Perello
  naturally for two reasons: the first was that Len Witlon was in town, and the
  second that in the Marquis&rsquo;s house, in a safe, and not a very safe
  safe, were four packets of cut emeralds that had arrived in London a few days
  before. They were in transit to an illustrious person in Italy who had a
  passion for emeralds, and had been purchased in the Argentine at great cost.
  The Marquis had notified the police, and Mr. O. Rater had thought it
  desirable to station a uniformed constable before and behind the house. He
  knew the names of those constables, and, leaning over the balcony, he
  addressed the small gathering of police officers on the pavement below.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is Walton here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said a voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And Martin?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said another voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; asked the Orator gently, &ldquo;why the hell
  <i>are</i> you here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was very hurt, because he knew just how quickly Len Witlon worked. He
  did not wait for the door to be opened, but slid down the rope on to the
  steps, and five minutes later was knocking at the door of the Marquis
  Perello&rsquo;s house. He knocked for a very long time. The marquis and his
  wife were at the theatre. The three maidservants were locked in a room
  upstairs. The armed valet who kept guard over the safe was found bludgeoned
  in the drawing-room, and the safe was open.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He worked four-handed,&rdquo; said the Orator philosophically.</p>

  <p>Len Witlon invariably worked four-handed, so the Orator had made no great
  discovery. And after a job was done the four would separate and leave England
  by various routes. There is, for example, a steamer that goes from Dundee to
  Holland, and yet another that sails from Plymouth to one of the French
  ports&mdash;Len never made the mistake of following the beaten track. His
  methods were unique: nobody but Len would have taken a furnished house in
  Burford Square and staged an elaborate murder mystery in order to bring all
  the police in the neighbourhood running to that one particular spot and leave
  unguarded the place he wished to burgle.</p>

  <p>A search of the house revealed nothing of value except&mdash;in the
  fireplace of the dining-room were a number of burnt papers, and a little slip
  printed in red which was only half-burnt. It had apparently to do with
  passengers and guides and the difficulties of Customs. He put the little slip
  in his pocket very carefully and sent forth widespread enquiries. The only
  clue he had&mdash;and that came to him the next morning&mdash;was from a
  constable of the City police who, standing at the juncture of Queen Victoria
  Street and Cannon Street, had seen a car in which was a woman. He was not
  even certain it was a woman, but she had that appearance, for her head and
  the upper part of her body were enclosed in a frock. She was, in point of
  fact, at the moment he saw her, engaged in slipping on a dress.</p>

  <p>Cannon Street Station drew blank : no woman had arrived in a car at that
  hour. She had obviously gone east of Cannon Street.</p>

  <p>The Orator was something of a psychologist himself. He knew Witlon&rsquo;s
  methods, and knew that that gallant gentleman would first assure himself that
  his beautiful lady confederate was safe. He interviewed P.C. Simpson, a
  crestfallen and resentful man, from whom his first murder had been ruthlessly
  snatched.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, she talked with a sort of foreign accent.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want you to remember every word she said, Simpson,&rdquo; said
  the Orator gently.</p>

  <p>P.C. Simpson thought very hard, trying to coax, by a vigorous massage of
  his head, the half-forgotten facts of the conversation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember anything she said, sir. The only thing that
  struck me as curious was that while she was a-moaning and a-groaning she had
  her eye on her wrist-watch. I saw her look twice.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The time was about eleven, I think?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The constable thought it was a little later.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;To me,&rdquo; said the Orator, &ldquo;it is as clear as
  daylight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When P.C. Simpson had gone, the Orator took from an envelope the little
  half-burned slip of printed paper that had been found in the grate of the
  dining-room, and reconstructed it...</p>

  <p>Early one morning, somewhere in the Bay of Biscay, a British destroyer
  came up over the horizon behind the slow-moving steamship <i>Emil</i> and
  signalled the captain to stop. The <i>Emil</i> was a small ship that carried
  a large number of pleasure-seeking passengers to the Moroccan ports and
  Madeira. She had left London at midnight on the night of the robbery, and the
  pretty Anglo-Spanish girl who had already become the belle of the ship had
  joined the <i>Emil</i> just before she cast off from one of the London docks.
  Miss Avilez protested vigorously against her arrest, but rather blotted her
  copybook by attempting to throw a small package overboard&mdash;a piece of
  extravagance on her part, since the package contained seventeen perfectly cut
  emeralds, none of which was under ten carats.</p>

  <p>The matron who looked after her on the destroyer brought her to London and
  to Mr. Rater. She replied to all his questions with the <i>hauteur</i> proper
  to a daughter of hidalgos.</p>

  <p>The next morning there appeared in the London Press a communication very
  carefully composed by the Orator himself. He wrote at greater length than he
  spoke.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;Part of the proceeds of the Burford Square
  robbery have been recovered by the arrest of a woman calling herself Inez
  Avilez. It appears that the leader of the gang responsible for this cleverly
  planned robbery, whilst he was careful of his own skin, had not only sent the
  woman on a route where she could be easily traced, but had left
  evidence&mdash;possibly with the idea of using her as a decoy to draw
  attention from himself to her destination.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>On the day following the pretty Anglo-Spaniard&rsquo;s conviction (she was
  a British subject from Gibraltar) a second inspired paragraph
  appeared:</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;This woman was deliberately sacrificed by the man
  who planned the robbery, and goes to prison to bear the punishment for his
  crime.&rdquo;</p><br>

  <p>It was a clumsily written paragraph, and there were several sub-editors
  who would have liked to alter it a little, but the Orator knew his man,
  though he might not have recognised Mr. Len Witlon if he had seen him pacing
  the floor of his expensive suite in Aix, crazily incoherent, planning
  vengeance for the insult that had been put upon him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got Witlon,&rdquo; reported the Orator laconically.</p>

  <p>And yet his superiors knew there was nothing in the world to associate
  Witlon with the robbery. He had his perfectly turned alibis, and witnesses to
  prove his presence in France at the hour the emeralds were stolen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a mind-reader, too,&rdquo; said the Orator, when they
  asked him for an explanation; &ldquo;and just at this moment I&rsquo;m
  reading Witlon&rsquo;s. What he&rsquo;s saying about me at this minute is
  enough to make me turn in my grave. Only I&rsquo;m not dead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Len Witlon had a brilliant associate, one John B. Stimmings, who came
  at the request of his master to Aix, not knowing the condition of Mr. Len
  Witlon&rsquo;s mind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Too bad about Inez,&rdquo; said Mr. Stimmings as he came into the
  ornate sitting-room and closed the door. &ldquo;Clever kid that. I&rsquo;ll
  bet this man Rater framed up something on her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This man Rater couldn&rsquo;t frame a picture,&rdquo; spluttered
  Len, his ordinarily good-looking face swollen and purple with anger.
  &ldquo;Rater! They call him the Orator, don&rsquo;t they! I&rsquo;ll make him
  talk! Look at this!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He slammed down two press cuttings before his visitor. &ldquo;He
  couldn&rsquo;t get anything on me. The Sûreté came after me the next morning,
  and there was I snug in bed in my villa at Auteuil.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Up in Paris,&rdquo; said John B., &ldquo;they talk about asking you
  to leave France&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Leave nothing! They know I wouldn&rsquo;t touch a thing in France.
  I&rsquo;m going to England to see this Rater fellow.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Stimmings looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Count me out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take one ticket&mdash;single.
  You&rsquo;re going dippy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The absurdity of the very suggestion that it was not a brilliant idea
  brought a fleeting smile to the angry man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen! You know me! I know just what that fellow&rsquo;s thinking.
  I&rsquo;ve got right behind the thing he calls his mind. John, do you
  remember when I went after the Infanta&rsquo;s pearls and then went back to
  Madrid four days after? Did anybody know me or recognise me? I&rsquo;m going
  to show you my biggest bit of work.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He might have added his ugliest, for in a tempestuous and sleepless night
  he had designed a crime that had no equal in his brilliant record.</p>

  <p>A week later there arrived in London an elderly English gentleman who gave
  his name at the best London hotel as Colonel Pershin. He had a British
  passport; he was apparently a fussy, rather quick-tempered man, who had no
  special business in life. He stayed at the Wheetham Hotel, which was at once
  the most obscure and the most fashionable in London, and he read the
  newspapers with great industry.</p>

  <p>A few days after his arrival Mr. Rater received a scented letter. It was
  written by a lady who signed herself &ldquo;One who Knows,&rdquo; and it
  ran:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">If you wish to know where the rest of the Perello emeralds
  are to be found, I can tell you. I want you to promise me that I shall not be
  arrested, but knowing that a police officer cannot make any such promises, I
  cannot ask you to put that into writing. I will come to Scotland Yard at 2
  o&rsquo;clock on Saturday evening. Will you be in your room?</p><br>

  <p>The Orator read and re-read the communication. Where women were concerned
  he believed in miracles. And yet he was satisfied in his mind that behind the
  letter was the inspiration of Mr. Witlon. For a long, long time he stood by
  his window looking on to the Embankment, staring at the river, and thinking
  himself into the mind of his enemy.</p>

  <p>There was at the Yard at this time a most unpopular Assistant
  Commissioner, who did not like the Orator, Major Dawlton had had his police
  training in India. He was an incurable theorist, and had a weakness for
  interfering with his executive. He summoned the Orator into his office.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come, come, Mr. Rater,&rdquo; he said, a little pompously.
  &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do at all. Here are emeralds of an enormous value
  stolen under the eyes of the police, after you had been specifically
  instructed to protect their owner! Have you seen this morning&rsquo;s
  newspapers?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t read&rdquo;&mdash;said the Orator wearily, and waited
  long enough for the Assistant Commissioner to get apoplectic before he
  concluded&mdash;&ldquo;newspapers when I have got work on hand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a scandal, Mr. Rater. Really, I am ashamed to meet my friends
  at the club. They are constantly asking me why we don&rsquo;t get detectives
  in from outside. And I think it would be an excellent scheme.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want detectives, you want mind-readers to deal with
  Witlon,&rdquo; said the Orator again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; said Major Dawlton.</p>

  <p>It was a very peaceful Saturday afternoon at Scotland Yard. The day was
  warm and the double windows that shut out the noises of the Thames Embankment
  were wide open. Sunshine bathed the deserted wharves and warehouses that form
  so fine a skyline on the southern bank, and laid on the river a sheet of
  fretted gold.</p>

  <p>The tramway-cars were more or less empty, the promenade given over to
  leisurely sightseeing folk who had brought their children for a stroll.</p>

  <p>Inspector Rater took off his pince-nez with a sigh, folded the minute he
  had been reading and returned it to its envelope. He gazed pensively through
  the open window. A tug drawing a string of barges was moving slowly upstream.
  Timber barges stacked high with planks of yellow pine. On the Embankment a
  few loungers leaned over the parapet.</p>

  <p>He turned his head as the door opened and Major Dawlton came in. Without a
  word he handed the letter to his superior. The Major fixed his eyeglass, read
  and sneered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That, I suppose, is the art of criminal detection,&rdquo; he said,
  with heavy irony&mdash;the Orator was very unpopular at that moment.
  &ldquo;Half the good work at Scotland Yard is done by informers. I should
  like to see this woman when she comes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If she comes,&rdquo; said the Orator softly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You think it is a hoax? I don&rsquo;t agree. It is probably some
  jealous confederate who has been badly treated. These scraps of information
  have come to the Yard every day since I have been here.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They have come every day I&rsquo;ve been here,&rdquo; said the
  Orator, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s seventeen years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Major snorted under this implication of his inexperience.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t come, but he will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Witlon? Rubbish! He&rsquo;s in France. That sort of scoundrel is
  not going to put his nose into this country, and if he did we&rsquo;ve
  sufficient evidence to convict him of simple larceny. I&rsquo;ll be here at
  eight o&rsquo;clock this evening.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make it a quarter to,&rdquo; suggested the Orator, venom in his
  eye.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">Major Dawlton, sitting in the office chair, yawned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s sold you,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told you not to come,&rdquo; said Mr. Rater.</p>

  <p>He stood with his back to the wall, glooming down at the Assistant
  Commissioner thoughtfully. The Major looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give her another quarter of an
  hour&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p><i>&ldquo;Whee-e-smack!&rdquo;</i></p>

  <p>Something whizzed past him; he felt the disturbance of air and, turning
  his startled head, saw the glass of a framed photograph splinter
  disastrously.</p>

  <p>There was no sound of a shot&mdash;no report.</p>

  <p>He was on his feet in an instant and ran to the window.</p>

  <p>Something struck the sill on which his hand rested, ripped a jagged wound
  in the stone and brought down the plaster from the ceiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d keep away from that window,&rdquo; said the Orator
  gently. &ldquo;They tell me he&rsquo;s a wonderful rifle shot, but I thought
  he&rsquo;d operate from the Council building. The barge was certainly a
  brilliant idea.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Major Dawlton&rsquo;s face was white as death.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shooting!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;At me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At me,&rdquo; said the Orator pensively. &ldquo;I hope those
  fellows have located him. I should think they would.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As he spoke he saw two motor-launches filled with men shoot out from the
  cover of the parapet; they were making for the barge.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the Orator. &ldquo;Now
  we&rsquo;ve got something to charge him with.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They were shooting at me!&rdquo; squeaked the Major.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told you not to come,&rdquo; said Mr. Rater, but the joy in his
  eyes belied his tone of sympathy.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;The general idea was a good one,&rdquo; said the
  Orator to the Chief Commissioner. &ldquo;Witlon knew my weakness for fresh
  air, and he must have made a reconnaissance and seen how easy it was to look
  into my room with the window open. Oh, yes, I knew he was in
  England&mdash;one of my men picked him up when he landed at Southampton from
  Havre.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Chief Commissioner&rsquo;s stern gaze was fixed on the Orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t dream he&rsquo;d be shooting into your room,
  or you wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed the Major to come?&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>The Orator did not answer immediately. Then he sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <h2><a id="story3"
     name="story3"></a>III. &mdash; THE OLD LADY WHO CHANGED HER MIND</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Sep 1927</h3>

  <p class="first">MR. RATER never took a job out of the hands of a subordinate
  unless there was a very urgent reason. The subordinate in this case was a
  humble police constable, and his job was to remove Mrs. Schtalmeister from
  the unconscious body of a rent collector. That the oblivion of this
  unfortunate man was entirely due to the stone jug this vigorous old lady had
  wielded was a tragic fact, for in an unguarded moment the disgruntled
  collector had threatened eviction unless the rent was paid. Possibly he was
  not too well acquainted with the tenants of 79 Keller Row and their peculiar
  methods&mdash;he most certainly did not know Mrs. Schtalmeister and her
  reputation, or he would not have turned away even as she was reaching for the
  pitcher</p>

  <p>She was nearer sixty than fifty, a tall and powerful woman with the grip
  of a navvy, and she had behind and about her the moral support of Keller Row
  and a people to whom rent collectors, school inspectors and policemen were
  anathema.</p>

  <p>It was when a sympathiser of the old lady took a hand and a pick handle to
  deal with the interfering officer that Inspector Rater, a chance and
  interested spectator, decided that the moment had arrived when he might
  interfere.</p>

  <p>It was he who hauled Mrs. Schtalmeister from the prostrate collector, his
  hard fist that persuaded the sympathiser to retire from view, and finally he
  who lifted the virago bodily on to the police ambulance and helped strap her;
  and when, half an hour later, Mrs. Schtalmeister was explaining in broken
  Dutch that she had been the victim of an unjustifiable attack, it was he who
  spoke tersely of her past record.</p>

  <p>She was a grim, raw woman, the terror of her neighbourhood; for fifteen
  years she had dominated the Swedes, the Dutchmen and the Scotsmen who for
  some extraordinary reason had congregated in Keller Row, Greenwich. They were
  seafaring people mostly; their men signed on at irregular intervals in the
  ships that go down Thames river from Victoria Docks. In the old days they
  lived in Poplar and Wapping, but once the County Council had driven a tunnel
  between Blackwall and East Greenwich it was inevitable that there should be a
  seepage of waste southward.</p>

  <p>Seven lascar brothers lived in one house; No. 43 held a shifting
  population of Chinese; a veritable German who had been interned during the
  war was established at No. 15; there were Norwegians, an Irish family, and at
  least one Finn in that <i>cul de sac</i> which ends blankly at the wall of a
  shipbreaking yard.</p>

  <p>To Keller Row one must surely return, since it was the scene of one of the
  most remarkable cases that was ever handled by the Orator. For the moment,
  here is Mrs. Schtalmeister fulminating against the law and its
  representatives, but growing more coherent every minute.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For fifteen year&rsquo; I lif in dis street&mdash;no quarrels haf I
  mit anyones. I lif like a lady &mdash;six pound a week I haf by my son....
  Nor bad tempers I haf: once, yes, in &rsquo;85 it is true. My brudder
  an&rsquo; I quarrels, but never since...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then, in perfect innocence, quite unconscious of the amazing breach of
  the law which she revealed, rather proud than otherwise of her deed, she told
  a story which Mr. Rater heard apparently unmoved.</p>

  <p>The offence was an old one, and in reality a technical one. It was not a
  matter in which he cared to move, though, being extremely curious, he did
  confirm the woman&rsquo;s statement a week or two afterwards.</p>

  <p>At the Greenwich Police Court on the following morning the episode of Mrs.
  Schtalmeister ended with a fine and a horrific warning from the magisterial
  bench. She paid the fine and her rent&mdash;she had money enough but was by
  nature miserly&mdash;and went back to Keller Row, where she died in the
  winter of &rsquo;23.</p>

  <p>The Orator did not know of her passing: he was not interested in people
  who were law-abiding. He was at the moment engaged in a jewel robbery in
  Chislehurst and it was rather a complicated case, for, although the thieves
  were caught, their arrest had been delayed just long enough to allow the
  fourteen big diamonds in Lady Teighmount&rsquo;s old-fashioned tiara to
  disappear. The setting was found, but since the setting had only its Early
  Victorian value, the Orator was not elated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you the gospel, Mr. Rater,&rdquo; said
  Harry Selt, the principal brigand. &ldquo;I duffed the sparklers with a Jew
  whose name I don&rsquo;t know: he works for a Big Feller on the Continent.
  All I got was two hundred, and that splits four ways. It&rsquo;s no good me
  tellin&rsquo; you a lie, Mr. Rater; you know how many stand in on a conjure
  like this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No more information than this could be had from Harry, which was
  unfortunate, for Lady Teighmount, in addition to being a very rich woman, was
  a family connection of a Cabinet Minister. This exalted man sent for the
  Orator, and he proved to be very human.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am asking a special favour, Mr. Rater,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My
  aunt is terribly keen on getting those diamonds back. They were given by her
  husband in the &rsquo;seventies or in some prehistoric year, and she attaches
  a sentimental value to them. Happily she&rsquo;s never known that diamond
  giving was the old boy&rsquo;s hobby. Now isn&rsquo;t it possible for you to
  get hold of some underworld gentleman who could lead you to them? She&rsquo;s
  willing to pay two thousand pounds and no questions
  asked&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Which is an illegal inducement,&rdquo; said Mr. O. Rater
  soberly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;I know. The point is, will you, as an act of kindness
  to me, go out of your official way to recover those stones?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator nodded. He felt that he had already said too much.</p>

  <p>No receiver is to be approached directly, especially by a police officer.
  The Orator began his tortuous investigations by interviewing one Alf Barkin,
  a dealer in dogs. It was a long interview and Mr. Barkin said very little.
  Every few seconds he shook his head and said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
  nothing about it, Mr. Rater,&rdquo; or: &ldquo;If I knew I&rsquo;d tell you,
  Mr. Rater,&rdquo; but in the end Alfred arranged to accompany the detective
  that night to a small drinking shop in Deptford, where they met Joseph Greid,
  a dealer in furniture, who knew a man &ldquo;slightly&rdquo; (he hastened to
  qualify the extent of his acquaintanceship) who knew another man who might
  possibly know a friend of somebody else who in his turn could perhaps get
  into touch with a friend of the receivers.</p>

  <p>For twelve days the Orator pursued his patient way. As was his practice,
  he said little, listened much and alertly. For he must trap certain vital
  statements carelessly dropped into the streams of verbiage, must sort
  essentials from non-essentials, unravel cunningly involved sentences.</p>

  <p>In the end he made a journey to Brussels, and there he met by appointment
  M. Heinrich Dissel.</p>

  <p>M. Dissel came to his sitting-room at the hotel, a stiff, youngish man
  with large horn-rimmed spectacles, rather untidy yellow hair and a stiff
  little furry moustache. He clicked his heels and bowed from the waist, before
  he offered a cotton-gloved hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your letter I have had, m&rsquo;sieu. Be pleased to be seated
  before I myself, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He put down the big black portfolio he was carrying, hitched the knees of
  his well-creased trousers, and sat down on the edge of a chair, exposing as
  he did so a length of white sock above his brilliantly yellow boot.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am merchant and agent, yes? But diamonds seldom. Now in Antwerpen
  I know several mans who buy, sell diamonds, sometimes goodly bought,
  sometimes badly bought. Yes, I know them. My brudder in London sent you? He
  is a good brudder but not amity&mdash;how shall you say?&mdash;friendtly. We
  quarrels, make a big row. He gives me plenty money and I love
  it&mdash;piquet, cheval de course, you understand? So we make the big row and
  no more do we be friendts. When I go to London I telephone, but he say
  &lsquo;Not to home,&rsquo; so we are not friendts.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He beamed as though his estrangement with his ill-used brother was the
  greatest joke in the world. The Orator moved uneasily in his chair: such
  undulations of discomfort were a preliminary to speech.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, M&rsquo;sieur Dissel; I&rsquo;m not very
  much interested in your family troubles. You were good enough to answer my
  letter about&mdash;um&mdash;a certain matter. Do I understand that you can
  buy back these diamonds?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>M. Dissel&rsquo;s smile was one of triumph. He dived his hand into the
  inside of his tightly fitting jacket and brought out a fat leather case. This
  he banged on the table and unfolded with a flourish. From a wad of letters
  and cards he fished out a packet wrapped in white tissue paper, which, with a
  deft flick of his finger, he unrolled. The diamonds came into view three by
  three as he came to the cotton-wool lining.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here is!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For these I pay two hond&rsquo;erd
  thirty thousand francs. Of profit I make thirty thousan&rsquo; francs&mdash;I
  will not pretend I make no profit.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator walked to the door of his bedroom and called in the expert he
  had brought from London. One by one the stones were examined. Henry Dissel
  was an amused spectator. In the end Mr. O. Rater counted out twenty
  one-hundred-pound notes and the Belgian folded them carefully and put them in
  his pocket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose, M&rsquo;sieur Dissel, you are not prepared to give me
  the name of the man from whom you made this purchase?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>M. Dissel shrugged and shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He may be good mans or bad mans,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If I speak
  him by name, there should be plenty troubles and questions and reclamations,
  and then he say: &lsquo;You, M&rsquo;sieur Dissel, you give me plenty
  nonsense. Again I will not deal with you,&rsquo; isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where does your brother carry on business in London?&rdquo; asked
  the Orator at parting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Theodor has the bureau in Victoria Street. Nomber nine hondred
  sixty,&rdquo; replied M. Dissel. &ldquo;But we are not good friendts. That is
  sad and against Christian teaching.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator frowned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Theodor? What is his other name?</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Theodor Louis Hazeborn&mdash;mine is Heinrich Frederick
  Dinehem.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator looked at him blankly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Another man would have said much more, but Chief Inspector Rater was
  sparing of speech: therefore was he nicknamed by his sardonic peers.</p>

  <p>M. Dissel was a Belgian subject and had been engaged in business for ten
  years, occupying a small office on the Boulevard Militaire. It was a very
  untidy office, the Orator discovered when he made a visit. Above the desk was
  a most ornate diploma in a golden frame. It testified to an athletic
  accomplishment of M. Heinrich Dissel.</p>

  <p>He was, as he said, an agent, representing a number of unimportant textile
  houses, English and German and American. For these he travelled a great deal.
  He was a member of a club where play was very high, but, although he was a
  gambler, nothing else was known against him. Occasionally he dealt in
  precious stones, antiques and even house property. There had been no
  complaint against him, and he was evidently the sort of man whom
  international thieves might use as an innocent cover for them in their
  negotiations.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Theodor Louis Hazeborn!&rdquo; The name occurred and recurred to
  Mr. Rater all the way back to London.</p>

  <p>The day he arrived he had the dubious satisfaction of restoring the
  missing diamonds to their owner&mdash;and Lady Teighmount was in an irascible
  mood. She grudged (she said) every penny of the reward: she thought that if
  the police could bring about their return for money they could have secured
  the stones without money; she hinted darkly that she did not exclude the
  possibility of the police in general and Chief Inspector Rater having shared
  the reward.</p>

  <p>The Orator listened and yet did not listen. He was thinking of M. Theodor
  Louis Hazeborn Dissel and of M. Heinrich Frederick Dinehem Dissel.</p>

  <p>Going back to his suburban home that night, the Orator suddenly said:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is crazy!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is crazy?&rdquo; asked his startled fellow passenger&mdash;for
  Mr. Rater had made his cryptic pronouncement in a railway carriage.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Everybody,&rdquo; said the Orator with great calmness.</p>

  <p>His companion drew back to a corner seat and located the alarm cord.</p>

  <p>But it <i>was</i> crazy&mdash;this theory which was beginning to shape in
  the Orator&rsquo;s mind. The craziest notion that any man could conceive.</p>

  <p>Patiently he began a fresh enquiry, exploring new avenues that radiated
  from old crimes. For three weeks he sought interviews with jewel thieves who
  were behind bars. A dozen prisons were visited, and at the end of his
  investigations he uncovered a skilfully hidden path that led from London to
  Belgium. Along this path furtive intermediaries had passed, carrying the
  proceeds of a score of robberies big and little. Not always did it lead to
  Brussels; sometimes it branched off to Liege, sometimes it stopped short at
  Ostend, but always at the end of it was a mysterious somebody to be found in
  a cafe or a beer-hall or place less reputable, and always the rendezvous was
  designated in London.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This was how it was done, Mr. Rater&rdquo; (the speaker was a fence
  serving out his sentence in Maidstone Gaol). &ldquo;When the boys got a good
  haul it was as certain as anything one of the big fences would be called up
  on the &lsquo;phone and told where the stuff could be sold. I don&rsquo;t
  know where this bird got his information, but he got it. And then one of our
  runners would take it over the water. The money was always good. I&rsquo;ve
  taken stuff over myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You never saw the foreign fence?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never. You&rsquo;d get to the cafe and then somebody would come in
  and say &lsquo;The boss is outside.&rsquo; He&rsquo;d be waiting round the
  corner in a cab. He&rsquo;d go through the swag like lightning with an
  electric lamp, name the price and pay it on the spot.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator did not ask how the London agent of the fence came to know who
  held the stolen property. He knew the underworld well enough to know that in
  certain sets such matters are common knowledge. He knew too that most
  receivers and the bigger of the thieves had houses of call to which they
  might be telephoned. The crazy idea was no longer crazy.</p>

  <p>Two days after this he had a whole day to himself and he took a
  busman&rsquo;s holiday&mdash;he called on the brother of the volatile
  Heinrich.</p>

  <p>Heinrich&rsquo;s office in Brussels had been one miserable room, untidily
  furnished. The office of the industrious Theodor was a place of polished
  mahogany and shining brass. On the ground-glass panel of the door was a
  neatly painted announcement:</p>

  <p class="sign">THEODOR DISSEL<br>
  engineer</p><br>

  <p>He was a tall, carefully dressed man, clean-shaven, rather exquisite,
  thought the Orator. His hair was brushed carefully back from his high
  forehead, he wore a monocle, his linen (in contrast to his brother&rsquo;s)
  was immaculate. His English was faultless.</p>

  <p>A girl secretary showed Mr. Rater into the private office where Theodor
  sat at a desk so amazingly neat and orderly that it seemed impossible that it
  could have been used. Theodor bowed from his hips, a little
  ceremoniously&mdash;it was the only suggestion of his foreign origin.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have an uncomfortable feeling that you have come to see me about
  my brother,&rdquo; he said with a rueful smile. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t exactly
  a premonition, because I happen to know that you interviewed him a few days
  ago&mdash;in fact he wrote and told me, and although he did not tell me the
  object of your call, I am just a little uneasy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked the Orator bluntly.</p>

  <p>M. Theodor Dissel paced up and down the room, his hands in the pockets of
  his well-creased trousers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well...&rdquo; he hesitated, &ldquo;you will not expect me to say
  anything disparaging of Heinrich&mdash;that would be unnatural. He is a wild
  sort of fellow, absolutely unstable, but I do not think bad at heart. When a
  man is as careless with money as he is, there is always a likelihood that he
  might get himself into serious trouble. Is it some trading
  transaction&mdash;some debt he has contracted which he has not paid? I am
  certain he would do nothing fraudulent&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His manner betrayed a natural anxiety. It was exactly the attitude the
  Orator would have expected in a worried brother.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If it is money...&rdquo; Theodor shrugged his shoulders helplessly.
  &ldquo;I can do little. I have already helped him to the extent of fifteen
  thousand pounds. That money I shall never receive in his lifetime.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no question of fraud&rdquo;&mdash;the Orator spoke
  slowly&mdash;not the &ldquo;kind of fraud you mean. Your brother is a Belgian
  national, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; and, when Theodor nodded: &ldquo;And you are
  British&mdash;naturalised?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Theodor quietly. &ldquo;I am married in England
  since the war. If my brother is married I do not know.&rdquo; He shrugged
  again. &ldquo;He is the kind of man who is likely to contract alliances of a
  less permanent character. I will be frank with you&mdash;he is a great
  trouble to me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator said nothing. He stroked his face, and in his large, pathetic,
  dog-like eyes seemed to be reflected something of the other&rsquo;s care.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Whatever you told me of Heinrich I should, alas! believe. He has
  certain friends who are not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; His gesture expressed the
  limits of disparagement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ever heard of his being engaged in the jewellery
  business?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Theodor frowned.&ldquo;Jewellery business?&rdquo; He spoke slowly.
  &ldquo;I did not know that he was in that trade. And yet, when he was in
  London last, he hinted that he had some dealings with a man in London&mdash;a
  Mr. Devereux. I met Devereux once, a rather unpleasant looking man&mdash;not
  the kind one would imagine was a jeweller. In fact I disliked his appearance
  so much that when he called on me after my brother&rsquo;s return to Belgium
  I sent a message to him that I was busy and could not see him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator thought for a long time.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Devereux is a pretty
  bad man. I know him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He went home to his lodgings and puzzled things out.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Crazy idea!&rdquo; was the sum of his conclusions.</p>

  <p>It was a problem that could be marked, &ldquo;Shelved for
  development.&rdquo; The Orator accordingly laid his mystery in a handy
  place.</p>

  <p>It was a fortnight later that Heinrich Dissel stepped gingerly out of the
  Brussels train at Ostend station. It was a warm and heavy September day and a
  white mist lay upon a glassy sea. He engaged a cabin aft, a &ldquo;cabin of
  luxury,&rdquo; where he deposited his one piece of luggage, a small valise,
  and ordered lunch to be served. He was, apparently, a little lame, for he
  walked painfully with the aid of a stick when he made an appearance upon the
  deck.</p>

  <p>The mist held to Dover, growing thicker as the English coast was
  approached. The boat, guided by the guns and siren of Dover Harbour, came
  slowly towards the harbour&rsquo;s mouth, an hour late.</p>

  <p>It was when she was turning&mdash;for mail boats go into harbour stern
  first&mdash;that a second-class passenger heard a cry for help. Heinrich
  Dissel had been seen hobbling towards the stern of the ship; had also been
  seen (and warned by a quartermaster) sitting perilously on the rail over the
  stern.</p>

  <p>The cry was followed by a splash, and, rushing to the side, a steward saw
  Heinrich&rsquo;s walking stick floating out of sight, but saw nothing of the
  man. A boat was instantly lowered, but though the sailors recovered his hat,
  Heinrich had disappeared from sight.</p>

  <p>That night Mr. Rater read in the stop press of an evening
  newspaper:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">passenger falls overboard from cross-channel steamer</p>

  <p class="newspaper">A passenger, believed to be M. Heinrich Dissel of
  Brussels, fell overboard from the mail boat Princess Josephine as the steamer
  was entering Dover Harbour. The body has not yet been recovered.</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said the Orator, unmoved by the tragedy.</p>

  <p>The body of Heinrich Dissel had not been found when the Orator paid his
  visit of condolence on the stricken brother.</p>

  <p>He discovered M. Theodor examining the contents of the small valise that
  the Dover police had handed to the dead man&rsquo;s relatives.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am bewildered,&rdquo; said Theodor, shaking his head. &ldquo;I
  have just been on the telephone to Brussels, but apparently there is not the
  slightest reason for suicide. His affairs were prospering, everything in his
  office was in order &mdash;so far as the poor fellow&rsquo;s affairs could be
  in order&mdash;and he had over a thousand pounds in his bank. The other day
  he lamed himself playing tennis, and I can only suppose that a sudden lurch
  of the ship brought the weight of his body on to his injured
  ankle...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Insured?&rdquo; asked Mr. Rater.</p>

  <p>Theodor nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I had forgotten that. When I paid his debts I insisted
  that he should insure with an English company. It was perhaps a little
  heartless, but it was necessary that I should have security.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For fifteen thousand?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think that was the sum. But the money is nothing&mdash;I am
  overwhelmed with grief at this terrible tragedy. Poor
  Heinrich&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Insured in the name of Dissel?&rdquo; interrupted the Orator.</p>

  <p>M. Theodor hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. Our family name is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Schtalmeister,&rdquo; said the Orator, nodding. &ldquo;I
  know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Only for a second was Theodor disconcerted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We changed our names by deed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the Orator. &ldquo;You had two uncles,
  didn&rsquo;t you? One was called Theodor Louis Hazeborn and one called
  Heinrich Frederick Dinehem. Your mother named you Heinrich Frederick Dinehem
  a week after you were born. A month later she moved into another district in
  London and had a violent quarrel with your uncle Heinrich. So she went and
  registered your birth all over again as Theodor Louis Hazeborn, the second
  uncle.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Theodor was white but silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You started life with two names and you&rsquo;ve been carrying on
  the good work. With a clever little moustache you were Heinrich in Brussels
  and Theodor in London&mdash;a receiver of stolen property in both places.
  When your mother changed her mind, she gave us a lot of trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are mad,&rdquo; gasped Theodor agitatedly. &ldquo;My
  brudder&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You are your brother&mdash;and that falling overboard was pretty
  easy for you, wasn&rsquo;t it? I saw a diploma in your Brussels
  office&mdash;long distance swimming, eh? You got ashore and had a car
  waiting, I&rsquo;ll bet. You&rsquo;re the bird I&rsquo;ve been waiting
  for&mdash;the bird that was in two places at once. Get your hat.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="story4"
     name="story4"></a>IV. &mdash; THE SUNNINGDALE MURDER</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Dec 1927</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE was a certain Assistant Commissioner of Police at
  Scotland Yard who used to get very annoyed with Inspector Rater. Usually,
  commissioners are angry when their subordinates talk too much; this
  particular official was sore with the Orator because he talked too
  little.</p>

  <p>Colonel Levington, the Assistant Commissioner in question, had a house in
  Sunningdale which gave him, so to speak, an especial interest in the Aliford
  Gray case, and although Commissioners of Police may make all sorts of
  statutory declarations and take all manner of solemn oaths and live
  theoretically in fear of the Official Secrets Act, they are human, like
  everybody else, and Colonel Levington had a wife and family who regarded him
  as an oracle, and gave him credit for the fate that overtook every
  picturesque villain who figured in the popular newspapers. And he had
  neighbours who respected him and would drop in to coffee and for the
  enlargement of their experience. In truth, Colonel Levington knew nothing
  whatever about criminal investigation: he was an administrator who dealt
  largely with estimates and statistics. If he had been called upon to arrest a
  man he would not have known exactly where to start first. This, however, is
  by the way, and it is not denied that the Orator, as he was cynically
  nicknamed, was a very trying man.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Aliford Gray was a pretty widow of thirty-four, slim and dark, rather
  pale, with fine grey eyes, in which ever lurked the shadow of tragedy
  (according to her few intimate friends). Fernley Cottage, where she lived,
  was off the main road, a small bungalow which was the property of Mr.
  Leicester Vanne. Though it was small, it was very beautifully appointed, and
  stood in about two acres of ground. She kept two servants, a middle-aged
  woman and her daughter who lived at Sunninghill, ten minutes&rsquo; walk from
  the cottage. They did not sleep on the premises, and Mrs. Gray had not the
  slightest objection to spending the night alone.</p>

  <p>Her closest friend was this same Mr. Leicester Vanne, a wealthy young man
  who had a flat in Park Lane, and against whom there was not the slightest
  breath of scandal. He had one weakness, and it was through this that
  Inspector Rater had first made his acquaintance....</p>

  <p>The Orator called at the flat one evening, and found a very pensive man
  walking up and down his study, his hands thrust into his pockets; and the
  lady who was the indirect cause of his distress was standing by the window,
  her lips twitching with an amusement she could not conceal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry about this business, inspector,&rdquo;
  said Leicester Vanne, ruefully. &ldquo;But this fellow used the most terrible
  language in the presence of Mrs. Gray, and I&rsquo;m afraid I made a fool of
  myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You nearly made a corpse of him,&rdquo; said the Orator,
  soberly.</p>

  <p>Vanne and Mrs. Gray had been walking late that afternoon from Kensington
  through the park. There were few people about, and they had been followed by
  a man who had at first whined humbly for alms, and, when these were refused,
  had grown abusive, deceived probably by Leicester Vanne&rsquo;s slight frame.
  He was, however, a trained athlete, and when the man&rsquo;s language had
  grown just a little too lurid, he turned on him, picked him up bodily, and
  threw him over the bridge into the Serpentine. With great difficulty, owing
  to the bad light, the tramp had been rescued; with greater difficulty he had
  been brought to life by artificial resuscitation, and had been rushed to the
  hospital. Hence the Orator&rsquo;s visit.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Really, Dicky, you&rsquo;re too terrible.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was laughing softly, and something of that very softness and the look
  in her eyes told the Orator a great deal that was interesting, if not useful
  to him a week later.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is going to happen, inspector?&rdquo; Vanne was anxious,
  irritably nervous. &ldquo;Of course, I oughtn&rsquo;t to have thrown the
  blighter into the water. The comic thing was that he knew me&mdash;in fact he
  called me by name. It was when he said that I was going to get murdered one
  of these days that I lost my&mdash;well, I got rattled. Shall I be charged or
  something?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator was non-committal; he wanted Dick Vanne&rsquo;s version of the
  affair, and he pretty well knew, before the story was half through, that no
  police action would follow. The beggar was well known both to the London and
  to the country police. He had an unsavoury reputation, and a string of
  convictions that stretched from Truro to Aberdeen.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The best thing you can do, Mr. Vanne, is to send somebody down to
  see this bird at the hospital and fix it with him. I&rsquo;m not telling you
  this as a police officer or as a legal adviser&mdash;but a few pounds might
  make a lot of difference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Which was almost an oration for the Orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A bad egg, is he?&rdquo; said Vanne, interested.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Came out of Dartmoor last week.&rdquo; The Orator happened to look
  round a second later. Mrs. Gray, who had been standing by the window, was now
  sitting, her face averted, looking through the window as though she saw
  something which interested her. He had a feeling that the pose was unnatural
  and strained, and wondered whether she was laughing at her friend and did not
  wish him to see her merriment.</p>

  <p>He went back to Scotland Yard and had almost forgotten there were such
  people as Mrs. Aliford Gray and Mr. Dicky Leicester Vanne by the time he
  reached that interesting institution. A few days later, the loquacious
  superintendent gave him a few particulars about this friendship. The
  &ldquo;Super&rdquo; was a constant visitor to the Assistant
  Commissioner&rsquo;s house in Sunningdale.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a great friend of Vanne&rsquo;s. Rather a pretty woman,
  don&rsquo;t you think?... No, there&rsquo;s nothing of that kind in
  it&mdash;just friendship.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I said nothing,&rdquo; said the Orator, curtly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I knew what you were thinking,&rdquo; said the superintendent.
  &ldquo;But they say that man&rsquo;s temper is terrible; and I should say
  he&rsquo;s a bit jealous, too. The people down in Sunningdale can&rsquo;t
  understand why he doesn&rsquo;t marry her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Queer thing about the people in Sunningdale,&rdquo; said the
  Orator, who had no love for the Assistant Commissioner, &ldquo;is the number
  of things they don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was half-past four on the following Sunday morning, and the Orator, who
  had many curious habits, had just got up after nine hours of solid sleep, and
  had made himself a cup of tea, when his telephone bell rang. He glanced at
  the instrument coldly, for he had a number of reports to write, and worked
  best in the cold hours of the dawn. The bell shrilled again; he took up the
  instrument, and immediately recognised the voice of the Assistant
  Commissioner. The Colonel&rsquo;s voice was tremulous with excitement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to get...&rdquo; The word was
  unintelligible, but the Orator guessed he meant the Chief Constable.
  &ldquo;Will you come down right away? I&rsquo;ve asked the Yard to pick you
  up; the photographers and fingerprint people are coming down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; asked Rater, quickly.</p>

  <p>There was a little pause.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;... Mrs. Gray... awfully pretty woman who lives here ...
  murdered!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator opened his mouth wide but did not speak.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Murdered?&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;Have you any
  idea&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;s been murdered.... My God! It&rsquo;s awful! One of
  the prettiest women I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Extraordinarily nice woman...
  perfectly ghastly! Murdered, you understand, Rater?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I understand,&rdquo; said Rater, calmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
  very interesting.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He hung up the receiver, drank his tea, and was waiting on the sidewalk
  when the police car swung round the corner and slowed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stop,&rdquo; snapped the Orator, as he stepped on to
  the running-board and into the seat by the driver&rsquo;s side. &ldquo;Are
  there any details?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>None of the officers in the car had heard particulars; indeed, none knew
  of the identity of the murdered woman.</p>

  <p>The Orator pulled his coat collar about his ears and let himself go to
  sleep. The morning air always had that effect upon him.</p>

  <p>He woke as the car stopped before the little cottage. A light was burning
  in the hall; the door was wide open. On the crazy pavement that led from the
  road to the doorway he saw a policeman, and in the hall itself, Colonel
  Levington talking to a man whom he recognised as an inspector of county
  police.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right, Rater. The Berkshire police have called us
  in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Called me in or you in, sir?&rdquo; asked Rater, unpleasantly; for
  this Assistant Commissioner had nothing whatever to do with the Criminal
  Investigation Department.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You, of course, my good chap,&rdquo; said the other, irritably.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here merely as a&mdash;um&mdash;witness. Not that I
  witnessed anything,&rdquo; he said hastily, &ldquo;but naturally, they came
  and dragged me out of bed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is the body?&rdquo; asked Mr. Rater.</p>

  <p>To his surprise, the Colonel shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no body; it&rsquo;s been taken away. I hope you stepped
  carefully as you came up the pavement; there were blood marks there. This is
  where the crime was committed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pushed open the door of the pretty little drawing-room. The lights were
  full on, and Rater stepped in and took a glance round. There were signs of
  confusion here: a small table had been overturned, a bowl was smashed on the
  floor, there were two overturned chairs. These he saw immediately, and then
  his eyes fell to the cream-coloured carpet and the big bloodstain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;d better tell you what happened,&rdquo; said the
  Chief Commissioner.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator was suddenly bland, and when he was bland he was most
  offensive.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve got to be just a common or garden
  citizen. If I&rsquo;m in charge I&rsquo;m in charge; if I&rsquo;m not
  I&rsquo;m not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Colonel was slightly ruffled, but he was a good soldier.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, my dear chap. I&rsquo;ll wait in the garden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Wait anywhere you like, sir,&rdquo; said the Orator, and turned to
  the Berkshire inspector.</p>

  <p>The story was a very simple one. A police-constable going the rounds at
  half-past three in the morning had noticed that the hall lamp was alight. He
  went up the garden path, pushed the door, and found it was open. It was then
  that he saw a pool of blood on the doorstep. He called out, but there was no
  answer, and knowing that Mrs. Gray lived alone, he waited no longer, but
  walked into the hall, saw the smears of blood on the distempered walls of the
  passage, and passed through the doorway of the drawing-room.</p>

  <p>The lights were burning, and he saw just what the Orator had
  seen&mdash;that and no more: the signs of struggle.</p>

  <p>Rater called in the two men who had accompanied him from Scotland Yard and
  pointed to the polished surface of a brass fender.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a finger-print&mdash;get that. When daylight comes
  I&rsquo;ll have a more thorough search.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There were the ashes of a fire in the grate, and on the hearth a charred
  piece of paper. He picked it up carefully. In a woman&rsquo;s writing he
  read:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Tried to kill me... defended myself...&rdquo; The erratic character
  of the writing might stand for pain or fear, certainly for some abnormal
  condition of mind.</p>

  <p>He put the scrap aside, and, going out, made a tour of the house. It was
  getting light now, and he made as careful an inspection as he had made of the
  inside. He saw the blood on the flagstones, and proof positive that a
  bleeding body had been dragged into the roadway. Here the trail was lost.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Had she a car?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She had a little two-seater. They found the doors of the garage closed,
  and the machine intact.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Colonel Levington could be a silent spectator no
  longer. &ldquo;It is pretty clear, isn&rsquo;t it? She had a quarrel with
  somebody, they killed her and took her away&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are these the women?&rdquo; interrupted the Orator.</p>

  <p>He saw two figures crossing the road. He had sent for the two servants,
  not expecting that they would throw any light upon the matter. Leading the
  elder woman&mdash;the cook&mdash;into the dining-room, he put the
  conventional questions to her. Colonel Levington came uninvited. Evidently
  the woman had been told what had happened, for she was white and shaking.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has anyone been here during the night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only Mr. Vanne, sir.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator scowled at her. It was a trick of his when he was
  surprised.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Leicester Vanne?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What time was he here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He was here when I left, sir. A friend of mine saw his car going up
  the London road about twelve. It&rsquo;s not for me to say anything I
  oughtn&rsquo;t to say, sir,&rdquo; she went on, speaking with hysterical
  rapidity. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to swear anybody&rsquo;s life away, but
  they had a terrible quarrel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Madam and Mr. Vanne, sir. He was shouting at the top of his voice.
  I heard him say &lsquo;I insist upon an explanation,&rsquo; and I heard madam
  begging him not to speak so loud.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And you listened at the door&mdash;yes?&rdquo; said the Orator.</p>

  <p>The woman changed colour.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I did. I won&rsquo;t lie about it. I heard the missus
  say, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t marry you and I won&rsquo;t marry you. I refuse to
  tell you why, Dicky. If you loved me&rsquo;&mdash;or something of the
  sort&mdash;&lsquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t be so unreasonable.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; said the Orator, jotting down in his notebook the
  gist of the conversation the cook had overheard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then I heard him say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d rather kill you than lose
  you.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m perfectly sure he said that. I could go into the
  witness-box and take my Bible oath on it, though he&rsquo;s a nice gentleman
  when he&rsquo;s quiet, and I don&rsquo;t want to get him into
  trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was there any noise when you left?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The woman shook her head.</p>

  <p>They were talking in quite a conversational tone when she said good night
  through the closed door. Her daughter had left an hour before the row
  started.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what do you make of that?&rdquo; asked Colonel Levington,
  eagerly. &ldquo;It seems to me the most obvious thing in the world. This
  fellow must have stayed on, there was another quarrel...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She had been to bed,&rdquo; said the Orator, coldly; &ldquo;and the
  man who committed the murder didn&rsquo;t come in at the front door, he came
  in at the back. If you go round, you&rsquo;ll find the jemmy marks on the
  door and the lock smashed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Colonel was silent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I know Mr. Leicester Vanne; in fact I&rsquo;ve met
  him,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;A man of violent temper. It seems to me
  that that is the direction where your investigations should&mdash;er&mdash;be
  directed.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That thought even occurred to me,&rdquo; said the Orator,
  coldly.</p>

  <p>It was half-past seven when he reached the mansion block in Park Lane
  where Mr. Leicester Vanne had his flat. From judicious enquiries he learned
  that Mr. Vanne parked his car in a lock-up garage near by. At 8 o&rsquo;clock
  he returned, to find the cleaners were busy in the vestibule, and after a
  while he saw the porter, who would give him little information, having only
  come on duty at seven.</p>

  <p>The flat was on the first floor, and it was Vanne who opened the door to
  him. He recognised the Orator instantly, and stiffened.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, inspector.&rdquo; His voice was cold and steady, but
  the detective saw that that calmness of his required an especial effort.
  &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He opened the door wider with a suggestion of reluctance. Rater noticed
  that under his silk dressing-gown he was dressed. His face looked tired; he
  was unshaven; he had the appearance of a man who had spent a sleepless
  night.</p>

  <p>Vanne led the way to the small study, and closed the door behind the
  detective.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what is it, Mr. Rater?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator did not answer; his eyes were fixed on the other&rsquo;s.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the matter of Mrs. Gray, deceased,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He saw the man start.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Deceased? Dead?&rdquo; A look of incredulity was on his face.
  &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>With characteristic briefness, the Orator told the story of the night, and
  as he proceeded he saw the look of anxiety fade from the man&rsquo;s face. At
  the end Vanne was laughing hysterically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How absurd! I thought&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He checked himself.
  &ldquo;Do you think Mrs. Gray is dead?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator did not answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good God! You don&rsquo;t imagine that I&mdash;that is too
  absurd.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t imagine anything,&rdquo; said the Orator. &ldquo;I
  work on facts. There are bloodstains in that parlour at Sunningdale; there
  are bloodstains on the pavement outside the door, and signs of a body being
  dragged to the road.&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;And there are bloodstains in
  your car, Mr. Vanne.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Leicester Vanne was master of himself now. His face was a little paler as
  he realised the gravity of his position.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, you&rsquo;ve seen the car. How stupid of me!&rdquo; he
  said, and drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked the Orator.</p>

  <p>Vanne shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to say. I don&rsquo;t know where Mrs. Gray is; I
  can give you no information whatever.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater pursed his lips thoughtfully and stared past the man out of the
  window.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Blood in your car,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Were you dressed last
  night&mdash;evening dress?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vanne nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see that suit of yours, and particularly the
  shirt.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Leicester Vanne&rsquo;s eyes did not falter under the keen scrutiny of the
  other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I spilt some coffee on the front of my shirt, and I&rsquo;ve burnt
  it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The coat and trousers were old: I also put them
  into the furnace this morning before anybody was up. I tell you this because
  the night porter will probably tell you the same thing&mdash;he saw me going
  down to the basement with the parcel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bloodstains, of course,&rdquo; said the Orator, absently.
  &ldquo;You were with Mrs. Gray last night, there was a quarrel of some kind,
  and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Vanne made a gesture of despair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always quarrelling with somebody,&rdquo; he said,
  dejectedly. &ldquo;My temper is foul! But after this...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is Mrs. Gray?&rdquo; asked the Orator.</p>

  <p>The man turned on him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t know. I haven&rsquo;t seen Mrs. Gray since
  last night. If you think I murdered her, arrest me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was shaking with fury.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Talking about not losing your temper&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the
  Orator, and Vanne laughed hysterically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m a fool. I&rsquo;m very sorry, inspector. I can
  tell you nothing more about Mrs. Gray. What a fool I&rsquo;ve been! What an
  utterly hopeless idiot!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the inspector, as he turned to the door.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be seeing you later, Mr. Vanne.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That morning he made a few quick enquiries, and at each point was
  satisfied.</p>

  <p>At noon that day there was a conference at headquarters, from which
  Colonel Levington was tactfully excluded. At one o&rsquo;clock came a wire
  from a doctor in Devonshire which put the Orator on to a new trail, and
  simultaneously the report from a certain cottage hospital near Horsham that
  supplied the last clue. That afternoon he called again on Vanne. The young
  man was dressed, and was evidently expecting him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to give you any trouble. I&rsquo;ll just get my
  hat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not arresting you, if that&rsquo;s what you mean.
  I&rsquo;m only asking for information,&rdquo; said the Orator. &ldquo;Exactly
  where did you leave the body?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was facing Vanne squarely. There was no fencing with the question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Exactly where did you leave the body?&rdquo; asked the Orator
  again.</p>

  <p>Vanne&rsquo;s face was as white as death. &ldquo;Five miles on the other
  side of Horsham&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t leave it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It left you,&rdquo; said Rater grimly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in
  Langwell Cottage Hospital, with a superficial wound in the right arm...
  curious how those wounds bleed.&rdquo;Vanne stared at him open-mouthed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alive?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>

  <p>The Orator nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suffers from fits&mdash;I found that in the records of Scotland
  Yard, and confirmed it with the prison doctor. I thought it might be
  something like that. These people don&rsquo;t die so easily. But they look
  deader than any live people ought to look.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took a telegram from his pocket and opened it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Henry Walter Wassingheim is the gentleman&rsquo;s name: he was
  convicted in the name of &lsquo;Smith,&rsquo; which is unoriginal. I&rsquo;m
  going down to Horsham to see that body,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I expect
  it&rsquo;s all sober and lively by now. If Mrs. Gray had told me all about
  Henry Walter I could have given her all the evidence she wanted for her
  divorce. I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen to you, Mr. Vanne,
  but I&rsquo;d like you to do me a favour. Do you mind seeing Colonel
  Levington and telling him all about it? He&rsquo;s naturally long-winded.
  I&rsquo;m naturally ungifted for telling stories.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I first met Mrs. Gray,&rdquo; said Vanne, not to Colonel Levington
  but to the Commissioner mostly concerned, &ldquo;about five years ago. We met
  at the house of a mutual friend, and I don&rsquo;t disguise the fact that I
  fell immediately in love with her. In spite of my bad temper, she was an
  angel to me in all respects but one. She would never marry me. I thought she
  was a widow, and could see no reason why we should not be married. I did not
  know&mdash;nobody knew&mdash;that her husband was serving a sentence of ten
  years for a crime so hideous that she would not risk the publicity which a
  divorce would bring to her. They had been married secretly; nobody knew of
  the horrible life she had led with him. She was on the point of telling me,
  because she had heard he was about to be released, when unexpectedly on
  Saturday night he turned up at the house. He was drunk, more like a beast
  than a man. Somehow he had got to hear of her friendship with me, and put a
  wrong construction upon it, partly because he is incapable of understanding
  any friendship that is clean and wholesome. He tried to strangle her, and in
  defence she struck at him with a stiletto paper-knife that I had given to
  her, and he dropped, bleeding profusely. I know now that he was in a fit. She
  thought she had killed him, and hastily wrote a letter to me, intending to
  commit suicide. Writing, she grew a little calmer, and, burning the letter,
  called me up on the &rsquo;phone and told me what had happened. I drove to
  Sunningdale, and, first bringing her back to the flat, I returned to the
  cottage. My intention was to take the body to the seaside and leave it on the
  shore. Of course I made all sorts of blunders; leaving the hall lights
  burning and the door open was a terrible mistake if I intended covering up my
  tracks. I got into the car, and drove through Horsham, but on the other side,
  at the top of the hill, I developed engine trouble and stopped my car for a
  quarter of an hour. It must have been then that he recovered consciousness
  and crawled out of the tonneau. I did not miss him for ten minutes, and then,
  coming back, looked everywhere for him without success. Mrs. Gray was, of
  course, at my flat. She is now in Bournemouth. I was in terror when the
  inspector called, for fear he should make a search. It was for that reason,
  to give her time, that I told him I had burnt my clothes, which wasn&rsquo;t
  true. How did you know, inspector?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater made a gesture of self-disparagement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The thumb-print on the fender was easy to identify at Scotland
  Yard. After that, the case worked itself out. Besides, this husband fellow
  had a statement in his pocket that he intended killing his unfaithful
  wife&mdash;I had a copy of that....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stopped, and shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m talking too much,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <h2><a id="story5"
     name="story5"></a>V. &mdash; A BANK AND A SECRETARY</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Nov 1927</h3>

  <p class="first">THE ORATOR knew the London &amp; Southern Bank, because what
  little money he possessed was in its safe keeping. He knew Mr. Baide, the
  general manager of the Piccadilly Branch, by sight, because Inspector Rater
  once occupied a very cheap apartment in St. James&rsquo;s Street, the owner
  of the flat making a special concession in the matter of rent, being under
  the impression that the presence of a detective officer of such high standing
  upon the premises would act as a scarecrow to possible burglars.</p>

  <p>And, sitting at his window smoking his morning pipe, the Orator often saw
  Mr. Baide walking slowly up St. James&rsquo;s Street towards Piccadilly, his
  tall hat on the back of his head, his overcoat open summer and winter, his
  hands clasping behind him a furled umbrella, and on his placid face that
  peculiar expression of blankness which so often distinguishes the profound
  thinker.</p>

  <p>As for Sir Isaac Mannheim, the President of the London &amp; Southern, who
  did not know him? His great-grandfather had been born in Germany and had
  emigrated to England as a youth. But the Mannheims had remained German in
  name, whatever British characteristics they might have acquired, and most
  curtly did Sir Isaac refuse either to change his name on the outbreak or at
  the conclusion of war.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was good enough for my father and it is good enough for
  me,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He served through the war with distinction, gained the D.S.O. and lost his
  left arm, and came back to a world so bitterly anti-German that he might have
  been excused if he had yielded to the entreaties of his fellow directors. He
  listened in silence, grinned unpleasantly, and then:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Give me back my left arm and I&rsquo;ll think about changing my
  name,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He was an autocrat of autocrats; the directors of the bank were the merest
  ciphers&mdash;were in reality his nominees. Yet such was his genius that he
  raised the London &amp; Southern to the highest position in the City of
  London, and, rejecting all offers of absorption, came out in the end the only
  formidable rival to the Big Six.</p>

  <p>He was a good sportsman, a very gallant fellow, a rider to hounds and the
  adored head of his family. Here appears and disappears Sir Isaac Mannheim
  from the story of the big cheque fraud.</p>

  <p>The Orator had met him once and had been impressed. Later he was to be
  extremely annoyed with this Jewish gentleman, for reasons which will be
  apparent.</p>

  <p>It was a curious coincidence that at the time Inspector Rater was called
  in by the London &amp; Southern Bank he was engaged in investigating the
  affairs of Mr. Joseph Purdew, some time of Dartmoor Prison, ex-convict,
  ex-confidence man, ex-fraudulent promoter. Mr Rater was interested to
  discover how many of those &ldquo;ex&rsquo;s&rdquo; were honorary titles, and
  seemingly they all came into this category, for Joe Purdew was indubitably
  well established, with an office in a fashionable West End thoroughfare, as a
  bookmaker and commission agent, and the one glance Inspector Rater threw
  round the office convinced him that, whatever the graft might be, it was
  lucrative.</p>

  <p>When he was ushered into the holy of holies, where Joe Purdew sat at an
  empire desk chewing a gold toothpick, it occurred to the visitor for one
  fleeting moment that Joe was not too happy to see him. The synthetic
  heartiness of the greeting would not have deceived a child.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, fancy meeting you, Mr. Rater! Come in, come in. Have a glass
  of wine with me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Joe was stout and purple, and fussed round the room like an old hen,
  carefully closing the polished mahogany door which separated him from secular
  companionship.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny thing, I meant to write to you the other
  day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the swindle?&rdquo; asked Rater, shaking his head at
  the invitation to wine.</p>

  <p>Joe beamed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No swindle, Mr. Rater&mdash;I&rsquo;m running a straight business.
  I&rsquo;ve got four hundred of the best people in London on my
  books&mdash;profits nearly a thousand a week. Mugs, I agree, but mug-catching
  isn&rsquo;t a crime, thank Gawd!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He traded in the name of &ldquo;Bull &amp; England,&rdquo; which had a
  patriotic flavour to it.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s straight and above-board, Mr. Rater. I&rsquo;ve
  finished with the old game,&rdquo; said Joe virtuously. &ldquo;What I like is
  to be able to sit down in my house in Bayswater without the fear of a busy
  coming in and tapping me on the shoulder and asking me to step round and see
  the sergeant. Remember that time you pinched me at Southampton? But, Lord, I
  bear no malice....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater had no special reason for calling. He had heard of Joe&rsquo;s
  newest occupation, and had dropped in to satisfy his curiosity.</p>

  <p>As he pulled the door of the outer office open he nearly collided with a
  lady who was standing on the mat. She was tall and imposing; her hair was a
  deep auburn, and whatever defects there might have been to her complexion had
  been artificially rectified. She had good features, rather fine,
  lightish-grey eyes, and as she was expensively dressed he supposed that she
  was one of those four hundred best people in London of whom Joe had
  boasted.</p>

  <p>The second impression, which arrived immediately on top of the other, was
  that he had met her before. Memory plays tricks; in some obscure fashion she
  was associated in his mind with a broken pane of glass.</p>

  <p>He stepped aside to allow her to enter the office, and she passed him
  majestically.</p>

  <p>He had returned to Scotland Yard when the first report of the London &amp;
  Southern Bank fraud was brought to him. The minute covered two pages of
  foolscap and contained surprisingly little information. The plain fact was
  that a cheque drawn for £35,000 had been presented and honoured, and that the
  signature was afterwards discovered to be a forgery.</p>

  <p>Mr. Baide came into the outer office to meet the visitor. He was tall and
  stout and worried-looking, his grey hair untidy, his weary eyes eloquent of a
  sleepless night.</p>

  <p>The Piccadilly branch of the London &amp; Southern Bank had been recently
  rebuilt. The bank premises were the last word in luxurious dignity, and
  Inspector Rater, whose architectural tastes ran in the direction of domed
  roofs and serpentine marble, had a sense of contentment.</p>

  <p>Mr. Baide led him to his private office, carefully closed the door and
  pulled up a chair to the desk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is a most terrible business,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have never
  before had such a thing happen &mdash;never! For thirty-five years I have
  been a servant of the bank, and never once has a forgery come my
  way.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re lucky,&rdquo; said the Orator.</p>

  <p>He was not interested in the manager&rsquo;s biography. He wanted to hear
  only of a certain cheque for £35,000 which had been presented by somebody who
  had never been seen, honoured by an unknown cashier, the transaction entered
  up by a mysterious clerk....</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The first intimation I had that anything was wrong was when Mr.
  Gillan&rsquo;s secretary came to me with the pass-book and told me that there
  was no record of a sum of £35,000 being withdrawn. The record we
  have&mdash;and it is entered in a strange hand&mdash;is this.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He opened a large loose-leaf ledger and pointed to a line:</p>

  <p class="cp"><i>Bearer cheque</i> £35,000.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The cheque we found&mdash;it had by mistake been filed under
  another name, &lsquo;Gilby.&rsquo; It is unmistakably a forgery. Here it
  is.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He handed a slip of paper to the detective, who looked at it, smelt it,
  held it up to the light, and finally laid it on the table before him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is this from one of Mr. Gillan&rsquo;s cheque-books?&rdquo; he
  asked. &ldquo;You keep a record of the cheque-books which you issue?&rdquo;
  The manager nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes; it was the last cheque but one in a book which was issued to
  Mr. Gillan a month ago. We are in the habit of sending him ten books, each
  containing a hundred blank cheques, every six months. Mr. Gillan is a very
  rich stockbroker, who lives in Grosvenor Square, and this is not only his
  private, but to some extent his business, account.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator examined the cheque again. It had been privately printed, and
  the words &ldquo;Thomas L. Gillan Account&rdquo; were inserted in small
  letters above the name of the bank. It was, he observed, counter-signed in
  the bottom left-hand corner with the initials &ldquo;C.E.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is &lsquo;C.E.&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Baide smiled wanly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is a code which means
  thirty-five thousand. When Mr Gillan signs a cheque for a thousand pounds or
  upwards he indicates the fact by these initials. The &lsquo;C&rsquo; stands
  for &lsquo;3,&rsquo; the &lsquo;E&rsquo; for &lsquo;5.&rsquo; If it were for
  one thousand pounds it would be &lsquo;A.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who knows about this code?&rdquo; asked the Orator. &ldquo;You, of
  course. But who else?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The manager half shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was a matter entirely between Mr. Gillan and myself. All big
  cheques have to come to me for verification, and&mdash;that is the curious
  thing&mdash;this cheque was not brought to me. My secretary was only
  remarking this morning that I must have detected the
  fraud&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is your secretary?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You had better see her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Baide pressed a bell; a few seconds later the glass door opened and
  into the Orator&rsquo;s life came Miss Helen Lyne.</p>

  <p>She was little above medium height, but her slimness gave the impression
  that she was taller than she was. She was rather pretty in an enigmatic way;
  her hair was dark and brushed back from her forehead; the horn-rimmed glasses
  she wore were probably an improvement to her appearance. He guessed her to be
  somewhere in the region of twenty-four. She looked and he learnt afterwards
  that she was very capable; she was at any rate immensely self-possessed. She
  met the detective&rsquo;s eyes without flinching.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is Miss Lyne,&rdquo; said the manager.</p>

  <p>Rater nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know about the code?&rdquo; he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>For a second her straight eyebrows met in a frown of bewilderment. Then
  her face cleared.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean the code on Mr. Gillan&rsquo;s
  cheques&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Baide&rsquo;s mouth opened in astonishment.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I never told you!&rdquo; he blurted.</p>

  <p>Her red lips curved in a smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, but it was very obvious. I&rsquo;ve seen so many of Mr.
  Gillan&rsquo;s cheques and I&rsquo;ve noticed that the counter-signature
  varies, so I guessed it was a code.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The cheque was not brought into this office while Mr. Baide was
  out?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve never seen it before.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He asked her one or two questions, and all the time her eyes were fixed on
  his. There was the ghost of amusement in them once, he thought, and was
  piqued. Eventually he dismissed her, waited till the door was closed, then
  walked slowly towards it and opened it quickly. She was nowhere in sight.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where did you find this girl?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Baide fetched a long sigh.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She is very capable, but I can&rsquo;t get on with her,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;She was sent to me from head office about six months ago.
  I&rsquo;ve no complaints against her: she is most industrious and often
  she&rsquo;ll work here for an hour after I&rsquo;ve left, checking up
  correspondence.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where do you keep your keys?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Baide led him to a wall safe.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, and showed, hanging on steel pegs, about
  twenty keys great and small.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are those?&rdquo; asked the Orator, and the manager
  explained.</p>

  <p>The majority were pass-keys. That one was the main office safe, and that
  the strong-room, another was a pass-key to all the upstairs offices.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Lyne ever go to this safe?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The other hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think she&rsquo;s been once or twice, but I trust her,
  naturally; she was sent to me from head office by Sir Isaac himself. Sir
  Isaac never makes a mistake.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sir Isaac Mannheim? Where is he now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again the manager sighed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s on his yacht, cruising in the Mediterranean. We&rsquo;ve
  been trying to get in touch with him, but we haven&rsquo;t succeeded so
  far.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Later the Orator interviewed the assistant manager, the chief accountant
  and the head cashier. Until late in the afternoon he was in possession of Mr.
  Baide&rsquo;s office, questioning and cross-questioning clerks and tellers,
  and in the end was as wise as he had been when he had read the first minuted
  report.</p>

  <p>Before he left he sent for Baide, who had taken up his quarters in the
  assistant manager&rsquo;s office.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Obviously this job has been done from inside the office, by
  somebody who has access to the books and therefore to your safe,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Baide waited expectantly; if he imagined that the Orator would give
  him an account of his conclusions he was disappointed. Mr. Rater went back to
  headquarters and, interviewing his chief, discussed very briefly what he had
  learnt.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gillan, was it?&rdquo; The Chief Constable scratched his nose
  thoughtfully. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny! Gillan was supposed to have been
  killed the day after that cheque was presented&mdash;there was an aeroplane
  smash in Kent, and you remember his name was among the casualties. Apparently
  it was another man with very nearly the same name.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator stared at him thoughtfully but said nothing.</p>

  <p>The next morning he arrived at the bank, to learn that Mr. Baide had not
  put in an appearance: he was suffering from a nervous breakdown and was
  apparently in a bad way.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell me what I wish to know,&rdquo; said the Orator to
  the assistant manager. &ldquo;I want a list of all your customers that have
  died in the last twelve months and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He heard an exclamation behind him and turned quickly. Miss Lyne had come
  noiselessly into the room and she was staring at him in wonder. And then she
  said a thing for which the Orator never completely forgave her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How very clever of you!&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>He was still gasping at this piece of impertinence on the girl&rsquo;s
  part when a clerk came into the room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you see Mrs. Luben-Kellner?&rdquo; he asked of the assistant
  manager.</p>

  <p>The name was familiar to the Orator, and then he remembered: Mrs.
  Luben-Kellner was a racehorse owner and something of a figure in the sporting
  world, not by reason of her horses&rsquo; victories, which were few and far
  between, but by reason of their mediocrity. She had the reputation of having
  the worst stable of horses in England, and they had apparently been acquired
  at some expense. Perhaps their bad qualities were due to the fact that she
  herself trained them. She was the only woman trainer in England, and was
  rather jealous of that reputation.</p>

  <p>The assistant manager looked a little dubiously at the Orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better see this lady.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you want the room?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The assistant manager hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. It won&rsquo;t be very private, if you don&rsquo;t mind her
  being shown in here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater shook his head. He never objected to meeting people.</p>

  <p>When the door opened, there came into the room, bringing with her the
  fragrance of an exotic perfume, the lady he had seen on the door-mat of Joe
  Purdew&rsquo;s office. The recognition was mutual; she shot one quick glance
  at the detective, and when she spoke her voice was a little husky.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to trouble you, mister, but&mdash;where&rsquo;s Mr.
  Baide?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not very well to-day, madam,&rdquo; said the assistant
  manager, &ldquo;but I can fix anything you want.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again she looked at the detective, and was obviously at a loss as to how
  she should proceed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather discuss this matter without strangers being
  present,&rdquo; she said. Her voice was shrill, common; whatever veneer of
  refinement there was was scratched away in her agitation.</p>

  <p>There was nothing for the Orator to do but to leave the room. He was
  puzzled. Again he had that flashing recollection of a pane of broken
  glass.</p>

  <p>The assistant manager came out after a while, went into Baide&rsquo;s
  office and returned again to his visitor. Inspector Rater waited till the
  woman was gone, then the assistant manager came out of his room and beckoned
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo; asked Mr. Rater.</p>

  <p>The official shrugged. He didn&rsquo;t know very much, except that she was
  a lady with a large income. More than this he would not tell. Banks are not
  frank about their customers&mdash;especially to detective officers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As a matter of fact, she didn&rsquo;t come on business. She said
  she left a note-book in Mr. Baide&rsquo;s office&mdash;she came to see him
  yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>While he had been waiting for the lady to go, the Orator had located the
  office of the secretary. He had a few inquiries to make of her, but the
  result of his questioning had not, so far, been at all satisfactory. On his
  way out he stopped at the door of her office, turned the handle and stepped
  in. She was sitting at a typewriter desk, and so quietly had he entered that
  she did not realise he was there until he spoke, and then she closed a little
  note-book she was reading, so hurriedly that he guessed he had interrupted an
  important study.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why clever?&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>She swung round in her swivel chair so that she faced and looked up to
  him, and again he saw that mocking smile and the twitching at the corners of
  the red lips.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought it was awfully clever of you! You&rsquo;re Mr. Rater,
  aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Somebody told me that you never spoke, but you&rsquo;ve made quite
  a lot of speeches since you&rsquo;ve been here, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>For some reason Mr. Rater found himself going red. He was more furious
  with himself than with the girl,</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Young lady,&rdquo; he said, gently, &ldquo;two people ever tried to
  pull my leg, and only one of them escaped the gallows!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her amusement was undisguised now. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m
  in for a nasty sticky time!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Mr.
  Rater. I was only joking. But I do think it was clever of you to remember
  that when a person dies there is less likely to be a fuss about his forged
  cheque than if he&rsquo;s alive to repudiate it. And almost everybody thought
  Mr. Gillan was dead, didn&rsquo;t they? And here he is, alive and well and
  raising hell, if you&rsquo;ll forgive the unladylike expression.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator regarded her soberly. &ldquo;How clever of you!&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;You know so much that I&rsquo;m in three minds to take you along to
  Cannon Row or maybe to Scotland Yard, and have a real tea-table talk with
  you.&rdquo; She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d be wasting your time, O Orator! But I can quite
  understand your point of view. I&rsquo;ll show you something.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She opened the bottom drawer of her little desk and took out a small new
  diary. It was the sort of thing that could be purchased for a shilling. She
  turned the leaves rapidly, and held up an open page to him. It was covered
  with neat figures, and the Orator noticed that the last was £35,000.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That is what Mrs. Kellner came for, and I said I hadn&rsquo;t seen
  it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator took the book from her and slipped it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Interesting,&rdquo; said Mr. Rater. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;d like to
  hand you a few startling facts, young lady. Do you know Joe
  Purdew?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To his surprise she nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Snide bookmaker, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very snide,&rdquo; she answered, soberly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mean fellow, too? There&rsquo;s a girl goes there and sees him
  every evening. Her hair isn&rsquo;t straight like yours, and she
  doesn&rsquo;t wear horn-rimmed spectacles.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She may do when she is inside,&rdquo; said the girl, quietly.
  &ldquo;She really is short-sighted.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But she doesn&rsquo;t wear her hair like you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Miss Lyne shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And she doesn&rsquo;t call herself Miss Lyne. Miss Larner, as far
  as I can remember.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The smile came back to her face slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You <i>are</i> clever!&rdquo; she said, with obvious
  admiration.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing clever about spotting you. Now, young lady, perhaps
  you&rsquo;ll tell me all about the why and wherefore of your evening calls on
  my crooked friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The smile left her face. She thought for a moment, and then:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Accountancy. I&rsquo;m the young lady who does the books. He gets
  me cheaply, and he&rsquo;s given up his desire to make love to me&mdash;that
  was a nuisance at first.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who put you in this office?&rdquo; interrupted the Orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This bank office?&mdash;Sir Isaac,&rdquo; she replied. The Orator
  scratched his chin. The answer seemed sufficient.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Kellner is a customer of Joe&rsquo;s?&rdquo; She nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The best customer he has,&rdquo; she said drily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t understand her, and can&rsquo;t understand
  myself,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Whenever I see that woman I think of a bit of
  broken glass&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A picture-frame?&rdquo; she suggested, and the Orator jumped. He
  reached out his hand and gripped hers warmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where does she live?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;At Pentley, in Berkshire, if you want to find her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Married?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s almost straight,&rdquo; she said, seriously.
  &ldquo;Only she&rsquo;s got this peculiar vanity about horses&mdash;she
  thinks she understands them. I have an idea she must be the victim of her
  first husband. Have you ever seen her second husband come to town? He arrives
  in a swagger motor-car and invariably gets out near the Guards Memorial in
  Green Park and makes the rest of the journey on foot&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator waved her to silence. It was not a moment when he wanted
  anybody to crow over him, and this girl was unmistakably crowing.</p>

  <p>An hour and a quarter from town is a tiny village that nestles at the foot
  of the Berkshire hills. On the crest, and within sight of the beautiful
  downs, is a large red house that stands in ten acres of ground. The Orator
  did not drive up to the front door; he left his car at some distance from the
  house, and, like the second husband of Mrs. Kellner, went afoot. Nor, after
  his long walk through the grounds, did he approach the house directly until
  he saw that the big front doors were wide open. Nor did he ring: he stepped
  into the spacious hall and listened.</p>

  <p>The sound of voices that he heard came from a room beyond the stairway,
  and, with no thought or worry as to what would happen if he were discovered
  by a servant, he stepped softly forward and listened....</p>

  <p>Mrs. Luben-Kellner could be very coarse. She was being very coarse
  now.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;... Skulking here, when you ought to be up and doing and showing
  your face... what do you think that &lsquo;busy&rsquo; will think?... You
  know what a busy is,&rdquo; she said, impatiently, in answer to a mumbled
  enquiry. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to bring me to ruin, that&rsquo;s what
  you&rsquo;re going to do. Fancy leavin&rsquo; that damn&rsquo; book at the
  office for everybody to read! And Mr. Purdew says that he&rsquo;ll be brought
  into it too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A groan of a voice, indistinct and indecipherable. Then the woman&rsquo;s
  shrill voice rose again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all right if you do as Joe&mdash;Mr. Purdew tells
  you. Go back to the office to-morrow... nobody knows, nobody&rsquo;ll ever
  dream it&rsquo;s you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was at this point that the Orator opened the door. Mr. Baide sat
  hunched up in a big deep chair, his elbows on his knees, his big hands
  covering his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why did I do it... why did I ever do it?&rdquo; he asked, wildly.
  &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a bad wife to me... I&rsquo;ve been entirely
  dominated by you. I hate horses, I hate horse-racing.... Oh, God! I wish
  I&rsquo;d never seen you! I wish I could get rid of you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can help you there,&rdquo; said the Orator.</p>

  <p>Baide leapt to his feet, his face the colour of chalk.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry you thought I was rude to
  you,&rdquo; said Miss Lyne, penitently. &ldquo;But then, you must remember,
  Mr. Rater, that I regard you as an interloper. Dobell&rsquo;s Detective
  Agency has been on this case for two years. Harry Dobell is my brother. He
  sent me six months ago to get all the facts. You see, Sir Isaac has been
  suspicious for a long time. Whenever a customer of the bank died suddenly,
  the executors invariably had a dispute about some cheque that had been drawn
  a day before the death. I think that was Joe&rsquo;s idea&mdash;he&rsquo;s an
  old friend of yours, isn&rsquo;t he? The moment he heard that a customer with
  a big account had died, a cheque was prepared and passed through the account
  by poor old Baide. Sometimes no questions were asked; the executors did not
  attempt to trace the money, and the thing might never have been discovered so
  completely but for the report of Gillan&rsquo;s death. The unbelievable thing
  is that Mrs. Joe did all her betting with her husband&mdash;and really
  expected to be paid if she won!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator ran his fingers through his hair and smiled irritably.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a fool I was not to remember that I&rsquo;d seen her portrait
  in Joe&rsquo;s baggage the last time I pinched him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nobody will ever know how poor Mr. Baide fell into their
  clutches.&rdquo; She shook her head sadly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Such a nice old gentleman! What are you charging Mrs. Kellner
  with?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Bigamy,&rdquo; said the Orator, &ldquo;and conspiracy.&rdquo; The
  girl shook her head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity; she&rsquo;s been punished
  enough. You don&rsquo;t realise that, because Joe never made love to
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <h2><a id="story6"
     name="story6"></a>VI. &mdash; THE MAN NEXT DOOR</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Feb 1928</h3>

  <p class="first">WHEN Mr. Giles walked into the Chief Inspector&rsquo;s room,
  he did so with a cheerful assurance. His attitude proclaimed the fact that he
  had nothing whatever to fear from Scotland Yard or its genii; there was a
  smile on his red face and a frank geniality in his blue eyes which would have
  been proper to a man whose past was beyond reproach.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;<i>Good</i> morning, Mr. Rater: it&rsquo;s very good of you to see
  me, I&rsquo;m sure. When I wrote, I said to myself: &lsquo;I wonder if the
  gov&rsquo;nor will spare me a minute?&rsquo; The fact is, I&rsquo;ve been
  trying to make up my mind to write to you for some time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sit down, Farmer,&rdquo; said the Orator, gently. He whose rubicund
  countenance and expansive manner, no less than the accident of his surname,
  had earned him the nickname, smiled wider than ever and drew a chair to the
  inspector&rsquo;s table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know what things are, Mr. Rater! When a man&rsquo;s had a
  little bit of trouble with the police and is starting all over again to build
  up his reputation, he sort of shrinks from getting in touch with the police
  or authorities, if I may use that expression.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Straight now, Farmer?&rdquo; The Orator&rsquo;s steady eyes were
  coldly sceptical.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ab-so-lutely! The other game doesn&rsquo;t pay, Mr. Rater.
  <i>You</i> know that. Yes, I&rsquo;ve had a bit of luck. An uncle of mine set
  me up in business. Naturally, he doesn&rsquo;t know the jokes I&rsquo;ve been
  up to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What kind of business?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Farmer&rsquo; Giles dived into a pocket and extracted a
  pocket-case. The Orator took the large card which was handed across to
  him:</p>

  <p class="sign">J. Giles &amp; Co.<br>
  (Late Olney, Brown &amp; Stermer)<br>
  agents<br>
  479 Cannon Street, E.C.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Agent&rsquo; tells me everything!&rdquo; said Mr. Rater.
  &ldquo;What are you&mdash;a bookmaker?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But it appeared that the Farmer was the proprietor of a prosperous general
  agency.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The business is increasing every month,&rdquo; he said,
  enthusiastically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve worked it up in eighteen months to double
  what it used to be. My uncle&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth, Mr.
  Rater&mdash;I bought it with my own money. Twelve hundred of the best.
  I&rsquo;ve always been a very careful man, as you know, and I&rsquo;ve put
  money aside. What&rsquo;s the use of my telling you lies? It was my own
  money, got on the cross, most of it... you&rsquo;re too wide to believe it
  wasn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve been making up my mind to come and have a chat with
  you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I recognised you in the city, and you know I recognised you,&rdquo;
  interrupted the Orator. &ldquo;Yes, the business is O.K. I&rsquo;ve had you
  taped up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Farmer beamed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trust you! I said to my wife&mdash;quite a lady, Mr.
  Rater&mdash;she was in business herself when I picked her up&mdash;I said:
  &lsquo;Molly, if there&rsquo;s anybody wider than Mr. Rater, I don&rsquo;t
  want to meet him!&rsquo; My very words!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Married, eh?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Giles nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Eighteen months. I&rsquo;d like you to come down to tea one Sunday.
  She&rsquo;s as pretty as a picture. It&rsquo;s not much of a neighbourhood
  &mdash;908 Acacia Street&mdash;and we&rsquo;ve got a few queer birds living
  in our road. One of these days I&rsquo;ll get a flat up West, but I always
  say &lsquo;Creep before you crawl&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was a man given to the employment of trite maxims.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;908 Acacia Street!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator had two causes for astonishment. Acacia Street he knew. It was
  a long avenue of very small houses, the last thoroughfare in which you might
  expect to find the residence of J. Giles &amp; Co. (late Olner, Brown &amp;
  Stermer), Merchants of the City of London.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is my point, gov&rsquo;nor.&rdquo; The Farmer was anxious to
  explain the modesty of his habitation. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to make an
  honest living. I&rsquo;m earning good money, but what happens if I come up
  West and take a flash flat? First of all, the police start making enquiries;
  secondly, I meet my old friends, and that starts me wrong.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very creditable,&rdquo; murmured Inspector Rater; &ldquo;also
  you&rsquo;re not known in Brockley.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; said the other.</p>

  <p>He took up his hat from the floor where he had placed it and smoothed the
  crown.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know a man called Smith&mdash;George Smith?&rdquo; he
  asked.</p>

  <p>The Orator looked at the ceiling.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an uncommon name,&rdquo; he said; and the Farmer
  grinned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You will have your joke, gov&rsquo;nor! He lives next door to me,
  and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he wasn&rsquo;t a lag. He&rsquo;s a
  sanctimonious sort of fellow, and goes to church; but all I know is that the
  night the boys did that job at Blackheath and got away with eight thousand
  quids worth of sparklers, he was out all night; I happened to know because I
  saw him come home at five.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You having worked at your office all night?&rdquo; murmured the
  Inspector, and for a moment the caller was disconcerted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. To tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m an early riser.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You always were, Farmer,&rdquo; said Mr. Rater, and offered a limp
  hand.</p>

  <p>908 Acacia Street! And at 910 lived a certain man who was a wood carver by
  trade and who dabbled in electrical contrivances.</p>

  <p>A coincidence: a portent, probably&mdash;Mr. Rater found material for
  speculation.</p>

  <p>Giles went back to his office in Cannon Street. He had some rooms on the
  second floor of a business block, and attended to the more intimate side of
  his affairs. He had in truth purchased the wreckage of a once prosperous
  concern, but with little intention of putting it to a legitimate use. Even
  when that remarkable order had been cabled to him from a client of the old
  firm, and he had been notified by the bankers that £6,000 had been placed to
  his credit for the purpose of making the purchase, his first inclination had
  been to draw the money and vanish gracefully. He had, however, taken over two
  clerks with the business, and one of these explained that the money could
  only be drawn on presentation of the invoices for the goods; thereupon Mr.
  Giles most virtuously, and with the assistance of the clerk who knew
  something about the execution of orders, carried out his duties, received his
  small commission and was more or less content.</p>

  <p>It so happened that the order he filled was an advantageous one, and at
  the end of six months trading he found his clientele had increased
  threefold.</p>

  <p>He was only mildly interested in the phenomenon, for his interests lay
  elsewhere than in the pure paths of commerce. J. Giles &amp; Co. was really
  the head clerk, who conducted all negotiations and did no more than bring
  cheques to be endorsed or signed (the former operation was carried out by Mr.
  Giles willingly, the latter suspiciously), and he left to his employer other
  negotiations more delicate than the head clerk imagined.</p>

  <p>The shipping of second-hand motor-cars to India and the Far East is a
  lucrative business, if you do not pay too much for the cars. And Mr. Giles
  paid next to nothing. He had a stabling yard adjacent to the London Docks,
  where cars would be crated, and it was on the shipment of these machines that
  his fortune was founded. He had got the strength of this graft from a man he
  met in Dartmoor, and he might have accumulated a fortune on the disposal of
  the stolen machines&mdash;he was on his way to being the biggest car fence in
  London&mdash; and from the legitimate profits of his business, if that
  unfortunate spirit of adventure which was his downfall had remained
  dormant.</p>

  <p>On the night before he had interviewed Mr. Rater, he had visited
  Sunningdale in a stolen car, and, accompanied by two willing helpers, had
  lifted from a locked house some £1,500 worth of silver, and that was not his
  first job.</p>

  <p>The modus operandi of the little gang can be simply described. A motor-car
  left unattended was &lsquo;knocked-off&rsquo; by one of the confederates; the
  other two were picked up in a quiet suburban street, and the car was driven
  to the house which had been marked down for attack. He had found some little
  difficulty in securing assistance. Higgy James, whom he eventually secured,
  voiced the objection of his kind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good workman, Farmer, but what about that gun of
  yours? If you&rsquo;re carrying one, miss me out. You&rsquo;ve done a seven
  for shooting at a copper, and the next time it&rsquo;ll be life, and anybody
  who&rsquo;s with you may get the same. I&rsquo;m not playing unless you cut
  out the shooter.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The English criminal&rsquo;s horror of being found in possession of
  firearms is natural. The pistol embellished burglar receives an automatic
  addition of five years for his armament should he find himself interviewing
  one of His Majesty&rsquo;s judges.</p>

  <p>The silver from the overnight raid had already been melted, and in bar
  form would be disposed of by J. Giles &amp; Co. (late Olney, Brown &amp;
  Stermer), Merchants &amp; Shippers. He finished work early and went to Acacia
  Street, having a certain matter to settle. As he passed No. 910, where his
  offending neighbour lived, he scowled at the unlighted window. No. 910 was
  built against his own house, which was of a semidetached order. Giles opened
  his own door with a key, and strode into the dining-room. The girl who was
  sitting by the side of the fire, sewing, got up quickly, and a stranger
  observing the scene, with no knowledge of their relationship, might have
  supposed that she stood in terror of him, for all the smile she forced. If
  she was not as pretty as a picture, that was entirely Farmer Giles&rsquo;
  fault, but the bruise had almost disappeared, he was pleased to note&mdash;
  pleased because that old so-and-so Rater might very easily take it into his
  head to accept the invitation he had given.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get my tea,&rdquo; he said, curtly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>As she moved to the door he called her back.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has that fellow next door been smarming round?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, dear; he hasn&rsquo;t spoken to me; I haven&rsquo;t seen him
  ....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me no lies!&rdquo; His voice rose menacingly.
  &ldquo;You let me come back and catch you gossipping over the garden wall and
  see what happens to you, my girl!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She did not answer; fear struck the colour from her face as she stood
  tense, waiting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I picked you up out of the gutter, so to speak,&rdquo; said J.
  Giles. &ldquo;A bit of a shop gal, up to your eyes in debt. Why I married you
  I don&rsquo;t know: I must have been crazy with the heat. I&rsquo;ve given
  you a home and all the luxury that the heart can desire.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, dear; I&rsquo;m very grateful.&rdquo; She hastened to speak,
  but he silenced her with a wave of his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My tea,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He often woke up in the morning with a dismal sense of his lunacy in
  marrying this girl. Men should stick to their own game, and his game was
  burglary and not bigamy. Here was a handle for the &lsquo;busies&rsquo; if
  they ever got to know about his first marriage; and just as he was making
  good, and had three thousand &lsquo;ready&rsquo; stowed away in the Northern
  and Southern Bank. The more he thought about his danger from this source, the
  more he hated her. It was inconsistent in him that he objected to the
  attentions of the man next door. If the old fool hadn&rsquo;t knocked on the
  wall in the middle of the night, and later come with an overcoat over his
  pyjamas to ask what was the meaning of the screams, he might have used Mr.
  Smith for his own purposes. He wasn&rsquo;t a bad-looking fellow, either,
  though rather grey and sombre. When the Farmer had caught him by the throat
  and had attempted to throw him into the street, the intruder had pinned him
  as though he were a child, had shaken off the grip and flung the Farmer the
  length of the passage.</p>

  <p>Joe Giles brooded before the fire till the girl brought in his tea and
  placed the tray on the table. For a long time he ignored her presence, and
  then, without looking at her:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If a fellow named Rater calls, he&rsquo;s from Scotland
  Yard&mdash;a friend of mine. I know everybody at Scotland Yard&mdash;I have
  to, in my business; but you needn&rsquo;t tell him anything about me, do you
  hear?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A long silence; and then: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that fellow next door do for
  a living?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Joe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Joe&rsquo;!&rdquo; he mimicked her.
  &ldquo;Do you know anything?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shrank back from the threat of his uplifted hand, and he laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You behave yourself and I&rsquo;ll behave myself,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a gentleman calling on me to-night: when he comes, you
  go up to the bedroom. If I want you I&rsquo;ll send for you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He looked at his watch and yawned, and, going up to the bathroom, washed
  himself and announced his intention of going out for an hour. Once, in the
  early days of their marriage, she had made the mistake of asking him where he
  was going, but that folly had not been repeated.</p>

  <p>She waited until the door slammed on him, passed quickly into the
  drawing-room with its bow window, and through the curtains watched him till
  he disappeared; then she went through the kitchen, leaving all the doors open
  so that she could hear, knowing that her neighbour would have heard the door
  slam.</p>

  <p>He was waiting in the garden, a dark figure in the gloom.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I had to lie to him, Mr. Smith,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I said I
  hadn&rsquo;t spoken to you. What am I to do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Her voice was vibrant with despair; and yet she found a certain dismal
  happiness in talking to him. Every night the girl went out at the same hour,
  and every night she made her way to the garden to discuss a problem which had
  been hopeless at its outset and was hopeless yet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you hadn&rsquo;t seen me to-day.&rdquo; His voice was rough
  but kindly. &ldquo;Has he beaten you again?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head: he could just see that gesture.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, he hasn&rsquo;t struck me since you came the other night. I
  don&rsquo;t know what to do, Mr. Smith, I&rsquo;m so terrified of him. He
  gives me no money, so I can&rsquo;t run away from him. If I went back to my
  old job at Harridge&rsquo;s he would follow me. He terrifies me. Sometimes I
  think I shall put my head in the gas oven and end it all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking like a fool.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s voice was
  sharp, but almost instantly he became his gentle self. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find
  a way out for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who is Mr. Rater of Scotland Yard?&rdquo; she asked, suddenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; He had obviously been startled by the question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Joe was talking about him; said he would be likely to call. Do you
  know him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A pause.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I know him. I met him once. When is he coming?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His tone was anxious, and she wondered what Rater stood for in his
  mind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s coming at all. Joe only said that
  he might be calling. He wants to know what you do for a living.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She heard a chuckle from the other side of the wall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He does, does he? Well, you can tell him the truth: I&rsquo;m a
  working woodcarver&mdash;he&rsquo;s seen me at the bench often enough; and
  I&rsquo;ve another job, which is my own private affair and I never talk about
  it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you don&rsquo;t, you dirty trickster.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The girl screamed and turned in horror, to find her husband standing
  almost by her side. He had crept back without a sound, and had overheard the
  last part of the conversation. She would have fled past him, but he caught
  her by the arm in a grip that made her scream again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You wait here. So this is what you do when I go out in the evening,
  eh? I&rsquo;ll settle with you later, Smith.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He dragged the girl inside and bolted the door. Mr. Smith, who was by no
  means a squeamish man, made a little grimace as her cries came out to
  him...</p>

  <p>She lay huddled on the bed, too weak, too stunned even to cry. Mr. J.
  Giles buttoned his wristband and put on his coat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now you can go to bed, my girl, and be thankful you&rsquo;re
  alive,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He locked the bedroom door on her and went downstairs into the kitchen and
  chose an empty soda-water bottle. Then he went out of the house and knocked
  at Mr. Smith&rsquo;s door. He was glad to notice that the hallway was in
  darkness. He heard the footsteps of the man, and then the door was pulled
  wide open.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Evidently Joe had been recognised.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d come to see you, Mr. Smith&rdquo;&mdash;
  Giles&rsquo; manner was polite, even deferential &ldquo;&mdash;and ask you as
  a great favour to me not to talk to my wife. She&rsquo;s a very foolish girl,
  and I don&rsquo;t want to get her into trouble of any kind,
  and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His tone was so conciliatory, his manner so completely subdued, that Smith
  was off his guard. He saw, only for the fraction of a second, the weapon in
  the man&rsquo;s hand, and ducked his head as the soda-water bottle struck
  him. He went down on his knees and collapsed in a heap on the floor, and Mr.
  J. Giles closed the door carefully and went back into his house to spend an
  uncomfortable half-hour. Suppose this bird went to the police... that was the
  second mad thing he had done.</p>

  <p>From time to time he pressed his ear against the thin party wall, and had
  the satisfaction of hearing the stumbling feet of his victim. Taking up a
  position in the parlour where he could watch the front door, he waited for
  the man to emerge; but half an hour and an hour passed, and nothing happened.
  The Farmer smiled. There was probably a very good reason why the man should
  not go to the police.</p>

  <p>Towards ten o&rsquo;clock the man he expected called. It was
  &lsquo;Higgy,&rsquo; the best of runners and the loyalest of assistants.
  There was a job ready for the working&mdash;a big house on the outskirts of
  Horsham. The family were away; there were seven maidservants and two elderly
  men.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The old lady who owns the house is down at Bournemouth, and keeps
  all her jewels in the safe. You can&rsquo;t see it because it&rsquo;s let
  into the wall behind the head of the bed. &lsquo;Stokey&rsquo; Barmond went
  through the house yesterday&mdash;he got pally with a gel servant&mdash;and
  he says it&rsquo;s easy. A French safe that you could open with your
  finger-nails, and lashings of jewellery&mdash;old-fashioned, but the stones
  are extra.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the best way for the car?&rdquo; asked Mr. Giles.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Higgy&rsquo; explained. There was a side road where it could be
  parked, and from there over a low boundary wall into the grounds was &lsquo;a
  step.&rsquo; He produced a fairly accurate plan, for &lsquo;Higgy&rsquo; in
  his youth had been apprenticed to a cartographer. This the Farmer scanned
  carefully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It looks good. Get &lsquo;Stokey&rsquo; to knock off a car
  to-morrow night, and pick me up at the top of Denmark Hill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No shooters,&rdquo; said &lsquo;Higgy.&rsquo; It was his
  conventional warning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is it likely?&rdquo; demanded the Farmer.</p>

  <p>It was his conventional reply.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, when he went up to his room he took his Browning from a
  locked drawer, and slipped in a full magazine. He knew better than any that
  his next stretch would be a lifer, and he would as soon hang.</p>

  <p>That morning he had seen Smith with a bandage round his head. He was
  standing at a little iron gate that shut off the forecourt of his house from
  the road. For a moment, at the sight of him, the heart of J. Giles had
  quailed and he had gripped the loaded cane he carried.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said Smith. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a bone to
  pick with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Pick it when you like,&rdquo; said the Farmer, keeping his
  distance.</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll choose the time yourself,&rdquo; he said, and
  with the mysterious hint they parted.</p>

  <p>All day long Mr. Smith considered his position, and in the evening, after
  the Farmer had gone to his nefarious work, the man next door went out to find
  a telephone booth and Rater. For the party walls were very thin, and Mr.
  Smith, who made a hobby of wire and other electrical contraptions, had made
  for himself a small microphone...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve left it rather late Smith,&rdquo; said the Orator; but
  anticipated Smith&rsquo;s explanation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer thing for me to do, sir. I can&rsquo;t very well
  go into the box, and that&rsquo;s been worrying me all day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator only waited long enough at Scotland Yard to get into touch with
  the Sussex police before he boarded a swift tender and took the Worthing
  road.</p>

  <p>The Farmer&rsquo;s gift of organisation was of a high order. Almost to the
  minute he was picked up at the top of Denmark Hill by a light car, the
  proprietorship in which had undergone a change in the previous hour.
  &lsquo;Higgy&rsquo; was at the wheel, their companion in the seat behind.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You picked a good &rsquo;un,&rdquo; said the Farmer graciously,
  which was high praise for him.</p>

  <p>They passed through Horsham in a blinding shower of rain which would have
  made police observation a difficult business even if &lsquo;Higgy&rsquo; had
  not already changed the number-plate of the stolen car and covered its
  radiator with a muff.</p>

  <p>As they approached the scene of their exploit, &lsquo;Higgy&rsquo; asked,
  not without anxiety:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t brought your shooter, have you, Farmer?&rdquo;
  and Mr. Giles turned on him savagely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Would <i>you</i> get a stretch
  for my gun? It&rsquo;s me that&rsquo;s got to go through it if we&rsquo;re
  caught&mdash;not you!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, &lsquo;Higgy&rsquo; persisted stubbornly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you got a gun or haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; snapped the Farmer.</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Higgy&rsquo; said nothing, but he was not convinced. It was his
  task to stand by the car, and at the first sound of a shot&mdash;well,
  &lsquo;Higgy&rsquo; knew his own graft best. He&rsquo;d be half-way to
  Horsham before the Farmer reached the road. He had already got his excuses
  ready for his desertion.</p>

  <p>The car turned into the side lane, moving silently on the downward slope
  with its engine shut off till &lsquo;Higgy&rsquo; braked the machine to a
  jolting standstill. There was a whispered consultation. Crossing the wall,
  Farmer and his assistant disappeared into the night. &lsquo;Higgy&rsquo;
  loosed the brakes, and, by pushing and pulling, managed to turn the nose of
  the machine about without switching on his engine. He waited for ten minutes
  to pass, trod on the starter and set the engine going. A quarter of an hour,
  and he was half-dozing at the wheel, when he heard the squelch of a footstep,
  and a light was suddenly flashed in his face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Step down and don&rsquo;t shout,&rdquo; said a terse voice.
  &lsquo;Higgy&rsquo; was conscious that the lane was full of uniformed
  policemen, two of whom were already crossing the wall.</p>

  <p>The Farmer had reached his objective, and with the assistance of a
  convenient porch had forced a window which brought him to the bedroom. The
  safe proved to be almost as easy money as he had anticipated. In a quarter of
  an hour he had wrenched the little door from its hinges and had stowed away
  in his several pockets the valuable contents. When he came out on to the
  porch his watcher had disappeared. Swinging over the balustrade, he slid down
  a pillar....</p>

  <p>A hand gripped his arm tightly, but he wrenched it free. He saw, dimly,
  the shape of a helmet against the copper red sky, dodged under an
  outstretched arm and ran. He was within a dozen paces of the wall when his
  pursuer leapt forward and, tackling him low, brought the thief sprawling to
  the ground. In an instant he was on his feet, grinning with rage, and as the
  constable scrambled up with him...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s yours!&rdquo; said the Farmer, and shot twice from the
  hip.</p>

  <p>He didn&rsquo;t wait to see the man go slithering into the mud, but darted
  for the wall and threw himself over, into the arms of the Scotland Yard men
  who were waiting for him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cop,&rdquo; said the Farmer, and hastened to establish
  his innocence. &ldquo;We were struggling for the gun and it went off by
  accident.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The jury will be interested,&rdquo; said the Orator, icily.</p>

  <p>The murder was a commonplace, vulgar one. Only the profession of the
  victim gave it a public interest. The Farmer appeared first at the local
  police court, before a bench of magistrates, then before an Assize Court.
  £3,000 in the bank gave him the right to the best legal advice, and his case
  was argued with great eloquence by a brilliant leader of the Bar. The value
  of such assistance was that it prolonged the trial from one to two days, but
  the result was inevitable. The reporters sharpened their pencils, the bored
  ushers leaning against the wall, the morbid sightseers&mdash;even the stolid
  jury knew it was inevitable before the curtain rose on the last act of the
  drama. Only the judge and the counsel for the defence offered a similitude of
  conscientious doubt. And when sentence was promulgated, and he was taken to
  Wandsworth Prison, handcuffs on his wrists and three warders in attendance,
  there was, felt the Farmer, still hope.</p>

  <p>He had not seen his wife since his arrest. She had come up once at his
  earnest request, but since he was not allowed to interview her except in the
  presence of a prison official, he could not give her instructions as to
  certain rather incriminating articles which must be done away with (such as
  two full boxes of ammunition in the right side hand of the chest of drawers);
  she wasn&rsquo;t of much use to him, and the sight of her white, drawn face
  exasperated him to such an extent that when she came again he declined to see
  her.</p>

  <p>The Court of Appeal dismissed his case summarily. And then it was he
  bethought him of sending for the Orator. Mr. Rater saw him in his cell, a
  growth of red beard on his redder face, and the Farmer grinned his
  greeting.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got me to rights, Rater&mdash;why did you let
  &lsquo;Higgy&rsquo; off with a three?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;Higgy&rsquo; had certainly escaped with three years&rsquo; penal
  servitude.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And that fellow Smith&mdash;he thinks I&rsquo;ll be leaving that
  woman of mine a bit of money and that he&rsquo;ll marry her. Now I&rsquo;m
  telling you, Rater, she&rsquo;s not my wife. I was married before.
  She&rsquo;s not entitled to a farthing&mdash;she won&rsquo;t get it
  either.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He gave particulars of his early marriage. It was not in a spirit of
  contrition, but rather, as he explained, with satisfaction, &ldquo;to put her
  in her place.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My point is that I don&rsquo;t want that woman to go claiming
  anything from me. She&rsquo;s been a curse to me,&rdquo; he added, but did
  not explain how. Nor, thought Rater, could a logical explanation be
  forthcoming.</p>

  <p>It was out of sheer malice that he had sent for the Orator, who suggested
  as much, and the condemned man nodded and grinned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not going to marry Smith&mdash;not on my
  money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry about Smith&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began the
  Orator, but stopped. He was on delicate ground.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That man&rsquo;s a crook,&rdquo; said the Farmer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
  had him &lsquo;taped&rsquo; for a long time. He&rsquo;s always going out at
  nights, and staying away a couple of days. He lives alone, and I&rsquo;ll bet
  if you &lsquo;fanned&rsquo; his house you&rsquo;d find lashings of
  stuff.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised,&rdquo; said the Orator, who was
  glad to leave his victim.</p>

  <p>The man next door was a sore point with the Farmer. He discussed him with
  his custodians, the warders who watched him night and day. He did almost all
  the talking, and they the listening; but they were good listeners.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish I&rsquo;d knocked his brains out,&rdquo; he said, amiably.
  &ldquo;They can only hang you once, even for fifty thousand murders.
  I&rsquo;ll bet he carries that mark I gave him to his grave! I caught him
  here...&rdquo; He illustrated the blow, and the warders were only faintly
  interested.</p>

  <p>And then came the morning of mornings, and Mr. J. Giles submitted
  patiently to being prayed over. He was still red of face, hardly moved by the
  horror which awaited him in the little cell that opens immediately opposite
  the one in which he was confined. When the parson had finished, he rose from
  his knees with a grunt of satisfaction.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s see your&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then the man next door walked swiftly into the cell, and he had a
  black strap in his hand. Giles stared at him open-mouthed. There was a livid
  scar on his forehead. No doubt at all, it was Smith... the man next door!</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Good Gawd!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you meant,
  was it? We&rsquo;d meet again and you&rsquo;d be the fellow that brought it
  off!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Smith, the hangman, did not answer. He never spoke in business hours.</p>

  <h2><a id="story7"
     name="story7"></a>VII. &mdash; THE SIRIUS MAN</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Jan 1928</h3>

  <p class="first">THE ORATOR was not in his most amiable mood when the
  telephone bell rang. He looked round helplessly for his clerk, for he hated
  telephone calls : they made greater demands on speech than he was prepared to
  meet.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is that Mr. Rater?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Girl&rsquo;s voices are not easily recognisable through a telephone
  receiver, but Mr. Rater had no difficulty in identifying the speaker.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Linstead.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It would have been unpardonable if he had forgotten her, for less than a
  year before she had been his secretary, a dark-haired girl, incorrigibly shy
  and nervous, who had given up work at the earnest request of her uncle, who
  for some reason had suddenly become aware of her existence and was now, he
  remembered vaguely, living in a handsome flat in Mayfair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder if it&rsquo;s possible to see you, Mr. Rater? It&rsquo;s a
  very important matter to me... nothing to do with the police, of course...
  and yet it is in a way&mdash;I mean my trouble &mdash;but you were so kind to
  me...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She ended on a note of incoherence.</p>

  <p>The Orator rubbed his nose thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>He was a man who had very few likes and many dislikes. He liked Betty
  Linstead for reasons which had no association with her prettiness. She was
  efficient, accurate and silent. Talkative secretaries drove him mad;
  secretaries who demanded that he should discuss the weather he loathed. He
  began liking her when he found that she did not think it was necessary to say
  &ldquo;Good morning.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not busy; I&rsquo;ll come along,&rdquo; he said, and
  scribbled down her address on the blotting-pad.</p>

  <p>He had an idea that Brook Manor was a most expensive block of flats, but
  he discovered it to be more exclusive than he had imagined&mdash; a place of
  glass and metal doors, of dignified hall porters who had the appearance of
  family retainers, of heavily carpeted corridors. When he was admitted to No.
  9 he found himself in an apartment so luxuriously appointed and furnished
  that his attitude towards the girl who came to meet him was a little
  reserved. This was not the plainly dressed secretary he knew. About her wrist
  were three bracelets, the value of which represented Mr. Rater&rsquo;s salary
  for at least four years.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you came, Mr. Rater,&rdquo; she said,
  breathlessly. &ldquo;I want you to meet Arthur&mdash; Mr. Arthur
  Menden.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was the same fluttering, nervous creature he had known in other days.
  She led him into the drawing-room and introduced him to a good-looking young
  man, and if Mr. Rater was embarrassed by the splendour of the flat, he was
  more embarrassed by the presence of this third party.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all dreadfully complicated,&rdquo; said Betty, in her
  quick, frightened way. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about uncle... and Arthur. Uncle
  doesn&rsquo;t wish me to marry Arthur...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Inwardly the Orator groaned. He had expected many problems, but that of
  the young lady in love with a man objectionable to her relatives was the last
  he anticipated. She must have guessed his growing annoyance, for she almost
  pushed him into an armchair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I must tell you everything from the beginning. Uncle Julian you
  know, of course&mdash;everybody knows Uncle Julian. He&rsquo;s a bachelor.
  But he&rsquo;s always been very kind to me, and made me a small allowance
  when I was working for you. Just enough to live on&mdash;I think he would
  have given me more, but he believes in girls working for their living. I only
  saw him once in six months, unless I met him by accident. I used to dine with
  him on Christmas Day if he was in London, and once he asked me down to his
  box at Ascot, but I made him so uncomfortable, and was so uncomfortable
  myself, that I rather dreaded those meetings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think, in fairness to your uncle, you ought to tell Mr. Rater
  that there was nothing unpleasant about Julian Linstead. He simply
  didn&rsquo;t wish to be bothered with girls,&rdquo; interrupted Arthur
  Menden. And then, with a laugh: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a queer old devil, and
  I&rsquo;ve no reason to excuse him. But I haven&rsquo;t been exactly
  straightforward in the matter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was my fault entirely,&rdquo; interrupted Betty.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When did you come into this property?&rdquo; The Orator was heavily
  sarcastic as he comprehended the beauties of the room with a wave of his
  hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to tell you,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;It was whilst I was working at Scotland Yard that I had a very urgent
  letter from uncle asking me to come and dine with him. I knew Arthur then, of
  course. We&rsquo;d been&mdash;friends for a long time. I dined with Uncle
  Julian at the Carlton. He offered me the long lease of a big flat; he said he
  would furnish it regardless of cost, and that he would pay me five thousand a
  year so long as I did not marry. I was bewildered at first, but eventually,
  after another meeting, I agreed. I don&rsquo;t suppose any girl would think
  three times about such an offer. He was my father&rsquo;s brother, and I was
  his only relative, and it was always understood that I was his heiress.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really think very seriously about the clause
  prohibiting my marriage&mdash;I thought that was just a provision he made for
  my own protection, but I soon discovered that he was very much in earnest. He
  found out about Arthur, I really think, by employing detectives to watch us.
  He came round here one day in a state of terrible excitement, and begged me
  not to think of marrying Arthur or anybody else. He made me promise that I
  would tell him before anybody when I had found the man I wanted to marry. I
  really wasn&rsquo;t very keen.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Does he know Mr. Menden?&rdquo; asked the Orator.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. That&rsquo;s a queer thing: he had no objections to Mr. Menden
  as an individual until he learnt, as he did subsequently, that I was very
  fond of him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, then he was beastly&mdash;he did everything he possibly could
  to ruin Arthur.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Arthur interrupted: he was a young man with a sense of justice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;d call it ruin to be offered a
  job in the Argentine, but he certainly was very keen on getting me out of the
  way. Naturally, I wouldn&rsquo;t like Betty to lose her allowance, but thank
  the Lord I&rsquo;m earning enough to keep two.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re getting married?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been married four months,&rdquo; she said, and stared
  at him in fright.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The devil you have!&rdquo; said the Orator.</p>

  <p>She nodded quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was underhanded, but... I don&rsquo;t know... I must have been a
  little crazy, but I hadn&rsquo;t the courage to tell Uncle Julian, and I
  wouldn&rsquo;t let Arthur tell him either. What I have done is to write to
  him to-day, telling him I&rsquo;m going to be married to-morrow. You see, we
  were married in a registrar&rsquo;s office, and somehow I do want to be
  married in a church.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re being married all over again, and you&rsquo;re
  making a false declaration, and you want me to get you out of all your
  trouble before you get into it?&rdquo; said the Orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; Betty Linstead said, quickly.
  &ldquo;It is quite legal; Arthur has made enquiries. Lots of people get
  married in churches of different denominations, one for the husband and one
  for the wife, and lots of others go through two ceremonies, the one civil and
  the other religious. I want the religious one for... for a special
  reason.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All this is interesting,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but what exactly do
  you wish me to do?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The young people looked at one another, and it was the man who spoke.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The truth is, Mr. Rater, Betty thinks her uncle is mad. It
  isn&rsquo;t the loss of the money that worries her, it is the fear of what
  may happen to&mdash;well, to me, when Julian Linstead hears about the
  marriage. He is insane on the subject of Betty remaining a spinster. And
  he&rsquo;s one of the nicest of men on any other subject&mdash;that&rsquo;s
  the weirdness of it. There isn&rsquo;t anybody who could say a word against
  him. I doubt if he has an enemy in the world. Honestly I&rsquo;m rather
  scared about what will happen&mdash;not to myself but to Betty.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A light began to dawn on Mr. Rater.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You want police protection?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>They nodded together, so like children in their concern that the Orator
  almost broke a lifetime&rsquo;s habit and laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re crazy but I will see what I can do about
  it,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He was more amused than annoyed at the trivial cause of his summons. It
  was a simple matter to have the house watched, but he had no intention of
  wasting three perfectly good detectives on such a job&mdash;and here he was
  wrong.</p>

  <p>Julian George Linstead was an antique dealer who had speculated on the
  Stock Exchange to such purpose that he was no longer interested in antiques,
  which means that he was not an antiquarian at heart but had engaged his
  energies and such genius as he possessed in the buying and selling of
  furniture, pictures and the like, having acquired in his youth the technique
  necessary for the successful prosecution of his business.</p>

  <p>He was a bachelor of forty-five, good-looking in a dark and rather
  sinister way. He was a man of very charming manners, had a sense of humour,
  was a generous giver to charities, but rather shy of having his name
  associated with his many gifts.</p>

  <p>He had a flat in Curzon Street which was run by a Mrs. Aldred, an elderly
  and unprepossessing housekeeper. There were also living in the flat a maid,
  Rosie Liffing, and Mr. Aldred, who acted as butler-valet. These three people
  were commonplace and respectable folk: the girl rather plain and stout and a
  member of the congregation of Plymouth Brethren.</p>

  <p>Mr. Linstead did not entertain at the flat; on those occasions when he
  gave a party it was invariably at the Carlton Hotel. Even these were of a
  modest kind. So far as could be ascertained, he had no entanglements of an
  embarrassing nature. He was a member of the Junior Carlton; in politics he
  was vaguely Conservative, a party towards which he had a leaning because they
  never did anything very drastic or uncomfortable and were believed to be
  friendly disposed towards vested interests.</p>

  <p>So he lived blamelessly, accepting his annual tax assessment as an act of
  God, and fulfilling the social obligations which convention dictated in a
  quiet and unostentatious fashion. He had a shoot in Norfolk, rented a fishing
  in Scotland, hunted twice a week in the early weeks of the season, had a box
  at Ascot (which more often than not he occupied alone) and a tiny yacht in
  Southampton Waters. He was at Deauville and the Lido at the right moment, and
  spent at least three weeks at St. Moritz in the winter. People knew him as
  well off; he was, indeed, an exceedingly rich man. His saturnity denied him a
  few acquaintances that might have made life interesting, and a larger number
  who would certainly have made living expensive.</p>

  <p>He had one amiable weakness, an interest in the occult, and was a friend
  of that remarkable man, Professor Henry Hoylash, the geometrical astrologer,
  who was a frequent visitor to the flat in Curzon Street. Professor Hoylash
  was a mild little man who could and did predict world events with amazing
  accuracy. He was known as &ldquo;The Sirius Man&rdquo; because all his
  prophecies were in some mysterious fashion founded on the position in the
  heavens of this star at the date when the Pyramids were built. It was a
  science that had many votaries, and Mr. Linstead, who had not even known that
  there was such a star, and who had the impression, gained from travel
  posters, that the Pyramids were erected to advertise Thomas Cook &amp; Sons,
  was terribly impressed when the subject was explained to him.</p>

  <p>Professor Hoylash came occasionally to dinner, and on one occasion did
  persuade Linstead to forego his winter sports holiday and make a trip to
  Cairo.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater made his enquiries and learned all that there was to be learnt
  about Mr. Linstead. Whatever change of attitude his niece may have detected,
  such change had been visible to his servants. Mr. Aldred, the butler, who
  spoke freely to one of Mr. Rater&rsquo;s men (it was in the saloon bar of the
  Cow and Gate) said that a better employer never existed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s taken up with these ghosts and spirits that the old
  professor&rsquo;s so keen on and talks about Egyptian gods and things, but
  bless my heart and soul, isn&rsquo;t a gentleman entitled to his
  hobbies?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The detective pressed him on the question of Mr. Linstead&rsquo;s
  occultisms.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in it,&rdquo; protested the butler. &ldquo;He
  amuses himself casting horoscopes, and is always asking what hour and day in
  the year I was born and my wife was born; otherwise you&rsquo;d never know
  that he&rsquo;s taken up with this Egyptian stuff.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Apparently Mr. Linstead had taken up his studies with some seriousness. He
  had acquired a library of sorts on occult subjects, had a marvellous model of
  the Pyramids, that took to pieces, would spend hours in making mysterious
  calculations.</p>

  <p>The Orator&rsquo;s interest in Mr. Linstead&rsquo;s obsessions was hardly
  alive to start with&mdash;it waned into oblivion as soon as his enquiries
  were completed. After all, there was nothing remarkable in a rich uncle
  holding views about the destination of his money, for Betty was certainly his
  heiress. He returned to Scotland Yard, signed a few letters, heard the
  reports of his immediate subordinates and went home.</p>

  <p>He went to bed early that evening, and he was so sound a sleeper that he
  did not hear the telephone ring at first, but after some time, cursing
  silently, he slid from his bed and took up the instrument.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Arthur Menden, sir,&rdquo; said an anxious voice at the
  other end of the wire. &ldquo;You remember you saw me at Betty&rsquo;s flat
  yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, yes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator realised from the young man&rsquo;s hoarse voice that something
  was wrong.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;She has been spirited away to-night&mdash;I&rsquo;m speaking from
  her flat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Spirited away? What the devil do you mean? Don&rsquo;t talk.
  I&rsquo;ll come round.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He dressed furiously. Why should he, a responsible police official, be
  called out of bed in the middle of the night on such a fool&rsquo;s
  errand?</p>

  <p>He found Mr. Menden in a state of agitation which he did not imagine could
  be possible in so phlegmatic a young man. Apparently he had been unaware of
  the disappearance until midnight.</p>

  <p>Although he and Betty were married they lived apart. Ordinarily he would
  have spent the evening with her, and it was at her request that he had gone
  to his own flat after dining with her at Ciro&rsquo;s Grille and seeing her
  home. At half-past ten he was called up on the telephone by a stranger, who
  said that he was speaking for the head of the engineering company for whom
  Menden worked. The caller asked him to go at once to the senior
  partner&rsquo;s house on Kingston Hill to discuss a cable that had arrived
  from Bermuda, where, in point of fact, Arthur Menden&rsquo;s firm had a big
  contract.</p>

  <p>Never suspecting that there was anything wrong, he dressed, found a
  taxi-cab, and was driven to Kingston. Here he found a birthday party in
  progress. Mr. Fallaby, the engineer in question, had no knowledge whatever of
  the call, and, in point of fact, had no cable to discuss. Puzzled and annoyed
  by the hoax, Menden went back to his apartment. He arrived home at a quarter
  to one and heard the telephone bell ringing when he went in. It was
  Betty&rsquo;s maid. She had tried for an hour to get into touch with the
  husband of her mistress, but without success.</p>

  <p>The story she told was that at eleven o&rsquo;clock Betty had been called
  up by somebody who said he was the janitor of her husband&rsquo;s flat. Would
  she go to the flat at once? He must have said something more, but this was
  all the maid knew. Looking out of the window she saw a car standing by the
  sidewalk and saw Betty talking to a man for a little while before she entered
  the car with him and drove off.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you get her a cab?&rdquo; asked the Orator.</p>

  <p>The maid explained that she was undressed and that before she could get
  her clothes on Betty was gone. She had only stayed long enough to tell the
  girl where she was going.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you recognise the man or the car?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The maid shook her head. It was a very dark night; she thought the car was
  a Rolls Royce&mdash;it was a very long one.</p>

  <p>The girl dressed and waited for Betty&rsquo;s return. When twelve
  o&rsquo;clock came she became alarmed and rang up Menden&rsquo;s
  flat&mdash;to receive no answer.</p>

  <p>That was all the information she could give, and was, indeed, the only
  information available.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Julian Linstead! It can&rsquo;t be anybody else,&rdquo;
  said Arthur Menden, in a state of nervous frenzy. &ldquo;I waited for you to
  come, Mr. Rater, otherwise I&rsquo;d have been at his flat by now.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator could find no other explanation of the girl&rsquo;s flight. She
  had no friends in London, and in any case would not have gone off alone in a
  car with a stranger.</p>

  <p>The only other clue, if it was a clue, was the fact that she had taken her
  sleeping things with her&mdash;her brush and comb were gone from the
  dressing-table and her nightdress-case and slippers were missing.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes later they were knocking at the door of Mr. Linstead&rsquo;s
  flat and after a while the door was opened by the butler, who was in his
  dressing-gown.</p>

  <p>He was too picturesquely dishevelled for conviction. The Orator saw that
  his shoes were laced and tied, and this did not accord exactly with the
  disorder of his hair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir. Mr. Linstead went out of town yesterday morning. I think
  he went to Paris&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His protest was a little too loud. The Orator looked him in the eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a police officer,&rdquo; he said simply, and he saw the man
  look and blink.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Will you let me write a letter to Mr. Linstead?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man nodded mutely and led the way into Mr. Linstead&rsquo;s handsome
  study, and switched on the lights. The Orator sat down at the desk, looked
  left and right and, stooping, lifted the waste-paper basket and took out two
  crumpled envelopes. These he smoothed out on the table before him, and
  recognised that the first was in the handwriting of Betty Linstead. It had
  been posted that morning at noon.</p>

  <p>He beckoned Mr. Aldred. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter addressed to Mr.
  Linstead posted this morning, delivered this afternoon. Who opened
  it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man swallowed but said nothing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Linstead opened it,&rdquo; the Orator went on; &ldquo;therefore
  he couldn&rsquo;t have gone to Paris this morning. It arrived this evening,
  didn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

  <p>Confronted with this evidence of the omnipotence of Scotland Yard, the
  butler was dumb.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mr. Linstead gone?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man could only shake his head and make curious sounds. Obviously on
  this matter he was ignorant. He knew Mr. Linstead had one or two little
  places in the country to where he went. Brighton was one favourite haunt,
  Sunningdale another; he had an unpretentious bungalow on the Thames, but the
  butler was not quite sure where, and the Thames, as the Orator remarked
  sardonically, was a rather long river, mainly fringed with bungalows in which
  wealthy and semi-wealthy bachelors spend their week-ends.</p>

  <p>He questioned the other members of the household. They were genuinely
  without information. If there was anybody who was privy to Mr.
  Linstead&rsquo;s movements it was the butler and no other, and he had
  relapsed into a dogged silence, relieved with denials. The man was dismissed,
  and Mr. Rater had a consultation with the bereaved husband.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think the matter is not as serious as you imagine,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;but I shall know better when I have had a talk with this bird.
  Walk round the block for an hour and come back. You understand, of course,
  that I am acting without any authority or warrant, and that I am on a kick in
  the pants to nothing.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>No sooner was the young man gone than the Orator sent for the butler, and
  for the greater part of half an hour questioned and cross-questioned,
  illicitly examined the contents of such drawers as were open, and at least a
  dozen volumes of Mr. Linstead&rsquo;s occult library. In that space of time
  he became acquainted with more devils and gods than he had dreamed existed:
  Het and Seth and Osiris and bull-headed monstrosities that Tutankhamen knew;
  but his principal discovery was in one of the drawers of Mr. Linstead&rsquo;s
  desk.</p>

  <p>By the time Arthur Menden had returned, the Orator had concluded his
  investigations and had formulated an exact theory.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any trouble coming to your young
  lady. I advise you to go home and get a night&rsquo;s sleep. I&rsquo;m going
  to wait here until brother Julian returns.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you know where he&rsquo;s staying?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea, and it doesn&rsquo;t
  matter,&rdquo; he said curtly.</p>

  <p>It was with considerable reluctance that Menden at last took his
  departure, though not to bed: looking out of the window, the Orator saw him
  pacing restlessly up and down the opposite sidewalk.</p>

  <p>It was half-past six o&rsquo;clock when the detective heard a key in the
  hall lock, and, anticipating the butler, whom he pushed back into his room,
  he opened the door.</p>

  <p>Julian Linstead&rsquo;s eyes were so heavy with sleep and weariness that
  he did not observe that it was a stranger standing in the dark hallway, and,
  rushing past him with no word of thanks, he walked quickly into his study. He
  stood for a moment just inside the room, sniffing the unexpected fragrance of
  the cigar which the Orator had been smoking, and then turned to face the
  detective.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why, what&mdash;what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he stammered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; said the Orator, and then Linstead recognised him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Mr. Rater from Scotland Yard?&rdquo; he said, in a
  shrill, almost hysterical voice.</p>

  <p>The Orator nodded. He was a little taken aback by the recognition, for he
  never dreamed he was amongst the famous figures of contemporary history.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is Miss Linstead?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Linstead? My niece?&rdquo; Julian made a heroic attempt to
  appear unconcerned. &ldquo;Good heavens, what has happened to her, and why on
  earth should I know?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is she?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I swear to you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use, Mr. Linstead?&rdquo; The Orator&rsquo;s voice
  was one of infinite weariness. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been sitting up all
  night to have this kind of child&rsquo;s talk handed to me. I know pretty
  well that she&rsquo;s at your bungalow on the Thames, but I don&rsquo;t
  happen to know where your bungalow is situated, though I can find it in half
  an hour after I return to Scotland Yard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man&rsquo;s unshaven face was white and haggard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, and suddenly seemed to grow old.
  &ldquo;Have it your own way: she is there, and she&rsquo;s quite safe and
  well. I took her there last night and got her a woman attendant from a mental
  home to look after her. She won&rsquo;t be hurt, and I hope to be able to
  bring her to reason&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; he went
  on quickly. &ldquo;God forbid that she should be! Only ....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Only you take a great deal too much notice of that bogey friend of
  yours, Professor Hoylash,&rdquo; said the Orator quietly.</p>

  <p>Julian looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re trying to prevent your niece from
  marrying. Well, you&rsquo;ll be interested to know, and apparently she
  hasn&rsquo;t told you, that she&rsquo;s already married.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A look of horror came to Linstead&rsquo;s face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Married?&rdquo; he croaked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Married four months ago,&rdquo; said the Orator.</p>

  <p>He saw the terror in Linstead&rsquo;s face vanish. It was replaced by a
  look of wonder and then of infinite relief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Three months ago?&rdquo; he repeated in a hollow tone. &ldquo;But
  that is impossible&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t impossible,&rdquo; said the Orator.
  &ldquo;Horoscopes are impossible. I have just been examining a couple, and
  putting two and two together. Your Professor Hoylash drew up two horoscopes,
  one of your life and one of your niece&rsquo;s, and he discovered that you
  would die the day she was married. And you&rsquo;re alive.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But she never told me... why should she say she is going to be
  married... in a church... to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a very good reason, I suspect,&rdquo; said the Orator
  drily. &ldquo;A little one but a good one. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if
  there are a couple of heirs to your property in a few months&rsquo;
  time.&rdquo;</p>

     name="story8"></a>VIII. &mdash; THE COUPER BUCKLE</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Apr 1928</h3>

  <p class="first">INSPECTOR RATER had a friend in the Inland Revenue
  Department who was almost as speechless as himself. When the Orator needed
  recreation he and this man used to go on long walking tours together.
  Sometimes it was Rater who remarked in the course of the day that it looked
  like rain and sometimes it was his friend. Occasionally the Inland Revenue
  man expressed the opinion that they had taken the wrong road, but more often
  than not they made no mistake and there was nothing to talk about.</p>

  <p>To Mr. O. Rater this was the ideal holiday. There were, however, happy
  week-ends when he and his untalkative companion sat together on a punt moored
  near a mill stream and silently tempted the taciturn pike.</p>

  <p>A certain Mark Ling, who was a criminal by preference, had a cottage near
  Marlow, and it was his daydream that one day the Orator would overturn the
  punt and be drowned. Mark, a tall, good-looking and always well-dressed man,
  used to lie face downward in the meadowland adjoining his cottage and watch
  the motionless figures for hours on end and picture himself assisting a
  drowning Orator towards eternity with the aid of a sharp-pointed
  boathook.</p>

  <p>Sometimes he had a visitor himself. Steiny Lamb and he had interests in
  common, and had much business to discuss. And between talks about keys and
  windows and the best way of avoiding the Flying Squad, they used to be
  together in the long grass and watch the Orator fishing.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t hear yourself speak with all that
  chattering,&rdquo; he said sardonically. &ldquo;I wonder who is the other
  dummy.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t look like a busy,&rdquo; said Steiny.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Busies don&rsquo;t make friends with busies,&rdquo; said Mark
  libellously; &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t trust one another!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mark had a flat in Soho, in addition to his Marlow cottage. He did not
  belong to the underworld&mdash;and by &lsquo;underworld&rsquo; is meant that
  section of criminal society which lives in a state of semi-starvation for an
  average of three months every year, is riotously affluent for a fortnight,
  and spends the other eight and a half months in prison.</p>

  <p>He made big money and used little men to hide him up. Steiny was such a
  little man. He was also an inquisitive little man.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who done that job in Leicester?&rdquo; he asked on the occasion of
  his visit to Marlow.</p>

  <p>Mark pulled an unpleasant face. The Leicester job was a sore point with
  him. He had been &lsquo;tailing&rsquo; the Couper buckle for the best part of
  a year, and somebody else had got in ahead of him. There were fourteen stones
  in the Couper buckle&mdash;each stone turning the balance at fourteen carats;
  it was one of the pieces that every jeweller and dealer in precious stones
  knew as well as he knew the palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know: the Birmingham mob, I should think,&rdquo; he
  said sourly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s not me! How do they think
  they&rsquo;ll get those stones out of the country? It will be murder for the
  man who tries it!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There were many people in his world who were ignorant of Mark Ling&rsquo;s
  graft. He was something more than a capable burglar: Mark was the cleverest
  &lsquo;disposer&rsquo; in Europe. He could smuggle stolen jewellery in and
  out of the country; he knew every continental fence, could find markets for
  stolen bonds, and within a few days could &lsquo; plant&rsquo; Bank of
  England notes in a dozen foreign cities. His reputation, however, was not of
  the best amongst the people who employed him. Stones and money had a trick of
  disappearing in transit. Sometimes his savage victims accepted his excuse
  that he had to give away a little loot to sweeten the continental
  police&mdash;but they were chary of employing him again.</p>

  <p>Yet in some respects he was a necessity. Postal packets addressed to
  Brussels, Antwerp and Amsterdam are often opened by Customs authorities in
  their search for contraband, and big parcels of ill-gotten wealth had been
  lost from this cause.</p>

  <p>So Mark thrived, for he spoke three languages and understood the tricks of
  travel and Customs evasion better than any other man.</p>

  <p>But once he twisted a little receiver of Newcastle, and that receiver had
  a long memory.</p>

  <p>Scotland Yard was in truth greatly active in this matter of the Couper
  stones&mdash;though you might not think so from an observation of the
  lethargic Orator, dozing over his fishing-rod.</p>

  <p>Steiny, who was a shrimp of a man with a wizened, puckered face, had two
  weaknesses: he was loquacious and inquisitive. He was especially curious
  about a recent and lucrative robbery.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You was in the Burrow Hill job, wasn&rsquo;t you, Mr.
  Ling?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mark turned his cold eyes upon his companion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who told you that lie?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>Steiny was instantly apologetic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know how these things get about. Well, to tell you the truth,
  Mr. Ling, I happened to see you come out of St. Pancras Station the day after
  the &lsquo;bust,&rsquo; and I put two an&rsquo; two
  together&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And made them seven,&rdquo; smiled Mark pleasantly. &ldquo;Well,
  let&rsquo;s talk about this moneychanger&rsquo;s. I can let you have the
  tools and tell you where you can get the car. How many of you will be on the
  job?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Steiny thought that three would be sufficient.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take a fourth out,&rdquo; said Mark.</p>

  <p>For the loan of the necessary impedimenta he frequently
  &lsquo;stood&rsquo; in for profit of &lsquo;jokes&rsquo; in which he himself
  took no part.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t take offence at what I said?&rdquo; Steiny
  was sensitive to atmosphere. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a big man an&rsquo;
  I&rsquo;d like to work with you. I know more people in the game than you.
  Why, I know a &lsquo;fence&rsquo; that I&rsquo;ll bet you never heard of!
  I&rsquo;m the only man who&rsquo;s tumbled him and knows how he
  works....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When I want information from you I&rsquo;ll ask you for it,&rdquo;
  interrupted Mark.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What I mean to say is that I saw you the other
  night&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Steiny.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see a dam&rsquo; sight too much,&rdquo; said Mark, with a smile
  that was not at all genial.</p>

  <p>A week later Steiny, with two others, met near Soho and made their several
  ways to the vicinity of a shop which did rather a brisk business in foreign
  exchanges. It was Saturday evening and the place was closed. Mark&rsquo;s
  plan was to open it, and he and his friends made their way to the rear of the
  premises, which was in a side street. Drawn up by the kerb less than a dozen
  yards away was a motor-van bearing the misleading title &lsquo;Happy Days
  Laundry,&rsquo; but the only linen it contained was that worn by eleven men
  of the Flying Squad.</p>

  <p>There was a bit of a fight&mdash;Steiny&rsquo;s side lost. &ldquo;All
  right, Mr. Rater, it&rsquo;s a cop. How long have you been a
  &lsquo;flyer&rsquo;? Lord love a duck, I can&rsquo;t keep track of some of
  your busies! One day you&rsquo;re respectable, another day you&rsquo;re in
  the Flyin&rsquo; Squad.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater said nothing eloquently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Make it right for me, Mr. Rater,&rdquo; pleaded Steiny. &ldquo;We
  ain&rsquo;t done nothin&rsquo;&mdash;can&rsquo;t you charge me &lsquo;under
  the Act&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator was in an obliging mood. Steiny was charged under the
  Prevention of Crimes Act, which meant a lighter sentence than if he had been
  charged with loitering with intent&mdash;a subtle difference.</p>

  <p>Looking round the court from the vantage place of the dock, Steiny had
  time during the hearing of the evidence to pick out a friend or two. He saw
  Mark, very neatly attired, and with him a pretty girl&mdash;dark, tall,
  infinitely ladylike. Mark was a great finder of pretty girls. He caught
  Steiny&rsquo;s eye and winked. Steiny did not wink back.</p>

  <p>He had heard about Mr. Ling&rsquo;s new &lsquo;find&rsquo;&mdash;Mark was
  inclined to be boastful about his conquests. This, then, was the &lsquo;young
  lady whose father was in a big way of business.&rsquo; Steiny was interested.
  After he had received his &lsquo;drag&rsquo; he saw the Orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who snouted on me, Mr. Rater?&rdquo; he asked, and, when Rater
  shook his head discouragingly: &ldquo;Good-lookin&rsquo; feller, was it? Very
  partial to the gels?&rdquo; And then, in exasperation : &ldquo;Bless my
  heart, Mr. Rater&mdash;I bet you don&rsquo;t even talk in your
  sleep!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not so much lip,&rdquo; said the Orator.</p>

  <p>Now there was only one &lsquo;good-looking fellow&rsquo; in the criminal
  world, and that was Mark Ling. And it was, as the Orator knew, Mark who had
  informed the police about the money-changer&rsquo;s raid. If there was any
  doubt in the inspector&rsquo;s mind as to whether Mark was concerned in the
  theft of the Couper buckle he would have pursued the subject; but
  Mark&rsquo;s alibi was unshakable.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Know anything about those Couper stones, Steiny?&rdquo; he
  asked.</p>

  <p>Steiny shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir. And if I did I wouldn&rsquo;t tell you. Nosin&rsquo; is
  for them that likes it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And then he began to laugh shrilly; he laughed so much that for a moment
  the Orator thought he was hysterical.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, mister.&rdquo; Steiny wiped his eyes.
  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a little joke&mdash;thank you for all you&rsquo;ve
  done for me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Outside the courthouse Mark was strolling westward with his pretty
  companion. She was the daughter of a respectable jeweller named
  Eddering&mdash;Pauline Eddering&mdash;and Mark had made her acquaintance in a
  picture-house, a method of introduction which occasioned her at times
  considerable misgivings.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was dreadful to see that poor man sentenced,&rdquo; she
  said.</p>

  <p>Mark laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s your own fault, my dear; you said you&rsquo;d never seen
  the inside of a police court.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I would never have dreamt of going, only you told me you had to be
  in court. I am a perfect fool about you&mdash;you exercise the strangest
  fascination over me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She occasionally talked like a character in a novelette, but Mark was
  always impressed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When are you going abroad?&rdquo; she asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Next Friday.&rdquo; His answer was very prompt.</p>

  <p>He was leaving on the Thursday&mdash;not being too sure of Steiny. Besides
  which, there was cause for alarm in the fact that twice his lodgings had been
  visited by obvious detectives, who had made too careful enquiries of the
  porter at his flat as to his movements. Mark little bungalow near Marlow
  abandoned.</p>

  <p>She sighed again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish you weren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;On Friday I shall
  sleep over that horrid shop alone. Father is going to Manchester and I hate
  being in the house by myself. Suppose a burglar&mdash;like that man we saw
  sentenced&mdash;came whilst I was asleep. Anybody could open that old safe.
  If daddy would only put the emeralds in the bank I wouldn&rsquo;t feel so
  bad&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She checked herself as though she realised that she was saying too
  much.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I oughtn&rsquo;t to have told you about the emeralds,&rdquo; said
  Pauline penitently; &ldquo;but isn&rsquo;t it ridiculous! Seventeen thousand
  pounds&rsquo; worth of emeralds in a tin-pot safe!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He did not question her; apparently he took little or no interest in the
  information.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A lot of money&mdash;your father must be rich,&rdquo; was all he
  said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Rich! I doubt if daddy is worth a thousand pounds! No, the emeralds
  were left by a Russian lady to be reset. That was two years ago and
  we&rsquo;ve never heard from her since. Daddy said she must have gone back to
  Russia and been murdered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He accompanied her home. This was the second time he had met her father, a
  bent, elderly man, who seemed to take very little interest in his daughter or
  her new friend.</p>

  <p>The shop was a small one but did a fair trade in the cheaper kind of
  jewellery. The safe he now examined for the first time with a professional
  eye was under the counter. It was, as the girl had said, an antiquated
  affair; the sort of safe that any experienced cracksman could open with a
  butter-knife.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trade&rsquo;s as bad as it can be,&rdquo; grumbled Mr. Eddering,
  shaking his head dolefully. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t even sold a wedding-ring
  for a week.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I told Mr. Lewis&rdquo; (this was one of Mark&rsquo;s fancy names)
  &ldquo;about the Russian lady and the emeralds,&rdquo; said Pauline as they
  sat down to tea, whilst the youthful assistant attended to the shop.</p>

  <p>Mr. Eddering rubbed his unshaven chin irritably.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what my legal position is,&rdquo; he said,
  frowning at Mark. &ldquo;Some of my friends say that I ought to advertise
  that the goods will be sold to defray the cost of resetting, but that of
  course is absurd! The bill for the setting is under twenty pounds.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m rather fond of emeralds&mdash;could I see them?&rdquo;
  asked Mark carelessly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Eddering glared at him and shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, sir, you can&rsquo;t see them,&rdquo; he rasped.
  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all wrapped up ready for the lady when she calls. I take
  no risks.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are they insured?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The jeweller&rsquo;s thin lips curled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Am I the sort of man who would not insure them?&rdquo; he
  asked.</p>

  <p>He went into the shop later, leaving Mark and the girl alone.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think daddy is mad,&rdquo; she said helplessly.
  &ldquo;Look.&rdquo; She pointed to the window and to a little courtyard
  behind.</p>

  <p>At the end of the yard was a wall, little more than six feet high.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Anybody could get over that wall and through this window in a
  jiffy,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t even have burglar alarms
  fixed. Sometimes, Mark, I get scared to death; for although daddy has a
  revolver, I&rsquo;m sure he would never dare to use it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He oughtn&rsquo;t to leave you alone,&rdquo; said Mark, shaking his
  head. &ldquo;Who else sleeps in the house with you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was a young housemaid who slept in the basement apparently, and who
  double-locked her door every night; an aged porter who lived in an attic.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course we have a telephone, but that&rsquo;s in this room. What
  on earth should I do if I woke up in the night and heard people
  downstairs?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Open the window and shout,&rdquo; suggested Mark.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have the courage,&rdquo; she shivered. &ldquo;I
  think I should put my head under the bedclothes and wait till they were
  gone!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mark stayed for an hour, and when he came out he had a little shock.
  Standing on the opposite side of the street, apparently interested in nothing
  but the passing traffic, was Cobbett. Cobbett was a C.I.D. man and one of the
  Orator&rsquo;s most trusted assistants.</p>

  <p>Mark walked a dozen paces, hoping that he had escaped observation, and
  then came face to face with Lane, yet another of the Orator&rsquo;s men. This
  time he could not avoid recognition.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hullo, Mark!&rdquo; said Lane cheerfully. &ldquo;Been
  shopping?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The familiarity of the man offended Mark Ling&rsquo;s delicate
  sensibilities. He had never been in the hands of the police, and however much
  suspected he might be, no third-rate busy had the right to address him by his
  Christian name. It was, indeed, time to find a fresh land, where detectives
  were a little more respectful.</p>

  <p>He passed on without a word, and that night went to Marlow, collected such
  of his personal belongings as he had left there and, returning to his flat,
  packed one trunk, which he sent by the porter to a railway cloak-room.</p>

  <p>It had not been his plan to leave England alone, but he had found that
  Miss Pauline Eddering had rather stringent views about the propriety of
  single girls accompanying their gentlemen friends to the Continent. He might
  have persuaded her&mdash;the necessity had passed. Now she could be nothing
  but a cruel embarrassment.</p>

  <p>He saw Pauline the next afternoon and made sure of his ground. His plans
  need not be altered, he discovered with satisfaction. Mr. Eddering was going
  to Manchester not on the Friday but on the Wednesday. This suited Mark
  admirably, for his cabin was already booked for the Thursday.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve decided not to stay in the house on Thursday,&rdquo;
  she said. &ldquo;After the shop&rsquo;s shut up I&rsquo;m going to sleep in
  the house of a friend&mdash;that shop would give me the creeps.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose your father will bring in a night watchman while
  you&rsquo;re away?&rdquo; asked Mark carelessly.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Father&rsquo;s terribly mean&mdash;it&rsquo;s an awful thing to say
  about one&rsquo;s own parent, but there it is. No, he trusts that silly old
  safe.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That night Mark Ling heard the bell ring, and opened the door of his flat
  to meet the one man in the world he did not wish to see.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Can I come in?&rdquo; asked the Orator.</p>

  <p>Mark opened the door a little wider to admit the detective. His first
  inclination was, as soon as his back was turned, to make a bolt for it. He
  had to exercise all his self-control to stop himself taking this step. He
  followed Rater into his dining-room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;All alone?&rdquo; asked the Orator, and, when Mark nodded:
  &ldquo;What about this Couper buckle?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mark grinned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one thing in the world you know, Chief, it is that
  I wasn&rsquo;t in that job. In fact I&rsquo;ve never been in any kind of job.
  Why the police should think I am a criminal I can&rsquo;t for the life of me
  understand. I&rsquo;ve never been in your hands&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Most of the people who have been hung had never been in the hands
  of the police,&rdquo; said the Orator.</p>

  <p>Mark chuckled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not going to hang me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater sat down at the table, opened his notebook and turned the
  leaves.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know you weren&rsquo;t in the Midlands when that burglary was
  committed, but I&rsquo;ve got an idea that you were in on the job. I&rsquo;m
  going to put the matter very straight to you, Ling; I want those stones, and
  I&rsquo;m authorised to pay a big sum of money to get them back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d better offer it to somebody else,&rdquo; said Mark
  cheerfully.</p>

  <p>He could afford to be cheerful&mdash;for once in his life he was suspected
  of a crime of which he was perfectly innocent.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you realise that the fact that you haven&rsquo;t been in
  our hands will not prevent you getting a long stretch if you come our
  way?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; said Mark sarcastically. &ldquo;But if I get a long
  stretch over the Couper diamonds I shall be the victim of police
  persecution!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He felt lighter at heart when the detective had gone than he had before.
  His final preparations for departure were made. On the Thursday night as soon
  as dark fell he made his way to the jeweller&rsquo;s shop. It was shuttered
  and locked; there was no light in any of the rooms upstairs.</p>

  <p>Mark strolled through a back street till he came to the rear of the
  premises. There was nobody in sight; he was over the wall and in the
  courtyard in a few seconds, for he was something of an athlete.</p>

  <p>The back window was easy: he climbed up into the dining-room, still
  redolent with the rank scent of Mr. Eddering&rsquo;s tobacco&mdash;he smoked
  a South African brand which was very pungent.</p>

  <p>The door communicating with the shop was bolted on the inside but
  unlocked. Mark Ling listened at the door which communicated with the living
  part of the house, and turned the handle softly. It was locked, and this was
  all to the good. He used only a small electric torch suspended from a button
  when he tackled the safe, employing an electric drill which he fastened to
  one of the lamp-holders, carefully removing the globes from all the
  others.</p>

  <p>In three-quarters of an hour he had cut out the lock, and a pull brought
  the heavy door open. There were a number of account books, and at the back of
  the safe a small drawer, which was unlocked. Inside this was a flat package
  wrapped in brown paper and heavily sealed. Attached to the string was a
  label:</p>

  <p class="cp"><i>Princess Litiffski&mdash;emeralds for resetting.</i></p>

  <p>Slipping the package in his pocket, he made another brief scrutiny of the
  safe&rsquo;s interior. There was nothing worth taking. The value of the stock
  in the shop was negligible from his point of view.</p>

  <p>He carefully reclosed the safe, disconnected and pocketed his drill, and
  went back the way he had come, bolting the door behind him, and being careful
  to close the window before he dropped into the courtyard below.</p>

  <p>When he reached the main street again he looked at his watch. It was
  twenty to ten. He had chosen his day with great care. There was leaving a
  party of Rotarians on a visit to Brussels. A special train and boat had been
  put on, and when the ten o&rsquo;clock special drew out of Victoria, Mark was
  an austere passenger sitting in the Pullman car eating a frugal supper.</p>

  <p>Even with this big crowd he was careful to take no risks. He found one of
  the porters he usually employed and handed him his bag. At the same time he
  slipped the package from his overcoat.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Put that in your pocket and give it to me when I&rsquo;m on
  board,&rdquo; he said; and his precaution was justified, for he was one of
  the three men stopped at the gangway and taken to a little office and
  searched.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Very sorry, sir,&rdquo; said the detective who conducted the
  inspection. &ldquo;It is part of the regulations that one in every hundred
  passengers must have his pockets examined.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was no such regulation, Mark knew.</p>

  <p>On the lower deck he found his porter in a state of agitation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;They searched your bag, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just
  put it in your cabin.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mark followed the man; the porter slipped the package into his hand.
  Hanging flush with the deck, right opposite where he stood, was one of the
  ship&rsquo;s boats. By reaching out his hand he could touch the gunwale. Mark
  slipped the package gently on to what he knew was one of the side seats of
  the boat before he turned to his cabin.</p>

  <p>A man was waiting for him; he was very urbane, very courteous and very
  pleasantly spoken, obviously Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hope I am not going to inconvenience you, Mr. Ling,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;but my colleague tells me that he has forgotten to search your
  overcoat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His colleague had told him nothing of the sort. Smilingly Mark submitted
  to the search.</p>

  <p>They came to Ostend in the early morning before daybreak, and during the
  four hours they had taken to cross the sea Mark had employed himself well. He
  had discovered a middle-aged passenger who had been very seasick and seemed
  totally uninterested even in the fact that he had reached his destination. To
  him Mark was very helpful, and the passenger gratefully accepted his help in
  gathering his hand baggage together.</p>

  <p>Mark was making his way to the Customs officers&rsquo; bench when he was
  again stopped, this time by two Belgian detectives, who led him to a small
  office and again submitted him to a search. But the package was in the
  sea-sick passenger&rsquo;s ulster pocket, and whilst he was assisting him
  into a cab later, Mark retrieved his precious package.</p>

  <p>He did not take a cab: leaving his bag at the station, he walked along the
  wind-blown quay of Ostend towards a small hotel at the northern end of the
  quay. He had turned the corner on to the deserted front when:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Stick &rsquo;em up!&rdquo; said a voice.</p>

  <p>Out of the darkness a man had appeared, his face hidden by a handkerchief.
  The extended hand held a Browning. Mr. Ling&rsquo;s hands went up.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Get the stuff, Annie,&rdquo; said the hold-up man, and Mark became
  aware of a woman&rsquo;s presence.</p>

  <p>She came nearer to him; her hand dipped into his pocket and took out the
  package....</p>

  <p>Pauline Eddering used a peculiar scent. Mr. Ling sniffed and gasped.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You know me, Ling,&rdquo; said the man with a gun. &ldquo;When I
  was fencing in Newcastle you caught me for three thousand pounds. I had to
  get this stuff away to the Continent, and you were the best
  fellow&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>So far he got when they were suddenly surrounded by a circle of light;
  glaring electric torches focused them. They were within a circle of armed
  policemen.</p>

  <p>Mark heard the catch of the girl&rsquo;s breath, and felt the package
  which had been half drawn from his pocket thrust back again. Before he could
  rid himself of his encumbrance he heard the Orator&rsquo;s voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Got a buckle belonging to somebody, haven&rsquo;t you,
  Mark?&rdquo;</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">In Pentonville Prison, Steiny, who described himself as a
  painter, had ample leisure and opportunity for gossiping. He was gossiping
  now with a fellow sufferer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s him that&rsquo;s just gone into that cell. He&rsquo;s
  going to Wormwood Scrubbs to-morrow.... You&rsquo;ve heard of Mark Ling?
  Clever feller.... Mind you, I could have saved the snouting hound! The minute
  I saw him with that girl I knew he was doomed! I used to fence with her

  <h2><a id="story9"
     name="story9"></a>IX. &mdash; THE CASE OF FREDDIE VANE</h2>

  <h3>First published as "The First Night" in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>,
  Mar 1928</h3>

  <p class="first">INSPECTOR RATER very seldom went to the theatre, and would
  not have been at the Elcho on that tragic night, but for the fact that Johnny
  Crewe, having more money than sense, had gone into theatrical management.</p>

  <p>He knew Johnny&mdash;had known his father before him: but he never saw
  Freddie Vane until it was too late to be introduced to him.</p>

  <p>Johnny was keen on Dian Donald&mdash;a small-part actress&mdash;more often
  a no-part actress, for the ideal understudy very seldom makes an independent
  appearance.</p>

  <p>That was almost a daily saying of Alana Vane. Dian was, most uncannily,
  the double of Alana: the same hair, the same figure, the same voice. Her legs
  were indubitably pretty&mdash;theatrical gossip writers used to call them
  &lsquo;shapely.&rsquo; Johnny Crewe objected, very naturally, to any
  reference to them at all.</p>

  <p>Otherwise he was rather sensible, approved her stage career, had an
  implicit and unshakable faith in her ultimate success, and longed for its
  coming.</p>

  <p>He could have married right away&mdash;he was a very well-off young man,
  even in the days of Alana. But&mdash;Dian must have her chance. Marriage
  would mean the breakdown of the &lsquo;position&rsquo; she had built with
  such labour, and the shutting of the door which seemed at the point of
  yielding.</p>

  <p>Alana used to sneer at this talk of marriage. Dian Donald did not know her
  in the days before she began to grow sour, and the straight lines deepened on
  each side of her face; to Dian she was always the most lovely woman in the
  world, and the public thought so too. The Elcho Theatre was never without its
  queues. She had saved more bad plays and given value to more valueless music
  than any woman on the stage. Her personality was electric, her voice
  glorious. She was one of the few musical comedy actresses that could act. Few
  spoke of her by her surname&mdash;she was &lsquo;Alana,&rsquo; and so her
  name appeared on poster and programme.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Marriage! Humph!&rdquo; She laughed harshly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine
  and it&rsquo;s heartbreaking. You&rsquo;re better off, Dian, as a single
  understudy than as a married star. And you&rsquo;re a good understudy,
  darling. The world&rsquo;s best. If you had the sense of a rabbit,
  you&rsquo;d take the small parts Dowall offers you and get away from me. A
  little know-how, and your name would be in lights and you&rsquo;d be drawing
  down three hundred pounds a week instead of six.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Forsyant is &lsquo;off&rsquo; to-night,&rdquo; said Dian.
  Alana knew this.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;she&rsquo;s dining with Freddie. He said he was going
  to his club to meet a man, but he&rsquo;s dining with Elsa.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Freddie was big and florid, and notoriously gallant. He had been an
  assistant stage director when Alana found him, in a third-class show that she
  had made into a first-class show. His salary had been about on a level with
  Dian&rsquo;s. And then Alana fell in love, and they were married; and after
  that, Freddie did no more work: only took people out to
  dinner&mdash;chorus-girls at first, and then principals, and then the lovely
  Elsa, who was blue-eyed and calculating. All this happened before the big
  break, and it was like Alana that she should play to the very last night of
  the show, should come smiling to the footlights and make her little speech
  before the curtain fell, never to rise upon her again.</p>

  <p>A few people knew the reason. Alana had been the proprietor of the
  theatre, and that she had surrendered her holding to her husband. Fewer were
  aware of that scene in her dressing-room when Freddie had been very
  frank.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you want to quit, quit! When you ask me to give you back your
  shares, you are being childish.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve swindled me!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Alana was trembling&mdash;it was not all fury.</p>

  <p>Freddie, floridly good-looking, a credit to his tailor and valet, could
  laugh at this.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Darling angel! You made over your shares to me, and that&rsquo;s
  that. There is no sense in calling me names. If you divorce me, I&rsquo;m
  willing to make you a fair allowance. If you don&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll stand
  pat.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She pointed to the door, not trusting herself to speak.</p>

  <p>So passed Alana. So came Elsa Forsyant and a new type of performance.
  There was a failure, and another failure, and then a half-success. Freddie
  the florid began to grow streaky lines round his china-blue
  eyes&mdash;Dowall, the old director, grinned sardonically.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the type of show that&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; insisted
  Freddie. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get back the Alana kind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your Alana?&rdquo; sneered Dowall.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Elsa could do it on her head.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Freddie said this defiantly. Mr. Dowall made audible sounds of
  derision.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s on her feet she&rsquo;s got to do it,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;and those kinds of show cost money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>This significantly. He had a pretty shrewd idea that the financial
  position of Freddie and his new wife was not very sound.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You get the show together. I&rsquo;ll find the money.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He might speak with confidence, but he had certain inward doubts. The
  theatre was a heavy responsibility. The first two shows had been financed by
  himself; for the next he secured backing, and he had exhausted that source of
  revenue in his one effort. Still, suckers were born at the rate of one a
  minute.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So Great Heart&rdquo; was born, but the particular sucker that
  Freddie sought did not attach itself to his clumsily baited hook, until one
  day he met a most agreeable young man waiting at the stage door to escort a
  member of the company to dinner....</p>

  <p>The rehearsals of &ldquo;Great Heart&rdquo; remained a bad memory to those
  who took part in them. The &ldquo;book&rdquo; was bad, the music was in the
  main written by a surprising young aristocrat. Dowall said openly that
  Freddie had been paid a considerable sum by the composer for the opportunity.
  The hard-working chorus alone were efficient.</p>

  <p>Elsa insisted upon her lines being altered again and again&mdash;she was
  not very strong on her h&rsquo;s&mdash;and shamelessly took to herself not
  only the best lines but the best songs in the play. She would have no other
  pretty girl in the play. She must be alone, incomparable. She changed the
  leading man twice&mdash;once because he was so tall that he made her look
  short, once because his voice was so good that it drowned her own rather
  feeble notes.</p>

  <p>Sometimes she did not come to rehearsal for days....</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I read the part,&rdquo; said Dian, snatching a hasty tea with
  Johnny in the Palm Court of the Carlton. &ldquo;Oh, Johnny! It is terrible at
  the theatre! Mr. Dowall just sits in the stalls and glowers. And Freddie
  doesn&rsquo;t seem to care much. He was worried last week, but now he
  doesn&rsquo;t trouble to come to rehearsals.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>John Crewe moved uneasily in his chair. He was a fresh-faced and
  youthful-looking man of thirty.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, really!&rdquo; he said, awkwardly. &ldquo;He seemed very
  cheerful about it all when I lunched with him on Monday.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You lunched with Freddie? You didn&rsquo;t tell me! I didn&rsquo;t
  know that you had met him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Johnny was embarrassed.</p>

  <p>He did not think it was the moment to confess that his lunch had cost him
  a lot of money. Freddie had found his sucker. He could change the subject
  more easily because he had a question to ask her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What were you doing in Baker Street this morning?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stared at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t in Baker Street&mdash;why?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was his turn to be astonished.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I saw you&mdash;I was with Joe Carteris&mdash; you passed us in
  a taxi, and when I waved my hand to you, you waved back.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I have not been north of Oxford Street for ever so long. It is
  curious&mdash;one of the girls at the theatre said she saw me in Hyde Park
  last Sunday: and Hyde Park is the last place in the world I would go to on a
  Sunday! If Alana were in England I should know why I had been
  &lsquo;seen.&rsquo; That sort of thing was constantly happening in the old
  days.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where is Alana?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In Chicago&mdash;I had a letter from her a few days ago. Just a
  letter about nothing, asking me to write. She said she was going West, and
  gave me her address in Los Angeles. How Elsa hates her! She wants that
  divorce, and I&rsquo;m sure Alana will never give it to her. The newspapers
  are always referring to Alana and what she did for the Elcho, and what a big
  gap she made when she left London. Elsa was furious with the last
  notices&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid they will be worse this time.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Again Johnny Crewe looked uncomfortable, and she misunderstood the cause
  of his uneasiness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It really doesn&rsquo;t matter. If we &lsquo;flop,&rsquo; we flop!
  And I&rsquo;ll give up my silly dreams and become domesticated.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Johnny drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, without the enthusiasm she expected.</p>

  <p>Then came the last rehearsal.</p>

  <p>The producer sagged back into his chair and wiped his bald forehead. The
  long line of barelegged chorus-girls stared at him anxiously: the little knot
  of principals gathered near the prompt support of the proscenium arch offered
  a languid interest in the forthcoming tirade. They were weary, exhausted. The
  dress-rehearsal lasted from ten o&rsquo;clock on the Sunday morning until
  midnight. And then the chorus had been told to get into their practice
  dresses, and the principals to change. It was now four o&rsquo;clock on a
  very cold Monday morning. The big theatre was like an icehouse, full of
  draughts. Only Mr. Dowall retained any heat in his system.</p>

  <p>He reached for the butt of a cigar he had laid in a long ash-tray attached
  to the back of the seat, lit it, and puffed sourly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a horrible company&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t one of you
  who knows anything about your job, and if you did it wouldn&rsquo;t be worth
  knowing. You girls are just... punk! You know less than you knew the day
  before you came to rehearsal. You won&rsquo;t listen to
  nothin&rsquo;&mdash;you just stand about and chatter like a lot of old
  crows... and we open to morrow! No&mdash;to-night! All right&mdash;you can
  all go home. To-night I want everybody in the theatre at 5.30: chorus,
  principals, everybody. We open, and God help us! If we postponed we&rsquo;d
  be worse. A&rsquo; right!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He waved the company to the devil&mdash;they melted noisily.</p>

  <p>He called his familiar to him. &ldquo;Not a costume that fits, half the
  shoes haven&rsquo;t arrived, the orchestra&rsquo;s a crime and the
  stage-hands the biggest bunch of left-handed bimbos I&rsquo;ve seen since I
  left the fit-ups. Fit-ups! Gawd, they&rsquo;d give points to this mob!
  Twenty-five minutes changing one set! There&rsquo;ll be a riot in the theatre
  to-night!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Dowall was a gloomy man with a deeply lined face. His scowl was
  permanent.</p>

  <p>Two girls came towards him, along the narrow space between the orchestra
  and Row A. Elsa came boldly, with the air and manner of a proprietress, a
  small, supple lady, expensively perfumed, her hands glittering.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Listen, Dowall, I can&rsquo;t open to-night. I&rsquo;ve got no
  voice, and I&rsquo;m simply a bundle of nerves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dian, the understudy, would gladly have missed the interview, but she had
  been commanded to appear.</p>

  <p>Mr. Dowall looked at the leading lady steadily. She was pretty: even her
  worst enemy could not deny the loveliness of regular features and faultless
  complexion. Her figure was sometimes described by ecstatic paragraphists as
  divine&mdash;Mr. Dowall would concede that also.</p>

  <p>But he, of all men, knew the shrew behind those deep blue eyes, knew
  something of the meanness of her soul, and of those red lips of hers.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bundle of nerves, and you&rsquo;re not all you might
  be, Elsa, and you&rsquo;ve got a doctor&rsquo;s certificate tucked away in
  your stocking, and the show opens to-night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He stated the facts calmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you propose we shall do? Postpone for a month, and bring
  the company down to Monte Carlo to give you a chance of rehearsing under
  favourable conditions?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be sarcastic at my expense, Dowall.&rdquo; Her
  voice rose a note.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Shall I tell you something?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The grim-faced producer put his thumbs in his armholes and looked up at
  her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;If you were Alana I&rsquo;d be foaming at the mouth and rolling on
  the floor. Alana matters. You don&rsquo;t matter two rows of pins.
  You&rsquo;ve got a part in the play, and you&rsquo;ll just fill it:
  you&rsquo;ll dance well and sing reasonably; your fans will say
  &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t she wonderful?&rsquo; and the people who don&rsquo;t like
  you will say they like you better when you&rsquo;re doing something else. The
  play&rsquo;s a flop that you couldn&rsquo;t save. She could. When your young
  man changed his lady friend, he lost the best leading woman in the
  world.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was livid with fury.</p>

  <p>Dowall listened to her comments, and yet didn&rsquo;t listen. Dian crept
  away unnoticed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Say it with flowers!&rdquo; snarled Mr. Dowall.</p>

  <p>Freddie was waiting for her in a decidedly cheerful and conciliatory frame
  of mind. He listened without any comment to her shrill tirade...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He insulted me, and you sat there snoring like a pig! I wonder I
  didn&rsquo;t smack his face.... You&rsquo;ll fire Dowall at once,
  Freddie!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>To her surprise, Freddie chuckled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He will be crushed in the general débacle,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>She snapped at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t use foreign words to me! I know
  you&rsquo;re better educated than I am. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I mean I&rsquo;m taking no further risks with the Elcho. I&rsquo;ve
  sublet the theatre, and I&rsquo;ve sold the production.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She switched on the light of the car to see him better.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sold the production?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Lock, stock and barrel, hook, line and sinker!&rdquo; he said,
  almost gaily. &ldquo;The bare cost of the production is eight
  thousand&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have a cheque for twelve in my pocket to-morrow
  night&mdash;and the only contract is an exchange of letters. We&rsquo;ll go
  away to Monte, and we&rsquo;ll be married before we go.&rdquo; She stared at
  him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Married? Has Alana&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Freddie was very pleased with himself. &ldquo;I was married in America:
  you didn&rsquo;t know that, did you? And I have been divorced in America. It
  cost two thousand dollars, but it was worth the money. I had the whole thing
  framed. Alana was served with papers without knowing they were divorce
  papers. You know what a devil she is to process servers. I guess she
  doesn&rsquo;t even know now that I&rsquo;m here. The case was tried in her
  absence and I had a letter this morning from my lawyer saying it was through.
  Am I the clever boy?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;When did this happen?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A month ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She nestled closer to him.</p>

  <p>The Orator came to the theatre on the opening night mentally protesting at
  his own frivolity. A glum-looking Johnny was in the vestibule, for he it was
  who, in a moment of mental aberration, had conceived the bright idea of
  purchasing the show &ldquo;lock, stock and barrel.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took Mr. Rater to the little office that had been placed at his
  disposal by the management, and briefly and very frankly explained the
  situation. The Orator, to whom money was money, listened with a falling
  face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You look as if you&rsquo;re caught,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
  unfortunately I can&rsquo;t arrest him for obtaining money by false
  pretences.&rdquo; Which was almost an oration for the Orator. &ldquo;When is
  this robbery to be committed?&rdquo; he asked, and Johnny explained that the
  deal was to be concluded that night, and the formal signing of the contract
  confirming the terms of the letter.</p>

  <p>He had had, at any rate, the intelligence to consult his solicitor.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; said the Orator, and his sympathy made the
  young man writhe.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It may get through. Dian had a cable from Alana this morning from
  New York, wishing her luck. There&rsquo;s a funny message in it
  too.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He searched his pockets and found the cablegram and handed it to the
  Orator.</p><br>

  <p class="telegram">ALL GOOD LUCK FOR TO-NIGHT STOP DON&rsquo;T FORGET MY OLD
  TRICK OF LEAVING PRIVATE DOOR UNBOLTED STOP THAT IS A SURE LUCK
  BRINGER.</p><br>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s her private door?&rdquo; asked the Orator, and Johnny
  explained that from the dressing-room led a private passage to a door that
  gave on to the street. Alana, in her whimsical way, always had this unlocked
  ready to fly from the theatre if her reception was a bad one.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course she never used it, but I can understand her
  feelings.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator said nothing, but allowed himself to be led to an end seat. He
  also wanted a way of escape if the play was boring.</p>

  <p>In her dressing-room sat Dian, numbed and panic-stricken. She was dressed
  for the first act, had been &lsquo;made up&rsquo; and dressed for an
  hour.</p>

  <p>She gazed hopelessly at inevitable failure. The play was bad, the music,
  the production, everything. To have made her appearance in the middle of a
  successful run... that would have given her a chance.</p>

  <p>She looked round the resplendent dressing-room&mdash;it had been used by
  Elsa.</p>

  <p>The play might run a week, a month perhaps; and it was Johnny&rsquo;s.
  Failure might not ruin him, but it would hurt him badly. This added
  responsibility was disastrous.</p>

  <p>Then she remembered Alana&rsquo;s quaint warning and called her dresser
  into the room. To add to the tiresomeness and confusion of life, her dresser
  had telegraphed to say that she was ill, and a new woman had made her
  appearance&mdash;a brown-faced woman with grey hair drawn back from her
  forehead, her face still further disfigured by a strip of
  sticking-plaster.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My old man gave me that,&rdquo; she explained; but Dian was not in
  the mood to be interested in the domestic infelicities of dressers.</p>

  <p>She was a capable woman, who handled the dresses expeditiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you unlock that outside door, miss? The key&rsquo;s not hanging
  on the &rsquo;ook. Miss Alana always had it unlocked on a first
  night.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dian remembered, and, searching her bag, gave the key to the dresser, who
  disappeared, and, returning soon afterwards, laid the key on the table.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Funny ideas professionals have,&rdquo; she said, in her shrill
  voice. &ldquo;You ought to be able to open that door from the inside, anyway.
  Oh, by the way, miss, somebody sent a bottle of wine for you&mdash;I think it
  must have been Mr. Crewe. He says you must have a drink before you start the
  show.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want a drink,&rdquo; said Dian wearily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Oh, miss, you must. It will cheer you up. And besides, Mr. Crewe
  wants you to.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Without waiting for instructions, she uncorked the bottle and poured the
  fizzing stuff into a glass....</p>

  <p>For half an hour she sat looking straight ahead of her. The call-boy
  knocked at the door and bellowed her name, and she rose and went out with a
  feeling that it was not she who walked so light-heartedly along the dim
  passage that led to the stage.</p>

  <p>Johnny did not reach his box till nearly eight o&rsquo;clock, just before
  the curtain rose, and he was staggered to find the next box occupied by Elsa
  Vane. At least she might have had the decency to keep away that night!</p>

  <p>The programme had been &lsquo;slipped&rsquo; with the information that,
  owing to severe indisposition, Miss Elsa Forsyant would not make her
  appearance; and with this as a text, John Crewe made his way to
  Freddie&rsquo;s box in an endeavour to save something from the wreckage.</p>

  <p>Freddie met him at the door of the box and listened with half-closed
  eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Sorry, old man, but when I sold you the production I didn&rsquo;t
  undertake that Miss Forsyant should appear. She&rsquo;s terribly ill;
  she&rsquo;s only come here to-night so that her fans can see her... the
  doctor thinks it&rsquo;s a complete nervous breakdown and has ordered her
  away to the Riviera. But the show&rsquo;s all right; don&rsquo;t let old
  Dowall rattle you. And that young lady of yours is going to make a big hit,
  believe me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He slapped Johnny on the back, and John Crewe had to exercise a great deal
  of self-restraint to prevent himself slapping back.</p>

  <p>He had hardly reached his seat when the curtain rose.</p>

  <p>The opening was weak. The best producer in the world could have done
  nothing with the artistocrat&rsquo;s music. There was a stir in the theatre;
  the gallery began to cough. Mr. Jevons, the conductor, a nervous man, mopped
  his wet brow and communicated his nervousness to the orchestra. The first
  comedy scene was painfully unfunny. Johnny writhed in his seat. And then,
  with a burst of music&mdash;all the good numbers in the show had been
  imported for Elsa&rsquo;s benefit&mdash;there came Dian.</p>

  <p>There was no doubt about her personal resemblance to Alana. For a moment
  the big house gasped, and then, as it recognised the likeness, it roared a
  welcome. She was a little taken aback by the reception, smiled nervously,
  bowed and began her number.</p>

  <p>It was Alana, with all her vivacity, all her cleverness, all the tricks of
  hand and head: Alana&rsquo;s voice, Alana&rsquo;s twinkling feet. Again and
  again they called her back.</p>

  <p>Crewe looked across to the box where Freddie was sitting. His face was
  white, his mouth wide open. He sat like a man stricken dumb. In some
  mysterious way the play had gathered itself together, as though the very
  presence of the great star added some galvanic quality to its composition
  which it had not possessed until she came on to the stage.</p>

  <p>The first scenes passed like a flash. John saw the audience picking up the
  little slips from the floor and scanning them. Who was Dian Donald? Was it a
  new name by which Alana desired to be known? Had she been reconciled to her
  husband...?</p>

  <p>The third scene was the interior of a shack. Dian made her entrance in the
  costume of a cowboy. There was an exchange of repartee between her and the
  comedian. Suddenly she pulled a long-barrelled automatic from the holster on
  her hip. She had to fire at the comedian, and by a trick his hat was pulled
  from his head. But she did not look at the comedian; she turned and faced the
  box, hesitated a second, then, lifting her pistol, fired, and Freddie fell
  forward limply over the edge of the box.</p>

  <p>In an instant there was a pandemonium; a woman&rsquo;s voice screamed
  shrilly. Before Johnny could reach the box the curtain was down.</p>

  <p>He lifted the man and laid him on his back. He was breathing heavily, and
  one glance told John that the wound was not fatal.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; It was the Orator&rsquo;s voice.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater bent over the prostrate figure and made a quick examination.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How do I get on to the stage?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was an accident,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;She was
  nervous&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;&ldquo; How do I get on to the stage?&rdquo;
  asked the Orator impatiently.</p>

  <p>Crewe led the way down the narrow staircase and through a steel door. The
  stage was in confusion. He saw Dowall, the only cool man in that excited
  crowd.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Miss Donald went to her room and the door&rsquo;s locked,&rdquo; he
  said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Show me the way,&rdquo; said the Orator severely.</p>

  <p>They came to the star&rsquo;s dressing-room, but the door was locked and
  bolted from the inside, and all their repeated rappings on the door did not
  arouse an answer.</p>

  <p>They had no need to send for the stage carpenter. He had followed them
  through the labyrinth of passages leading to the dressing-room, and he had a
  crowbar in his hand.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I thought you might want it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I tried to get
  into the room a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>On the Orator&rsquo;s instructions, he began to break the panel of the
  door. The key was on the inside, and, pushing through his hand, he turned it
  and the door was flung open.</p>

  <p>Dian&rsquo;s dressing-room was empty; on the long table under the mirrors
  and the naked lights there was a jumble of make-up material, an opened
  champagne bottle and two glasses. Three dresses lay on the floor as though
  their wearer had stepped out of them and had left them where they lay. There
  was no sign of Dian.</p>

  <p>Off the dressing-room was a small recess, and, pulling back the velvet
  curtain that hid this, Rater saw a figure lying on the ground with a pillow
  beneath her head.</p>

  <p>It was Dian, and she was sleeping. When the Orator lifted the rug which
  covered her he saw that she was wearing the flimsy dress in which she had
  made her first appearance. He went back to the dressing-table and sniffed at
  the glass, which still held a little wine.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Doped,&rdquo; he said laconically. &ldquo;Better get a doctor.
  Where is the dresser?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But the woman had vanished.</p>

  <p>The carpenter, at his request, showed him the private passage
  communicating with the street. It was behind what looked to be a wardrobe
  door&mdash;a narrow lime-washed corridor which ended in a heavier door.</p>

  <p>Rater pulled at this and it yielded: it was ajar. He stepped into the open
  and found himself in a side street. Snow had fallen during the performance
  and there were wheel tracks newly made.</p>

  <p>By the time he had finished his investigations the doctor had arrived and
  was bringing Dian and the woman to consciousness.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a very fierce dope,&rdquo; he reported.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like the contents of the glass for analysis.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Freddie had been taken to hospital and the great audience had
  dispersed.</p>

  <p>In a fever of anxiety Johnny sat beside the girl, who was still dull and
  heavy from the effect of the drug. The Orator made a brief visit to the
  hospital and came back full of information, and Johnny put his worries into a
  question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not arresting Dian? It was an
  accident&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Orator, &ldquo;she shot to kill.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>John Crewe looked at him in horror.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But that, Rater&mdash;that is a monstrous suggestion. Dian hardly
  knew him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Alana knew him very well indeed,&rdquo; said the Orator grimly.
  &ldquo;Vane played a pretty unpleasant trick on the woman&mdash;divorced her
  when she wasn&rsquo;t looking. Vane is well enough to squeal his troubles
  into a sympathetic ear.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What has happened to the dresser? Have you found her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. And don&rsquo;t expect to. Pretty good actress, Alana. And a
  fast worker. She got from New York to London in four hours, unless the wire
  was sent by a friend. And I suppose she&rsquo;ll get back in two
  hours.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Later Dian told her story, and heard in return of the missing dresser. She
  remembered drinking the wine and no more. Johnny advanced the suggestion that
  the Orator had offered, and she listened gravely.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It comes to this, then, that Mr. Rater gives me the alternative of
  setting the police on Alana or saying that the whole thing was an accident?
  Well, it was an accident. I&rsquo;m through with the theatre.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Johnny was &ldquo;through&rdquo; too&mdash;he had already torn up the
  cheque that should have been in Freddie&rsquo;s pocket.</p>

  <h2><a id="story10"
     name="story10"></a>X. &mdash; THE GUY FROM MEMPHIS</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>, May 1928</h3>

  <p class="first">THERE was a society of men and women who devoted their time
  and their little money to the reformation of the habitual criminal, and every
  Thursday night all the habitual criminals in London who were not wanted by
  the police at that particular moment, or who were not engaged in the exercise
  of their habitual criminality, would assemble in Duvern Hall and be addressed
  by eminent persons, some of whom were quite great novelists. At the committee
  meetings of this reformation society the organisers would congratulate one
  another upon the extraordinary progress they were making, and would detail
  such cases as:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">H&mdash; X&mdash;. A man with 17 convictions, now doing
  honest work with Messrs. B. &amp; C., and quite satisfied with drawing 35s.a
  week....</p><br>

  <p>When it came out in evidence, as it were, that X&mdash; was supplementing
  his 35s. a week with a little private larceny at the expense of the firm
  which employed him, his name was ruled out of the book of grace and he was
  most conveniently forgotten. For this society, like many others, had not
  realised that, of every pound spent in the reformation of the habitual
  criminal, 19s. 10½d. was wasted&mdash;if the other 1½d. were devoted to the
  stamp on a letter telling the gentleman to go to hell his own way.</p>

  <p>Sometimes retired inspectors of police came down and addressed their late
  lawful prey with honeyed words and brotherly love, and the silent and
  watchful audience would afterwards discuss with one another the appearance of
  their old foe.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;...See that diamond stick in his tie? I wonder who he pinched that
  from&mdash;the thievin&rsquo; so-and-so!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Only one or two members of the active force had been induced to take an
  interest in the movement, and Inspector Oliver Rater, with great reluctance,
  consented to &ldquo;say a few words.&rdquo; The night he came to make his
  address the hall was crowded. He had so many personal acquaintances, so many
  people who resented his interference in their business, that it could not be
  otherwise.</p>

  <p>His address was brief.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Some of you fellows make me sick,&rdquo; he began unpromisingly.
  &ldquo;When you say you&rsquo;re trying to get an honest living, you mean
  that between jobs you go round ear-biting the mugs! Two of you tried to catch
  me last week, when you found I was coming to speak in this hall&mdash;thank
  you for the compliment! The majority of you are only really comfortable when
  you&rsquo;re in stir&mdash;you feel at home with the screw. One of you
  fellows&mdash;I&rsquo;m not naming names&mdash;came out of prison last week,
  and the first thing he did was to go round and scrounge a couple of kites! I
  have since found that you have a can in tow. I&rsquo;m warning you! I&rsquo;m
  not praying over you. Not a tear have I shed. I&rsquo;ve only helped one man
  to get a job, and what did he do? He pinched a new suit of clothes from his
  boss and bust a house in Finsbury. He is happier on the Moor. There
  isn&rsquo;t one of you who doesn&rsquo;t say he&rsquo;s being hounded down by
  the police, and none of you that doesn&rsquo;t look upon a policeman as a
  house agent. This is the longest speech I&rsquo;ve ever made in my life. I
  shall certainly see most of you again at the Assizes, and if I don&rsquo;t,
  it will be because I shan&rsquo;t be there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was not a successful address. The committee were horrified. Most of
  them didn&rsquo;t know that &lsquo;stir&rsquo; was prison, that
  &lsquo;ear-biting&rsquo; was borrowing, that a &lsquo;screw&rsquo; was a
  warder, or a &lsquo;kite&rsquo; a cheque, a &lsquo;can&rsquo; a fool, and
  they invariably said &lsquo;burglary&rsquo; where the Orator and his friends
  preferred &lsquo;bust.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>They were so horrified that they wrote to the Chief Commissioner; and the
  Chief Commissioner replied that he had their letter of the 21st and that the
  matter was receiving his attention.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like to have been there when the Orator spoke,&rdquo; he
  said, as he dropped the letter of complaint in the wastepaper basket.
  &ldquo;He has probably used up all his speech for the next two years and we
  shan&rsquo;t get a word out of him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But there was one appreciative hearer. The society had a straw-haired
  typist whose name was Lydia Grayne. She was very pretty and fair and
  competent, and had declined seven separate invitations to have a little
  dinner with members of the committee. There were seven men on the
  committee.</p>

  <p>She came shyly to the Orator as he was leaving the building.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Would you be awfully offended if I asked for your autograph, Mr.
  Rater?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator looked at her with a twinkle in his grey eyes, took the book
  without a word and scribbled his name.</p>

  <p>She was from Canada, she told him; had only been in the country three
  months. Later he heard that she had left her dismal job; but he did not know
  what the new one was until some time had elapsed.</p>

  <p>Scotland Yard at this time had a sort of guest: Captain Martin J. Snell,
  of Philadelphia. Ordinarily, Chief Inspector Rater did not like talkative
  men, but for some reason which was inexplicable he tolerated the garrulity of
  the American&mdash;and not only tolerated it but encouraged the man. This was
  during the period when the Orator was suffering from insomnia. Captain Snell
  was in Europe watching the operation of the criminal law; he had allocated a
  month of time to Scotland Yard and had been shown everything from the Black
  Museum to the Lost Property Office. At night he used to stroll west with Mr.
  Rater, or spend a less energetic evening in the Orator&rsquo;s sitting-room,
  telling tales of strange adventure.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There was a guy down in Memphis named Lew Oberack. This bird was
  the slickest con man that ever talked money...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here the Orator&rsquo;s head would droop. That was why he liked Captain
  Snell: his voice was soporific. Yet, if he had listened to the clever
  American, certain strange happenings in the office of one Dimitri Horopolos
  would have been quite understandable.</p>

  <p>Mr. Horopolos was a Greek and immensely wealthy. He controlled not only an
  extensive trading concern, but his firm were bankers and financial agents,
  and he had a finger in most of the big international flotations.</p>

  <p>A singularly good-looking creature, with his girl&rsquo;s complexion, big
  dark eyes and black silky moustache, he was as singularly vain. He was vain
  of his prowess as an athlete, his riding, his beautiful house in Elman
  Square, and the fascinations he exercised over susceptible womanhood.</p>

  <p>There was once an oblique complaint addressed to Scotland Yard, and Rater
  himself had interviewed the smiling millionaire.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; drawled Dimitri, &ldquo;how absurd! The girl
  threw herself at my head. I did my best to bring her to her senses, and when
  I found I could do nothing with her, I discharged her. A man in my position
  is subject to such charges.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There is no charge,&rdquo; said the Orator briefly.</p>

  <p>Later he interviewed the girl, but without success. The thought of
  publicity terrified her. Her successor left the service of Mr. Dimitri quite
  as hurriedly, and was as reticent about the reason. Mr. Dimitri Horopolos met
  the Orator by accident in Bond Street.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve lost another of my secretaries.&rdquo; he smiled.
  &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know what to do to please them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator was chewing at the end of a cigar. He eyed the gentleman
  unfavourably.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ever tried not doing things that displease them, Mr.
  Horopolos?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>Dimitri was tickled; he had a sense of humour. Moreover, he was rather
  pleased with himself that morning, for at last he had found a pearl amongst
  secretaries, a straw-haired girl with great blue eyes, who had accepted the
  job he offered with alacrity. She was a stranger in London, had no relations,
  no friends at all. She didn&rsquo;t like the idea of living in, but that was
  a difficulty which might be overcome. After all, as Dimitri said to a
  compatriot, you can&rsquo;t expect everything.</p>

  <p>The Orator was well aware that the new secretary had arrived. He had an
  ocular demonstration, for Dimitri, with an audacity worthy of one of his
  classical forebears, sent the girl with a note to Scotland Yard.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">My dear Mr. Rater, I have had so much trouble with my
  previous secretaries that I would like you to approve this one, and pass on
  the warning which I understand it is your practice to give to any pretty girl
  who comes into my employ.</p><br>

  <p>The Orator looked up from the letter to the demure girl sitting on the
  other side of the desk.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, Miss Grayne, they tell me you didn&rsquo;t like reforming
  criminals?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was delighted that he remembered her name.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got such a nice place now, Mr. Rater,&rdquo; she said.
  &ldquo;Mr. Horopolos is so very kind, and so handsome&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never
  seen a better-looking man, have you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not since Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s was burnt down,&rdquo; said the
  Orator in his most offensive manner.</p>

  <p>He hesitated, in face of this letter, to offer any advice whatever. In all
  probability Dimitri had told the girl that he was not popular at Scotland
  Yard, that he had lost certain secretaries. It was even probable... the
  charitable Mr. Rater shook his head and dismissed the idea.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find this Greek a very good fellow for pay,&rdquo; he
  said, &ldquo;but a bit friendly. You can&rsquo;t help that&mdash;nobody can.
  If I were you, I&rsquo;d have office hours and keep &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She was very grateful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how the hours run in this country,&rdquo; she
  said. &ldquo;What time ought one to leave work at night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Just as soon as it&rsquo;s dark,&rdquo; said Mr. Rater.</p>

  <p>That night he sat before his fire listening to Mr. Snell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, this guy Oberack&mdash;the bird I told you about&mdash;lived
  in Memphis...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At this point the Orator&rsquo;s head drooped forward and he slept.</p>

  <p>Dimitri found his new secretary a great improvement on any that he had
  ever possessed. She had a ready sense of humour, was prepared to laugh at
  stories which with the average secretary would not have raised a smile, and
  would certainly have caused acute misgivings in the mind of more commonplace
  young women. She was certainly remarkably able, and rattled through his
  correspondence at an extraordinary speed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My dear, you&rsquo;re both efficient and charming,&rdquo; he said,
  and patted her on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>He always started by patting them on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>She looked up at him with her big blue eyes and smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I shall be very happy here,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My last
  place...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She told him of her unfortunate experience in the office of a middle-aged
  tea man, and of the no less unpleasantness associated with her earlier
  work.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Prisoners&rsquo; reform, eh?&rdquo; He was amused, was Mr. Dimitri,
  who had never been to prison and therefore could never be reformed in a
  proper and official manner. &ldquo;What a bore it must have been for you,
  little girl!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He usually had a big correspondence by the early morning post, and he
  stayed long enough to deal with this before he went to the City. Generally he
  returned about four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon and dealt with such
  letters as had arrived in the course of the day. He had a big house, which he
  had built for himself, and maintained a fairly large staff.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One of these days I&rsquo;ll show you some of my nice
  diamonds,&rdquo; said Dimitri, who was prouder of these treasures than of any
  others he possessed.</p>

  <p>She was thrilled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you keep them in the house?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

  <p>Dimitri smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I keep them under the house,&rdquo; he said, amused by her
  eagerness; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something which will interest you. Six
  attempts have been made to burgle me. Twice the burglars, who were one of the
  cleverest gangs from Paris, succeeded in getting into the house, but if there
  had been two hundred gangs instead of two they couldn&rsquo;t have got into
  my strongroom&mdash;it&rsquo;s the one burglar-proof vault in
  London.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Here he did no more than justice to his marvellous strong-room. It was
  constructed in the basement, a small room of steel and concrete, with a door
  two feet thick. He had in it a system of ventilation. It had served its
  purpose for his father during the war, for it was near to being a perfect
  bomb-proof shelter. It was under construction when the war started, and its
  ventilation, which was an afterthought, had been designed to make the place
  habitable during the hours when German aeroplanes were hovering over
  London.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In fact, it is rather like a little room where one could sleep in
  comfort,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You must see it one day.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had no intention that she should see it one day, or even one evening,
  when he spoke; for this vault of his was most jealously guarded. A
  commissionaire was on duty day and night at the end of the passage leading to
  the underground room.</p>

  <p>He was the most attentive of employers. She had not been working for him a
  week before he insisted upon accompanying her to the door when she left.</p>

  <p>On this particular night he stood in the doorway, watched her trip down
  the steps and turn left. As he did so, he saw a man come out of the shadow of
  a lamp-post and talk to the girl. For a moment she stood, hesitant. He saw
  the man talking earnestly; then suddenly Lydia turned back and came quickly
  towards him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; asked Dimitri.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I think he&rsquo;s a police officer or
  something,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said, her voice tremulous. &ldquo;He told me I
  ought to be very careful about staying late in your house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dimitri, in his fury, brushed her aside and went down to the man. He had a
  clear view of his face&mdash;thin, long, with a dark moustache and bristling
  black eyebrows.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the devil do you mean by speaking to that lady?&rdquo; he
  demanded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a police officer, are you? You can go back to
  Mr. Rater and tell him from me that if I am subjected to any more of this
  treatment I shall make a complaint to Scotland Yard.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He saw the man smile.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who told you I was a police officer?&rdquo; he asked coolly.
  &ldquo;And if I am, what objection is there to my warning a young girl about
  the perils of the street?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was on the tip of the Greek&rsquo;s tongue to be very rude indeed.
  Instead, he mastered his emotion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come in and have a drink,&rdquo; he said, as genially as he
  could.</p>

  <p>The man hesitated for a moment, and seemed a little reluctant. But his
  manner and tone immediately changed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry to give you any annoyance or any trouble, sir,
  and I&rsquo;m not anxious to get in any myself. I have my duty to do...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Come inside,&rdquo; said Dimitri.</p>

  <p>Obediently the man followed him. On the top of the steps they passed the
  girl, whom Dimitri dismissed with a brief good night. He led the way into a
  sumptuously furnished study. The man sat awkwardly on the edge of a chair,
  balancing his hat on his knee.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking you to betray any of your office
  secrets,&rdquo; said Dimitri with a flashing smile as he poured whisky into a
  tumbler and sent soda fizzling after; but if your job is to watch me, I can
  save you a lot of trouble&mdash;I&rsquo;ve no desire to be on bad terms with
  the police. On the other hand, I should prefer to be on good terms with
  them.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man coughed apologetically, reached out for the whisky-and-soda and
  gulped it down.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Duty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Never mind about duty,&rdquo; said Dimitri affably. &ldquo;What
  you&rsquo;ve got to do is to do your duty by yourself. Will you be here every
  day?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The watcher nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Except Sundays,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>Dimitri laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;On Sundays I promise to behave myself.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He took a note-case from his pocket, extracted a crinkling white oblong of
  paper and laid it on the table. The watchful man saw it was for ten
  pounds.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t take that, sir, I couldn&rsquo;t really. I mean, I
  should get into very serious trouble.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trouble!&rdquo; scoffed the Greek. &ldquo;What nonsense! You think
  of nothing but trouble. I suppose that naturally runs in a police
  officer&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He pressed the note upon Mr. Olcott, which, his guest told him, was his
  name, and after a considerable show of reluctance the note was pocketed.</p>

  <p>He saw Olcott again the next night. The man touched his hat to him
  respectfully. On the third night Dimitri again invited him into the
  house.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know exactly what your orders are,&rdquo; he
  said, when he had his visitor sitting behind a large whisky-and-soda. Olcott
  coughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, to tell you the truth, sir, I should get into
  serious&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Trouble, I suppose!&rdquo; snarled Dimitri, who was no longer
  amused. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re likely to get into trouble anyway,
  aren&rsquo;t you? What are your instructions?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>After a while it came out. Olcott&rsquo;s duty was to watch the house
  until the girl left, and to remain for an hour after to report if she
  returned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Suppose she does a little extra work, what happens then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I report to Mr.&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t want to mention
  names&mdash;if she doesn&rsquo;t come out by half-past ten.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Greek&rsquo;s lips curled in a sneer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s about the
  stupidest thing I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All right,
  Olcott&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell you the night you can leave early!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>His friendship with the girl was progressing satisfactorily. She had
  tentatively accepted an invitation to supper at a fashionable restaurant.
  Only Dimitri knew that the venue would be changed at the last minute.</p>

  <p>She certainly displayed some evidence of apprehension when he suggested,
  on the morning of the proposed meal, that she should come back to the house
  at ten.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;A little <i>tête-à-tête</i> supper would be rather jolly,&rdquo; he
  said. &ldquo;We can have it in my suite.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head. This straw-haired girl had suddenly developed a
  weakness for the proprieties, it appeared, for she suggested that she should
  bring a friend with her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a perfectly stupid idea,&rdquo; he smiled.
  &ldquo;Think it over.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She thought it over all day; and during that period the plans were
  adjusted to meet her objections. It was to be a dinner at seven; then a
  supper at nine; then a dinner at half-past eight, with an assurance that he
  would see her home. He agreed to every modification, for the beauty of the
  girl was like none that he had ever known.</p>

  <p>Inspector Rater was at the Yard, and his American friend had installed
  himself in the chair on the opposite side of the desk, had clouded the
  atmosphere with cigar smoke, and had set the Orator&rsquo;s head nodding.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;...Well, this guy in Memphis... smartest con man ever...&rdquo;</p>

  <p>When the Orator woke up he was alone, with no other proof of his
  visitor&rsquo;s presence than the odour of his cigar. It was a messenger who
  had awakened him, and the Orator looked at the unfinished report which the
  arrival of Snell had interrupted, and groaned inwardly, for this document had
  to be before the Chief Constable at eleven o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>

  <p>He was half asleep and only dimly heard the messenger&rsquo;s voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What, boy?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He came about four or five minutes ago, sir. He said this had to go
  to you personally.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator took the crumpled piece of paper from the messenger&rsquo;s
  hand, unfolded it, and smoothed it out. It was a thin sheet, evidently torn
  from a diary, and the message, in a shaky hand, was written in
  pencil.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"><i>For God&rsquo;s sake help me. The Greek has locked me in
  underground room. I came to dinner</i>... (here a few words were
  indecipherable)... <i>Please help me. &mdash; Lydia Grayne</i>.</p><br>

  <p>The Orator was wide awake now. He glanced at the clock: the hands pointed
  to ten. Lydia Grayne and the Greek! No further explanation was needed; as to
  how the message was sent to him, by what agency, he did not even trouble to
  guess. He touched a bell, and then, finding the messenger still in the room,
  sent him in haste to gather a squad. Five minutes later a police tender was
  flying westward. It pulled up with a jerk before the house of Mr. Dimitri
  Horopolos, and the Orator was the first to jump to the pavement.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell twice before an answer came, and to his surprise it was
  Dimitri who eventually opened the door to him. He was wearing a
  dressing-gown; on his face was a scowl, which might have been caused by the
  sudden appearance of Inspector Rater.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he demanded wrathfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I want Lydia Grayne,&rdquo; said the Orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s not here,&rdquo; stormed the man. &ldquo;Your
  damned spy could have told you that!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You can admit me voluntarily or I&rsquo;ll get a search warrant in
  half an hour,&rdquo; said the Orator briefly.</p>

  <p>The man threw open the door and stalked before them up the stairs. He
  paused at the head and snarled back: &ldquo;Shut the door, one of you!&rdquo;
  There were no servants to be seen, a circumstance which struck the Orator as
  curious. He learned afterwards that the servants of this strange
  establishment lived in a separate quarter of the house, which could be
  entirely shut off at its owner&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>

  <p>It was not to his study but to a little room on the first floor that
  Dimitri conducted them. The Orator saw a table laid for two, and on the
  sideboard a variety of cold viands.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now perhaps you&rsquo;ll tell me what you mean by this,
  inspector?&rdquo; said Dimitri loudly.</p>

  <p>The Orator handed the little sheet of paper to his unwilling host. Dimitri
  read and frowned.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a damned lie!&rdquo; he said when he finished.
  &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not here. She was coming, but she didn&rsquo;t turn
  up.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you an underground room?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Greek hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have. I keep most of my valuables there. You don&rsquo;t
  suppose I&rsquo;d shut her away in a safe, do you? The whole thing is
  ridiculous. I tell you she was coming, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I should like to see that underground room,&rdquo; insisted the
  Orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;But I tell you, she hasn&rsquo;t even come tonight. I was expecting
  her; can&rsquo;t you tell from the table nobody&rsquo;s been here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The table is not evidence,&rdquo; said the Orator. &ldquo;I want to
  see your underground room.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man turned purple and white and seemed as if he would explode in his
  fury. Instead, he went into another room, and after a time returned with two
  small keys on a key-chain.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;As you&rsquo;re so darned curious, I&rsquo;ll show you the
  place,&rdquo; he said.</p>

  <p>He went down a narrow flight of stairs, the detective at his heels, along
  a narrow corridor, and stopping before a steel door, inserted first one key
  and then the other. The great door swung backward. He put in his hand and
  turned a switch, and the Orator found himself in a small, dungeon-like
  chamber, illuminated by a bulkhead light in the roof. On small glass shelves
  were deposited hundreds of leather cases.</p>

  <p>But that did not interest him. He saw a chair, a table and a camp-bed. The
  girl was not there.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is there any other room?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course there isn&rsquo;t any other room,&rdquo; snapped Dimitri.
  &ldquo;I tell you she didn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator looked round and for a moment felt foolish. Had he been hoaxed?
  There was no place for a mouse to hide in that room. When he got upstairs to
  the ground floor level, Dimitri&rsquo;s reserve melted. For five minutes he
  stormed in three languages at this disturber of his peace. His voice grew
  shrill with fury; the diamond rings on his hands made scintillating sweeps of
  light as he gesticulated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very fine,&rdquo; said the Orator; &ldquo;but I only
  want to tell you that I&rsquo;m entitled to make this search, and I&rsquo;m
  not sure even now that she isn&rsquo;t on the premises.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Search the house!&rdquo; roared Dimitri.</p>

  <p>It was an invitation which the Orator did not hesitate to accept.</p>

  <p>But nothing was found. He went back to his car a puzzled man, and the door
  slammed on his heels.</p>

  <p>Dimitri went back to his sitting-room, livid with rage; paced up and down;
  was on the point of telephoning through to the servants&rsquo; section to
  order his hidden menials to clear away the supper, when he heard a rat-tat at
  the door. Perhaps it was Lydia. His heart jumped at the thought. He raced
  along the passage and threw open the door. A man was standing there: he
  recognised him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What the hell do you want?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Let me in quick,&rdquo; said Olcott in a low voice.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just left Rater and he&rsquo;s furious with me. Did he
  search your strong-room?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course he searched my strong-room!&rdquo; snapped Dimitri.</p>

  <p>He closed the door, and the two men went back to the small room where the
  table was laid. Mr. Olcott closed the door of this behind him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want? You&rsquo;ve been a lot of use to me! Have
  you seen the girl and headed her off?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Olcott shook his head impatiently.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What I want to know is, Mr. Horopolos, did he take the keys of your
  strong-room away with him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Dimitri.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; The man was very earnest.</p>

  <p>The Greek put his hand in the pocket of his dressing-gown and took out the
  ring with the two little keys.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here they are.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Hand them to me&mdash;and don&rsquo;t move, or I&rsquo;ll blow the
  top of your head off!&rdquo; said Mr. Olcott, and the Browning in his hand
  was very steady, in striking contrast to Dimitri, who nearly swooned with
  horror.</p>

  <p>He was placid enough; allowed himself to be tied up and gagged, before the
  leisurely Mr. Olcott with the keys went down to examine the strongroom.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">When the Orator returned to the Yard he found the talkative
  Mr. Snell sitting in an armchair. The Orator was not in a mood for
  reminiscences. Snell was a wily man in the ways of criminals, and to him he
  told the story.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; said Snell, drawing a deep breath. &ldquo;That sounds
  like that guy at Memphis... the finest con man that ever lived. He used to
  work with his wife&mdash;the prettiest thing you ever saw&mdash;straw-headed,
  blue-eyed. She&rsquo;d find a guy to fall for her, and she always picked a
  bad man. Then this guy from Memphis used to turn up, pretend he was a
  detective and clear out all that was worth clearing. I&rsquo;d like to bet
  that that guy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Before he had finished, the Orator was racing back to the police car. It
  was just driving away when he leapt on to the footboard, and the two
  detectives who were in sight joined him.</p>

  <p>By the time he got to Dimitri, broke in the door and untied him,
  &ldquo;that guy from Memphis&rdquo; was driving with his straw-haired wife
  somewhere east of Marble Arch.</p>

  <h2><a id="story11"
     name="story11"></a>XI. &mdash; THE DETECTIVE WHO TALKED</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>The Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Jul 1928</h3>

  <p class="first">LET me say at first I was never a man for talking, and very
  early on in my police career I learned a lesson which should be taught to all
  young constables: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk at the wrong time or listen to the
  wrong people.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I was rather proud of my brevity in speech, and if anybody had told me
  that I talked too much, I should have been slightly amused. And yet I did
  when I tackled the most interesting case that has ever come my way, the
  Blidfield murder.</p>

  <p>I knew old Angus Blidfield slightly. He was the owner of a big house in
  Bloomsbury Square. He had converted the property into flats, and he himself
  occupied the first floor, that is to say the entrance floor, with his niece,
  Miss Agnes Olford.</p>

  <p>Old Blidfield was a bachelor, a very rich man and rather eccentric. In
  spite of his money he was very mean, and was something of a miser. I did not
  know then that he kept large sums of money in the house, and I suppose only
  about two other people did. His niece knew, though she wasn&rsquo;t aware how
  much money the old man had in that japanned tin box of his which he kept
  under the bed</p>

  <p>She was very pretty, but a rather spiritless little thing, who occupied a
  position in his household which no self-respecting slave would have accepted.
  She did the housework&mdash;they kept no servants&mdash;attended to the old
  man&rsquo;s correspondence, and during his periodical breakdowns in health
  was nurse to him as well.</p>

  <p>I knew his doctor, a young fellow named Lexivell, a very smart young man
  who had a suite of apartments in Gower Street. I got to know him through our
  divisional surgeon being taken ill. We had to get a doctor for something or
  other&mdash;to test a drunk, or something unimportant&mdash;and the station
  sergeant remembered young Lexivell and brought him in.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Now your fortune&rsquo;s made,&rdquo; I told him, when I heard that
  the old man had appointed him a sort of doctor to the household.</p>

  <p>Dr. Lexivell laughed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;He wanted to make me a sort of honorary physician,&rdquo; he said,
  &ldquo;but I very carefully explained to him that I had to live.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I wasn&rsquo;t very much surprised at this, because Mr. Blidfield never
  spent an unnecessary penny. He used to go out every morning with a market bag
  and do his own shopping, going as far as the Edgware Road to save a penny on
  potatoes.</p>

  <p>I don&rsquo;t think there was very much the matter with him, but he was
  something of a crank about his own health, and called the doctor in on the
  slightest provocation. If he had been a paying patient, the hobby would have
  been very acceptable to the doctor, who hadn&rsquo;t a very large practice,
  and who, as I knew, was living up to his income if not beyond.</p>

  <p>One day I heard that the old man was seriously ill, and, meeting Dr.
  Lexivell by accident at the corner of Tottenham Court Road, he told me that
  Angus had &ldquo;developed a heart.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It is nothing very serious, but he will have to look after
  himself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wanted him to get a nurse, but he
  wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. I&rsquo;m not at all pleased with the idea of that
  girl and an old man who may pop off at any moment being together in the flat
  alone.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He was going to tell me something, but stopped himself, and then, changing
  his mind, he said after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation:</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no business of mine, but when I have been there late at
  night I&rsquo;ve always found a couple of men either outside the door or on
  the opposite side of the road watching the house. I saw one of them&mdash;a
  dark, foreign-looking fellow. It&rsquo;s the same two, I&rsquo;m sure. I
  spoke to Mr. Blidfield about it, and to my surprise he knew the house was
  being watched, but immediately turned the subject as though he was not
  anxious to discuss it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Dark, sinister men who watch houses are always interesting to me, and I
  strolled round one afternoon, not expecting, however, to find the watchers on
  duty. As a matter of fact they weren&rsquo;t. I rang the bell of the flat,
  and Miss Olford opened the door to me. Her uncle had gone driving. It was his
  one extravagance. He used to hire a car about twice a week from a local
  garage and be driven into the country.</p>

  <p>Pretty little Miss Olford looked very tired herself. She had been up until
  three o&rsquo;clock that morning.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The doctor says that between eleven and three are the critical
  hours with uncle, and has told me I ought not to go to bed before three. He
  has been bullying uncle to get a nurse, but I don&rsquo;t think he
  will.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is the matter with him?&rdquo; I asked.</p>

  <p>She was very vague, apparently knew nothing except what the doctor had
  told her. I did not mention the dark watchers, because I did not want to
  alarm her. I suggested that she should go to sleep there and then, but she
  shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Uncle may be back at any moment and he will want his tea,&rdquo;
  she said.</p>

  <p>So far as I could gather&mdash;I did not see Mr. Blidfield&mdash;the
  doctor&rsquo;s efforts to procure a nurse were not very successful. Less than
  a week after I called, nurses became unnecessary.</p>

  <p>I was anxious to know all about the two men who were watching the house.
  One of my detectives had seen two people behaving suspiciously in the square
  and had questioned them, but they had given satisfactory account of
  themselves. I called on Mr. Angus Blidfield on the Saturday afternoon, and
  this time had the good luck to find him at home.</p>

  <p>We knew one another slightly, well enough, at any rate, for me to excuse
  my calling to enquire after his health.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s little wrong with me but palpitation,&rdquo; he
  grumbled. &ldquo;That young doctor&rsquo;s out after fees, but he&rsquo;ll
  get nothing from me! He wanted me to get nurses in&mdash;they all work
  together, these medical people, and I&rsquo;ve no doot that he&rsquo;d get a
  commission out of their salary. A pound a day for nurses!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Though he treated his illness lightly, it wasn&rsquo;t difficult to see
  that he was a little uneasy about himself. Not so uneasy, however, that he
  was prepared to spend fabulous sums on nurses.</p>

  <p>It was a Saturday night&mdash;and it was the night I talked too much, so I
  am not likely to forget it. A very unpleasant night it was for the month of
  May. Snow and sleet, which more properly belong to January, was being flung
  by a forty-mile wind in the faces of people who were foolish enough to
  venture into the great open spaces, as the cinema calls them.</p>

  <p>The great open space in question was Bloomsbury Square, and the time was a
  quarter to one in the morning. I was battling along the bleakest stretch of
  the square, my umbrella held before me, though for all the protection it gave
  me I might as well have been without it.</p>

  <p>If I had come into a head-on collision with another man similarly hidden
  (which was quite possible, for the wind was blowing from every direction)
  there would have been no more than an apology on either side. But the fellow
  who barged into me came sideways. The first impression I had was that he had
  been blown off the roof by the force of the wind; my second impression was
  that he had come down a flight of steps leading from one of the houses in the
  square. It was so dark and miserable that I didn&rsquo;t even notice which
  house it was.</p>

  <p>I was surprised by the collision into saying many things that I should not
  have said. I&rsquo;ve got a far-reaching voice, and every word must have been
  heard in spite of the gale. He was cursing, not quite so loudly but
  distinctly, as he searched the pavement for something he had dropped. He
  found it at last, picked it up, fumbled and dropped it again. I heard the
  clang of it and knew that it was a key.</p>

  <p>By this time my anger had evaporated, and the realisation that my remarks
  were somewhat uncalled for came to me. I stooped to aid in the search,
  touched a piece of sodden string, which was suddenly jerked away from me by
  the stranger. Without a word of greeting or farewell, apology or acceptance
  of apology, the man tried to brush past me. Again we collided, this time
  violently. There was a crash, and something fell to the pavement. By the
  light of a street lamp I saw that it was a very shiny silver case, larger
  than a cigar- or cigarette-case. It flew open as it fell and two or three
  tiny and indistinguishable articles fell out. With a curse, the man stooped,
  gathered them together and flew on. I did not see his face, but then, I had
  made no attempt to help him in his search&mdash; though he needed help. One
  hand still grasped the umbrella, which, even as he rose, was blown inside
  out.</p>

  <p>That began and ended the incident. In a few seconds the man had vanished
  into the darkness, and I was on my way to my lodgings.</p>

  <p>I had taken a few paces when I found something attached to the rubber sole
  of my shoe&mdash;a little obstruction that made for awkward walking. Bracing
  myself against a lamp-post, I lifted my sole and drew the thing clear.</p>

  <p>I did not throw it away, because it was not my habit to throw away
  valuable things, but went home, put my find on the mantelpiece, had supper,
  and went to bed. I was just falling asleep when I realised that the man must
  have come from the Blidfield house.</p>

  <p>I was called at half-past five by the telephone, and I learned that Angus
  Blidfield had been murdered. His niece had gone into his room at half-past
  five, at which hour he was invariably awakened, to take him a cup of tea, and
  had found him lying dead on the floor, with terrible injuries to his head.
  These had been inflicted by a life-preserver which the old man kept hanging
  on the rail of his bed as a weapon of defence against burglars.</p>

  <p>A big steel deed-box which he kept under his bed was found to have been
  forced open, and was empty. By the time I arrived, the house was in the
  possession of the police, and the mechanical side of Scotland Yard were
  making the usual search for finger-prints. The room was still a little hazy
  from the smoke of burnt magnesium, for the photographer had just finished his
  work when I came in.</p>

  <p>I found the girl in the dining-room, very white and shaky, but she told
  her story with great clarity.</p>

  <p>This was her story, that the doctor had called at half-past eight the
  previous evening, had seen her uncle and had said that there was no longer
  any necessity for her nightly watch. She could not go to bed before eleven,
  but at that hour, absolutely weary to death, she had gone to bed and was
  instantly asleep. She was awakened by her alarm clock at half-past five, at
  which hour she invariably rose to make a cup of tea for her uncle. It was
  then that she discovered the murder.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You heard nothing in the night?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No sound at all?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hardly heard the alarm
  clock.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I went back to the room where the murder had been committed, and made a
  very careful examination. The window was drawn down from the top about two
  inches, but evidently the intruder or intruders had not come this way.
  Outside the window was a deep, wide area. The door of the flat opening from
  the passage bore no jemmy marks, and the lock, which was a particularly
  complicated one, had not been forced.</p>

  <p>The girl could give me no information about the contents of the black box,
  except that it contained money&mdash;how much, or in what shape it was, she
  could not say. I was questioning her when Dr. Lexivell arrived. At her
  request one of the detectives had telephoned to him, the instrument being in
  the room where the body was lying.</p>

  <p>He and the divisional surgeon arrived simultaneously and made an
  examination of the body, and Lexivell came in to see me.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;This is a bad business. Have you any idea who did it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I shook my head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Not the slightest,&rdquo; I said, and it was then that I had my
  lesson that a still tongue makes a wise head, for I spoke foolishly.
  &ldquo;It was a rotten night,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and I should imagine that
  even the policeman on the beat was not looking for burglars. I personally was
  in bed at midnight.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was one of those foolish lies which even clever people tell, though I
  am not particularly clever. I saw the girl&rsquo;s grave eyes fixed steadily
  on mine, and something in that gaze emphasised my stupidity. I believe women
  have a sixth sense, or perhaps it&rsquo;s only an animal instinct, which
  enables them to penetrate and look into a man&rsquo;s mind. It was the only
  time in my life that I have felt, and probably looked, confused.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you traced the men I spoke to you about?&rdquo; asked the
  doctor.</p>

  <p>To tell the truth, I had forgotten the watchers. My mind was so occupied
  with something more important that I did not give much thought to them even
  at that moment.</p>

  <p>I sent the girl out of the house to a neighbouring hotel, and waited till
  the body was moved before I began an inch by inch search. There was nothing
  in the shape of documentary clues that could give us the slightest help.
  Stuck in the edge of a looking-glass on the old man&rsquo;s dressing chest
  was a card bearing two telephone numbers, one of which was the doctor&rsquo;s
  and the other the local garage from which he hired his car. On his bedside
  table was a white paper, bearing the label of a local chemist, which
  contained a sleeping-draught that he had not opened. I drew the attention of
  Dr. Lexivell to this and he nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I ordered that for him, but he had a great aversion to drugs
  of any kind, and though he promised me he would take it, apparently he did
  not.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Had you ordered a sleeping-draught before?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No. You see I wanted to give this unfortunate girl a good
  night&rsquo;s sleep. There&rsquo;s no doubt that, although his heart was a
  little dicky, it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as he imagined&mdash;in fact, much of it
  was sheer nerves.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He had not, he said, heard from the old man after his visit, and an
  enquiry at the telephone exchange confirmed that no call had been put
  through.</p>

  <p>I saw Miss Olford at the hotel. Her uncle was not aware, she told me, that
  she was in the habit of sitting up half the night. She and the doctor had
  entered into an amiable conspiracy to keep from him the fact that any alarm
  was felt about his condition.</p>

  <p>I asked her a question.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ordinarily, are you a light or a heavy sleeper?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She smiled faintly at this.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am a very light sleeper. The least noise disturbs me. When Uncle
  Angus used to move about in the middle of the night he always woke me up, and
  I think this worried him a little, for he had ideas about young people having
  lots of sleep. He told the doctor, and Dr. Lexivell wanted to treat me for
  insomnia, but I hate drugs of any kind.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>That day I interviewed the lawyer, and discovered that the girl was Angus
  Blidfield&rsquo;s sole heir. She had a brother, a ne&rsquo;er-do-well who
  lived in London and had apparently been in some trouble with the police. It
  was not she but the doctor who told me this.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered if he was the fellow who was always
  hanging about the house.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It wasn&rsquo;t difficult to trace young Olford, but he could give my
  sergeant no other information than that, at the time the murder was
  committed, he was in bed. Such rough-and-ready enquiries as we were able to
  make immediately confirmed this alibi.</p>

  <p>It was one of the most interesting days I have ever spent&mdash;or would
  have been but for that cloudy sort of uncomfortable feeling a man has when he
  realises every other minute how foolish he has been.</p>

  <p>I pushed out two of my best men to pursue enquiries in a certain
  direction. I knew they would take some time to get the information I wanted,
  and that the period of waiting was full of unpleasant possibilities. At nine
  o&rsquo;clock that night I was writing my first report. I do the work that
  requires a great deal of thought in my own flat, which at this time was off
  Guilford Street. My apartment was also on the ground floor, that is to say on
  the street level, and my dining-room overlooked a courtyard at the back of
  the flat, a small, square space which was approached by a door through which
  tradesmen come to deliver their goods. There was a wall about eight feet
  high, easily scalable; but I don&rsquo;t think the gentleman who called upon
  me troubled to climb the wall, because afterwards the door, which was usually
  kept locked after six p.m., was found open.</p>

  <p>It was quite dark, and the rain of the previous night had hardly ceased,
  though it was warmer. I had written about four folio pages when there was a
  startling crash. Something was flung through the window and dropped at my
  feet. If it had fallen under the table out of sight, I should not have been
  alive to-day, but fortunately I saw it. It was a Mills&rsquo; bomb.</p>

  <p>I didn&rsquo;t stop to pick it up and throw it back the way it came,
  because I know enough of Mills&rsquo; bombs to realise that time is the
  essence of the contract. I made one leap for my bedroom and got to the cover
  of the wall before it exploded. But even so I didn&rsquo;t escape altogether,
  for a ricochetting segment of the bomb cut through my boot.</p>

  <p>The noise was terrific. I staggered out into the wrecked room, so dazed
  that I didn&rsquo;t know what I was doing, and not until the fire engines
  arrived was I anything like myself.</p>

  <p>Nobody was killed, thank God, but the flats above and below were partially
  destroyed. The bomb blew a hole in the floor, wrecked every stick of
  furniture there was in the room and gave the newspapers material for a two
  days wonder.</p>

  <p>But to me that bomb spoke a message of four words: &ldquo;You talk too
  much.&rdquo; And I&rsquo;ve never forgotten it.</p>

  <p>I got to Scotland Yard, and about midnight I had my room so full of
  bookmakers, moneylenders, bill discounters, keepers of gambling houses, etc.,
  that I had to open the window to let in the pure air.</p>

  <p>At half-past one in the morning there was an accident in Little Creefield
  Street. Two taxi-cabs collided, there was a smashing of glass and a wild
  hullaballoo raised by a passenger, who had to be lifted out of the cab
  although it wasn&rsquo;t even overturned. A policeman blew a whistle, and
  when Dr. Lexivell put his head out of the window to find out what had
  happened, he learned that the passenger had broken an ankle and had cut his
  face with glass.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come down in a minute,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>

  <p>When he got to the street he found half a dozen men surrounding something
  that lay on the ground. They opened to let him come through&mdash;and then
  grabbed him.</p>

  <p>My Chief thought it was rather a theatrical way of making an arrest, but I
  was justified when we searched the doctor; he had an automatic in his hip
  pocket&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t even put up the safety catch. When I searched
  his room I found a couple of Mills&rsquo; bombs in a locked
  cupboard&mdash;this was just after the war: he had been in the Army and had
  collected quite an armoury of deadly weapons.</p>

  <p>All the precautions we took to arrest him would not have been necessary
  but for my telling him that I was in bed at the moment when, he knew very
  well, he had collided with me in Bloomsbury Square. He had recognised my
  voice, but had been pretty sure I hadn&rsquo;t recognised him, although,
  after he missed the silver end of a hypodermic syringe which he had dropped
  in the collision, and which I had found stuck in my sole, he might have
  supposed I had some clue.</p>

  <p>I saw him after his conviction, and he was perfectly frank about the whole
  affair.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I was broke and in the hands of moneylenders, and desperately
  pushed for &lsquo;ready,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Patients will often
  tell doctors what they will not even confess to their lawyers, and almost the
  first time I met old Blidfield he told me that he kept eight thousand pounds
  in cash in the box under his bed. I don&rsquo;t know why, but probably he was
  dodging taxation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The difficulty was to find an opportunity for robbing him without
  incriminating myself. He was a bit of a hypochondriac, and my first idea was
  to persuade him he was ill, give him drugs, and, whilst he was doped, to help
  myself. Against this there was the fact that he had a niece in the flat and
  that he wouldn&rsquo;t take drugs in any circumstances.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I did persuade him that his niece was looking ill, and that she was
  not getting enough sleep, and he agreed to give me the key of the flat so
  that if he called me at any hour of the night I could come in without
  disturbing the girl. But here again I was met with this difficulty, that
  Agnes Olford was a singularly light sleeper. I tried to treat her, but she
  shared the old man&rsquo;s objection to any kind of sedative. It was an
  inspiration to induce her to sit up until three o&rsquo;clock every morning
  in case the old man wanted her.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;After a week of this I knew there would be no light sleeping on the
  night I made my attempt. It took a lot to persuade the old boy that one
  sleeping-draught would not start him on a career of drug-taking, but I
  thought I had convinced him, and when I called in the evening he told me that
  he would take it. I arrived at the house about half-past twelve. The girl, I
  knew, was so dead sleepy that I had nothing to fear from her. I thought all
  that was necessary would be to open the box at my leisure and get away before
  he woke up. I had planned, by the way, one or two artistic touches to give a
  verisimilitude to the theory of burglary. As it happened, they weren&rsquo;t
  necessary. Blidfield was asleep: I didn&rsquo;t realise that he had not taken
  the drug until I had got the strong box open and heard his voice challenging
  me. There was a little struggle&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The doctor shrugged his
  shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course, I recognised your voice the moment I heard it,&rdquo; he
  went on, &ldquo;but I was hoping that you hadn&rsquo;t recognised me, and
  there would have been no trouble if you had not made it very clear, not only
  that you suspected but that you knew I was the murderer. In your business it
  is a great mistake to talk too much.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>I have never forgotten my lesson.</p>

     name="story12"></a>XII. &mdash; THE FALL OF MR. RATER</h2>

  <h3>First published as "The Orator's Downfall" in <i>The Pall Mall
  Magazine</i>, Jun 1928</h3>

  <p class="first">THE ORATOR was a man who had very few hobbies, and, for so
  up-to-date an individual, he had an almost childish dislike of novelties. His
  wireless set had been given to him by an enthusiastic admirer, or he might
  never have owned such a contraption. As it was, it stood for six months in
  his sitting-room and was never once used. When he did attempt to play with
  it, the batteries were not working, and another six months elapsed before he
  could summon sufficient interest in the strange devil-box to take the
  necessary steps for its repair.</p>

  <p>Gradually he became reconciled to hearing other people talk. Every day he
  studied the programme in the daily newspaper and switched on at such hours as
  would offer him the best opportunity of hearing people talk without there
  occurring any necessity for his reply.</p>

  <p>He avoided music, chamber or otherwise, and concentrated upon those
  improving talks which have driven so many people to dog-racing. Sometimes, he
  would be woken up by the jazz band of the Orpheum Hotel, sometimes he would
  wake naturally. Occasionally&mdash; very occasionally&mdash;he would
  listen-in to dance music, and hear the languid clapping of the dancers, and
  strive vainly to distinguish and give coherence to those indistinct scraps of
  conversation which float from the dancers themselves and are probably caught
  and mangled by some special attachment in the microphone.</p>

  <p>Once he heard a man, evidently a tired business man, discussing his
  favourite topic, which was business, and he heard as plainly as though the
  speaker were in the same room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;... I never believe in letting business accounts slip past. I
  happen to know he&rsquo;s written to us in Glasgow....&rdquo; Here was a
  blur, caused by a woman with a strident laugh. &ldquo;... I ran against the
  beggar in the Strand to-day and I said: &lsquo;Hi! You owe us eight
  shillings!&rsquo; Rather marvellous, remembering, eh? I&rsquo;d only seen him
  once.... No, we don&rsquo;t supply arsenic except to agents....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Now everybody knows about the Angel of the Odd: that if you hear about
  senna pods in the morning from your doctor, you&rsquo;re pretty sure to hear
  the words &lsquo;senna pods&rsquo; in the evening when you&rsquo;re dining
  with your banker; and the Orator, who was a firm believer in the law of
  coincidence, which he had sought vainly to tabulate, was not surprised when
  the next morning brought arsenic to his table in the form of the first report
  issued by the Chief Constable of Wessex, dealing with the Fainer murder.</p>

  <p>It came rather late to Scotland Yard. Mrs. Fainer was in prison, awaiting
  trial. The Orator read the letter slowly, as was his wont.</p><br>

  <p class="quote"><i>&ldquo;...I am not absolutely satisfied that this woman
  is the murderess</i>&rdquo; (wrote the Chief Constable, who, in addition to
  being a good friend of the Orator&rsquo;s, was the shrewdest man that ever
  held such a position), &ldquo;<i>nor am I satisfied that my detectives have
  made as good a job as they might have done. I was rather a fool not to call
  in Scotland Yard before, but if it is in order I would like you to come down,
  even though I am bringing you on a fool&rsquo;s errand, to clear up one or
  two doubts that are in my mind.</i></p><br>

  <p>The Orator carried the letter to his Chief. &ldquo;Business&rdquo; was
  slack that afternoon, and he travelled down to Burntown, and the Chief
  Constable met him at the station.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;The trial&rsquo;s next week, and I don&rsquo;t see what other
  evidence you can secure&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got enough to hang this wretched
  creature&mdash;poor soul!&rdquo; he added inconsistently. &ldquo;Pretty girl,
  Rater... much too good for her husband&mdash;a grousing, whining semi-invalid
  who nagged her from morning till night. By gad, I almost feel that she was
  justified&mdash;if she did it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The dead man Fainer was a well-off merchant who had retired from business
  after he was thirty, and ten years later had married the girl who was now in
  prison. Their life was not a particularly pleasant one; he was a hard man to
  deal with. To all appearance Mrs. Fainer had borne her wretched life without
  complaint. She had one or two friends, the most important of whom was a Mr.
  Alexander Brait, who was an agent representing a number of hardware firms in
  that part of the country. He also conducted a general agency.</p>

  <p>Mr. Brait was highly respected in Burntown; he was the leader of one or
  two local movements for the improvement of the young, he was a good speaker,
  sang in the church choir, was interested in church matters, and had a local
  reputation for good fellowship.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt,&rdquo; said the Chief Constable,
  &ldquo;that Brait was trusted more by Fainer than he trusted anybody. But
  that&rsquo;s quite understandable, because Brait is a very hearty soul with a
  large sense of humour, who could often talk Fainer out of his tantrums, and
  did, I think, make life a little smoother for Mrs. Fainer. The tragic thing
  is that he is the principal witness for the prosecution.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Exactly why is he the principal witness? Did he see the poison
  administered?&rdquo; asked the Orator.</p>

  <p>To his surprise the Chief Constable nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was evidently administered at tea. There were present in the
  room Mr. Fainer, his wife and Brait, who saw the wife pass a plate of cakes
  to the husband, who was afterwards taken ill. He died the next morning, and
  the medical evidence is arsenical poisoning. Brait knew nothing about this
  till next day, and then the poor chap was in a devil of a stew, because that
  afternoon he had met Mrs. Fainer, who had made a most extraordinary request
  to him, namely, that he should secure her some arsenic from the local
  chemist. He was flabbergasted, and, not wishing to offend her, said that he
  could only procure it if he signed the poison book and told the chemist what
  it was for. She seemed perturbed at this and begged him to take no further
  action. He saw her that afternoon at tea, and she made no further
  reference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Was arsenic found in the house?&rdquo; asked the Orator.</p>

  <p>The Chief Constable shook his head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; we&rsquo;ve turned the place upside down, and there&rsquo;s not
  a sign of it, nor have we been able to trace where she bought it. She of
  course denies that she administered poison; she says she saw Brait that day
  at the very place he stated he saw her, which was at Broadway, which is the
  shopping centre, but that she made no reference to arsenic and made no
  request to him. Brait has taken that rather well. He&rsquo;s a sensible man
  and he realises that this unfortunate woman must lie to save her
  life.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How long has Brait been here?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In the town? About five years. He&rsquo;s highly
  respected....&rdquo; He recited again Mr. Alexander Brait&rsquo;s various
  accomplishments.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has she any lover?&rdquo; interrupted the Orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;oh dear, no, nothing like that! Naturally we made the most
  exhaustive enquiries, but found no evidence of that at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator stirred his tea thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see exactly what I can do, unless it is to find the
  place where she got the arsenic.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; said the Chief Constable. &ldquo;That is where our
  fellows have fallen down.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Now the Orator never despised coincidences, and almost his first act was
  to call the head-waiter of the Orpheum Hotel, whom he knew.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Talking about arsenic, were they? Oh, that would be Mr. Langfort
  from Glasgow. He&rsquo;s got a chemical works. He was here last night, and
  he&rsquo;s leaving for Glasgow in the morning. Would you like to speak to
  him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I think I would,&rdquo; said the Orator.</p>

  <p>He had to wait five minutes whilst Mr. Langfort was paged, and after a
  while he was put through, evidently to a private room, and he instantly
  recognised the voice he had heard on the wireless. It took him a few seconds
  to reveal his identity, and apparently he was not without fame, for Langfort
  seemed impressed.</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater explained what was the reason of his call.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said the merchant, when he had finished&mdash;he
  spoke with a very distinct Scottish accent&mdash;&ldquo;fancy your hearing me
  on the wireless! My wife will be very interested in that. Yes, I was talking
  about arsenic. By the way, I shall be grateful if you did not mention the
  fact that I was talking to a lady...&rdquo; Here he got a little
  incoherent.</p>

  <p>The Orator sneered privately and soothed him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It was about a fellow I met on the street yesterday. He came up to
  Glasgow&mdash;a traveller or something for a firm of general
  merchants&mdash;and I happened to see him. He bought a pound of arsenic. I
  can give you the date. My memory is perhaps the most remarkable of my
  assets....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator let him talk about himself for five minutes before he gently
  led him back to the subject of their discussion.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;His name?&rdquo; Here for a moment the wonderful memory failed.
  &ldquo;Grinnet&mdash;he had an office in Bristol, I remember. He did a small
  foreign trade. But the beggar never paid me, and after all these years I
  spotted him when I saw him....&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did he pay?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You bet he paid!&rdquo; said Mr. Langfort triumphantly.</p>

  <p>He was willing to give any item of information. Mr. Rater wanted only one.
  He listened carefully, making notes, without the slightest idea that the
  notes would be of any value to him.</p>

  <p>That night he dined with the Chief Constable and put forward a
  request.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Certainly. You can go into the prison to-morrow. I&rsquo;ll get you
  an order from the Sheriff. I don&rsquo;t suppose she&rsquo;ll want to talk
  about it, and really I feel a scoundrel that I should try to incriminate her
  any further. But perhaps you could talk to her, Rater, and bring her to a
  sense of her responsibility. You might drop a hint that she&rsquo;d be
  helping the cause of justice, and that there&rsquo;s very little chance of
  her escaping sentence, if she told you all she knew.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>At nine o&rsquo;clock the next morning the Orator passed through the black
  doors of Wilsey Prison and was conducted through a hall familiar to him to
  the women&rsquo;s quarters. A door was unlocked and he was ushered into a
  waiting-room. Presently a door at the other end opened and a woman came in.
  She was very pale; her manner and mien were listless, but even so, she had
  dignity and poise and a beauty that is rarely seen.</p>

  <p>The Orator was no sentimentalist. He had seen beautiful women who were
  little less attractive than the deadliest of cobras; but there was something
  about this girl&mdash;whether it was the terrible position in which she found
  herself or whether it was that she carried with her the very manner of
  innocence&mdash;that threw him momentarily off his balance.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I am Detective Inspector Rater from Scotland Yard, Mrs.
  Fainer,&rdquo; he said gently. &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d come and have a
  talk with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes and shook her head wearily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I can tell you, inspector, that I
  haven&rsquo;t told everybody already.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>He came round the table and sat at her side, so that they were not two
  feet apart, and he signalled the attendant to retire to the other end of the
  long room.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Where the poison came from?&rdquo; She shook her head. &ldquo;I
  don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m almost weary of saying that, but I don&rsquo;t.
  And I don&rsquo;t expect you to believe me.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Your trial is next week. Shall you persist in the story you told
  about Mr. Brait?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked up at this.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I never spoke to Mr. Brait about poison. I shall go into the box
  and swear it, but I don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;ll make any
  difference.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why should he say that it was not true?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Now the Orator had an instinct that was almost uncanny. In that shrug, in
  that expression, he read something which she had not intended to tell.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Are you a great friend of Mr. Brait?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;not a great
  friend.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has he ever wanted to be a better friend than he is?&rdquo; asked
  Rater.</p>

  <p>Her headshake was half-hearted.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to discuss it,&rdquo; she said.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has he ever made love to you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him, startled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has he ever made love to you?&rdquo; repeated the Orator.</p>

  <p>The sigh and the headshake came together.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose he did in a way.&rdquo; And then: &ldquo;Who told
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is Mr. Brait like in appearance?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stared at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you seen him?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen nobody except the Chief Constable. I wonder if you
  believe me, Mrs. Fainer, but I really want to help you, and I&rsquo;m not
  trying to trap you into saying something that will hurt you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She looked at him long and fixedly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of
  you, Mr. Rater. They call you the Orator.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A faint smile transfigured the pale face.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking more than usual.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>And, strive as he would against the impulse, the Orator found himself
  going red.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am,&rdquo; he said awkwardly. &ldquo;Will you tell me
  about Mr. Brait?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She hadn&rsquo;t much to tell. There had been one or two uncomfortable
  moments, and he had written her a few letters.</p>

  <p>The Orator knew she was keeping something back, that the uncomfortable
  moments had been very horrible moments for her, and as for the one or two
  letters...</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you keep any of them?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

  <p>Again she hesitated.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. They scared me a little bit, but I wanted to keep them
  in case&mdash;well, my husband believed in Mr. Brait implicitly. And then I
  had a terrible fright. I had put them in a locked box, and I think one day
  when I was out my husband must have opened the box and taken them. They
  weren&rsquo;t there. I don&rsquo;t know why he should have gone to the box at
  all: I only keep stationery and odd scraps of writing-paper there.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did your husband ever talk to you about them?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;One of the servants may have done it. You are sure they were
  stolen&mdash;that they&rsquo;re not there now?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Absolutely. Just before I was arrested I looked. I think the police
  have the box. There&rsquo;s no evidence in it against me.&rdquo; She smiled
  again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What is Brait like?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She described him in a few words.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;In many ways he is a very nice man&mdash;in every way that I know,
  except&mdash;well, what I&rsquo;ve old you. And one really doesn&rsquo;t
  blame a man for falling in love with a woman&mdash;at least, I suppose it was
  love. Very good-looking, fair-haired, much older than he appears, with
  wonderful blue eyes. You&rsquo;ll probably see him.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I shall see him to-night,&rdquo; said Mr. Rater. And then, to her
  obvious surprise, he rose. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I want to ask you any
  more, except about that box where you kept the letters. Was it fastened with
  an ordinary lock?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No; that&rsquo;s the curious thing about it. It had a Yale lock. It
  was given to me on my marriage, and I have the only key. I have kept letters
  there before, one or two scraps of things that I wanted to keep in safety,
  but when I opened it there were no letters at all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why do you keep stationery in it?&rdquo; asked the Orator, and saw
  the colour come to her cheeks.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;My husband hated me writing letters, and he was rather&mdash;mean.
  He used to count the sheets of paper in the stationery rack every morning;
  one had to account for every sheet that was missing and every envelope. It
  sounds ridiculous, doesn&rsquo;t it? So I used to buy stationery in the town
  and keep it hidden. He was always jealous of my keeping up old friendships. I
  used to correspond with girls with whom I was at school. I don&rsquo;t think
  you&rsquo;ll have any difficulty in proving that, though I don&rsquo;t see
  how it helps.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell the police when they arrested you about
  Mr. Brait&rsquo;s love-making?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that would help me very much,&rdquo; she
  said.</p>

  <p>The Orator went out of the prison a changed man. Not for the first time in
  his life he was on the side of the defence; but never before had he felt so
  strongly in favour of an accused person.</p>

  <p>He met Mr. Brait that night, and told him in part of the interview. Mr.
  Brait listened and was unspeakably sad.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wish to God I&rsquo;d never met her that day,&rdquo; he said.
  &ldquo;I very nearly didn&rsquo;t go to the town. It was only a fluke that I
  passed along Broadway and saw her standing outside the chemist&rsquo;s shop.
  I rather like her.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;rather&rsquo;? Do you like her very
  much?&rdquo; asked the Orator bluntly.</p>

  <p>The man flushed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you should ask me that,&rsquo;&rsquo; his
  voice had a note of <i>hauteur</i>. &ldquo;I like her&mdash;she&rsquo;s a
  nice woman. I liked her husband better&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever write letters to her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man smiled.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Has she told you I did? Well, if she did it&rsquo;s rather stupid
  of me to deny it. I have written little notes saying that I was coming up to
  play at picquet with my poor friend, but that is all. Do you suggest there
  are other kinds of letters?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m suggesting nothing, I&rsquo;m asking questions,&rdquo;
  said the Orator in his most unpleasant manner.</p>

  <p>After Brait had gone&mdash;the interview took place in the Chief
  Constable&rsquo;s office late at night&mdash;that high official was a little
  reproachful.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ought to upset Brait: he&rsquo;s a very,
  very decent fellow, a man who wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a fly. What did you think
  of her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;Mrs. Fainer? Wonderful!&rdquo; said the Orator.</p>

  <p>A man who had reached the age of fifty-two years and was still a bachelor
  had no right to think of a prisoner, almost condemned to a shameful death, as
  the Orator thought about Mrs. Fainer when he paced up and down the identical
  pavement on which she had stood when she interviewed Brait.</p>

  <p>Early the next morning he was abroad, and the young detective who had been
  placed at his disposal brought him one or two interesting items of news.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Brait&rsquo;s office-boy has been sacked for smoking in business
  hours. I&rsquo;ve had a chat with him, and he&rsquo;s rather an intelligent
  youth.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I hate intelligent youths,&rdquo; growled the Orator; &ldquo;I like
  &rsquo;em normal!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Yet the intelligence of the youth was put beyond dispute when, at ten
  o&rsquo;clock that night, he came to the lodging of Mr. Rater&rsquo;s
  assistant and brought with him a day-book. Three times during the next day
  the Orator drove to a neighbouring town five miles away, where he could
  telephone without exciting the curiosity of the local exchange. He had
  distance calls put through to St. Helens in Lancashire, he interviewed by the
  same medium a vicar in a small country town in Somerset, and by night there
  was nothing left to unravel but the mystery of the locked box.</p>

  <p>The Chief Constable had it in his store.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It has no value. Mrs. Fainer gave us the key. It has got nothing
  but stationery in it.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Is the stationery still in it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said the officer in surprise.</p>

  <p>Two minutes later the box was on the table before the Orator.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the key.&rdquo; The Chief Constable took it from a
  drawer, and the box was opened.</p>

  <p>There were a dozen sheets of notepaper of varying sizes at the bottom, and
  beneath these half a dozen envelopes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I wonder why she bought two sizes of stationery?&rdquo; mused the
  Orator.</p>

  <p>He took the top three sheets out and laid them on the table. By the side
  of these he put the other sheets, which were larger.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And why did she keep notepaper which is slightly soiled?&rdquo; he
  asked.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How on earth could I know that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Rater indulged in one of his rare smiles.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take all this stationery home if you don&rsquo;t mind.
  To-morrow I&rsquo;m going to London; I shall be back on Sunday. Before I
  leave I want to see the prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>It was a curious interview he had with her. She came into the room with a
  firmer step; her eyes were brighter; there was more of resolution in her slim
  carriage. Yet the reason was far from what he had imagined.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just given up,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m
  preparing for the very easy way out.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking like a fool,&rdquo; growled the Orator, and he
  saw laughter come into her eyes and die again.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You see, Mr. Rater, suppose by some extraordinary fluke the jury
  returned a verdict of not guilty&mdash;I can&rsquo;t imagine their doing so,
  but suppose they were influenced by my lawyer&mdash;and from what I&rsquo;ve
  seen of him I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll be very greatly
  influenced&rdquo;... again that light in her eyes. &ldquo;I have nothing to
  live on. I should be a marked woman, I should have to leave the country. My
  husband left me penniless. His last act when he was dying&mdash;yes, he
  believed I had poisoned him&mdash;was to revoke his will. I simply
  don&rsquo;t want to face life with that terrible burden on me. Really I
  don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any necessity to contemplate facing
  anything.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You could marry again,&rdquo; growled the Orator, without looking
  at her.</p>

  <p>She at any rate looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What a strange man you are, Mr. Rater! You&rsquo;re not a bit like
  the descriptions I&rsquo;ve had of you&mdash;one reads about you in the
  papers, and you are talking, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator rose and cleared his voice.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
  got to face life all right.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She stared at him open-eyed.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean that they will return a verdict of not
  guilty?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Of course I mean that,&rdquo; said Mr. Rater testily.
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure now. You see, the dustman&rsquo;s wife kept the coat
  for patching little Jimmy&rsquo;s pants.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>She thought he was drunk: he could see that unspoken slander in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad,&rdquo; he said, and made his escape
  hurriedly.</p>

  <p>The dustman&rsquo;s wife had been the discovery of the young detective.
  Already a recommendation to headquarters, to appoint that young man to
  Scotland Yard, was on its way.</p>

  <p>The Orator was two days in town, mainly in Whitehall. He came back by the
  six o&rsquo;clock train to Burntown, and the Chief Constable met him on the
  station.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve asked Mr. Brait to come to my office,&rdquo; he said, a
  little shortly.</p>

  <p>Already he regretted his tardy request for assistance from Scotland
  Yard.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And look here, Rater, I don&rsquo;t want this man offended.
  He&rsquo;s been very useful to us, and has given us the fullest possible
  information.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I shall annoy him or not,&rdquo; said
  the Orator, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve made the discovery that you asked me to
  make, and that ought to satisfy you, Chief.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve found where the poison came from?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Orator nodded, but he would say no more until they were in the
  spacious office in the Town Hall which the Chief Constable used as his own.
  There were two other officers in the room when they arrived, and Mr. Brait
  rose with a smile to greet the detective; but the Orator did not take the
  outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>He took up a position before the fireplace.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;How long have you been in this town?&rdquo; he asked without any
  preliminary.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Five years.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Before that you were where?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Mr. Brait told him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You were a general agent in that town too?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The witness nodded.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Were you very much surprised when Mrs. Fainer asked you to buy
  arsenic for her?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; said the other.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never handled arsenic in your life, I
  suppose?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Brait firmly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never bought arsenic from the wholesaler by the pound?
  I am asking this because I have evidence that a packet came to you by
  registered post on the day Mr. Fainer was taken ill. It is entered in your
  book as chemicals, but I have discovered the firm at St. Helens that supplied
  you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>Brait nodded coolly.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I remember now. I bought a pound&mdash;or a half-pound, I&rsquo;m
  not sure which&mdash;and posted it on the same day to a customer of ours in
  Shanghai.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Do you remember the customer?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t for the moment remember,&rdquo; said Brait.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Have you the receipt for the registered package that you sent
  on?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>A little hesitation.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t registered.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the Orator bluntly. &ldquo;You ordered that
  the arsenic should be sent to you registered. Why did you send it on to China
  unregistered?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>There was no reply to this.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What time did you post it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;About one o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; came the unguarded answer, and the
  Orator almost leaped at him.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Ten minutes before you left Mrs. Fainer on the Broadway? You had it
  in your pocket then?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man turned from red to white.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to answer any questions&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he
  began angrily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll answer every question I put to you,&rdquo; said the
  Orator. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t go to the post immediately, did
  you?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;No, I posted it that night,&rdquo; said the other sulkily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;So you had it in your pocket when you went to the Fainers&rsquo; to
  tea? I suggest to you that the packet was broken in your pocket when you came
  back to your house, and that the next day you burnt your coat&mdash;you have
  been unlucky: the dustman who removed the remnants kept a piece or two of the
  pocket, which had not been burnt, and that is impregnated with arsenic. Do
  you know that?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man sat down heavily.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you another thing. You bought arsenic five
  years ago from a firm in Glasgow, and didn&rsquo;t pay until the other day,
  when the owner and manager of the business met you in the Strand. He will
  certainly come down and identify you. In this case the arsenic was sent to
  the town where you came from. You had a general agency business there. That
  was also intended for China, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man did not answer.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Three days after your first wife died.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The man came to his feet with a howl of fury.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What are you suggesting?&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;Why should I
  kill Fainer&mdash;my best friend?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Because you were in love with his wife; because you wrote her
  letters proposing that she should run away with you.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to produce those letters.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll produce them all right. There were three in a little box
  which Mrs. Fainer kept. She thought they&rsquo;d disappeared. It was only the
  ink that disappeared. The man who writes love letters in invisible ink
  deserves more than the gallows you&rsquo;re going to get. Take
  him!&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The Chief Constable leaped to the door to intercept the flying man. For a
  moment Brait stopped, as though uncertain what to do, and then, before the
  Orator could reach him, he had dropped his hand to his pocket.... There was a
  flash and a report, and he dropped to the ground.</p>

  <h3>* * * * *</h3>

  <p class="first">The trial of Mrs. Fainer for the murder of her husband was a
  short one. The Orator, who was something of a driver, took her to London in
  his two-seater, and only once in the course of the journey did he speak. That
  was when they were drawn up at a wide bend of a hill road that overlooked a
  valley through which a river ran. It was here that he became really
  talkative.</p>

  <p>His wife often reminded him of this beginning of his downfall.</p>
