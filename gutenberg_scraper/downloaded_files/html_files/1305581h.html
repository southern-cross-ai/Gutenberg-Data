<h3>PREFACE</h3>
<p><span class="a">The</span> period dealt with in this book lies
for the most part outside what has been well termed the Age of
Great Discoveries, and has in consequence met with less
attention, perhaps, than it deserves. While the main episodes
have formed the theme of many and competent writers, few attempts
have been made to present such a connected view of the whole
course of Geographical Discovery within the limits here adopted
as might bring out the precise position occupied by each separate
achievement in relation to the general advance of knowledge. It
is this task which has been attempted in the present volume. The
reasons which give a certain unity to the period are discussed in
the following pages, but it may be briefly characterised here as
that in which, after the decline of Spain and Portugal, the main
outlines of the World-map were completed by their successors
among the nations of Europe.</p>
<p>In dealing with so wide a field, both as regards time and
space, the arrangement of the subject-matter presents
considerable difficulties. To take the major portions of the
world in turn, and trace the course of discovery for each from
beginning to end, would, it was thought, lose much by failing to
bring out what may be called the general perspective of the
story. Successive periods were marked by more or less definite
characteristics all the world over, and both the aims and methods
of discoverers changed with the times. On the other hand a strict
chronological arrangement of the whole material would have its
own disadvantages, and a compromise between the two methods
seemed to offer the only suitable solution. For each part of the
world the whole epoch has therefore been broken up into periods,
possessing a general unity in themselves, and sufficiently
prolonged to escape the drawback of frequent interruptions of the
story.</p>
<p>Whilst original sources of information have been consulted as
far as possible, it is obvious, in view of the extent of the
field, that this could not be done universally, in a text-book
that does not, primarily at least, profess to present the results
of original research. The contributions of so many previous
workers in the field have been drawn upon that it is impossible
to acknowledge the indebtedness in each separate case; more
especially as the narrative is based on notes collected during a
long series of years. A few of the more particular obligations
must however find expression. Of earlier dates, works like
Burney's classical collection of South Sea voyages, Southey's
<i>History of Brazil</i>, Müller's and Coxe's accounts of Russian
North-East voyages, and Barrow's <i>History of Voyages into the
Arctic Regions</i>, have of course been consulted; while, of more
recent times, Markham's <i>Threshold of the Unknown Region</i>,
Ravenstein's <i>Russians on the Amur</i>, Parkman's and Winsor's
historical works on North America, and Theal's on South Africa,
Bryce's <i>History of the Hudson Bay Company</i>, Burpee's
<i>Search for the Western Sea</i>, Conway's <i>No Man's Land</i>,
Nordenskiöld's <i>Voyage of the Vega</i>, and many others, have
furnished useful indications. The publications of the Hakluyt
Society, with the valuable introductions supplied by the several
editors, have also been an important source of information.</p>
<p>As regards the illustrations, special thanks are due to Mr
Kitson, and his publisher Mr Murray, for permission to utilise
the chart of Captain Cook's routes, and the portrait of the
navigator, given in the former's <i>Captain James Cook</i> (which
appeared, unfortunately, after the chapter dealing with Cook's
voyages was written); to Sir Martin Conway for similar permission
to use the reproduction of the Muscovy Company's Map of
Spitsbergen given in his <i>No Man's Land</i>; and to Mr H.N.
Stevens for supplying gratuitously for reproduction a facsimile
of Foxe's Arctic Map. To Mr Addison, draughtsman to the Royal
Geographical Society, I am indebted both for the actual drawing
of the chart of Cook's routes, and also for useful advice in
regard to the preparation of the other hand-drawn maps, for which
I am myself responsible.</p>
<p>The Index has been made as complete as possible in the hope
that it may serve as a guide, not only to the contents of the
book, but also to sources of further information. Thus even where
mere mention of a place is made in the present work, it is felt
that the reference may be of use to students desirous of tracing
the fortunes of such a place, or the course of European
intercourse with it, in the narratives of the travellers
themselves.</p>
<p>In deference to modern usage, such forms as Hudson'<i>s</i>
Bay, the Strait<i>s</i> of Magellan, have been discarded, though
at a certain expense of picturesqueness, and, in the second case,
even of strict accuracy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, my warmest thanks are due to the Editor of the
series, Dr F.H.H. Guillemard, not only for the great interest he
has taken in the book from the outset, but for his unstinted aid
in proof-reading, and for his many valuable suggestions, which
have eliminated not a few inaccuracies.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p><span class="a">The</span> closing years of the sixteenth
century formed an important turning-point in the history of the
world, and, as a natural consequence, in the more special field
of geographical discovery also. A hundred years had elapsed since
the great events which gave to the latter end of the fifteenth
century its unique influence on the story of the
nations&mdash;the discovery of America, and the first voyage to
India round the Cape of Good Hope. During that interval Spain and
Portugal, the pioneers in the new movement towards world-wide
empire and commerce, had attained a degree of expansion unknown
since the days of the Roman Empire, and, in virtue of the famous
Bull of Pope Alexander VI, had practically divided the
extra-European world between them. Fleet after fleet had been
despatched from their shores, straining to the utmost the too
scanty resources of the two nations, reinforced though they were
by the riches of Peru, and the spices and other valuable
commodities of the East. Meanwhile, other nations were standing
forth as possible rivals, and the arrogant claims of Spain and
Portugal to exclude all others from the world's commerce did but
hasten the downfall of their supremacy.</p>
<p>In the hope of securing a share in the East Indian trade the
English long expended their energies on fruitless efforts to open
a route by the frozen North, though the bold exploits of Drake
and others brought them into actual collision with Spain on the
ground claimed by her as her exclusive property. Private
adventurers also made their way to the East, but it was not until
the nautical supremacy of Spain had been broken in 1588 by the
defeat of the "Invincible Armada", that the equal rights of all
to the use of the maritime highways were vindicated. It was,
however, not the English, but the Dutch who were the first to
avail themselves of the new opportunities. After the voyages of
the Portuguese had made Lisbon the chief entrepot of the valuable
Indian trade, Antwerp and Amsterdam rose to importance as centres
of distribution of Indian goods over Northern Europe. Rendered
desperate by Spanish oppression, the seven northern provinces of
the Netherlands in 1580 declared their independence, and in
retaliation Philip II, under whom the whole dominions of Spain
and Portugal were then united, took the short-sighted step of
forbidding the Amsterdam merchants to trade with Lisbon.
Threatened with ruin, they were of necessity driven to more
determined efforts to obtain an independent trade with the East,
and though they too, for a time, made the mistake of searching
for a northern route, they soon boldly resolved to enter into
open competition with the Portuguese, and in 1595-96 the first
Dutch fleet sailed for India. An English expedition had, it is
true, made its way to the East in 1591, but it proved
unsuccessful, and it was not until 1599 that systematic steps for
a direct trade with India were taken by the formation of the
English East India Company.</p>
<p>With the change thus brought about in the distribution of
material power among the nations of Europe, it was natural that
geographical discovery should also in future follow a different
course. Whereas the great discoveries of the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries had been almost entirely the work of Spain
and Portugal, with the beginning of the seventeenth the energies
of both nations became suddenly paralysed, and after the first
decade of the new century no more great navigators set sail from
their shores. Their place was taken by the Dutch, French, and
English; the Dutch especially&mdash;who, as already stated, had
gained a start on the English in the matter of Eastern
trade&mdash;leading the way, during the early part of the new
period, in the path of maritime discovery. But although the
French lagged somewhat behind, as compared with the Dutch and
English, in the prosecution of Eastern enterprises, they were
destined to play an important part in the exploration of the New
World, especially in North America, to which their view had been
directed from an early period, even in the sixteenth century. By
a curious coincidence the Russians were simultaneously entering
upon a new period of activity in the broad regions of northern
Asia. It was to these four nations therefore that the principal
work in completing the geographical picture of the world in its
broad outlines was now to fall.</p>
<p>Before proceeding to describe the course of discovery under
the new order of things, it will be well to take a rapid survey
of the state of knowledge of the globe existing at the close of
the sixteenth century, and of the ideas which then prevailed
respecting the still unknown portions.</p>
<p>As regards the knowledge of the general distribution of land
and water, a marked improvement had taken place during the latter
half of the century. America, after the voyage of Magellan across
the Pacific, had slowly taken its fitting place as an independent
division of the land, being now regarded neither as an insular
mass of comparatively small area, as had been supposed by the
mapmakers of the opening years of the century, nor as stretching
across the North Pacific in a comparatively low latitude to join
the eastern parts of Asia, as had been shown on maps dating from
the middle of the century. The idea of a narrow strait separating
the two continents in the far north was already gaining ground,
though based apparently on a quite insufficient foundation.</p>
<p>Much less had been done to clear up the uncertainties
respecting the supposed Great Southern Continent, which had from
very early times appealed to the imagination of philosophers, and
the investigation of which was the most important piece of
geographical work remaining to be done. Even before the voyage of
Magellan, geographers had a strong belief in the existence of
land beyond the southern ocean, and this was greatly strengthened
by the passage of that navigator through the strait which bears
his name, as it was naturally imagined that the land to the south
of the strait formed part of a great continental mass. Whether or
not the ancient and medieval geographers had to any extent based
their ideas on vague rumours of Australia which may have reached
the countries of southern Asia, is a question which cannot be
answered; but it has been held with some show of reason that
statements of Marco Polo, Varthema, and other travellers, point
to a knowledge that an extensive land did lie to the south of the
Malay Archipelago. It is an almost equally difficult matter, and
one which concerns our present subject more nearly, to decide
whether the indications of a continental land immediately to the
south of the Archipelago, to be found in maps of the sixteenth
century, were based at all on actual voyages of European
navigators. The influence of the writings of former travellers
and investigators is still seen in many of these maps. Thus the
term "Regio Patalis", which occurs on many of the earlier maps as
the designation of a southern land, is known to have been
borrowed from early writers. In the maps of the Flemish school of
cartographers&mdash;Ortelius, Mercator, and others&mdash;a
continental land is vaguely shown, but the details respecting it
are merely borrowed from Marco Polo. A special point, however,
about these maps is that New Guinea is correctly shown as an
island separated by a narrow strait from the main mass of land,
although it is stated in one at least that their relation was
still uncertain.</p>
<p>An apparently stronger argument for the view that Australia
had been reached during the first half of the century is supplied
by a series of manuscript maps by a French school of
cartographers (of which the best known representative was Pierre
Desceliers), the earliest possibly dating from 1530. They all
show, immediately to the south of Java, and separated from it
only by a narrow channel, a vast land bearing the name Jave la
grande. The details inserted on the coast line, though fairly
full, are of little use for purposes of identification; but from
some slight resemblance of the contours to those of Australia,
and from the vast size of the land portrayed, it has been held
that the maps in question prove that an actual discovery had been
made.</p>
<p>The unsupported evidence of these maps&mdash;which in other
outlying parts of the world contain many hypothetical
details&mdash;can, however, be hardly said to justify any
positive conclusion, and it may even be possible that some rough
sketch of Java (then commonly known by Polo's designation "Java
major") may have been used to supply the outline and terminology
of the supposed continental land.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> However
this may be, it is certain that such a discovery was not
generally known, and we may consider that to all intents and
purposes the work of exploration in this direction had to start
from the beginning in the period with which we have to deal.
Elsewhere, though vast tracts remained a blank on the maps, the
work of discovery did not set out, at the beginning of the
seventeenth century, with quite such a clear field. We will take
the various quarters of the globe in order, and note briefly the
extent of knowledge possessed at the time with respect to each,
and the chief tasks still to be accomplished.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The recently discovered Carta Marina of
Waldseemüller (1516) has a representation of Java which may be
regarded as a first step towards the Great Java of the French
maps.]</p>
<p>The <i>ex</i>tensive exploration of Europe may be said to have
been completed by the close of the sixteenth century. Such
fantastic forms as had been given to the northern parts of the
continent, including the British Islands, in maps of the early
part of the century, and even in the famous map of Olaus Magnus
of 1539 (though this showed a great improvement on its
predecessors), had given place to more correct outlines, thanks
principally to the English voyages of Willoughby, Chancellor,
Burroughs and others, and the Dutch voyages of Nai, Tetgales, and
Barents in 1594-96. The copies of Barents' own map, published at
Amsterdam in 1599 and 1611, show well the advance that had been
made in the previous half-century (see p. 26). Russia too, though
still imperfectly known to the rest of Europe, had been rescued
from the obscurity hitherto enveloping it by the work of Von
Herberstein (1549), as well as by the travels of Giles Fletcher,
Queen Elizabeth's ambassador to the Czar (1588), and of Anthony
Jenkinson and other agents of the British Muscovy Company.</p>
<p>The knowledge of Asia attained before the end of the sixteenth
century may be considered under three heads. Firstly, that
acquired by medieval travellers before the voyage of Vasco da
Gama; secondly, that due to the voyages of the Portuguese and
others by the sea route to India; and thirdly, the somewhat vague
information respecting northern Asia acquired by Russian and
Finnish merchants and voyagers during the course of the century.
The first of these sources had supplied more or less detailed
information respecting the whole of Asia south of Siberia, but
the absence of accurate maps or scientific description caused
much confusion of ideas with respect to it. For the southern and
south-eastern countries, especially the coast-lines, this
information was now superseded by the results of recent voyages,
though, as we have seen, the statements of the early travellers
continued to exercise a powerful influence with map-makers and
cosmographers in Europe, if not with the voyagers themselves. For
the whole of Central Asia, however, as well as the interior of
China, the writings of Friar Odoric, Willem de Rubruk, Marco
Polo, and the early missionary friars, remained the only sources
of knowledge, and could at best present a most imperfect picture
of those vast regions. In the south and east the Portuguese
voyages (recorded in the history of De Barros and the poems of
Camoens) had before the close of the sixteenth century re-opened
to the world a knowledge of the whole coast-line as far as the
north of China and the Japanese islands. The greater part of the
Malay Archipelago had become well known, including the northern
coasts of New Guinea: but whether the southern coast of the great
island had been explored is uncertain, the statement by Wytfliet
that a strait existed between it and a land to the south being
possibly based only on Mercator's theoretical representation.
Some information had also been supplied regarding the various
kingdoms of India and Indo-China by the travels of Duarte
Barbosa, Caesar Frederik, Gasparo Balbi, Ralph Fitch, Jan Huyghen
van Linschoten, and others, some of these having reached India
overland, and thus contributed to a better knowledge of the
countries of western Asia. The extensive travels of Fernão Mendez
Pinto, though not published till the beginning of the next
century, were carried out during the sixteenth, and, in spite of
much exaggeration on the part of the traveller, threw
considerable light on the state of the East in his time. Lastly,
in Northern Asia, the newly awakened enterprise of Russian and
other merchants had begun to make known the western parts of
Siberia, including the coasts of the Arctic Ocean as far as the
mouth of the Yenesei. The state of knowledge of this region at
the beginning of the new century is shown by the map by Isaac
Massa published in Holland in 1612. But the great advance of
fur-hunters and of others across the wilds of Siberia was only
just beginning, and the discovery and conquest of that vast
region belongs almost entirely to the period dealt with in the
following pages.</p>
<p>In Africa, the end of the sixteenth century marks the close of
a period of activity, to be followed by nearly two centuries of
stagnation, so far as geographical discovery is concerned. The
entire coasts were of course known, and in places, such as Benin,
the acquaintance with the lands immediately in their rear was
closer than was the case in our own times until quite recent
years. There is no doubt, too, that some knowledge of the
interior was possessed by the Portuguese at the time we are
treating of, though to determine exactly the extent of that
knowledge is a task of great difficulty, if not impossible, with
the limited material we now possess. From the fact that maps of
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries show the African interior
filled in with lakes and rivers such as are now known to exist
there, it has even been imagined that the Portuguese of those
days possessed an intimate knowledge of Central African
geography, rivalling that due to the explorers of the nineteenth
century. It is necessary briefly to examine the basis of this
idea, which we shall find a very unsubstantial one. The earlier
cartographers of the sixteenth century (Waldseemüller, Ribeiro,
and others) merely followed Ptolemy's account, and made the Nile
rise from two or more lakes lying east and west a long way south
of the Equator. In course of time, however, the vague information
gleaned by the Portuguese on the east and west coasts seems to
have been combined with the older conjectural geography. From
Congo and Angola on the west, and Mozambique, Sofala, and
Abyssinia on the east, rumours of lakes and empires reached the
ears of travellers, and when these were put down on the maps with
considerable exaggeration of distances, the whole interior became
filled with detail, and names heard of from the opposite ends of
the continent became confusedly mixed in the centre of it. The
maps of Mercator (1541 and 1569), Gastaldi (1548), Ramusio
(1550), and Ortelius (1570) are among the earliest examples of
this type, all showing the Nile as rising from two great lakes
lying east and west, south of the Equator. The well-known map of
Filippo Pigafetta (1591), based on the accounts of Duarte Lopez,
was evidently evolved in much the same way, though the lakes
there appear north and south of each other. In all these maps the
greater part of the geography represented is unmistakably
Abyssinian (see sketches on p. 150).</p>
<p>In other quarters the knowledge of the Portuguese was probably
confined to the districts closely adjoining their colonies of
Angola, Mozambique, and Sofala. Behind the two last named,
expeditions had been pushed to a considerable distance, and
Portuguese envoys had reached the country of the celebrated chief
known as the Monomotapa, south of the central Zambezi. The power
of this potentate became greatly exaggerated and he was supposed
to rule over an empire equal to those of Asiatic monarchs. The
Portuguese writers were acquainted with the famous ruins at
Zimbabwe, which place the Jesuit priests are even supposed to
have visited; but this appears doubtful, as the name Zimbabwe was
then applied to the residence of any important chief. The
gold-producing region of Manica had certainly been visited before
the end of the sixteenth century, and ruined forts now existing
prove that the Portuguese occupation extended to the Inyaga
country, a little further north, and was not confined to the
Zambezi valley. On that river itself their knowledge seems to
have extended about to the site of the present post of Zumbo, at
the confluence of the Loangwa.</p>
<p>In South America, discovery had made vast strides during the
century following the first arrival of white men. Within the
first 50 years the whole contour of the coasts had been brought
to light, though as the passage round Cape Horn had not been made
before the close of the century it was still supposed by some
that Tierra del Fuego formed part of a great southern continent.
Before the new century began, the range of the Andes, with the
important empires occupying its broad uplands, had been made
known by the conquests of the great Spanish captains, while
explorers of the same nation had also traced the general courses
of the three largest rivers of the continent. By the voyage of
Orellana in 1540-41, followed twenty years later by that of the
tyrant Aguirre, almost the whole of the course of the Amazon had
been laid down. In the system of the Plata the Spanish governors
Mendoza and Alvar Nuñez had ascended the Paraguay, penetrating
almost to the frontiers of Peru, besides forcing a way from the
coast to the upper Paraná. Of the Orinoco, the shortest of the
three, less had been explored, as the cataract of Atures had
turned back more than one adventurous voyager. Its western
tributary, the Meta, had, however, been ascended for some
distance, and the wide plains at the eastern foot of the Andes of
New Granada, about which our information is even at the present
day far from perfect, had been traversed again and again by
searchers after the fabulous city of "El Dorado"&mdash;the Golden
Monarch. These included German adventurers like Georg von Speier,
Nicholas Federmann, and Philip von Huten, as well as Spanish
captains like Hernan Perez de Quesada and Antonio de Berrio.
Under the latter the site of the city changed its locality, and
the southern tributary of the Orinoco, the Caroni, became the
imagined channel of access to its fabled lake; but little success
attended his efforts to penetrate in this direction. Nor did much
increase of knowledge result from the voyages of Ralegh and other
Englishmen to the same regions. In spite of all this activity
vast tracts of forest, especially in the Amazon basin, remained
unexplored, and the whole southern extremity of the continent was
entirely neglected whilst, even where travellers had penetrated,
the geographical knowledge obtained was often of the vaguest, and
imaginary delineations of lakes and rivers long filled the
maps.</p>
<p>In North America much less progress had been made in the work
of discovery. While the coasts facing the Atlantic up to the
threshold of the Arctic regions had gradually been surveyed by
voyagers of various nations, and a few had pushed up the remote
Pacific coasts as far as Lat. 42° N., the whole of the northern
and north-western shores&mdash;the former by reason of their icy
barrier, the latter because of their distance from
Europe&mdash;still remained unknown, though, as already stated,
ideas of the existence of a strait separating north-west America
from Asia began to be current about this time. The whole of the
northern and central interior, too, remained a blank on the map,
and only on the confines of the Spanish viceroyalty of Mexico had
any progress in land exploration been made. The example of the
wealth of Mexico had led adventurers to roam the wide plains of
the southern United States in search of fortune, and the
expeditions of De Soto, Coronado, and others had made known
something of the lower Mississippi and its tributaries, and of
the more western regions up to the Grand Cañon of the Colorado.
But the absence of rich empires in this direction soon caused
these efforts to be abandoned. In Florida, unsuccessful attempts
at a settlement had been made by French protestants, and further
north, in Virginia, the first beginnings of the English
settlements destined to grow in time to such vast proportions
were in existence. Still further north, off the coasts of
Newfoundland, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and English ships
frequented the banks in large numbers for the sake of the
fishery, and the French under Cartier had already led the way in
discovery by the ascent of the St Lawrence beyond the present
site of Quebec, soon to be the scene of colonising efforts on the
part of their countrymen. A wide field for discovery was thus
open in eastern North America, and the coming century was to
witness a well-sustained activity, leading to a great enlargement
of the bounds of geographical knowledge.</p>
<p>In the wide domain of the Pacific Ocean much remained to be
done, though fairly correct ideas as to its nature and extent had
become current. Since the voyage of Magellan many Spanish
navigators had crossed from the coast of America to the islands
of the Eastern Archipelago, to which this was their regular
route, owing to the division of the world between Spain and
Portugal, the return voyage being made across the North Pacific
in fairly high latitudes. From Callao in Peru Mendaña had twice
crossed the ocean in about 10° S., discovering the Solomon and
Santa Cruz groups and supplying apparent confirmation of the
ideas then current as to the existence of a southern continent.
On the second voyage he had been accompanied by the celebrated
navigator Quiros, whose own chief work fell within the new
century, and will be dealt with in the following pages. Other
Spanish navigators had crossed the ocean north of the Equator
from Mexico to the Philippines, and it has been supposed that
Gaetano&mdash;the pilot who accompanied one of these, Villalobos,
in 1542&mdash;afterwards made a voyage to the Sandwich Islands.
But this discovery, if made, was carefully kept secret, and had
no influence on the subsequent history of Pacific exploration.
The Englishmen Drake and Cavendish had likewise crossed the
Northern Pacific, and just at the close of the century the Dutch
expedition under Van Noort had followed in the tracks of Magellan
and for the fourth time effected the circumnavigation of the
globe&mdash;but this belongs rather to the new than to the old
period. In most of these voyages certain definite routes had been
followed, which missed many of the most important groups of
islands. The information brought home with respect to those seen
was very vague and fragmentary, and for the most part they can
with difficulty be now identified. Both in the north and south,
vast expanses of ocean remained untraversed, and the exploration
of these, especially in the south, was one of the principal tasks
of the coming century.</p>

<p>In the Arctic regions some advance had already been made
before the close of the sixteenth century, the new period having
in fact been ushered in by the early enterprise of the English
and Dutch in this quarter, from about 1550 onwards. In dealing
with this part of the world it will be advisable to go back to
about that date, so as to give a more connected account of the
progress achieved; and it is unnecessary to enter into the
subject here.</p>

<small>Title of the Wright-Hakluyt Map of A.D. 1600.</small></p>
<br>
<p>The state of knowledge respecting the world in general at the
close of the sixteenth century is well shown by the map prepared
under the superintendence of Edward Wright, the Cambridge
mathematician, to whom the projection now known as Mercator's is
held to be really due. This map, finished in 1600, and sometimes
found inserted in the edition of Hakluyt's famous collection of
voyages completed in that year, is the earliest English example
of that projection. It differs from many maps of the time in its
careful discrimination between actual discovery and conjectural
geography, the latter being almost entirely excluded. Thus no
trace is seen of the hypothetical southern continent, apart from
a slight indication of land in the position of northern
Australia. The recent Arctic discoveries are well shown, and it
has been thought that John Davis had some share in its
preparation. The strait which bears his name is correctly drawn,
as well as the discoveries of Barents in Spitsbergen and Novaya
Zemlya. In the Far East, too&mdash;whence, as we shall see later,
Davis had recently returned&mdash;the map gives a very correct
representation of the Archipelago, Japan, etc. North of the
Pacific a wide blank occurs between the coasts of Asia and
America, the conjectural connection between the two, and the
equally doubtful Strait of Anian shown on so many maps of the
period, being alike omitted. Another type of map, current about
this time, is represented by that of Ortelius, a reduced copy of
which, prepared by Girolamo Porro for Magini's Ptolemy of 1596,
is here reproduced from the Italian version of 1598. It will be
noticed that the supposed southern continent here takes a
prominent place.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<h4>THE ARCTIC REGIONS, 1550-1625</h4>
<p><span class="a">In</span> the remarkable outburst of maritime
enterprise which followed the discovery of America, it was the
equatorial regions, with their real or supposed wealth in the
precious metals and other valuable commodities, which above all
stimulated the energies of such nations as, by their political
influence or favourable geographical position, had been called
upon to take part in these adventures. But, side by side with
this principal current of activity, there had begun to flow, in
the course of the sixteenth century, a subsidiary stream of
enterprise in the direction of the inhospitable North&mdash;a
stream which, though at first but feeble in comparison, was
destined to lead to results of great importance for the widening
of the geographical horizon. And as it was the more southern
peoples of Western Europe who had gained the chief glory and
profit from the earlier quest, so it was the hardy seamen of the
north who, as an equally natural result of geographical position,
carried off the laurels in the still more arduous task of seeking
new routes through the frozen Arctic seas.</p>
<p>The first beginnings of enterprise in this direction belong to
still earlier times than the search for a route to the Indies,
and are in fact to a great extent lost in obscurity. Long before
the Venetian and Portuguese navigators began to venture into the
unknown wastes of the Atlantic, the seamen of the north had
carried out voyages unsurpassed for their daring even by the more
fruitful exploit of Columbus. Before the end of the tenth century
the most northern point of Europe seems to have been rounded by
Other in the voyage narrated by him to our King Alfred, while in
the following century the Norsemen (who had already colonised
Iceland) found their way to the distant shores of Greenland,
where, according to the story, two separate settlements were
founded and existed for some centuries. They even appear to have
reached some part of Eastern Canada or Newfoundland. The supposed
voyages of the Venetian noblemen, Niccolo and Antonio Zeno, in
the fourteenth century, have been proved almost with certainty to
have been mainly, if not entirely, fictitious; but that some
glimmering of knowledge of these northern regions was possessed
by the cartographers of the following century is shown by various
maps that have come down to us, especially that of Claudius
Clavus, the "earliest cartographer of the North." The rising
spirit of maritime adventure found its first outlet in England in
the voyages of the Cabots, father and son, though those of
Sebastian, the son, have not yet been satisfactorily elucidated,
and the idea once held that they reached as far north as the
mouth of Hudson Strait rests on no sure foundation. The arguments
put forward by Robert Thorne in 1527, as to the feasibility of a
north-west passage, led to no immediate result, and it was some
years later that the English merchants took the first important
step towards securing a share in the benefits of distant trade,
from which the jealousy of their continental rivals had hitherto
excluded them.</p>
<p>Mainly through the agency of Sebastian Cabot, an association
was formed for "the discovery of lands, countries, and isles not
before known to the English", and this received a royal charter
in 1549.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> At this time the thoughts of the
merchants were directed chiefly to the opening up of trade with
the East by way of Northern Russia, and for this purpose an
expedition of three ships was fitted out in 1553 and despatched
under the command of Sir Hugh Willoughby, with Richard Chancellor
as "pilot-major." It was furnished with "letters missive" from
King Edward VI to the potentates of the regions likely to be
visited, and sailed from Ratcliffe on the Thames, full of high
anticipation, on May 10, 1553. But it was doomed to meet with
disaster. After sailing along the coast of Norway the ships
encountered boisterous weather, and two of them, the <i>Bona
Esperanza</i> and <i>Bona Confidentia</i> (the former
Willoughby's own ship), were driven hither and thither, and
though they sighted land in the latitude of 72° (probably on the
south-west coast of Novaya Zemlya), were finally forced to take
refuge in the haven of Arzina <sup><b>[2]</b></sup> in Lapland,
where the whole of the crews perished miserably of cold and
hunger. The third ship&mdash;the <i>Edward Bonaventure</i>, with
Chancellor for captain, became separated from the others and
succeeded in reaching the mouth of the Dwina in the White Sea,
whence Chancellor and some of his companions travelled inland to
Moscow, and were well received by the Emperor Ivan Vassilivich,
thus paving the way for future trade relations between Great
Britain and Russia. On his return Chancellor wrote a short
account of the country and the manners and customs of its
people&mdash;the earliest first-hand information on the subject
which reached this country. He was drowned when returning from a
later voyage in 1556.</p>

<p>In 1555 a second voyage was made, and trade definitely
established, while in 1556 the Company despatched Stephen
Burrough, in the pinnace <i>Searchthrift</i>, to explore still
further east in the direction of the river Ob. Burrough reached
Vaigatz Island on July 31, and soon afterwards entered the Kara
Strait between that island and Novaya Zemlya, which has been
sometimes known, from him, as Burrough Strait. He was unable
however to advance any distance into the Kara Sea, but turned
back on August 5, wintering at Kolmogro at the mouth of the
Dwina.</p>

<br>
<p>The success of the trade with Russia diverted the energies of
the merchants from the search for a north-east passage for some
years, and it was not until 1580 that any serious attempt was
made to prosecute discovery in this direction, attention having
meanwhile been once more directed to the north-western route.
Yearly voyages were however made to Kolmogro, and agents were
regularly established in Russia to buy up commodities in
readiness for the arrival of the ships, while some made their way
on behalf of the Company as far as Persia and Central Asia.
Hakluyt prints the commission issued in 1568 (given as 1588 by a
misprint) to three servants of the Company&mdash;Bassendine,
Woodcocke, and Browne&mdash;to explore eastwards beyond the
Pechora, but nothing is known of the result. In 1580 the Company
determined to renew their efforts for the discovery of a
north-eastern route to Cathay, and commissioned two captains,
Arthur Pet of Ratcliffe and Charles Jackman of Poplar, to sail
for that purpose, in the barks <i>George</i> and <i>William</i>
of London, the former of 40, the latter of 20 tons only. In spite
of the ill-success of Burrough's attempt, it was still hoped that
by passing through the strait between Vaigatz and Novaya Zemlya,
a passage might be found to China in a generally eastward
direction, as indicated on a chart which had been drawn by
William Burrough. With our present knowledge of the difficulties
to be encountered&mdash;difficulties so great that the wished-for
passage was not made until three centuries after Pet and
Jackman's time&mdash;we can only wonder at the sanguine spirit
which regarded it as possible that China could be reached, in the
small and frail vessels employed, during the same summer in which
they set out, or at worst after one winter had been spent on the
northern coast of Asia.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> It was only in case
the land should be found to extend to 80° N., or even nearer the
Pole, that the impossibility of the passage was thought probable.
In such a case, after as much of the coast as possible had been
explored during the first summer, the explorers were recommended
to winter in the Ob, and ascend it the next summer to the "City
of Siberia." In any case all possible care was to be taken to
enter into friendly relations with the inhabitants, and lay the
foundations of future trade. A point to be specially kept in
view, either on the outward or return voyage, was the examination
of "Willoughby's land", and its relation with Novaya Zemlya.
Notes for the guidance of the voyagers were also supplied by
William Burrough, Dr Dee, and Richard Hakluyt, the last dealing
particularly with the commodities to be taken as specimens of
English wares, and the points on which information was needed in
regard to the countries visited.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> A representation of the northern coast
of Asia current about this time, as seen in Mercator's map of
1569, was still to a large extent based on the old classical
writers. It showed one decided promontory&mdash;Cape
Tabin&mdash;running up into the Arctic Sea, but, beyond this,
little further hindrance to a voyage to China in latitudes far
lower than the reality. Cape Tabin still appears in the map of
Barents's discoveries drawn by Hondius for Pontanus's <i>History
of Amsterdam</i> (1611), of which a portion is shown on p.
26.]</p>
<p>Although the amount actually accomplished fell very far short
of these expectations, the two captains made a determined fight
against heavy odds, and only turned back after trying every means
in their power of pushing east across the Kara Sea. The ships
separated, after passing the "Wardhouse" (Vardoe), owing to the
bad sailing of the <i>William</i>, but a rendezvous was arranged
at Vaigatz. The first land sighted by the George seems to have
been the south-west coast of Novaya Zemlya, but after vainly
searching for a passage Pet went south and explored the mainland
coast east of the Pechora, a part of which he took to be the
island of Vaigatz. Going north again a meeting was happily
effected with the <i>William</i>, and the two ships entered the
Kara Sea either through Yugor Shar, the narrow strait between
Vaigatz and the mainland, or through the broad opening north of
Vaigatz already discovered by Burrough.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> They
were constantly beset by ice and baffled by fog, till at length,
after vain endeavours to make headway, the navigators turned
their faces homewards, only escaping from the ice with much
difficulty. Further dangers were encountered on the shoals of
Kolguev Island, and the ships again separated, the <i>George</i>
safely reaching Ratcliffe on December 26, 1580, while Jackman, in
the <i>William</i>, after wintering on the coast of Norway, set
out in the following February towards Iceland in company with a
Danish ship, and was never again heard of.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> It has been generally held by English
writers that the passage was made by Yugor Shar, which has
therefore been often known as Pet's Strait, but reasons were put
forward by Baron von Nordenskiöld for supposing that the route
was to the west and north of Vaigatz.]</p>
<p>Pet and Jackman deserve great credit for the boldness with
which they fought their way through the ice-pack of the Kara Sea,
as well as for their judgment and resource in availing themselves
of any opening which promised to afford a passage. The
difficulties of this navigation have baffled many a voyager even
in modern times, and it is no matter for surprise that with their
small advantages they were unsuccessful in pushing further east.
Little serious effort in this direction seems to have been made
by the Muscovy Company for some years after this, though a rumour
was current about 1584 that an English vessel had previously been
lost at the mouth of the Ob, and its crew murdered; while
information obtained in that year by Anthony Marsh, one of the
Company's factors, points to a knowledge on the part of the
Russians at this time of Matyuskin Shar, the strait between the
two large islands of Novaya Zemlya.</p>
<p>The search for the north-east passage was now taken up with
much zeal by the Dutch, whose heroic attempts to open up the much
desired route must now be spoken of, before recurring to the
efforts of the Muscovy Company. The first Dutch voyage to the
extreme north of Europe seems to have been made in 1565, when a
trading post was established at a spot to which the name Kola was
given. It is but little after this that we first meet with
Olivier (or Oliver) Brunei, a man who took no small part in the
further prosecution of Dutch northern enterprise, though himself
a native of Brussels. Having undertaken a voyage from Kola to
Kolmogro on the White Sea, he was made prisoner by the Russians,
apparently at the instigation of the English, and remained so for
several years. Being at last liberated through the good offices
of the Anikieffs, Russian merchants associated with the
Strogonoffs, he made several journeys of exploration on their
behalf in the direction of the Ob, visiting Kostin Shar on one
occasion. He helped to establish mutual trade relations between
Holland and Russia, and eventually secured the support of the
famous merchant De Moucheron for a voyage of discovery. Brunei
set out in a ship of Enkhuysen in 1584, but met with no success,
being baffled in an attempt to pass through Yugor Shar, and
losing his ship, with a cargo of furs, etc., in the mouth of the
Pechora. He is said to have afterwards entered the service of the
King of Denmark, and possibly took part in the voyage of John
Knight to Greenland in 1606.</p>
<p>The town of Enkhuysen, which thus had the honour of leading
the way in the Dutch voyages of northern discovery, was not long
in organising another attempt in the same direction. Among its
citizens were several men who had interested themselves in
geographical and commercial matters, including the famous
Linschoten (whose long residence in the East Indies made him the
foremost authority on all matters connected with the eastern
trade of the Portuguese) and Cornelis Nai, an experienced seaman.
The Middelburg merchant De Moucheron continued to turn his
thoughts to the north-eastern route, and the divine and
geographer Peter Plancius was a zealous advocate of further
enterprise. He did much to improve his countrymen's knowledge of
navigation, and among his pupils were Willem Barents and Jacob
van Heemskerk, each destined to play an important part in
northern discovery. Both were capable seamen, especially Barents,
who seems, like John Davis in England, to have been well versed
in the science of navigation.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> In 1594 two
vessels were fitted out&mdash;the <i>Swan</i>, commanded by
Cornelis Nai, and the <i>Mercury</i>, by Brant Tetgales, both
natives of Enkhuysen. With Tetgales Linschoten went as commercial
agent. At the same time the merchants of Amsterdam decided to
take part in the enterprise, and fitted out a third
vessel&mdash;also named the <i>Mercury</i>&mdash;and this was
placed under the command of Barents,<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> with
whom a small fishing-boat from Terschelling also sailed. The
plans laid down by the Amsterdam adventurers differed from those
of the men of Enkhuysen, the former considering that a route
round the north coast of Novaya Zemlya would offer the greatest
prospects of success, while the latter adhered to the idea of
entering the Kara Sea through one of the straits separating the
several islands. As we have seen, some knowledge of Matyuskin
Shar seems to have been gained by the Russians before this date,
but the greater part of the coasts of the northern island were
certainly unknown, so that the attempt to sail round its northern
end betokened great hardihood, though quite justified by the
measure of success now and subsequently attained by this
route.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Either he, or a contemporary of like
name, was author of a sailing directory for the coasts of the
Mediterranean.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> The full name of the navigator was
Barentszoon, contracted by the Dutch to Barentsz, but the form
Barents may conveniently be retained in English. Nai is sometimes
spoken of merely as Cornelis Corneliszoon.]</p>
<p>Almost the whole of the voyage was made independently by the
two parties, though all the vessels met at a rendezvous at
Kildin, in Lapland, towards the end of June. On the 29th, Barents
sailed for Novaya Zemlya, which was sighted on July 4 in 73° 25'
N., and followed northward to Cape Nassau, which was reached on
the loth. Now began a heroic struggle to advance through the ice,
which was here encountered in great quantities. It has been
calculated that the various courses run by Barents on this coast
make up a total of over 1600 nautical miles, the furthest point
reached (July 31) being near the Orange Islands. The men now grew
discouraged, and seeing but slight probability of accomplishing
the object of the voyage, Barents reluctantly agreed to turn
back. On August 15 he reached the islands "Matfloe and Dolgoy"
(Matthew Island and Long Island) to the S.S.W. of Vaigatz, and
fell in with the other captains, who had likewise returned from
an ineffectual attempt to push eastward to the Ob. They had
sailed through Yugor Shar, to which they gave the name Nassau
Strait, being the first navigators, with the doubtful exception
of Pet, to pass through this passage into the Kara Sea. They
claimed to have sailed eastward as far as the meridian of the
mouth of the Ob, but as the distance given is only 50 to 60 Dutch
miles (each equal to four geographical miles), this can hardly
have been the case. All four vessels now sailed home together,
reaching their respective destinations about the end of
September.</p>
<p>The report made by Linschoten after the return of the voyagers
estimated the chances of future success more favourably than was
perhaps justified, and this encouraged the merchants to set on
foot a more ambitious undertaking for the following year. Seven
vessels took part in it, and this time the Amsterdam merchants
were willing to combine with those of the other towns interested,
their two ships being placed, like the rest, under the command of
Nai, who was appointed admiral of the whole fleet. He sailed in
the <i>Griffin</i> of Zeelandt, while Tetgales and Barents
commanded, respectively, the <i>Hope</i> of Enkhuysen and the
<i>Greyhound</i> of Amsterdam (both new war pinnaces), Barents
also undertaking the post of chief pilot of the fleet. The chief
commercial agents were Linschoten, who again represented the
merchants of Enkhuysen, etc., and François de la Dale, who looked
after the Moucheron interests. It was arranged that one of the
smaller vessels, a yacht of Rotterdam, should return alone with
the news, in case of a successful rounding of Cape Tabin, still
supposed to be the crucial point of the whole navigation, the
remainder of the passage to China being thought comparatively
short and easy. As on the former voyage, a Slav named Spindler
went as interpreter, to facilitate the hoped-for intercourse with
the peoples of Eastern Asia. The fleet sailed on July 2, 1595,
and on the 19th of the same month approached Yugor Shar, having
the day before passed Matthew Island ("Matfloe"). The strait was
blocked by immense masses of ice, and it soon became evident that
its passage would be a matter of unusual difficulty, if not quite
impossible. The ships anchored in a bay on the Vaigatz side,
behind the point known to the Dutch as Idol Point (not to be
confounded with the spot at which Samoyed idols were found by
Burrough, which was at the northern end of Vaigatz), and thence
an examination of the strait was made both by sea and land, but
with little success. Barents appears to have been the most
energetic of the captains in his efforts to find a passage, and
he repeatedly renewed his attempts when the rest were ready to
abandon the task as hopeless. But after immense exertions, which
brought the ships only a small part of the way through the
strait, the outcome of various councils was that the men of
Amsterdam, whose obstinacy seems to have given some offence to
their fellow-adventurers, at last agreed to turn back and joined
in a protest signed by all the captains and the two commercial
agents, declaring that all had done their utmost to fulfil their
commission, and that the only course open to them was to sail
homewards. Thus ended the voyage on which such great expectations
had been built, but which had in reality met with much less
success than many of the previous ventures, owing, it is true, to
the unusual severity of the season, which had kept the ice in the
Yugor Strait packed into a solid mass throughout the summer.</p>

<small>Boats' adventure with a polar bear.<br>
(<i>From De Veer's narrative of Barents's
Voyages.</i>)</small></p>
<br>
<p>In spite of the ill-success of the expedition of 1595, the
merchants of Amsterdam, encouraged no doubt by the ardour and
sanguine spirit shown by Barents, were ready to make yet another
attempt in the following year. It was the belief of Barents,
founded on his experiences during the voyage of 1594, that the
greatest chance of success lay with the route round the north of
Novaya Zemlya, and in this he had the support of the opinion of
Plancius. Being now independent of their former associates, the
Amsterdam merchants were able to form their plans in accordance
with these views. Two ships, the names of which are not recorded,
were fitted out, and placed under the command of Jacob van
Heemskerk and Jan Corneliszoon Rijp, who had been associated with
Linschoten and De la Dale as commercial agents during the second
voyage, Heemskerk having Barents with him as pilot and apparently
leaving to him a large share in the direction of the voyage. The
expedition sailed from Vlieland near Amsterdam on May 18, 1596,
and in deference to the opinion of Rijp a course was steered
further to the west than on the previous voyages, and this led to
the discovery, on June 9, of Bear Island, long called Cherie
Island by the English, being so named by Stephen Bennet seven
years after its discovery by the Dutch. Here the voyagers landed,
and gave the island its name from an encounter they had with a
bear. Continuing their voyage towards the north, they reached the
ice-pack on June 16, and after tacking to keep clear of it, found
the latitude on the 17th to be 80° 10'. On the same day high,
snow-covered land was sighted, which was evidently the coast of
Spitsbergen, east of Hakluyt Headland (as the extreme N.W. point
of the group was afterwards named by Hudson), this island group
being thus brought to light for the first time in the history of
discovery. Before the end of the month the west coast was
explored, southwards, to 76° 50' N., the name still in use for
the whole group being applied to the newly discovered land by
reason of its sharp summits (though it was taken to be part of
Greenland), while that of Vogel Hoek was given to the north point
of the Foreland (the long island lying a little off the coast) on
account of the multitude of birds there seen. The mouths of Ice
Fjord and Bell Sound were also noted. Bear Island was once more
reached on July 1, and here the two ships parted company, Rijp
returning along the coast of Spitsbergen after a fruitless effort
to push north through the sea to the east, while Heemskerk,
yielding no doubt to Barents's persuasion, sailed for Novaya
Zemlya.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The farthest point of the voyage of
1594 was successfully passed, the north-eastern promontory of the
group being rounded and a bay reached on the east coast which
received the name of Ice Haven. Here the ship was beset, and the
navigators were forced to spend the winter in great misery. A
house was built of drift-wood, which gave them some shelter from
the cold, but scurvy broke out and caused much suffering, Barents
himself being one of those most severely attacked. Time wore on,
but summer approached without any prospect of the release of the
ship. It therefore became necessary to attempt the homeward
voyage with no better resource than two open boats, in which, on
June 13, they embarked, fifteen in all, Barents and another man
being still very ill. On June 20, when with incredible
difficulties they were making their way down the west coast of
Novaya Zemlya, the indomitable navigator, who had done more than
any other to keep alive the hope of effecting the north-east
passage, breathed his last, and two others of his comrades soon
shared his fate. The survivors at length reached open water, and
having obtained some help from two Russian vessels met with on
July 28, made their way to Kola, where they found three Dutch
ships, one of them commanded by their old comrade Rijp, who took
them home to Holland.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> See additional note on Rijp at the end
of the volume.]</p>
<p>The feat thus accomplished ranks among the hardiest
achievements of Polar exploration. For the first time a party of
men had wintered far within the Arctic Circle, suffering all the
hardships inseparable from such a first experience, without any
of the comforts enjoyed by those who have since followed in their
footsteps. No other navigator visited their desolate wintering
place until nearly three centuries later, when, in 1871, Captain
Carlsen landed there and found the hut still standing, and
various relics which had been left in it when abandoned by the
early explorers. The death of Barents&mdash;perhaps the most
hardy and capable navigator ever produced by Holland&mdash;was a
great loss to the cause of Polar discovery, and the small success
achieved naturally led to a cessation, for the time being, of the
Dutch search for a passage. The next attempt was to be made by
the English in the person of Henry Hudson.</p>

<br>
<p>Of the early life of this enterprising seaman we know
absolutely nothing, and doubts have even been thrown, though with
no sufficient reason, on his English nationality. In 1607 we find
him in command of one of the Muscovy Company's ships&mdash;the
<i>Hopewell</i>&mdash;which was to renew the search for a
northern route to the East, on which so much energy had already
been expended by the Company. The idea seems to have been to
attempt the passage right across the polar area, according to a
suggestion made many years earlier by Robert Thorne. Thus instead
of steering for Novaya Zemlya, or even for Spitsbergen, Hudson,
who sailed from Gravesend on May 1, directed his course towards
the east coast of Greenland, which was sighted on June 13. The
southern part of this land had already been touched at more than
once during the north-west voyages&mdash;which we shall have to
consider presently&mdash;as well as by Cortereal in the 16th
century. But even the point where it was first struck by Hudson
was some way to the north, and a still higher latitude was
attained during the further voyage; though the observations of
the coast, hampered as they were by the ice, did not supply any
clear idea of its configuration, the land being still shown in
subsequent maps as it had been in that of the Zeni and others of
its type. Hudson, however, did a useful piece of work in
following the edge of the ice-barrier which extends between
Greenland and the neighbourhood of Spitsbergen, and proving that
there was little likelihood of a passage being found through it.
Spitsbergen seems to have been struck near the Vogel Hoek of
Barents, while during subsequent cruises a good part of the west
and north-west coasts was examined, and the names Hakluyt's
Headland, Collins Cape, and Whales Bay assigned to localities on
the west coast.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> On July 23 an astronomical
observation, as recorded in the journal of John Playse
(practically the only authority for the voyage), gave the
latitude as 80° 23', but the correctness of this is doubtful. In
any case enough was done to show that no prospect offered of a
passage through the ice-pack, and after sailing to and fro for
some time, Hudson was forced to turn homewards, falling in
accidentally during the voyage with an island (in Lat. 71°) which
must have been that of Jan Mayen, but which was named by him
"Hudson's Tutches" (Touches). Tilbury was finally reached on
September 15. Besides the negative result as regards the
wished-for passage, the voyage was important for the attention
called by it to the great number of whales and walrus in the
Spitsbergen-Greenland Sea, the capture of which formed the
incentive for so many subsequent enterprises.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Whales Bay was the opening in 79° just
north of Prince Charles Foreland, Collins Cape being on its
northern side.]</p>
<p>The failure of this attempt to pierce the northern ice-barrier
did not deter the Company from renewing the search in the
following year, when trial was once more made of the old route by
Novaya Zemlya, Hudson being again in command, with Robert Juet as
mate. Sailing from the Thames on April 22, and passing the North
Cape on June 3, he navigated the sea between Spitsbergen and
Novaya Zemlya, the first ice being seen on June 9, in 75° 29'.
The day before, the change in the colour of the sea to a
blue-black had been noted&mdash;a change which Hudson had
already, in 1607, connected with the neighbourhood of ice, though
the coincidence is now said to be purely accidental. For the
greater part of this month the voyagers continued to beat about
in this sea,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> constantly hindered by ice from
making any advance northwards. As they increased their longitude
easterly, they were, in fact, compelled to lose some of their
northing, and when Novaya Zemlya was sighted on June 26 near the
point called Swarte Klip by the Dutch, they were as low as 72°
25'. Some time was now spent on this coast, landings being
effected on several occasions and observations made of the
general nature of the country, which they found less inhospitable
than previous accounts had led people to suppose. Bird life was
plentiful, and many deer, bears, and a fox were seen, the sea
also abounding with walrus. Still going southward, they came to
Kostin Shar, an inlet with an island dividing it into two
branches, which had been reached by Brunei, but placed too far
north and corrupted by map-makers into Costing Sarch. Here the
powerful set of the current outwards gave Hudson great hopes of
finding a passage to the Kara Sea, but an exploration by boat
proved them fallacious. Therefore being, as he says, "out of hope
to find passage by the north-east," Hudson reluctantly gave up
the attempt, being "not fitted to try or prove the passage by
Vaigatz," though on the return he hoped to ascertain whether
Willoughby's land "were as it is layd in our cards." He also had
some idea of making an attempt by the north-west, hoping to be
able to run a hundred leagues or so within the sound then known
as Lumley's Inlet&mdash;which may either have been Hudson Strait
itself or a passage further north&mdash;and the "furious
overfall" which had been seen by Davis (see p. 35). But the time
being now far advanced he considered it his duty to the Company
not to run unnecessary risks, and returned home, reaching
Gravesend on August 26.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> An occurrence often referred to in
connection with this part of the voyage was the supposed sighting
of a mermaid&mdash;in reality, no doubt, a seal]</p>
<p>It was not many months before the indefatigable navigator was
once more negotiating with a view to a third northern voyage, but
not now under the auspices of the English Company, which seems to
have lost heart after such repeated failures. The circumstances
attending the inception of Hudson's voyage for the Dutch East
India Company are not fully known, but the main facts can be
pieced together from scattered sources. Either at the end of 1608
or the beginning of 1609 he was invited to Amsterdam to give an
account of his northern experiences, and had interviews with
Plancius and others; but though the Company thought that a
further attempt would be worth making, they came to no immediate
arrangement. Meanwhile a scheme, favoured by Isaac Le Maire, had
been set on foot for the establishment of a rival company under
the patronage of Henry IV of France, and the employment of Hudson
on a northern venture. This led the existing company to
reconsider their decision, with the result that a ship or ships
<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> were equipped at once, and were ready to
sail by April 6, 1609. The greater part of the crew were
Dutchmen, who seem to have been indisposed to accept Hudson's
authority, for after sailing for Novaya Zemlya to make trial, as
a last hope, of the passage by Vaigatz, he found disaffection
existing, and, the ice giving no greater promise of success than
in the previous year, he decided to search for a passage along
the American coast, being encouraged to do this by letters and
maps sent him from Virginia by Captain
Smith.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> The result was the examination of a
stretch of coast extending as far south as 37° 45', and the
visiting and naming of the Hudson River. During the return
dissension again prevailed, and on reaching Dartmouth on November
7, Hudson and the other Englishmen on board&mdash;among whom was
Juet, to whom we owe the only detailed narrative of the
voyage&mdash;were ordered by the English authorities not to leave
England, but to remain to serve their own country. It was not
long before arrangements were made for an English voyage to the
north-west, but before speaking of this we must go back somewhat,
and take up the thread of former attempts in this direction.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The greater part of the voyage was made
in the <i>Half Moon</i>, but according to statements in the
minutes of meetings of the council of the Company, Hudson's ship
was the <i>Good Hope</i>, and it has been thought that this may
have sailed also, but it seems more probable that a confusion had
arisen with the name of the ship in which he made his earlier
voyage.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> A renewed Dutch attempt by the
north-east route, in 1611-12, is referred to at the end of the

<br>
<p>The voyages of the Cabots, which led the way to the
north-eastern coasts of America, were not, as we have seen,
followed up for a number of years by any further efforts on the
part of the British merchants. The chief credit of re-directing
public attention to this route seems to belong to Sir Humphrey
Gilbert, though there is little doubt that the idea of renewing
the search where it had been broken off by Sebastian Cabot had
been working in the minds of others, among them Martin Frobisher,
to whom fell the actual task of carrying it out. In 1574 Gilbert
wrote a learned discourse to show the probability that an easy
route to India would be found by the north-west. While based to a
large extent on mistaken premisses, it contained some shrewd
ideas, and the argument for a north-west passage based on a study
of oceanic circulation had in it something more than mere
plausibility. In the then existing state of knowledge it was
certainly more justifiable to conclude that an easy passage might
be found on this than on the opposite side of the Atlantic; and
that the Muscovy Company, which had all Cabot's experience at its
disposal, should have so long persisted in its preference for the
north-east route would be matter for surprise, were it not for
the encouragement offered by the rapid development of trade with
northern Russia. Gilbert's treatise was not printed till 1576, by
which year Frobisher had already gained so much support, that he
was able to sail from Ratcliffe on the Thames on June 7, the
expedition consisting of the <i>Gabriel</i>, Frobisher's own
ship, the <i>Michael</i> (Captain Matthew Kindersly), and a
pinnace. The Queen had taken much interest in the preparations,
and among the supporters were Michael Lok, a prominent merchant,
Richard Willes,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> and others. Having reached
Foula, the westernmost of the Shetland Islands, Frobisher sailed
slightly north of west, and on July 11 sighted land, which was
taken to be the Frisland of the Zeno map, the observed latitude
of 61° corresponding to that assigned in this to the south end of
Frisland. In reality it was the southern point of Greenland, and
when this had been passed, a course somewhat north of west
brought the ships to a new land, with much ice along its coast.
On August 11, in 63° N., Frobisher entered what he took to be the
desired strait leading to the Pacific, but which was really the
bay, since known by his name, running into the south-eastern
extremity of Baffin Land. This was explored during several days,
and communication was opened with the Eskimo of that region, who
are described as "like to Tartars." But it was found impossible
to proceed to the end of the bay, and on the 26th the homeward
voyage was begun, Harwich being reached early in October. The new
land received, from the Queen herself, the name "Meta Incognita",
or the Unknown Bourne.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Willes, like Gilbert, wrote a treatise
to prove the probability of a north-west passage, in which he
endeavoured to answer the objections of those who took the
opposite view. He states these with great clearness, but his own
arguments seem hardly calculated to carry conviction.]</p>
<p>Frobisher renewed the search in the two succeeding years (1577
and 1578), in the latter with as many as 13 ships, but without
materially adding to his discoveries. His ill-success in the
primary object of his voyages made him catch at any chance of
deriving a profit from the venture, and he brought home a cargo
of a shining mineral which he thought to contain gold, but which
proved quite worthless. The promoters naturally lost heart, and
Gilbert was soon occupied with the colonising schemes in the more
southern parts of North America, in the prosecution of which he
lost his life in 1583. But the efforts put forth were not without
their ultimate result, for it was not long before others came
forward to renew the enterprise, for which the discoveries of
Frobisher, scanty though they had been, supplied both incentive
and encouragement.</p>

<small>Martin Frobisher.</small></p>
<br>
<p>John Davis, the able navigator who was to take up the task
where it had been left by Frobisher, was the son of a yeoman
landowner at Sandridge in the parish of Stoke Gabriel on the
Dart. Here he was a neighbour of the Gilberts, and was likewise
brought into the society of their half-brother, Sir Walter
Ralegh. Having probably been accustomed to the sea from his early
youth, his advice was naturally sought by the promoters of
voyages of discovery, among whom Adrian Gilbert, the younger
brother of Sir Humphrey, took a prominent place after his
brother's death. Another associate was Dr John Dee, the
mathematician. In 1585 a new scheme took shape, the necessary
funds being provided by various merchants of London and the West
Country, principally Mr William Sanderson, a wealthy and
influential citizen of London, while the voyage had also the
support of Sir F. Walsingham, Secretary to the Privy Council.
Davis was placed in command, and sailed from Dartmouth on June 7,
with two vessels, the <i>Sunshine</i> of London, a bark of 50
tons, and the <i>Moonshine</i> of Dartmouth, somewhat smaller. On
the 28th they left the Scilly Islands&mdash;a survey of which was
made during an enforced detention&mdash;and sailed across the
Atlantic without sighting land until, on July 20, the east coast
of Greenland was struck, some distance north of Cape Farewell.
From its barren and inhospitable nature, the land received the
name of Desolation, being considered a new discovery, distinct
from the land sighted by Frobisher and by him identified with
Frisland. Rounding the southern extremity and resuming his
north-west course, Davis again sighted the coast just north of
64°, the extensive opening where Godthaab now is being named
Gilbert Sound. Hence he crossed the strait which has since borne
his name and examined the opposite coast north of, and within,
Cumberland Gulf, which seemed to offer good hopes of a passage
westwards. But finding it too late in the season to continue the
survey, he decided to return to England and arrived at Dartmouth
on September 30.</p>
<p>Davis soon persuaded the merchants to fit out another
expedition, the men of Devon, especially the Exeter merchants,
contributing the greater part of the cost. Four ships were made
ready&mdash;the <i>Mermaid, Sunshine, Moonshine</i>, and the
<i>North Star</i>, a pinnace&mdash;and sailed from Dartmouth on
May 7, 1586. The <i>Sunshine</i> and <i>North Star</i> were sent
under Captain Pope to survey the east coast of Greenland, while
Davis with the other two vessels made his way to Gilbert Sound,
where friendly intercourse was maintained with the Eskimo. The
<i>Mermaid</i> was sent home hence, owing to sickness among the
crew, while Davis in the <i>Moonshine</i> resumed his examination
of the American shore of the strait, but without adding
materially to his knowledge. He sailed south along the Labrador
coast, and secured a large number of cod, which were salted and
taken home, a way being thus suggested of recovering some at
least of the expense incurred. The <i>Sunshine</i> had already
arrived in safety, but the pinnace had unfortunately been lost in
a storm.</p>
<p>Little had been done on this voyage in the way of exploration,
and the Exeter merchants did not care to risk another venture.
But Davis still found support from Walsingham, Gilbert,
Sanderson, and others. Three ships were equipped for a third
voyage in 1587, but two of these were to prosecute the fishery
only, while Davis in the third attempted further discovery. They
were the <i>Elizabeth</i> (of Dartmouth), the <i>Sunshine</i>,
and the <i>Ellen</i> (a "clincher" or clinker-built pinnace of
London). Davis seems to have sailed in the <i>Elizabeth</i> but
to have afterwards transhipped into the <i>Ellen</i>. The voyage
yielded greater geographical results than any of the previous
searches for the north-west passage, and forms the best title to
fame of the bold and skilful seaman who conducted it. Dartmouth
was left on May 19, and though the start was in some ways
unpropitious, the crossing of the Atlantic was successfully
accomplished, and mountainous land was sighted on June 14. This
was on the west coast of Greenland, for two days later
communication was opened with the Eskimo who had been visited on
former voyages, with whom the explorers now had some
difficulties. The <i>Ellen</i> sailed north, alone, on June 21,
and continued to follow the land (which they named London Coast),
with an open sea to the west and north, up to 72° 12', when a
course was shaped to the west. The highest point reached&mdash;a
bold headland over 3000 feet high&mdash;had been named Hope
Sanderson, in honour of the London merchant who had given Davis
so much encouragement. While crossing the gulf since known as
Baffin Bay, they fell in with the ice-pack, which for some time
baffled their efforts to reach the western shore, forcing them
southwards, so that when land was sighted they were near the
narrows of Davis Strait. Making their way through this on a
southward course they passed the mouth of an inlet between 62°
and 63° N., which may have been that explored by Frobisher, but
which they named Lumley's Inlet, and on the 31st came to a spot
where the water was in great commotion, "whirling and overfalling
as if it were the fall of some great water through a bridge."
They noticed here a great gulf which can have been no other than
Hudson Strait, and named the cape to the south Chidley's Cape.
Reaching 51° without seeing anything of the other ships, they
sailed homewards, and arrived at Dartmouth on September 15.</p>
<p>By this time the small likelihood of making the whole passage
through to the Pacific in one voyage must have been fairly
evident, and any results would be welcomed which, by extending
the bounds of the known area, might pave the way for ultimate
success. It was from this point of view that Davis's services
were particularly valuable, for by his three voyages, especially
the last, he had thrown more new light than any of his
predecessors on the general outlines of land and sea in the far
north-west. Yet there were not wanting those who blamed him for
not accomplishing more, and the failure to find a passage
discouraged the promoters from continuing the quest in the years
immediately following. Although Davis had shown the great
probability that openings existed in the American coast-line, in
comparatively low latitudes, the next serious attempts, both of
Dutch and English, were, as we have seen, by the north and
north-east. Only when Hudson had proved by actual experience the
hopelessness of finding a way to China by these routes did he in
turn devote his energies to the north-west, where, in 1610, he
took up the search almost from the point at which it had been
left by Davis.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The later voyages of Davis, to the East
Indies by the Cape route, are spoken of in Chapter II. pp. 49,
53.]</p>
<p>Several voyages had, it is true, been made to the north-west
in the interval between 1587 and 1610, but of these either the
results were practically nil, or the objects were other than the
search for a passage. In 1602 the English East India Company sent
out George Weymouth, who quickly returned owing to a mutiny among
his crew, and has left no clear account of the voyage, though it
is probable that he entered Hudson Strait. The ill-fated voyage
of 1606 under John Knight, supported both by the East India and
Muscovy Companies, had still less result. Knight had the year
before taken part in the earlier of two expeditions sent out from
Denmark in search of the lost colonies of that nation on the
coast of Greenland, the command of the whole being entrusted to a
Scotsman, John Cunningham, while the important post of chief
pilot was held by a Yorkshireman, James Hall, who subsequently
commanded an English expedition to the same region. Hall went in
the same capacity in 1606 (Cunningham also going as captain of
one of the ships), and it is to him that any results of value
seem to have been due. They consisted chiefly in a fuller
examination than had been made by Davis of the west coast of
Greenland.</p>
<br>
<p>We may now return to Henry Hudson, whose voyage of 1610 was
supported by several of the merchant princes who did so much at
this time to encourage geographical discovery. The most prominent
of these were Sir Thomas Smith, a zealous member both of the
Muscovy and East India Companies; Sir Dudley Digges, son of the
noted mathematician Thomas Digges, and himself a man of great
ability and determination; and Sir John Wolstenholme. A single
vessel, which bore the name <i>Discovery</i>, since so honoured
in the annals of exploration, was fitted out, the object,
according to Purchas, being "to try if, through any of those
inlets which Davis saw but durst not enter, any passage might be
found to the other ocean called the South Sea." Robert Juet once
more sailed as mate, and soon began to display the
insubordination which had in the end such tragic consequences.
Robert Bylot or Byleth, who later took a prominent part in Arctic
exploration, was also of the number. Sailing on April 17, the
voyagers passed in view of Iceland, where they saw Hekla in
eruption, sighted Greenland, in about 65°, on June 4, and passed
its southern point, "Desolation" of Davis, on the 15th. Sailing
thence north-west and west, they entered Hudson Strait on the
night of June 24-25. Continuing to sail west amid much ice, and
sighting the land on either side from time to time, they passed
the "Islands of God's Mercy", "Hold with Hope", "Salisburies
Fore-land" (on Salisbury Island), and other points, and, after
covering about 250 leagues, entered the narrow passage between
Digges Island and Cape Wolstenholme which led into the broad
waters of Hudson Bay, called by the explorer "the bay of God's
great mercies." Keeping to the east side of the bay, they went
generally south until further advance was barred on reaching the
extremity of James Bay. The account written by Abacuk Prickett,
the only at all complete narrative of the voyage that we possess,
does not permit the further course of the <i>Discovery</i> to be
followed in detail, but after beating up and down James Bay in
the vain hope of finding a way out to the west the ship was
frozen in on November 10, and it became necessary to pass the
winter in this inhospitable region without a possibility of
replenishing the fast-dwindling supplies. It was spent in great
discomfort, the only resource afforded by the country being a
limited quantity of fish and fowl. Discord also prevailed and,
when the food was all but spent, open mutiny broke out. Hudson
and a few who stood by him were placed in an open boat and
mercilessly abandoned to their fate, while the mutineers sailed
homeward in the ship, experiencing great difficulties owing to
their lack of the necessary qualifications for navigating these
all but unknown seas. Among them was Prickett, the writer of the
narrative referred to, who though according to his own account
not implicated in the mutiny, was kept on board by the
ringleaders apparently with a view to his influencing his master,
Sir Dudley Digges, in their favour.</p>

<small>Hudson Bay and its approaches.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Thus perished miserably one of the most persevering and
meritorious of the old Arctic voyagers, but his important
discoveries were followed up two years later by Sir Thomas
Button, who, with Captain Ingram, was sent out in 1612 by the
same enterprising adventurers, then incorporated as a company for
the discovery of the north-west passage. Button reached the mouth
of the Nelson river (where he wintered in much privation), thus
defining approximately the limits of Hudson Bay to the west,
though in spite of a renewed examination to the north of this in
the ensuing spring the wished-for passage still eluded his
search. Still less was achieved in 1613 by Captain Gibbons, who
never advanced beyond the Labrador coast. In 1614 the
<i>Discovery</i> was sent a fourth time with Robert Bylot or
Byleth as master. He had taken part in the three previous
voyages, and was a capable navigator, though his fame has been
overshadowed by that of his better-known chief pilot, William
Baffin, who is entitled to rank with seamen like Davis and
Hudson.</p>
<p>Baffin had already been employed in responsible positions, and
had made three voyages to various parts of the Arctic regions. We
first hear of him in 1612, when James Hall&mdash;the Yorkshireman
already referred to in connection with the Danish voyages, who
had returned to England on their termination&mdash;induced Sir
Thomas Smith and others to join in a venture to the west coast of
Greenland, himself sailing as commander in the <i>Patience</i>,
while a second ship, the <i>Heart's Ease</i>, had as master
Andrew Barker. Baffin went as chief pilot in the <i>Patience</i>,
and wrote the narrative of the voyage, of which a portion has
been preserved by Purchas.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The expedition
sailed from the Humber on April 22, 1612, but was unfortunate,
Hall being murdered by the Eskimo in retaliation for wrongs done
by the Danes, with whom he had been associated. The Greenland
coast, however, was examined for some distance north of Gilbert
Sound. During the next two years Baffin took service under the
Muscovy Company and did some good work in Spitsbergen, but, as we
have seen, joined the north-west voyage of 1614 under Bylot.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Another account was written by John
Gatonby of Hull.]</p>
<p>In this voyage, Hudson Strait was again the line of approach
to the unknown region, and though much hindrance was experienced
from ice, certain new coast-lines were brought to light to the
north-west of the strait, while careful observations of the tides
were made throughout. The general set of the flood from the
south-east was fully established, and though the navigators'
hopes were temporarily raised when some distance north-west of
Seahorse Point <sup><b>[2]</b></sup> on Southampton Island by its
coming from the north, these proved fallacious, as it was soon
found that further advance was blocked by land, ice, and
shoal-water, which seemed to form an enclosed bay. It was
therefore soon afterwards decided to sail home, and Plymouth was
reached on September 8, without the loss of a single man.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> So named by Baffin from the number of
walrus seen.]</p>
<p>During this voyage Baffin had done his best to obtain an
accurate representation of the coasts sighted, by means of
astronomical and other observations, and his carefully drawn map,
which has come down to us, gives an excellent idea of the region
of Hudson Strait. On one occasion he attempted&mdash;for the
first time, so far as records exist&mdash;to put in practice the
method of finding the longitude by means of lunar distance. As a
general result of his observations, he gave it as his opinion (in
which he was not far wrong), that any passage which might exist
by way of Hudson Strait must be by means of a narrow inlet, while
the main channel probably opened out of Davis Strait.</p>
<p>Accordingly when the <i>Discovery</i> was once more sent out
by the same adventurers in 1616, Bylot and Baffin occupying the
same respective positions, the search was renewed in the more
northerly direction, and bore fruit in the discovery of the whole
extent of Baffin Bay up to the entrance of Smith Sound in 78° N.,
or over 5° north of the furthest point reached by Davis. For a
time the sea was filled with heavy pack-ice, but towards the end
of June this rapidly disappeared, and good progress was made,
giving the voyagers hopes of a passage. But after reaching
Hakluyt Island, between Whale Sound and Smith Sound, the land was
found to be closing in on the north, and the ship ran to the
westward in an open sea with a stiff gale of wind. Bending round
to the south, Baffin passed in succession the openings of Jones
Sound and Lancaster Sound, but these seem to have offered no
chance of a passage, being probably blocked by ice. The west
coast, too, was much encumbered with ice, so that it was
impossible to keep it in sight, and having come down to the
latitude of 65° 40', Baffin finally abandoned all hopes of
success.</p>
<p>It may be thought strange that, having seen the entrances to
Jones and Lancaster Sounds, Baffin never considered the
possibility of an advance through either of these. But it is
evident that, as on the voyage of the year before, he was in
search of a wide passage such as is afforded by Baffin Bay
itself, narrow straits encumbered with ice being naturally
considered unfit to supply a practicable commercial route to the
Pacific. Having therefore proved that no such wide opening
existed to the west, Baffin regarded the problem as virtually
solved in the negative sense, and he held out no inducements to
his employers to continue the enterprise. He had now seen his
last of polar exploration, and the rest of his voyages were made
in the service of the East India Company, in which he met his
death during an attack on Ormuz in 1622.</p>
<p>Several more attempts were made by the Hudson Bay route before
the search was given up&mdash;if not finally, at least for a
century. In 1619 a Danish expedition was despatched under Captain
Jens Munk, one of the most capable seamen in the Danish navy, who
had previously had some Arctic experience in the Novaya Zemlya
seas. A Danish East India Company had been formed in 1616, and
had received warm support from King Christian IV, who likewise,
three years later, encouraged the idea of a voyage in search of
the north-western route, the command of which was entrusted to
Munk. The locality which was thought to offer most likelihood of
a passage seems to have been that part of Hudson Bay near the
mouth of the river now known as the Churchill, where observations
of the tide during Button's expedition had suggested the
existence of some connection with the Pacific, and had been named
Hubbart's Hope, after a member of that expedition. Munk (who had
with him two Englishmen, one at least of whom may have been in
Hudson Bay before) began by examining Ungava Bay, and then, after
traversing Hudson Strait, of which he made a map, sailed
south-west to a point near the Churchill, where he wintered.
Misfortune soon assailed his party, the greater part of which
succumbed to scurvy, while the survivors&mdash;Munk himself and
two others&mdash;with difficulty made their way home in the
smaller of their two vessels. Apart from some mapping of the
coasts, the voyage had achieved little in the way of geographical
discovery.</p>
<p>More was done by the English expeditions of Captains Luke Foxe
and Thomas James, who both sailed in 1631, and examined the whole
south-west shores of Hudson Bay, showing that continuous land
blocked the way. Foxe was an experienced seaman, hailing from
Hull, who had long been interested in Arctic discovery, and after
many efforts succeeded in gaining the support of Sir John
Wolstenholme, Sir Thomas Roe, and other influential men, the
result being that the <i>Charles</i>, a pinnace belonging to the
navy, was placed at his disposal. James was a man of more
education, but less nautical experience, who persuaded the
merchants of Bristol to fit out an expedition in rivalry to that
of Foxe. The two vessels sailed almost simultaneously, and both
carried out much the same programme, though they did not meet
till well on in the season. Both traced the south-west shores of
Hudson Bay until they linked their surveys with those of Hudson,
but whereas Foxe then returned north and explored the channel now
called after him, beyond the turning-point of Bylot and Baffin,
James decided to winter in the bay which has ever since borne his
name. He and his men suffered many hardships, and judging from
his own account, he was unusually unfortunate in the difficulties
from ice and other obstacles which he encountered. In 1632 he too
searched for the northern channel out of the bay, but failed to
find an outlet and returned home without accomplishing anything
very important. The result of the two expeditions was, however,
to show that no way out of the bay existed to the west, and
though the possibility of a passage to the north-west was not
disproved (Foxe seems on the contrary to have still felt
confident that one existed), the patrons of discovery were not
encouraged to make any more efforts. Both Foxe and James wrote
accounts of their voyages, that of Foxe&mdash;which embodied also
narratives of former attempts in the same direction&mdash;bearing
the quaint title <i>North-West Fox, or Fox from the North-West
Passage</i>. It contains a famous map, which shows the Arctic
regions as then known with a remarkable degree of accuracy. A
portion is here reproduced in facsimile. While Foxe's narrative
was somewhat rugged in style, that of James, who was a man of
some culture, possessed a good deal of literary merit, and from
the first attracted some attention.</p>

<br>
<p>We must now return to Spitsbergen, to which the large number
of whales and other marine animals reported by Hudson attracted
adventurers of various nationalities in increasing numbers during
the early part of the seventeenth century, leading incidentally
to a considerable increase of geographical knowledge. The English
were first in the field, though they were driven to seek the aid
of the Biscayans as experts in the fishery. From 1610 onwards the
Muscovy Company sent up vessels yearly, the earliest voyages
being made under Captains Jonas Poole and Thomas Edge
(1610-1612), who examined various bays on the west coast. An
English interloper. Captain Marmaduke, was also hunting walruses
in the Spitsbergen seas during these years, and in 1612 visited
some of the bays on the north coast, besides going north to 82°.
A Dutch and a Spanish ship&mdash;the former commanded by Willem
van Muijden&mdash;also found their way there, piloted by
Englishmen, former employés of the Muscovy Company. In
1613&mdash;a charter giving this company exclusive rights to the
fishery having been obtained from King James&mdash;a fleet of
seven vessels was despatched under Captain Benjamin Joseph, and
this, as we have seen, had as chief pilot Baffin, who wrote the
account of the voyage. The "Vice-Admiral" was commanded by Thomas
Marmaduke of Hull. In the following year a still larger fleet was
sent under Joseph and Edge, Baffin holding the same position as
before. A narrative was written by Robert Fotherby, master's mate
in the <i>Thomasine</i> (in which Baffin also sailed), who took a
foremost part in the endeavour to explore new portions of the
coast-line. Several attempts were made by himself and Baffin to
trace the northern coast, and, pushing their way partly by boat
partly on land, they at last succeeded in reaching the entrance
to Wijde Bay, which they called Sir Thomas Smith's inlet. The ice
was particularly close inshore during this year, and it was only
at the close of the season that they were able to bring their
ship round to the same point. The Dutch were also in full force,
and established their claim to a share in the fishery, which had
been successfully resisted by the English the year before. Two
ships, in one of which was the pilot Joris Carolus, were
specially set apart for discovery, but the ice apparently
prevented them from effecting much. From a map drawn by Carolus,
which shows land to the east of Spitsbergen, it has been thought
that some exploration was done in this direction, but this is
exceedingly doubtful.</p>
<p>From this time onward the Dutch, as represented by the
"Noordsche Compagnie", were more and more active, and in time
established a virtual monopoly of the fishery, their chief
quarters being at Smeerenberg, at the south-east end of Amsterdam
Island. The Muscovy Company continued to send ships for a time,
and in 1616 Thomas Edge was active in the south-east, where the
small Hope Island seems to have been already reached in 1613.
Besides Edge Island, "other islands lying to the northwards as
farre as 78°" are said to have been discovered in 1616, while in
1617 the adventurous explorers pushed still farther, reaching 79°
or thereabout, probably by way of the Great Sound, afterwards
called Wijbe Jans Water. The narrow passage by which this
communicates at its upper end with the open sea to the east must
have been visited, for it received the name Heley Sound from one
of the most active captains in the Company's fleet. From some
point in this neighbourhood the third large island of the
group&mdash;North-east Land&mdash;seems to have been sighted. It
was named Sir Thomas Smith's Island, and so appears in the map
printed by Purchas in 1625, which is reproduced on the previous
page. Some doubt exists whether the islands now called Kong
Karl's Land were discovered in this year. Purchas states that an
island was discovered, which Edge named Witche's Island
(<i>i.e</i>. Wyche's, from Sir Peter Wyche, a leading member of
the Muscovy Company), and this is marked on the map just alluded
to as stretching from north to south for a long distance, to the
east of Edge Island. The latitude here assigned is too low for
Kong Karl's Land, so the idea that this was reached has been
discredited, but it is possible that, though not actually
visited, it was sighted, like North-east Land, from some point of
vantage near the head of Wijbe Jans Water.</p>

<p>As time went on the Dutch became more and more powerful
relatively to the English, and the latter suffered much at their
hands. The energies of all were concentrated on whaling
operations, and few important additions to geographical knowledge
were made for many years, though the coasts of the various
islands became in course of time more accurately represented on
the maps. Hinlopen Strait, between the two largest islands, must
have been discovered fairly early, as it is named after a
director of the Dutch Company who held office from 1617 onwards.
Events worthy of mention were the accidental wintering of an
English party (among whom was Edward Pelham) in 1630-31, and that
carried out of set purpose, by a Dutch party under Van der
Brugge, in 1633-34. The last event of geographical importance
connected with the early whaling enterprise was the voyage of
Cornells Gilies, or Giles, round the northern and eastern sides
of the group in 1707. But this, as well as one or two isolated
attempts at discovery in the direction of Novaya Zemlya towards
the close of the 17th century, must be left for a later chapter
(see p. 400).</p>

<h4>THE EAST INDIES, 1600-1700</h4>
<p><span class="a">Although</span> little positive geographical
discovery resulted from the early trading voyages of the Dutch
and English to the Eastern seas, it will be necessary briefly to
refer to them, as they were of considerable importance in
familiarising the navigators of those nations with voyages to the
newly discovered regions, and so leading the way to a future
extension of knowledge.</p>
<p>After the defeat of the Spanish Armada, the English were the
first to make the voyage by the route opened by the Portuguese,
but the first enterprise resulted in failure, although one of the
three ships engaged in it reached the Eastern seas. The fleet was
commanded by Captains Raymond and Lancaster, and set sail on
April 10, 1591. Raymond's ship was lost on the voyage, but
Lancaster in the <i>Edward Bonaventure</i>, after touching at
Zanzibar, doubled Cape Comorin in May 1592, and after sighting
the coast of Sumatra reached Penang in June. After touching at St
Helena on the return voyage the ship encountered baffling winds
and was forced to run for the West Indies. Here the crew met with
many adventures, and, after losing his ship, Lancaster returned
home in a ship of Dieppe, over three years having been spent on
the voyage. In 1594 Lancaster undertook a voyage to Pernambuco,
but no further effort to open an intercourse with the East was
made by the English until the closing year of the century, before
which the Dutch had already secured a share in the Indian
trade.</p>
<p>Like the English, the Dutch had begun by attempting the
discovery of a route to the East by way of the Arctic seas, and
it was only after the first unsuccessful voyage of Barents for
this end that the voyage to India by the Cape was determined on.
In February 1594-5 the first fleet, consisting of four ships,
sailed from the Texel under the command of Cornelis Houtman and
reached Bantam in Java in 1596. Here a long time was spent in
negotiations for a cargo of spices, but, owing apparently to the
machinations of the Portuguese, difficulties arose with the
governor, leading to Houtman's temporary imprisonment, and
eventually to open hostilities. The fleet sailed along the coast
of Java eastward, and again became involved in hostilities, but
was able finally to refresh on the east coast between Java and
Bali. The return was made along the south coast of Java, this
being the first recorded occasion on which any European vessel
had taken this course.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The voyage was
therefore useful as giving a more correct idea of the width of
the island than had before prevailed. Among the curiosities
brought home to Holland was a specimen of the cassowary,
presented to one of the captains while on the north coast of
Java, which must have been brought from Ceram or the Papuan
group.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The avoidance of the south coast of
Java is attributed by the Portuguese historian João de Barros to
the violent currents to which ships are there exposed. This fact
accounts for the exaggerated notions which had prevailed as to
the extent of the island. The sea south of Java had been
traversed, out of sight of land, by the remnant of Magellan's
expedition, which steered for the Cape of Good Hope from the west
end of Timor. According to Hondius's map, both Drake and
Cavendish traversed the same sea, passing between Java and Bali,
and this is confirmed by the accounts received by Houtman of the
arrival of European ships at the south-east end of Java at dates
corresponding to those of Drake's and Cavendish's voyages.]</p>

<br>
<p>Fleets now sailed in quick succession from the various Dutch
ports, whose merchants vied with each other in their efforts to
secure a share in the new trade. In 1598 a number of expeditions
sailed under different commanders. The merchants of Amsterdam and
Rotterdam despatched a fleet of eight ships under J. van Neck and
W. van Warwijck, which reached Banda, Amboina, and the Moluccas,
besides visiting Java. A part of the fleet, including van
Warwijck's vessel, touched on the voyage at Mauritius, which then
first received that name. No inhabitants were seen, but the
island proved a convenient halting-place, and a garden was fenced
in and planted for the benefit of future voyagers. The merchants
of Middelburg and Veere, headed by the family of the Moucherons,
fitted out two ships (the <i>Lion</i> and <i>Lioness</i>), which
they placed under the command of the brothers Cornelis and
Frederik Houtman. This expedition is of interest from the fact
that the great Arctic navigator, John Davis, was engaged to act
as chief pilot, and the account of the voyage written by him is
the only one extant. Ill-luck attended the expedition, which
reached Atjeh in Sumatra after touching at Fernando Noronha,
Table Bay (then called Saldanha Bay), Madagascar, the Comoros,
Maldivhs, and the coast of India near Cochin. Davis's narrative
contains interesting particulars respecting the countries
visited, mentioning among other points the peculiar clicking
sounds of the Hottentot language, which are likened to the
clucking of a brood-hen. It appears that the fame of Queen
Elizabeth as the successful rival of Spain had already reached
the East, and the Raja of Atjeh was particularly anxious to see
Davis and to learn about the English nation, but the Dutch
commander did all he could to keep him in the background. During
the stay there a treacherous attack was made upon the expedition,
during which Cornelis Houtman was killed and the ship only saved
by the gallantry of Davis and two comrades, one of them an
Englishman named Tomkins, who successfully defended the
poop.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> After a vain attempt to make the port
of Tennasserim, which Davis speaks of as a place of much trade, a
course was shaped for the Nicobars and the homeward voyage soon
afterwards commenced. In July 1600 Middelburg was reached and
Davis returned to England, where his services were soon secured
by the English East India Company for their first voyage.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> There appears to be no foundation for
the story that the elder Houtman escaped with his life and lived
some years among the natives.]</p>
<p>During the year 1598 various Dutch ships were also sent out to
attempt the passage to India <i>viâ</i> the Strait of Magellan.
On June 27 a fleet of five ships set sail from Rotterdam under
the command of Admiral James Mahu. Several Englishmen accompanied
the fleet&mdash;among them the pilot, William Adams. From the
outset the expedition was unfortunate, for soon after leaving the
Cape Verde Islands the Admiral died of fever, by which a large
proportion of the crews were disabled, while scurvy soon added to
their distress. A landing was effected on the coast of Lower
Guinea and a camp formed for the sick; but few supplies were
available and the fleet sailed for Annobom. Here the Dutch came
into collision with the Portuguese and also suffered severely
from fever, so it was resolved to steer for the Strait of
Magellan. Here the ships encountered very severe weather and,
after reaching the Pacific, soon became scattered. Two were
forced to re-enter the straits, and of these one eventually
crossed the Pacific to the Moluccas, where she fell into the
hands of the Portuguese. The other, under Sebald de Weert, fell
in with the outward-bound fleet of Olivier van Noort, but
returned home after visiting some small islands, probably
outliers of the Falklands. A single unsupported document has it
that a third ship&mdash;that commanded by Dirck
Gerritsz&mdash;was driven south to 64°, where a snow-clad
mountainous land was sighted; and on this insufficient basis some
have claimed for her commander the discovery of the South
Shetlands. This ship was taken by the Spaniards after reaching
Peru.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the rest of the fleet, under the command of Simon de
Cordes, and with the English pilot, William Adams, on board,
proceeded up the coast of Chile. No full account of the voyage is
in existence, but we are able to gather some details as to its
occurrences from the letters of Adams, written some years later
from Japan, and from the facts gleaned by Van Noort's squadron.
Misfortune still attended the voyagers. Landing at the island of
La Mocha, de Cordes and a number of his men were slain by the
natives,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> while the same fate befel the other
captain and a portion of his crew at Punta de Lavapie, opposite
Santa Maria Island. Not venturing to meet the Spaniards in their
weakened condition, and having on board a large supply of woollen
cloth which they hoped to dispose of in Japan, the newly elected
captains resolved to steer for that country (November 1599).
After crossing the Line some islands were met with, inhabited by
cannibals. They are placed by Adams in 16° N., or three degrees
south of the Sandwich group, which might otherwise seem to be
indicated. They were no doubt units of the Ladrone or Marianne
group, though in this case the length of time occupied by the
further voyage to Japan&mdash;almost equal to that taken up by
the voyage from Chile to the islands&mdash;is only to be
accounted for by the storms encountered in the Western Pacific.
These led to a parting of the ships, and only that in which Adams
sailed reached Bungo (the modern Oita) in Japan, the crew being
then at the last extremity. Adams was imprisoned for a time, but
afterwards rose high in the Emperor's favour, and was largely
instrumental in throwing open the trade with Japan to the Dutch.
He was never allowed to return to Europe, but died at Firando
(Hirado Island) about 1620.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> In the account given to Van Noort it
was said that Simon de Cordes was slain at the Punta de Lavapie,
but Adams gives Mocha Island as the scene of his death.]</p>
<p>The four ships of Van Noort already alluded to sailed from
Goeree only three months after the Rotterdam fleet (September
1598). Like the latter they touched at the coast of Lower Guinea
and then twice visited the coast of Brazil before proceeding to
the Strait of Magellan. Arrived in the South Sea, Van Noort was
attended with better success than his predecessors, taking a
Spanish ship on the coast of Chile, and then crossing over to the
Ladrones and Philippines by a route apparently diverging little
from Magellan's. Off the Philippines a Spanish ship was defeated
after a hot encounter, and a course was then shaped for Borneo,
where a halt was made at Brunei. Van Noort then proceeded to the
north coast of Java, and passing through the strait between that
island and Sumatra, steered for the Cape of Good Hope. He arrived
in Holland with one ship on August 26, 1601, being thus the first
Dutch captain to complete the circumnavigation of the
globe&mdash;a feat which it had taken full three years, to
accomplish. Although Van Noort had not passed out of the tracks
of previous navigators, his voyage was of service to his
countrymen, as much information was collected about countries of
the East, including Japan, not visited by his squadron.</p>
<p>The subsequent trading voyages of the Dutch to the East, while
of importance as tending to establish the supremacy of that
nation in the Archipelago, and so paving the way for the
discovery of Australia, lack the interest of novelty which
attaches to their earlier efforts. In pursuance of their object
the merchant adventurers showed no abatement of energy. Trading
companies had been formed at the various Dutch ports, whence
fleet after fleet was despatched to the East. In 1602 the various
companies were united to form the Dutch East India Company, with
an exclusive charter prohibiting other Dutch subjects from
trading to the East, either by the Cape or by the Strait of
Magellan. The company's fleets engaged in open hostilities with
the Portuguese, while trading stations were rapidly established
in Java and Ceylon, as well as on the Malabar and Coromandel
coasts. By 1607 the Dutch had gained possession of the Spice
Islands and had factories in all the countries of the East from
Persia to Japan. In 1611 Pieter Both, the first Governor-General,
established a post at Jacatra in Java, some distance east of
Bantam, giving it the name Batavia; and in 1619 the Residence was
transferred by the fourth governor, Jans Pieterszoon Coen, to
this site, which thenceforth became the capital of the Dutch
possessions. Some of the voyages thus undertaken were of interest
from the point of view of geographical discovery, but before
speaking of them we must resume the thread of English
adventure.</p>
<p>In spite of the ill-success of the first English voyage to the
East, the wish to establish a direct trade with India still
animated the English merchants, but nothing was done until 1599
when, the Dutch having raised the price of pepper from 3<i>s</i>.
to 6<i>s</i>. and 8<i>s</i>. a pound, a memorial was addressed to
Queen Elizabeth on the subject of the formation of an association
for the object in view. The Queen favoured the proposal, and on
December 31, 1600, granted a charter of incorporation to the
English East India Company as "The Governor and Company of
Merchants of London trading into the East Indies." She also sent
Sir J. Mildenhall to the court of the Great Mogul to solicit his
favour for the company. Before the signing of the charter
preparations for an expedition had been pushed forward, Captain
James Lancaster being again placed at its head. Four "tall"
ships&mdash;the <i>Dragon, Hector, Ascension</i>, and
<i>Susan</i>, besides a victualler, the <i>Guest</i>&mdash;were
employed. As before mentioned, the services of John Davis were
secured for the expedition, which left Woolwich on February 13,
and Tor Bay on April 18, 1601. After touching at the Canaries and
suffering much from scurvy and from adverse winds during the
passage across the Atlantic, it put in at Saldanha Bay (Table
Bay) on September 9. The great use of lemon-juice as a preventive
of scurvy was fully demonstrated on this voyage, as the crew of
Lancaster's ship, who were provided with it, suffered far less
than those of the others. After a stay at Table Bay, and another
on the coast of Madagascar, the ships set sail for India on March
6, 1602, and fell in with an island called Roquepiz, the
identification of which is a matter of some difficulty. Then,
after passing amongst the Chagos Islands and banks, where the
ships were in much danger from sunken reefs, the Nicobar Islands
were reached on May 9, and Atjeh on May 29. A letter from the
Queen was presented to the King of Atjeh, who gave the voyagers a
cordial reception. Some pepper was obtained, but owing to the bad
season it was very scarce. More, however, was obtained at
Priaman, and at Bantam, whither the ships afterwards proceeded,
having first taken a merchant ship, sailing under Portuguese
colours, in the straits of Malacca. Agents were left at Bantam
and others despatched to the Moluccas, to establish a factory
there in readiness for the next arrival of ships from England. On
February 20, 1603, the homeward voyage commenced, the ships
passing through the Sunda Strait. Before rounding the Cape great
storms were encountered, in which the rudder of Lancaster's ship
was lost, and the voyagers were driven southwards into the hail
and snow of the South Atlantic; but after great exertions a
temporary rudder was arranged, and St Helena sighted on June 16,
the ships having been three months out of sight of land. Finally
they anchored in the Downs on September 11, and the voyage was
brought to a successful termination, two and a half years from
its commencement.</p>
<p>The second expedition was placed under the command of Captain
Henry Middleton, who had accompanied Lancaster in 1601, and the
same four ships were again sent out. Again the crews suffered
severely from scurvy, and on this account the General put in,
contrary to his instructions, at Table Bay, afterwards crossing
the Indian Ocean without touching anywhere until the island of
Engano, off the south coast of Sumatra, was sighted. From Bantam,
where the merchants left on the preceding voyage were
established, the <i>Hector</i> and <i>Susan</i> were sent home
after loading with a cargo of pepper, while Middleton proceeded
(Jan. 1605) with the other two ships to the more eastern parts of
the Archipelago. During this time great mortality prevailed among
the crews owing to an outbreak of dysentery brought on by
drinking the Bantam water. A large Dutch fleet under Van der
Hagen had arrived at Bantam two days before the English, and it
soon followed them on their eastward voyage. At Amboina, where,
owing to the peace lately concluded (1604) between England and
Spain, Middleton had established friendly relations with the
Portuguese governor, all hope of trade was removed by the arrival
of this fleet and the surrender of the Portuguese fort. Middleton
therefore resolved, much against the views of his associates, to
send the <i>Ascension</i> to Banda, while he himself proceeded to
the Moluccas proper, to try for a cargo of cloves. Here too the
arrival of the Dutch, followed by the destruction of the
Portuguese fort at Tidor, and the surrender of the survivors of
its garrison, put many difficulties in his way, but a certain
amount of trade was done, and in spite of some rather high-handed
proceedings on the part of the Dutch, the English commander was
able to remain on fairly friendly terms with both factions. On
the return voyage the <i>Hector</i> was found in a disabled
condition off the Cape, having lost the greater part of her crew,
which it had been necessary to reinforce with a number of
Chinamen before leaving Bantam. The <i>Susan</i> had been lost
during the passage. The three remaining ships continued the
voyage in company, and reached the Downs on May 6, 1606.</p>
<p>By opening a trade with the Moluccas, which had not been
visited by Englishmen since Drake's time, Middleton had done more
than the company had ventured to expect, and he was knighted for
his services immediately on his return. The company now
determined to extend their operations, and turned their eyes to
the mainland of India, whither one of the ships of the next
voyage was commissioned to proceed. The three vessels sent out in
1607 were under the command of Captain Keeling, who had
accompanied Sir Henry Middleton in 1604. In the new voyage he
sailed in the <i>Dragon</i>, while the <i>Hector</i> and
<i>Consent</i> were commanded respectively by Captains Hawkins
and David Middleton, the latter of whom, as it turned out, made
the voyage independently. The course taken by the <i>Dragon</i>
and <i>Hector</i> differed from that followed in previous
voyages, for they put in at Sierra Leone for the purpose of
watering, and here a stone was set up, engraved with the names of
Captains Keeling and Hawkins, near another which bore the names
of Drake and Cavendish. After refreshing at Saldanha, and again
touching at St Augustine's Bay, Madagascar, they proceeded to
Abd-el-Kuri and Sokotra, where valuable information was collected
as to the system of the monsoons and currents, and the navigation
to Aden, Surat, and Cambay. After leaving Sokotra, the ships
parted company, the <i>Hector</i> proceeding to Surat, whence
Hawkins sent his ship on to Bantam, and travelled overland to the
court of Jehangir; his journey resulting in the acquisition of
information, of much value to the company, regarding the state of
affairs in India. Keeling proceeded to Priaman and Bantam, and
afterwards to Banda; some useful hydrographical observations
being made during the voyage. Trade was again hampered by the
arbitrary proceedings of the Dutch, who were then at war with the
natives. Since Middleton's voyage they had been driven out of
Ternate and Tidor (1606), and their admiral, Paul van Caerden,
was in 1608 taken prisoner there, remaining in captivity over a
year.</p>
<p>The fourth voyage, under Captains Sharpeigh and Rowles, was
unfortunate. After visiting Aden, and Mokha on the Red Sea,
Sharpeigh proceeded to India, where his ship was wrecked in the
Gulf of Cambay. Sharpeigh visited Agra, while others of his crew
travelled in various directions, a sailor named Nichols making
his way across the peninsula to Masulipatam, while Captain Robert
Coverte returned to Europe through India, Persia, and Turkey. The
latter wrote an account both of the voyage and of his own
travels. The fifth voyage sent out by the East India Company was
under the command of Captain David Middleton, who in 1610
obtained a cargo of spice at Pulo Way, being, like Keeling,
hindered by the Dutch from loading at Banda. In the sixth voyage
Sir Henry Middleton was general, the second in command being
Captain Nicholas Downton. The ships proceeded to Aden, which was
found to have lost much of its former importance, and to Mokha,
where Middleton was made a prisoner, and taken inland to Sanâ.
Having at length effected his escape, he sailed for Surat, where
many impediments were put in his way by the Portuguese.
Subsequently reaching the Archipelago, his ship, the <i>Trade's
Increase</i>, the largest English merchant vessel of the time,
capsized while being repaired, and Middleton soon afterwards died
of grief at the partial failure of the voyage. It was, however,
important as leading the way to the English intercourse with
Western India, which subsequently attained such great
proportions.</p>
<p>Of the subsequent voyages only those can be spoken of which
were especially noteworthy as leading in new directions. During
the seventh, which sailed in 1611 under Captain Hippon, the
<i>Globe</i> visited the Coromandel coast and Siam, where
factories were established both at Patani&mdash;then an important
trade centre&mdash;and at Ayuthia, the capital. Two of the
factors were even sent inland to Chieng-mai or Zimmé, which had
been visited in the previous century by Fernão Mendez Pinto and
by Ralph Fitch, and which has come into prominence in modern
times in connection with railway projects in Siam. One of these
agents, Thomas Samuel, was a year or two later (1615) taken
prisoner to Pegu on the capture of Chieng-mai by the king of that
country, and died there.</p>
<p>The eighth voyage (1611-13), under Captain John Saris in the
<i>Clove</i>, was important as leading further afield than any of
the previous ventures, Japan being for the first time reached by
an English vessel. After visiting Sokotra and cruising for some
time in the Red Sea, where Saris met Sir Henry Middleton, the
<i>Clove</i> sailed for Bantam, and thence for the Moluccas,
where, after touching at various points, anchor was finally cast
in the road of Pelebere (or Poliweri) off Makian. Here, as usual,
some opposition was met with from the Dutch, who at the time had
forts on Ternate, Tidor, and Makian, though the Spaniards still
maintained a footing in Tidor. Continuing his voyage towards the
north, and touching to refresh on the northern portion of Jilolo,
Saris set sail for Japan, and passing among the Liu-kiu Islands,
reached Firando (Hirado) after a month's voyage. Here Saris
received a visit from William Adams, and leaving Richard Cocks,
the principal merchant of the voyage, to establish a factory,
proceeded <i>viâ</i> Osaka and the overland route to Yedo (Tokio)
to hand over the presents sent by the Company to the Emperor. His
journal gives interesting particulars respecting the Japanese
cities, of which Kioto or Miako was then the largest. On Saris's
departure Cocks was left at Firando to superintend the factory,
which he did for seven years. During this time the establishment
of trade between Japan and Siam was kept constantly in view, and
Adams more than once sailed for the latter country, but the
efforts of the merchants met with slight success. Saris's voyage
resulted in a considerable improvement in the knowledge of the
navigation of the Eastern seas, and his journal contains
instructive remarks on the currents, monsoons, etc., as observed
by him. He was able to introduce many corrections into the
charts, his latitudes for Cape Comorin, the island of Batjan, and
other places, being nearer the truth than those previously
accepted. Between Sokotra and Bantam he sailed through the 8°
channel between the Maldivhs and Minicoy, and was thus able to
define correctly the termination of the Maldivh group towards the
north, while Firando in Japan, the terminus of his voyage, is
given within 8' of its true latitude.</p>
<p>The only other voyage to which separate allusion can be made
is that of Captain Best, which was begun in 1612, and by the
victory gained over an overwhelming Portuguese fleet at Swally,
the port of Surat, opened up Western India to British enterprise.
A result of this victory was the despatch of Sir Thomas Roe, in
1615, as ambassador to Jehangir. To his travels reference will be
made presently. A few years later trade was opened with the
Persian Gulf, but Bantam in Java still remained the Company's
principal factory in the East, until, between 1618 and 1623, the
British merchants were expelled from all their posts in the
Archipelago by the Dutch, who thus became supreme in that
quarter, and were for a long time practically alone in carrying
on the work of exploration in the regions beyond.</p>
<br>
<p>It remains to speak of the attempts&mdash;insignificant
compared with those of the Dutch and English&mdash;made by the
French at this time to open up intercourse with the East.
Although this nation was the first to encroach upon the grounds
occupied by the Portuguese, the early enterprises of Gonneville,
Parmentier, and others, in the first half of the sixteenth
century, led to no practical result, and not till the next
century had commenced did the French merchants again bestir
themselves to secure a share in the eastern trade. A company was
then formed by some citizens of St Malo, Laval, and Vitré, and
two vessels were fitted out and placed under the command of
Michel Frotet de la Bardelière, who sailed in the
<i>Croissant</i>. The other ship, the <i>Corbin</i>, was
commanded by François Grout, and an Englishman was included among
the crew as pilot. The expedition sailed in 1601, but was
unfortunate from the first owing to severe attacks of scurvy and
want of discipline. The <i>Croissant</i> reached Atjeh in July
1602, but left again without doing much trade. The General died
on December 1, and after reaching the Azores the enfeebled
remnant of the crew were rescued from their sinking ship by some
Dutch vessels. The voyage is principally remarkable for the
adventures of François Pyrard, who sailed in the <i>Corbin</i>,
and after his return wrote a full account of his experiences,
together with valuable information on the countries visited. The
<i>Corbin</i> was wrecked on one of the Maldivhs, and the crew
made prisoners. Pyrard soon acquired the language and gained
favour with the king, but had not obtained leave to depart when
at length, after five years, a hostile expedition arrived from
Chittagong. The king was slain, and Pyrard with three companions,
the sole remnant of the crew, was taken to India. He gives a most
valuable account of the Maldivhs, and of the manners and customs
of the people; and so few have been European visitors to the
islands that this remained practically the standard authority on
the subject down to our own times.</p>
<p>Pyrard's stay at Chittagong was brief, but it enabled him to
collect a few particulars respecting Bengal and its productions,
the river Ganges, etc. On the Malabar coast, whither he then
proceeded, he went through many adventures and was for some time
kept a prisoner by the Portuguese. After his release he collected
much information respecting Western India and its inhabitants,
and particularly about Goa and the Portuguese government in
India&mdash;then hopelessly corrupt&mdash;and the growing
encroachments of the Dutch. His account is of special value from
the fact that this period is little touched upon by Portuguese
historians. He accompanied Portuguese expeditions to Cambay and
the Moluccas, and gives a full account of the trade of
south-eastern Asia, which still centred in the great emporium of
Malacca; describing also the Portuguese possessions on the
African coasts. At last, in the winter of 1609-10, Pyrard, with
other foreigners, whose numbers had become inconvenient to the
authorities, was placed on board the homeward-bound fleet, and
reached Europe, not without further adventures, after an absence
of ten years. The ship in which Pyrard sailed was wrecked on the
coast of Brazil, and his sojourn at Bahia, whilst waiting for an
opportunity to return to Europe, gave him the means of gathering
some information on the Portuguese possessions in that part of
the globe.</p>
<p>Two other French travellers, mentioned by Pyrard in his book,
may be briefly referred to here. Jean Mocquet, apothecary to
Henry IV of France, travelled extensively both in the East and
West (West Africa, Guiana, Morocco, India, and the Holy Land)
between 1601 and 1611&mdash;exactly the period occupied by
Pyrard's voyage&mdash;and in 1617 published in Paris an account
of his travels. He had sailed to Goa as apothecary to the Conde
de Feira, and returned in that capacity, in the same fleet as
Pyrard, with the great captain Furtado de Mendoça. The other
traveller was the Sieur de Feynes, Comte de Montfart, who in 1604
had reached Goa by the overland route <i>via</i> Aleppo, Isfahan,
and Ormuz. The first account of his journeys was published in
English in 1615 by a French resident in London. Doubt has been
thrown on the genuineness of his travels, but the references of
Pyrard and Mocquet confirm the general truth of his account.</p>
<p>No further attempt to open up trade with the East was made
until 1616, when some merchants of Paris and Rouen formed a
company and fitted out two ships for a voyage to India. The
command was given to a captain named De Nets, the smaller ship
sailing under Augustin de Beaulieu, who had already in 1612
accompanied a French expedition to the Gambia, and had shown
himself a skilful seaman. The expedition met with only partial
success, one of the ships being abandoned for want of sufficient
hands. In 1619 Beaulieu sailed again with three ships, and though
the results from a commercial point of view were not great, the
voyage has attained a considerable degree of celebrity by reason
of the careful observations on the countries visited made by the
commander, and contained in his journal, published in Thévenot's
celebrated collection of voyages. The variation of the compass
engaged the special attention of Beaulieu, who was able to show
that the variations were less regular than had been supposed. An
accurate description is given of the narwhal, two of which were
seen on the voyage. Some time was spent at the Cape on the way
out, and an interesting reconnaissance made of the district
behind Table Mountain. The modern Table Bay already receives that
name in Beaulieu's narrative, although the old name Saldanha Bay
is retained by contemporary, and even by some subsequent writers.
During a stay of 15 days at St Augustine's Bay, Madagascar,
Beaulieu attempted an exploration of the valley of the river
which enters the head of the bay; and though hindered by the
thickness of the brushwood, he climbed to a certain height and
assured himself of the importance of the river, which, he says,
seemed as broad as the Seine a league below Rouen. This must have
been the Onilahi, the principal river of south Madagascar. After
correcting the position on the chart of the Angoche and other
small islands on the African coast, Beaulieu sailed for the
Comoro Islands, of which he gives a fuller account than is found
in most of the early narratives. This is especially the case of
Angasija, or Great Comoro, which on account of its want of good
anchorages has down to the present day been less visited than the
other islands of the group. Having at length reached Sumatra, a
long time was spent at Atjeh in wearisome negotiations for a
cargo of pepper. Bantam being inaccessible owing to its
investment by the Dutch. One of the ships, which had proceeded to
Jacatra (Batavia), was burnt, apparently through Dutch treachery,
but Beaulieu at length set sail for France with a fair cargo,
passing through the Mentawei ("Montabay") Islands off the
south-west coast of Sumatra, and introducing some corrections
into the charts of that locality. He reached France in December,
1622.</p>
<br>
<p>Before continuing the story of maritime discovery in the far
East, we may close this chapter by referring to some of the most
famous travellers to southern Asia&mdash;chiefly by the overland
route&mdash;during the seventeenth century, although by so doing
it will be necessary to anticipate somewhat the progress of
events in other quarters. With the opening of maritime trade to
the East by the rivals of the Portuguese, the love of adventure
led a host of travellers&mdash;Dutch, French, English, and
German, as well as some of nationalities previously
represented&mdash;to visit the famous empires of those regions;
and as many of them published narratives of their journeys, the
result was a decided spread of knowledge respecting those
countries, although strictly geographical discoveries could
hardly be expected.</p>
<p>Of all the narratives of eastern travel which appeared during
the seventeenth century, the first in point of date of the
journeys was that of the French adventurer Vincent le Blanc, who
during forty years ranged over most of the eastern world, from
Syria, Arabia, and Samarkand, to Pegu, Siam, and Java, and in
Africa gained acquaintance with Abyssinia, Egypt, and Morocco.
But the greater part of his journeys were made before the end of
the sixteenth century, while his narrative&mdash;first published,
after his death, in 1648&mdash;shows much ignorance and want of
discrimination, even if it be not&mdash;as some have
thought&mdash;largely fictitious. A Portuguese traveller, Pedro
Teixeira, whose wanderings were almost as extensive, published
his narrative in 1610, but he too started on his travels before
the end of the previous century. Of his first journey nothing is
known except that after residing for some time in Persia and
Ormuz, he found himself at Malacca in 1600, and returned to
Portugal by way of the Archipelago (Sumatra, Borneo, the
Philippines) and Mexico. He set out again in 1604, and after
visiting Maskat and Ormuz returned by Baghdad to Aleppo, and
thence through Cyprus, Rhodes, etc., to Venice, and ultimately to
Antwerp. The desire of seeing foreign countries led an eccentric
Englishman, Thomas Coryat, to the East a few years later. Coryat
had held a small post in Prince Henry's establishment, but in
1608 started on a tour through Europe, which he described in a
book bearing the quaint title <i>Coryat his Crudities hastily
gobled up</i> etc. In spite of the eccentricities of the author,
this was of some real value as one of the first detailed
descriptions of European countries published in England. In 1612
Coryat started on more extended travels, which took him through
Asia Minor, the Holy Land, and Mesopotamia, to Persia and even to
Kandahar, whence he reached India in 1616. Here he died the
following year, and therefore never wrote a narrative of these
journeys, but some of his letters to friends from the East were
published, the last being dated from Agra, October, 1616.</p>
<p>Disappointment in a love affair was the cause of the travels,
about the same time, of an Italian, Pietro della Valle, who in
1614 left Venice on a pilgrimage to the holy places of the East,
taking the title "Il Pellegrino" by which he was afterwards
generally known. From Jerusalem he went by Damascus to Aleppo,
and on to Baghdad and the ruins of Babylon. At Baghdad he married
a beautiful Circassian, who accompanied him on his travels till
her death, and whose body was embalmed and taken to Italy. Delia
Valle made his way to the court of the Persian Emperor, and in
1621, after a visit to the ruins of Persepolis, reached Shiraz,
and Lar on the Persian Gulf, whence he made his way to India.
After extensive travels in that country he sailed for Maskat in
1624, and returned to Europe <i>viâ</i> Bassora and Aleppo. His
voyages, the publication of which was completed at Rome after his
death in 1652, contain many interesting particulars concerning
the countries through which he passed.</p>
<p>The above were private adventurers, but others of the number
held more or less official positions as envoys to the courts of
Eastern monarchs. Such was Sir Thomas Roe, whose embassy to the
court of the Great Mogul in the interests of British trade has
already been referred to. Roe, who had previously made a voyage
up the Amazon and on the coast of Guiana, was one of the most
capable agents employed by the East India Company. He arrived at
Swally Road in September, 1615, and after much obstruction on the
part of the authorities, made his way to the court of Jehangir at
Ajmere before the end of the year, passing through Burhanpur,
where he suffered a severe attack of fever. He spent nearly three
years in wearisome negociations with the Emperor and his
ministers, and his journal, first published by Purchas, contains,
besides the narrative of his journey, much valuable information
as to the events then going forward in India. During Roe's
residence in India, Edward Terry, an Oxford graduate&mdash;who
had sailed in 1616 in one of the East India Company's fleets, and
who, after his return to Europe, also wrote an account of his
experiences&mdash;joined him as chaplain. Another of the
Company's servants who travelled in India at this time was
William Methold, who in 1622 visited the diamond mines of
Golconda, and gave the first account of them ever published by an
English writer.</p>

<br>
<p>Persia, too, was the goal of various embassies during the
early part of the seventeenth century. In 1599 Sir Anthony
Shirley, a relative by marriage of the Earl of Essex, had
received from the latter an informal mission to that country,
whither he proceeded with his brother Robert by the overland
route <i>viâ</i> Aleppo so often followed at this time. Sir
Anthony soon returned to Europe, where (having fallen into
disfavour in England) he wandered from one court to another,
sometimes well received but finally
discredited.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Robert (afterwards Sir Robert)
Shirley stayed longer in Persia, and subsequently undertook
various embassies, on behalf of the Shah, to the countries of
Europe, including Great Britain, where he was well received by
James I. He returned to Persia for the last time in 1627 in
company with the English agent Sir Dodmore Cotton, but was coldly
received on his arrival at Kasvin, and died shortly afterwards.
Cotton had another companion on his mission to Persia, whose
account of his travels attained considerable celebrity. This was
Sir Thomas Herbert, who after reaching Kasvin (where Cotton too
died), made extensive journeys in Persia, afterwards visiting
India and Ceylon, whence he returned to Europe in 1627, by
Mauritius and St Helena. His narrative contains many curious
observations on the countries visited, and the objects of
interest observed. Among the latter was the dodo, Herbert's
quaint account of which is one of the earliest we possess.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The Emperor Rudolf II, by whom he was
well received at Prague, despatched him in 1605 on a mission to
the court of Morocco, an account of which appeared in 1609.]</p>
<p>The next embassy to Persia which need detain us was that sent
through Russia by the Duke of Holstein in 1633, with a view to
opening up a trade with the East for his subjects. The secretary
to the ambassadors was the celebrated Adam Olearius, while
another of the party was J.A. de Mandelslo, an intimate friend of
the former and previously page to the Duke. The ambassadors
proceeded no further than Persia, but Mandelslo, who had obtained
leave to go on to India, embarked at Ormuz in 1638, and landing
at Surat, travelled first to Agra, and afterwards made the voyage
to Goa and Ceylon, returning to Europe by the Cape. The account
of his journeys was published after his death (1644), from his
letters, by Olearius, as a supplement to the latter's own
description of Russia and Persia. It contained information
collected by Mandelslo respecting countries of the East not
visited by him personally, and in a subsequent edition was
enlarged by the addition of extraneous matter. Both Olearius and
Mandelslo were men of education, and made astronomical
observations during their journeys. In the second half of the
century a Russian embassy to Persia was accompanied by a
Spaniard, Don Pedro Cubero, who likewise visited India but
returned to Europe by the Philippines and Mexico, publishing an
account of his nine years' travels at Madrid in 1680. The Swedish
embassy to the same country in 1683, under Louis Fabricius, may
also be mentioned here. It is noteworthy through the part taken
in it by the celebrated traveller Engelbrecht Kaempfer, a German
physician and naturalist, who after crossing Persia to Gombrun
joined a Dutch fleet as surgeon (1688), visited north and south
India and Batavia, and thence went to Japan, where he remained
three years, collecting valuable material for an account of that
country. After his return to Europe in 1693 he published an
account of his travels under the title <i>Amoenitates
Exoticae</i>, which appeared in 1712. His history of Japan, the
best known of his works, was published, after his death, from his
MSS.</p>
<p>The work of missionary travellers to the far East will be
spoken of in another chapter, but the journeys of one of their
number, as concerned also with western Asia, may be suitably
touched upon here. Père Alexandre de Rhodes, a French Jesuit,
started for the Indies in 1618, and a few years later was sent to
labour in Cochin China. Here and in Tongking he maintained an
uphill fight for many years against difficulties and
persecutions, until finally obliged to abandon the country. After
visiting the Archipelago he returned to Europe through Persia,
Armenia, and Asia Minor, returning in 1660 to Persia, where he
died. He published an account of his travels in 1653.</p>
<p>As time went on, travellers to the East became more and more
numerous, and only the most famous can be briefly mentioned. Jean
Baptiste Tavernier, the son of a Dutch map-seller settled in
Paris, began his extensive travels by visiting most of the
countries of Europe, and in 1631 joined a caravan to Persia,
where his trading ventures met with such success that he devoted
himself for the future to eastern commerce, buying diamonds and
other precious stones to dispose of in Europe. After various
journeys he fell ill on the Volga and died at Moscow in 1689. His
Voyages, published in Paris in 1677-79, are a valuable authority
on the trade and trade-routes of the East at the time, and
especially on the diamond and other mines of India. Another
famous French traveller, François Bernier, started for the East
in 1654, and after visiting Syria and Egypt made his way to
India, where he resided some years as physician to Aurungzeb. His
accounts of the political affairs of the Mogul empire, first
published in 1670-71, give a valuable insight into the events of
the time, while his description of Kashmir, which he visited
himself, is the earliest, in any detail, that we possess.</p>
<p>Jean de Thévenot, nephew of the celebrated collector of
travels, Melchisedek Thévenot (himself, too, a traveller of some
note), made two extensive tours in the East, and died at Tauris
in 1667 on his final return from India through Persia. His
travels were afterwards published at Paris in 1684. Sir John
Chardin, who, like Tavernier, was interested in the diamond
trade, was the son of a Paris jeweller. During two separate
visits to the East, he resided many years in Persia, and paid
some attention to its antiquities and history. He was knighted by
Charles II during a residence in London, where he commenced the
publication of his memoirs in 1686. The list may be closed with
the name of Dr John Fryer, a Cambridge graduate, who between 1672
and 1682 travelled through India and Persia in the interests of
the East India Company, and wrote a <i>New account of East India
and Persia</i> (1698), one of the most readable descriptions of
India in the seventeenth century that we have.</p>
<p>A word or two must be devoted in conclusion to European
travellers in Further India during this period. The establishment
of English trade in Siam has already been spoken of. The Dutch
too devoted some attention to that country as well as to the
neighbouring kingdom of Cambodia, and their agents are said even
to have made journeys into the Laos countries on the Mekong.
After the early attempts of Père de Rhodes to found a mission in
Cochin China, these regions were the scene of much missionary
enterprise on the part of the French Jesuits. Between 1660 and
1662, three bishops in turn set out for Siam and the first and
third of these, Mgr de la Mothe, bishop of Beirut, and Mgr Pallu,
bishop of Persepolis, reached their destination in safety, taking
the overland route to the Persian Gulf, crossing India to
Masulipatam, and the Malay Peninsula near Tenasserim. The
overland passage from the Bay of Bengal to Siam <i>viâ</i>
Tenasserim, though involving many difficulties, was often used at
the time&mdash;among others by the servants of the East India
Company. It led up the Tenasserim river to Jelunga, whence it
crossed the watershed and debouched near the north-west corner of
the Gulf of Siam. An account of the journey of Mgr de la Mothe
was written by his companion M. de Bourges in 1666 while Pallu,
who after returning to France went out again in 1670-73,
published an account of his own journeys in 1682. Other
missionaries soon made their way to Siam, but French intercourse
with the country was not kept up only by these, for various
embassies were about this time exchanged between Louis XIV and
the king of Siam. The first French mission was headed (1685) by
the Chevalier de Chaumont, in whose company various ecclesiastics
sailed, including the Jesuit Tachard, and five others of his
order destined for China. Two accounts of the embassy were
written, one by the Jesuit just mentioned. In 1687-88 another
French embassy reached Siam under M. de la Loubère, whose account
of the country, published in 1691, is the best that has come down
to us from this period. M. Tachard made the voyage a second time
with La Loubère, and again published an account of his
experiences. After this second embassy, French interest in the
affairs of Siam seems to have declined.</p>
<p>For the neighbouring countries on the east coast of Further
India the various missionary reports, beginning with those of
Pere de Rhodes, contain the best contemporary information. Many
of the later accounts of the Jesuits were included in the
<i>Lettres Édifiantes et Curieuses</i> of Legobien and Du
Halde.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<h4>AUSTRALIA AND THE PACIFIC, 1605-42</h4>
<p><span class="a">We</span> have reserved for a separate chapter
the continuation of our narrative of Dutch voyages to the East,
from the importance which attaches to them as finally setting at
rest the question of the existence of a continental land to the
south-east of Asia&mdash;the last great question of the kind to
attain solution if we except the Antarctic problem, still but
partially solved in our own day. The rapidly-narrowing limits of
the unknown gave, in fact, little room for uncertainty as to the
broad distribution of land and water on the globe, except just in
the quarter where Australia was soon to be disclosed in its main
outlines. We have already referred to the general belief in the
existence of a Southern Continent, to which the discovery of the
Strait of Magellan&mdash;apparently separating South America from
another land-mass to the south&mdash;seemed to give confirmation,
and which led all navigators who lighted upon new lands to the
south to connect their discoveries with the same mysterious land.
The old notion that Java formed the northern extremity of this
supposed continent had not completely died out at the close of
the sixteenth century,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> in spite of the fact
that Del Cano, Drake, and Cavendish had all passed to the
southward of the island. As we have seen, the first Dutch Eastern
voyage, under Houtman in 1595-96, finally set this doubt at rest
as regarded Java, but it was not until many years later that the
insular character of New Guinea was fully recognised, although
the existence of a strait separating it from a larger land to the
south had been surmised if not actually proved before the
sixteenth century closed, as is seen from maps of Mercator,
Hondius, Wytfliet and others. When therefore the Dutch applied
themselves to southern discovery soon after their arrival in the
East, a practically untouched field lay before them in the
direction of Australia, for even conceding the possibility that
its coasts had been sighted during the early part of the
sixteenth century&mdash;and of this no satisfactory proof
exists&mdash;there is no doubt that geographers generally, and
those of Holland in particular, were totally ignorant of any such
discovery at the end of the same century.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Thus Linschoten, whose great work was
published in 1595-6, still expressed a doubt as to the insular
character of Java.]</p>
<p>The point to which attention was first directed was New
Guinea. On the despatch of a vessel, the <i>Duifken</i> or
"Little Dove", in 1602 for the purpose of opening up trade with
Ceram, the Dutch authorities in Banda had already in mind the
acquisition of fuller knowledge respecting "Nova Guinea", and
although little was then accomplished, more success attended the
voyage of the <i>Duifken</i> in 1605.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The
vessel, commanded by Willem Janszoon of Amsterdam, sailed from
Bantam on November 28 of that year, bound for the eastern parts
of the Archipelago. After touching at the Ke and Aru groups the
<i>Duifken</i> appears to have reached the coast of New Guinea in
Lat. 5° S. and to have followed the shores round Prince Frederick
Henry Island as far as the beginning of Torres Strait. Then
steering south the Dutch vessel traced the eastern shores of the
Gulf of Carpentaria, as far as 13° 45' S., having thus&mdash;for
the first time so far as record exists&mdash;sighted the coasts
of Australia. The true nature of Torres Strait&mdash;owing no
doubt to the islands with which it is strewn&mdash;was not
recognised, but the whole of the land seen was supposed to form
part of New Guinea. The greater part was uninhabited, but on one
or more occasions natives were seen, who are described as wild
and black savages. Nine of the crew were murdered by them while
attempting to open up trade. The farthest point reached was named
Cape Keerweer ("Turn-again"), while&mdash;as we learn from a map
of Janssonius first published in 1633, which embodies the results
of the voyage&mdash;other names were given to points touched at,
Prince Frederick Henry Island and the opposite coast being laid
down respectively as Tyuri and Modder Eylandt. Some doubt has
been thrown on the statement that the <i>Duifken</i> reached the
latitude mentioned, and the attempt has been made to prove that
the ship did not even reach the entrance to Torres Strait. This
is due to the fact that subsequent explorers placed a "Cape
Keerweer" in the vicinity of Prince Frederick Henry Island; but
as the instructions to Tasman make mention of a chart by the
officers of the <i>Duifken</i> showing the Cape in 13° 45' S.,
while we learn from the journal of a subsequent voyage (that of
Carstenszoon in 1623) that the <i>Duifken</i> had at least been
in 11° 48' S., the objection has little weight.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The instructions to Tasman for his
voyage of 1644, which constitute one of the principal sources of
information for previous Dutch voyages to New Guinea and
Australia, have been called in to support the opinion that the
<i>Duifken</i> sailed on this voyage in 1606. But from entries in
Captain Saris's journal, published by Purchas, there is no doubt
that 1605 was the year. Saris, using the old style, gives the
date November 18.]</p>
<p>The <i>Duifken</i> was back in Banda, as we learn from Saris,
before June 15, 1606, and the priority of discovery thus
undoubtedly belongs to the Dutch as compared with the Spaniards
under Torres, who, as we shall shortly see, was still in the New
Hebrides towards the end of June of the same year. It has been
supposed, but on hardly sufficient evidence, that a second voyage
to New Guinea was made by the <i>Duifken</i> in 1606-7.</p>
<p>We must now turn to the Spanish Expedition, which left Callao
in Peru on December 21, 1605, under Pedro Fernandez de Quiros,
and formed, it may be said, the closing episode of the great
epoch of Spanish maritime discovery.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The
expedition consisted of two ships and a launch, the second ship
being commanded by Luis Vaez de Torres. Quiros had accompanied
Alvaro de Mendaña as pilot on his second expedition of 1595,
during which, in the search for the Solomon Islands, the Santa
Cruz group had been reached. On this voyage his imagination had
been fired by the idea of the great southern continent, which he
imagined to lie in the neighbourhood of Santa Cruz, and which he
thought would offer a magnificent field for colonisation. This
idea took so much hold of Quiros that he devoted the rest of his
life, though without success, to the task of discovering this
land. Among his associates Quiros was regarded more or less as a
visionary, and was besides unpopular as a Portuguese, a fact
which must have greatly stood in the way of success.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Although in the service of Spain,
Quiros, like Magellan, was a Portuguese by birth. His native
place is said to have been Evora.]</p>
<p>The object of the expedition of 1605-6 was the colonisation of
Santa Cruz as well as the search for the great southern land. By
the help of the various accounts which have come down to us
<sup><b>[2]</b></sup>&mdash;which are in many ways fuller than
those of other early Pacific voyages&mdash;we are able to trace
with some precision the course followed, which brought the
voyagers in view of many more islands than had been seen in most
previous voyages. For 800 leagues Quiros steered S.W. by W., but
on reaching the latitude of 26° began, contrary to the advice of
Torres, to reduce his latitude, and thus appears to have passed
through the centre of the Low Archipelago. The islets seen were
for the most part uninhabited, and afforded no anchorage. On
February 10, however, in about 18° 10' S., a "flat island with a
point to the south-east full of palm trees" was found to be
inhabited, and the people proved friendly, though timid. Two days
later the ships ran along an island described by De Leza as sunk
in the middle like a piece of sea surrounded by land. It was 25
leagues long and six broad, and lay in 16° 30' S. This latitude
is that of the typical atoll Fakarava, with which the description
is in striking agreement, though from the length assigned to it
it is possible that other atolls running in the same general
direction were included in the estimate.<sup><b>[3]</b></sup>
Still making northing, the ships reached Lat. 10° 45', and for
more than a month the direction varied little from west, the
ships passing north of Samoa and the Fiji group. The crew of
Quiros's vessel were now inclined to mutiny, and the failure to
take prompt measures seems to have ultimately led to the partial
failure of the enterprise. Another inhabited island was passed,
and in the endeavour to obtain a much needed water-supply some
slight collisions occurred. At length the high island of Taumaku,
60 leagues short of Santa Cruz, was reached, and after friendly
dealings with the natives a more southerly course was steered,
which led past the northern outliers of the New Hebrides to the
largest island of the group, traversed by lofty chains of
mountains, which received the name of Espiritu Santo. The ships
anchored in the bay on the northern coast, which was named after
St Philip and St James. Quiros appears to have made plans for the
establishment of a settlement, which was to be called New
Jerusalem; but being forced during a squall to run out of the
bay, and the weather not suffering him to return, he after a few
days steered north, and when in the latitude of Guam shaped a
course for Acapulco, which was reached on November 23, 1606.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> These include, besides the memoirs of
Quiros himself, narratives by Torres, by the pilot De Leza, and
by the accountant Juan de Iturbe, with some other contemporary
documents. The voyage is also described by Torquemada in his
<i>Monarquia Indiana</i>.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>3</b> The first inhabited island has been
identified, by the late Admiral Sir W.J. Wharton, with the atoll
of Anaa (or Chain Island), in which case the atoll sighted on
February 12 would be one of those to the N.W. of Fakarava.]</p>
<p>This proceeding of Quiros in abandoning the enterprise without
a more serious attempt to communicate with his second in command
has been much criticised, and the reasons for such a course are
by no means obvious. One explanation is found in a letter of Don
Diego de Prado, who accompanied Torres on his further voyage and
who states that Quiros had virtually been carried a prisoner to
Mexico by a mutinous crew. No such reason is given by either De
Leza or Juan de Iturbe, which would be intelligible enough if, as
is possible, these were inculpated in the mutiny. Quiros returned
to Spain and urged on the government, but without success, the
desirability of further efforts for the discovery of the southern
lands, which he variously names Austr(i)alia del Espiritu Santo,
Indias Australes, or by analogous terms. Setting out in 1614 to
make a last attempt, independently of government aid, he died
without proceeding further than Panama.</p>
<p>Through the return of Quiros from Espiritu Santo it came about
that the most important discoveries of the voyage fell to the
share of Torres, whose subsequent achievements entitle him to a
high place among the navigators of the seventeenth century. They
are clearly described in the letter addressed by him from Manila
to the Spanish king on July 12, 1607. The separation of the ships
occurred on June 11, 1606, after which date Torres waited 15 days
in the bay of St Philip and St James, in the expectation of
Quiros's return. It was then decided to proceed without the
flag-ship, and the island of Espiritu was coasted for some
distance, although the strong currents prevented its
circumnavigation. Having sailed on a south-west course for a
considerable distance without sign of land, Torres turned N.N.W.
and fell in with land in 11° 30', which he took for the beginning
of New Guinea. In reality it would seem to have been one of the
islands of the Louisiade group, possibly Tagula or
Sudest.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> For, from a legend on Don Diego de
Prado's chart of the lands about China Strait (named by him
Tierra de la Buenaventura) we learn that this strait&mdash;at the
extreme east of New Guinea&mdash;was reached on July 18, after
vain endeavours to approach the land during the preceding five
days by reason of the dangerous reefs. This shows that land had
been previously sighted, as is also indicated by the latitude of
the first landfall, and the name applied to the whole country,
this being derived from a festival falling on July 14. The
further course is somewhat uncertain, as the distances given are
exaggerated and the latitudes do not always fit in with any
possible course. Torres seems to have sailed along the Louisiade
reef and the south coast of New Guinea (where the first
navigators to follow him were Bougainville and Cook), as far as
9° S., where shoals compelled him to resume a south-west course
as far as 11° S.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> Here large islands were
seen, which must have been in the neighbourhood of Cape York
Peninsula&mdash;itself possibly sighted. After two months'
coasting of the shoal, the latitude of 5° S. was reached, and
here the coast trended north-east and could not be followed on
account of shoal water. Apart from the latitude this point would
agree well with False Cape, the south-west point of Prince
Frederick Henry Island, the shoal water recalling the Modder
(Mud) Eylandt and Modder Grondt of Dutch navigators in this
locality. A northerly course brought the voyagers to another
coast running east and west in 4°, which was rightly considered
to be still a part of New Guinea. It was followed to the W.N.W.,
and near its termination clothed "Moors" were met with, who gave
information regarding affairs at the Moluccas. Leaving New Guinea
and passing through a sea strewn with islands, Torres reached
Batjan and proceeded <i>viâ</i> Ternate to Manila, where he seems
to have arrived in May, 1607.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Torres uses an ambiguous phrase with
regard to the distance sailed on a south-west course, saying that
he passed "the latitude" by a degree. He had already spoken of
"the order" for the regulation of the voyage, so that the phrase
would seem to refer to the latitude fixed upon to be reached
towards the south after leaving Santa Cruz. From Quiros's memoirs
we know that this was 20°, so that, passing this by a degree,
Torres would reach 21°, which is in fact stated to have been the
case in the memorial of Arias. A S.W. course to this latitude,
followed by a N.N.W. one, would just bring the navigator to
Sudest Island.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Torres's latitudes have caused
commentators some difficulty here. He says the shoal which
commenced at 9° S. stretched along the coast until 7° 30' S., and
"the extremity is 5" [degrees?], whereas the head of the Gulf of
Papua is hardly so far north as 7° 30'. The difficulty is removed
if we consider that 5° gives the latitude of the final
termination of shoal water north of the Aru Islands, and this
fits in well with the subsequent statement, that after going
along the shoal for two months the voyagers (after the passage of
Torres Strait) found themselves in 25 fathoms and in 5° latitude.
In this case it would be possible that the head of the Gulf of
Papua was not reached.]</p>
<p>By this voyage Torres had conclusively proved the insular
character of New Guinea, of the southern portions of which he had
taken formal possession in the name of the King of Spain. In the
state of decadence into which that empire had now entered, these
important discoveries were, however, little heeded, and the world
at large remained in total ignorance of them for nearly two
centuries. The Dutch still believed in a connection between New
Guinea and Australia, or at least regarded the question as still
open, even their great navigator Tasman remaining in ignorance on
the subject. It was not until the narrative of Torres had fallen
into the hands of Alexander Dalrymple after the capture of Manila
by the English in 1762, that full justice was done to the merits
of Torres, and his name applied to the strait discovered by
him.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> A map, now lost, showing the results of
Torres's discoveries, was prepared by Don Diego de Prado, already
alluded to. Plans by the same hand of bays and harbours on the
coasts visited have, however, come down to us, and are generally
accurate in their delineation. They were first reproduced in the
<i>Boletin</i> of the Madrid Geographical Society, Vol. 4, 1878,
and subsequently in Collingridge's <i>Discovery of Australia</i>,
chapter XLI, and elsewhere.]</p>
<p>Another Pacific voyage, of some importance in the history of
discovery, was that of the Dutch navigators Willem Corneliszoon
Schouten and Jacob Le Maire, which belongs to the second decade
of the seventeenth century. This expedition, which sailed from
the Texel on June 14, 1615, was not carried out under the
auspices of the Dutch East India Company, although the latter had
obtained the monopoly of all trading voyages to the east of the
Cape, or through the Strait of Magellan. To elude the
restrictions thus imposed on outsiders, a company of merchants
headed by Isaac Le Maire (father of Jacob) fitted out two ships,
the <i>Eendracht</i> and <i>Hoorn</i>, to search for a passage to
the South Sea south of Magellan's Strait. It was regarded as
possible that rich countries, with which trade might be opened
up, might be found in the supposed Southern Continent beyond
Tierra del Fuego. The insular character of the latter had already
been virtually proved by the voyages of Drake and others, which
had in fact much shaken the grounds for the belief in any
continental land immediately to the south of
America.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The conservatism of geographers,
however, had refused to abandon the old idea. On January 24,
1616, the Dutch captains sighted the passage between Tierra del
Fuego and the smaller island to the east, and conferred on it the
name Le Maire Strait. To the island&mdash;not recognised as such
at the time&mdash;the name Staten Land was given, in honour of
the States General of the Netherlands. On January 29, the ships
were off Cape Horn, the southernmost point of the Tierra del
Fuego archipelago, which received its name from the town of
Hoorn, the birthplace of Schouten, and the port where the
expedition had been equipped.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> Soon
afterwards the voyagers had before them the wide waters of the
South Sea.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> So early as 1525, one of the ships of
the squadron of Garcia de Loaysa had found an open sea in
latitude 55°, and the crew even imagined they discerned the
termination of Tierra del Fuego.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> It is possible that Drake had already
seen Cape Horn, as he is said by his chronicler to have reached
"the uttermost part of those islands."]</p>
<p>Before continuing the narrative of Schouten's voyage, the
later explorations in this region may be briefly referred to. In
1618-19 an expedition to examine Le Maire Strait was undertaken
by the brothers Bartolomé Garcia and Gonçalo de Nodal, who sailed
from Lisbon for the purpose. The strait was also navigated by the
Dutch "Nassau" fleet under Jaques l'Heremite (or le Hermite) in
1624. On this occasion, after doubling Cape Horn, the Dutch
navigators examined and named Nassau Bay to the north of the Cape
Horn group of islands, which seems to have been considered a
single island. It was named Le Hermite, a name now borne by the
westernmost of the group. The insular character of Staten Land
was discovered by Hendrik Brouwer&mdash;at one time
Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies&mdash;during his voyage
to Chile in 1643.</p>
<p>To return to Schouten's expedition, the principal objective of
which was, as we have seen, the supposed continent to the south
of the Pacific Ocean. In accordance with his instructions,
therefore, Schouten did not, Hke most of his predecessors, steer
a northerly course along the coast of South America, but after
refreshing at Juan Fernandez (discovered during the previous
century by the Spanish navigator of that name) struck north-west
and followed in the main the track of Magellan, crossing the
tropic of Capricorn on March 11.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The reason
for coming northward to this latitude was the necessity for
obtaining the help of the trade winds in the voyage across the
ocean. By April 3 the navigators had reached 15° 12' S. and found
that the compass showed no variation.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> The
first island&mdash;one of the northernmost of the Low
Archipelago&mdash;was here sighted, and named Dog Island. From
this point the course for several weeks diverged little from 15°
S., and, after some of the large western atolls of the Low
Archipelago had been passed, led them for a time south of the
tracks of all previous voyagers. Islands were still seen and some
of the well-known double canoes of the Polynesians were met with.
On May 11, the Samoan group having been left on the north, two
small islands were seen in 16° 10'&mdash;the one high, being
formed of a single mountain, the other somewhat lower, and lying
two leagues to the southward. These islands&mdash;named by the
Dutch Cokos (Coconut) Eiland, and Verraders (Traitor's) Eiland
respectively&mdash;are the modern Tafahi or Boscawen and
Niuatabutabu or Keppel, lying centrally between the Fiji, Tonga,
and Samoa groups.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The year before Schouten and Le Maire
sailed, another great Dutch expedition under Joris Spilbergen had
proceeded to the East by the Pacific route, and thus effected the
second Dutch circumnavigation of the globe. Spilbergen sailed up
the American coast to Acapulco before crossing the Pacific, and
his voyage brought little addition to geographical knowledge. It
is interesting, however, as supplying the first record of an
eruption of the great volcano Mayon ("Albaca" or Albay) in the
Philippines.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> The Dutch voyages supply the means of
reconstructing the isogonic chart for the period, which has been
done by Prof. W. van Bemmelen in an appendix to Tasman's journal,
edited in 1898 by Prof. J.E. Heeres. The passage from westerly
declination (which seems to have prevailed throughout a closed
area in the Eastern Pacific) to easterly had been recorded, at a
point a little to the south-west of that here reached, during the
voyage of Quiros and Torres. The latter found the variation to be
nil on the south coast of New Guinea, this marking the
commencement of the great area of westerly declination occurring
in the Indian Ocean.]</p>
<p>Having held to the south of west to the latitude named without
finding any signs of a continent, Schouten now sailed north and
north-west so as to make the north coast of New Guinea. Several
other small islands having been passed, the coast of New Ireland,
never before visited, was struck, and taken to be the termination
of New Guinea. Passing to the northward of this island and New
Hanover, the ships made the coast of New Guinea near Vulcan
Island, and followed it westward to its termination, finally,
after being tossed about by contrary winds, anchoring off Jilolo
on September 5. On the north coast of New Guinea the Dutch had of
course been preceded by the Spaniards and Portuguese (Jorge de
Meneses in 1526-27, Saavedra in 1528, and Ynigo Ortiz de Retes in
1545), but some additions were made to the knowledge of its
geography, and the nomenclature of our maps still bears traces of
the voyage in Vulcan and Schouten Islands, and in the Cape of
Good Hope, the north-west point of the main island. On reaching
Jacatra (Batavia) the <i>Eendracht</i> and her cargo (the
<i>Hoorn</i> having previously been burnt) were arbitrarily
seized by the Governor Jans Pieterszoon Coen on the ground of
infringement of the Company's monopoly. Jacob le Maire
died&mdash;of vexation it is said&mdash;during the homeward
voyage with Spilbergen.</p>
<p>The next Dutch voyage of circumnavigation&mdash;that of the
"Nassau" fleet under Le Hermite in 1623-26&mdash;accomplished
little in the way of geographical discovery. After an attempt,
attended with little success on the Spanish possessions in Peru,
the fleet proceeded to Acapulco after Le Hermite's death, and
crossed the Pacific in about 17° N. Observations for magnetic
declination were made during the voyage.</p>
<p>The expedition of Schouten and Le Maire had been unsuccessful
with regard to the discovery of the Southern Continent. Nor did
more success attend another scheme for the examination of the
supposed continental lands to the south of the Atlantic. Either
in 1615 or quite early in 1616 a Dutch ship, the <i>Mauritius de
Nassau</i>, appears to have sailed for Angola under the command
of one Jan Remmetszoon, with the ultimate aim of exploring the
Terra Australis westward, and if possible discovering a new
passage to the South Sea. Nothing is known, however, of the
voyage of this ship.</p>
<br>
<p>We have seen that the first part of the shores of Australia to
be visited by the Dutch was the eastern shore of the Gulf of
Carpentaria, reached by the <i>Duifken</i> in 1606. It was some
years before exploration was carried farther in this direction,
and meanwhile other discoveries had been made in a totally
different quarter of the island continent. In 1616 the Directors
of the Dutch East India Company, wishing to find a better route
to Java than that usually followed, had given orders to captains
sailing to the east by the Cape route to take a more southerly
course across the Indian Ocean than had hitherto been the custom.
In following these directions the <i>Eendracht</i>, commanded by
Dirk Hartogszoon of Amsterdam, unexpectedly fell in (October,
1616) with the west coast of Australia, or rather with the
adjacent island, in Lat. 26° S., still known as Dirk Hartog
Island. During the further voyage to Bantam the neighbouring
coast was examined in a northerly direction and soon received the
name Eendrachtsland after the ship which made the discovery,
being at once regarded as part of the long-sought Southern
Continent. Further discoveries along the same coast were soon
made. In 1617 the <i>Zeewolf</i>, with Haevick Claeszoon as
skipper and Pieter Dirkszoon as supercargo, sailed east in 39° N.
and, turning north, struck land in about 21° 20' S., which was
thought to be probably a mainland coast. A year later Lenaert
Jacobszoon in the <i>Mauritius</i> reached the same coast in
about 22° S., but took it for an island. He seems to have
discovered a river, which was named Willems Revier (<i>sic</i>).
Again in 1619 the <i>Dordrecht</i> and <i>Amsterdam</i>, two of
the ships of the fleet of Frederik Houtman (who sailed in the
<i>Dordrecht</i>) struck the south land in 32° 20' S. on July 19.
Steering north and sighting various points along the coast until
27° was reached, the commanders came to the conclusion that all
the land seen formed part of the mainland discovered by Dirk
Hartogszoon. The rocks subsequently known as Houtman's Abrolhos
were discovered on this voyage, while the land first seen
received the name Dedelsland after the supercargo of the
<i>Amsterdam</i>. The most southerly portion of the west coast
was discovered in 1622 by the <i>Leeuwin</i>, which name is still
borne by the cape which marks the final change of direction of
the coast.</p>
<p>Of the subsequent voyages to this western coast, which
continued to be made during another decade and more, we can refer
to two only&mdash;that of Gerrit de Witt in 1628, and that of
François Pelsaert in 1629. The former, during the homeward voyage
from Java, was carried southward and reached that part of the
coast (at the beginning of the north-west section) afterwards
known as De Witt's land. The latter in 1629 lost his ship, the
<i>Batavia</i>, on the Houtman's Abrolhos, and, during a voyage
to <i>Batavia</i> in one of the boats, surveyed the coast from
28° 13' to 22° 17'. After many attempts, rendered ineffectual by
the precipitous nature of the coast, and the breakers which beat
against it, a landing was at last effected. The land was utterly
barren, but natives were seen, though no communication could be
opened with them. Pelsaert returned from Batavia to rescue those
of the crew left at the Abrolhos, but discovering a plot,
executed some of the conspirators and abandoned two others on the
mainland. In the space of 13 years almost the whole western coast
had thus been visited from Cape Leeuwin to about 21°, and the
results of most of the voyages are well shown in the chart of
Hessel Gerritz, cartographer to the East India Company, compiled
in 1627 from the journals and drawings of the pilots.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the voyage of a single ship, the <i>Gulden
Zeepaard</i>, had in 1627 resulted in a knowledge of the whole
southern coast as far east as 133°&mdash;a distance exceeding
that covered by the whole series of voyages to the west coast
already described. Unfortunately, hardly anything is known of the
details of this voyage. The <i>Zeepaard</i>, commanded by
François Thijszoon, and having on board Pieter Nuyts, member of
the Indian Council, appears to have been separated from the rest
of an eastward bound fleet which sailed in 1626, and to have
surveyed the south coast of Australia between January and April
1627, arriving at Batavia on the loth of the latter month. Of the
reality of the discovery there can be no doubt, from the
comparative accuracy of the delineation of the coast visited, on
charts of a slightly later date, before any other vessel had
followed in the track of the <i>Zeepaard</i>. These show in their
proper places both the Recherche Archipelago and that still known
by the name of Pieter Nuyts, which formed the eastern limit of
discovery. The islands of St Peter and St Francis, which still
figure in our maps as the principal units of the latter group,
received their names on this occasion, while the land to the
north of the Great Australian Bight was long known as that of
Pieter Nuyts.</p>
<p>While these discoveries were being made&mdash;more by accident
than design&mdash;in the south and west, exploration had already
been resumed in the extreme north. On January 21, 1623, Herman
van Speult, Governor of Amboina, despatched two ships, the
<i>Arnhem</i> and <i>Pera</i>, under the chief command of Jan
Carstenszoon, to continue the work of the <i>Duifken</i> on the
Gulf of Carpentaria. New Guinea was reached in 4° 17' S. and the
coast followed in an easterly direction. A collision&mdash;fatal
to several Dutchmen&mdash;again took place with the
natives.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> On February 16, high mountains,
streaked with snow, were seen in the interior&mdash;evidently the
central snowy chain of Western New Guinea, the exploration of
which, entirely neglected down to our own day, has been taken up
energetically since the beginning of the present century. Its
highest known peak&mdash;over 15,000 feet in height&mdash;has
been named Mount Carstensz, after the old Dutch navigator now
claiming our attention. On reaching 7° S. the coast was found to
trend to the S.W.,<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> and on this account a
point of land was named Cape Keerweer&mdash;not to be confounded
with the cape of the same name on the Gulf of Carpentaria,
reached by the <i>Duifken</i>. The shallows in Torres
Strait&mdash;mistaken for a bay&mdash;again proved a hindrance to
eastward progress, and the ships turned south along the
Australian coast, supposed to be still part of New Guinea. On
reaching 17° 8', where the Staten river was discovered and named,
it was resolved to turn back and explore the coast more
carefully. The two ships became separated, and Carstenszoon in
the Pera, after discovering and naming other rivers on the coast
of the Cape York Peninsula, made his way back by way of the Aru
islands. Of the proceedings of the <i>Arnhem</i> after the
separation, little certain information is available. However,
from the instructions drawn up for the next voyage in this
direction it appears that that vessel had, between 9° and 13°,
discovered new lands, not recognised as forming part of the
mainland, which received the names Arnhem's and Speult's lands.
Although these cannot be strictly identified, there can be little
doubt that they were projecting points (or possibly islands) of
that part of the Northern Territory of Australia which still
bears the name Arnhem Land.<sup><b>[3]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> It will be remembered that nine of the
crew of the <i>Duifken</i> lost their lives in a similar
way.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Prince Frederick Henry Island was taken
for a part of the mainland, though its insular character had been
recognised during the voyage of the <i>Duifken</i>.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>3</b> The question has been discussed by
Prof. Heeres in the editorial portion of his edition of Tasman's
Journal, pp. 101-2. The position generally assigned to Arnhem
Land is confirmed by the facts connected with Pool's voyage, and
by contemporary charts.]</p>
<p>It was not until 1636 that further steps were taken to extend
the discoveries in this direction. In that year Gerrit Thomaszoon
Pool and Pieter Pieterszoon sailed from Banda for New Guinea,
which was struck at a point more to the west than had been the
case in the previous expeditions. The islands and bays of a part
of the western peninsula of the island were thus
explored.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> As on the former voyages, the
natives proved treacherous, and Pool and several of his crew lost
their lives at or near the scene of the former disaster.
Pieterszoon, who succeeded to the command, soon proceeded to the
Aru and Ke islands, whence, standing south, he advanced as far as
11° 8', discovering two stretches of coast, east and west of each
other, and separated by a channel. These can be no other than
Melville Island and a part of the adjacent mainland. The new
coastline received the names of Van Diemen's and Maria's
land&mdash;the former name being still applied to the north-west
point of Melville Island&mdash;though the conjecture was made by
the Dutch authorities that it was identical with Arnhem's or
Speult's islands already discovered.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> This coast had already been visited by
Torres, as is shown by De Prado's charts. But the Dutch were in
ignorance of the results of his voyage.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Prof. Heeres (<i>loc. cit</i>.), after
showing that Speult's land must have lain to the east of Arnhem's
land, throws out the suggestion that the former may possibly have
been the Groote Eylandt on the west side of the Gulf of
Carpentaria. This, however, is considerably south of 13°, while,
in view of the way in which the northern coast of Arnhem's land
is broken by bays, it is unnecessary to go far to find two
apparently distinct lands which might have borne the names in
question.]</p>
<p>The voyages of Carstenszoon and Pool had thus resulted in some
new discoveries, but had not succeeded in clearing up the
relations to each other of the various coasts discovered, nor to
the more western lands of Eendracht, De Witt, etc. They had also
rather strengthened than weakened the belief in a connection
between New Guinea and the South Land. To clear up the former
point was reserved for the great navigator Tasman, whose career
of discovery was now opening.</p>
<p>Although Tasman's fame rests chiefly on his Australian
discoveries, his earlier work was concerned with more northern
parts of the Eastern Seas, so that we must glance briefly at the
course of discovery in the region to the north before continuing
the story in its bearing on Australia. In the archipelago west of
New Guinea little of course remained to be done in the way of
maritime discovery after the close of the sixteenth century. Yet,
owing to the fact that ships followed fixed routes from one part
to another, certain restricted areas had remained almost
unvisited. One of these was the sea to the north of Ceram, which
lay off the main routes connecting the most important positions
in the Archipelago.</p>
<p>To bring about a better knowledge of this sea was, as it
happened, the first important task in which Tasman took part
after his arrival in the East. Born about 1603 in the small
village of Lutjegast, Abel Janszoon Tasman, after being twice
married, seems to have entered the service of the East India
Company in 1632 or 1633. In 1634 he sailed as skipper of the
<i>Mocha</i>, on the Ceram voyage just referred to. Owing to the
stormy nature of the seas south of Ceram during the eastern
monsoon, it was thought that a better though circuitous route
from Amboina to Banda at this season might be found by the north
of the island; and the verification of this conjecture, which
formed the object of the voyage, was fully attained, though
Tasman's crew came into collision with the natives on the
south-east coast of Ceram. A chart&mdash;still in
existence&mdash;showing the whole north coast of Ceram, was
prepared as a result of the voyage.</p>
<p>For some time after this Tasman was engaged in unexciting
operations in the archipelago, and it was not till 1639, after a
brief visit to the Netherlands, that he was again employed on a
voyage of discovery. He had meanwhile become expert in the art of
navigation, his skill and experience being spoken of in high
terms by the authorities in 1638.</p>
<p>The scene of the new explorations was to be in the western
part of the northern Pacific, which, although regularly traversed
by the Spanish ships sailing from the Philippines to Mexico, gave
free scope, by reason of its huge expanse, to stories of all
sorts regarding the existence of rich countries still awaiting
the advent of merchants. The eastward route generally followed
across the Pacific is described in De Morga's Philippines (1609)
as varying between east and north, until, after sighting the
Ladrones and passing between certain islands rarely seen in 38°
N., the ships eventually reached a latitude of 42°. During the
latter part of the voyage the course was south-east, the coast of
America being struck between 40° and 36° and followed southward
to Acapulco.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The islands supposed to lie in
38° had for some unexplained reason acquired the names Rica de
Oro and Rica de Plata (Rich in Gold and Rich in Silver). In
addition to these, two rich well-peopled islands were said to
have been discovered before 1584, between 35° and 40°, by a
Portuguese ship carried by storms for nine days to the east of
Japan. Unsuccessful attempts were made by the Spaniards to
discover these islands, especially by the voyage of Sebastian
Vizcaino, who reached Japan from Mexico in 1611. In 1635 accounts
of these mysterious islands, said to abound in gold and silver,
and to be inhabited by a white race of fine physique and gentle
manners, reached the Dutch authorities in the Eastern Archipelago
through an agent in Japan named Verstegen, and after some delay
it was decided in 1639 to despatch an expedition in search of
them.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The reason for this circuitous route
was, of course, the avoidance of the trade-winds and the
utilisation of the south-westerly winds of more northern
latitudes.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Verstegen apparently based his
information on the reports of the Portuguese ship above alluded
to, although he ascribes the discovery to a Spanish ship. It
seems possible that the Portuguese ship, if such it was, really
struck the coast of Japan near 40° N. after being driven hither
and thither by storms.]</p>
<p>Two ships, the <i>Engel</i> and <i>Graft</i>, were fitted out,
and the chief command was entrusted to Matthijs Hendricxsen
Quast, a captain of much experience in the Japanese and other
Eastern trade, while Tasman, captain of the <i>Graft</i>, was
second in command. The ships proved in bad condition, and
sickness soon broke out among the crews, so that the whole voyage
was carried out in the face of great difficulties. In spite of
these, however, and the necessary failure to find the
non-existent lands of which they were in search, Quast and Tasman
did valuable work in charting a portion of the eastern seas of
which the previous maps seem to have been very faulty, their
observations being made with surprising accuracy, considering the
instruments then in use.</p>
<p>Passing to the north of Bangka, where islands not previously
marked were placed on the chart, the ships, after recruiting at
Pulo Aur near the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula,
steered for the island of Luzon, which was found to lie more to
the east than it had hitherto been placed. Passing round the
north end of that island (the south-west wind being unfavourable
for the proposed course to the south of it), and continuing their
survey, the commanders steered east and north-east, and after a
time fell in with the Bonin Islands, of which they made the first
recorded discovery. A wearisome cruise through the seas east of
Japan now ensued, during which, after the Japanese coast had been
sighted through fog in about 37° N., the ships advanced eastward
without sight of land to about 170° E. It was now proposed to
return and survey the coasts of Tartary, Korea, and China&mdash;a
task which formed part of the two captains' commission&mdash;but
the wretched state of the ships made it imperative to return to
port as quickly as possible. After reaching the latitude of 42°,
the coast of Nippon seems to have been struck near its south-east
point, a very high mountain, answering to Fujiyama, being
sighted. The east coast of Kiusiu was next reached, proving to
lie farther west than the charts had led the explorers to expect;
and, after its southern point had been doubled, a course was laid
for Formosa, where, on November 24, the ships anchored, none too
soon, before the Dutch fortress of Zeelandia.</p>
<p>During the next few years Tasman was pretty constantly engaged
on trading voyages for the Dutch to Japan, Formosa, Cambodia, and
elsewhere.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The authorities had not, however,
been permanently discouraged by the failure of the expedition of
1639, and in 1643 it was resolved to make yet another attempt,
the objects in view being again the exploration of the coasts of
Tartary and the search for the gold and silver islands. The
command was this time entrusted to Marten Gerritszoon Vries, with
Hendrik Corneliszoon Schaep as second in command, the ships being
the <i>Kastrikom</i> and <i>Breskens</i>. The unknown regions of
the north practically began at the island of Yezo, for though
this had already been visited (1620) by the Jesuit missionaries
De Angelis and Carvalho, it was still doubted by geographers, and
even by the Dutch in Japan, whether it were really an independent
island, or joined either to Nippon on the
south,<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> or to the mainland of Asia on the
west. This voyage of Vries failed to solve the question
completely, though it considerably extended the bounds of
knowledge. The two ships, which sailed from Batavia on February
3, 1643, narrowly escaped wreck on a small island south of the
outer point of Nippon, and becoming separated, continued the
voyage independently. Vries himself in the <i>Kastrikom</i>
sailed up the east coast of Nippon and reached Yezo without
definitely proving the existence of an intervening strait.
Coasting the latter island with high snowy mountains now and then
in sight, the voyagers reached its eastern point near a summit
which they called Piek Anthonij. Friendly relations were
maintained with the inhabitants, who possessed many ornaments of
silver, which led the Dutch to conclude that mines existed in
their country. Still sailing north-east they discovered an
island&mdash;apparently Iturup&mdash;and beyond it a strait
dividing it from another land to the east. The former was named
Staten Island, while the supposed large land to the east received
the name "Compagnies Landt." Both were filled with bare shining
mountains. Passing through the strait, still named after the
Dutch commander, the voyagers entered a stormy sea, in which they
advanced as far north as 48°. Then, driven back by adverse winds,
they made the coast of Sakhalin, which they took to be still a
part of Yezo. This was explored from Cape Patience (in about 49°)
almost to its southern point, the ship afterwards returning
through Vries Strait to the south coast of Yezo. Interesting
information as to the land and its people was here obtained,
especially from a Japanese sailor, who declared that Yezo was an
island. The hairy inhabitants (Ainus) were described, the women's
custom of marking their lips with blue being mentioned. Vries
afterwards sailed eastward in 37° 30' in search of the gold and
silver islands, but of course without success.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The relations of the Dutch with
Cambodia commenced in 1601, and in 1636 they obtained permission
to build a factory there. Tasman in 1641 sailed up the Bassak, or
eastern mouth of the Mekong.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> It was known that a visit to Yezo from
Nippon entailed a sea voyage, but this was sometimes ascribed to
the difficult nature of the supposed land journey.]</p>

<br>
<p>The voyage of the <i>Breskens</i> also resulted in some
discoveries. Passing the entrance to the strait between Nippon
and Yezo, Schaep sailed along the coast of the latter, but,
instead of sailing through Vries Strait, continued on the outer
side of the Kurile chain, reaching the latitude 47° 8', twelve
degrees east of the east point of Nippon. Touching at the
Japanese coast on his return voyage, he was arrested and taken to
the capital, but ultimately released. The <i>Breskens</i>
meanwhile also made an unavailing search for the fabulous
islands.</p>
<p>The discoveries of Vries and his comrades were not followed up
by new voyages, and it was not till a century later that the
geography of the Japanese islands was finally made clear by the
voyage of La Pérouse.</p>
<br>
<p>We now come to the great expedition which was for the first
time to shed light on the true relations of the southern lands
hitherto discovered by the Dutch. It had long been wished by the
Government in the Archipelago, no less than by the authorities at
home, that the uncertainties which enveloped the mysterious
southern continent might be cleared away, and at length on August
1, 1642, a resolution was arrived at to despatch two ships, the
<i>Heemskerk</i> and <i>Zeehaen</i>, for that object. Tasman was
chosen as Commander-in-chief, while the captains of the vessels
were, respectively, Yde Holman and Gerrit Janszoon. The most
responsible officer next to Tasman was, however, the pilot-major
Frans Jacobszoon Visscher, already alluded to in connection with
surveying work in the East, who was perhaps the most experienced
and trusted pilot in the service of the Dutch at the time. The
principal objects which the authorities had in view were the
exploration (as far south as 54°) of the Southern Indian Ocean,
whose broad expanse had never yet been traversed by a European
ship much beyond 40°,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> and the discovery of a
passage&mdash;which they confidently expected to
exist&mdash;between Eendrachtsland and other known parts of
Australia, and the main mass of the southern continent. It was
hoped that in this direction a convenient route might be found by
which to open up trade with the remote shores of Chile. The
solution of the problem of the connection or non-connection of
New Guinea with the more southern lands also formed part of the
programme, and Tasman was instructed to sail along the whole
northern coasts of the latter, if possible as far as Willems
River in 21° N.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> As we have seen, from 1616 onwards,
outward-bound ships often steered east, after passing the Cape,
in latitudes of 38° and 39°. The governor. Van Diemen, in 1633
seems to have passed 40°.]</p>
<p>The ships sailed from Batavia in Java on August 14, 1642, and
passing through the Straits of Sunda, proceeded first to
Mauritius, where some defects in the equipment were made good. On
October 8, a new start was made, a general southerly course being
steered until almost 40° had been reached, after which the
direction was changed to south-east. In about the longitude of
Kerguelen Land&mdash;although according to the reckoning some 4½°
north of its true position (<i>i.e</i>. in 44° 47' S.)&mdash;dark
foggy weather was experienced, and as apparent signs of land were
seen in the form of floating weed, grass, and leaves, it was
deemed prudent on account of the fog to change the course again
for a more easterly one. The highest latitude was reached in
about 97° E., and though only 49° 4' according to Tasman's
computation, even this was full 10° south of any point hitherto
reached in that longitude. At length on November 4, at 4 p.m.,
very high land never before reached by European navigators was
sighted, the position at noon the same day being estimated as in
Lat. 42° 25' S., and in a longitude corresponding to 145° 52'
east of Greenwich.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Tasman's longitudes were no doubt
calculated from the Peak of Tenerife, through which passed the
initial meridian generally used by the Dutch at the time. That of
Ferro&mdash;considered to be exactly 20° west of Paris&mdash;had
been formally adopted in France in 1634, and were this the zero
line used by Tasman, his results would be still more accurate
than on the former supposition. His pilot-major Visscher is
known, however, to have reckoned from Tenerife.]</p>
<p>This new land was the south-west coast of the island now known
as Tasmania, but named by Tasman "Anthony Van Diemens Landt", in
honour of the famous governor of the Dutch East Indies. It was
found that the needle here pointed due north, the last 4° of
westerly variation having fallen off very abruptly. This, Tasman
says, is a useful sign of the approach to the land. From November
4 to December 5 the ships were cruising off the coast, surveying
when possible its bays, capes, and islands, which were duly set
down on a chart. Stormy weather was experienced, and it was not
till December 2 that a landing could be effected. According to
the report of the pilot-major, the land was high but level,
covered with wild vegetation, the trees standing apart and not
choked with undergrowth. Signs of the presence of natives were
seen, two trees having notches made in the bark at five feet
intervals to enable the natives to climb to their tops. From this
the sailors concluded that the people must be of immense stature.
Foot-prints of animals not unlike those made by a tiger's claws
were also seen. The following day Tasman himself landed, but on a
second attempt the pinnace was unable to reach the shore on
account of the surf; the carpenter therefore swam ashore with a
pole marked with the Company's mark, which he set up as a symbol
of possession.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The voyage was continued past
the islands of the east coast, but on reaching the point now
known as Freycinet Peninsula it was found no longer possible to
steer near the coast, so the voyage was resumed in an easterly
direction.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> This was on the shore of Frederick
Henry ("Henricx") Bay on the east coast, to the south of Maria's
Island.]</p>
<p>This course had been held for eight days only, when, on
December 13, another hitherto undiscovered land appeared in
sight. It lay to the south-east and was extensive and high, but
desolate, consisting, as was afterwards found to be the case, of
a double mountain range, compared by Tasman with those of
Formosa. This was the west coast of the south island of New
Zealand, and the part first sighted lay in about 42° 10' S.
Believing this to be part of the South Land and to be connected
with the Staten Land of Schouten and Le Maire, the navigators
called this also Staten Land. Sailing northward along the coast
in view of the surf breaking on the shore, the voyagers passed
the rocks of Cape Foulwind, known to this day as the Steeples, to
which objects they were likened by Tasman. Then rounding Cape
Farewell, they entered the broad bight (Zeehaen's Bocht) between
the two islands. Natives were now encountered and a collision
occurred in which four Dutchmen lost their lives. The people were
of ordinary height, between brown and yellow in colour, and naked
from the waist upward. They wore tufts of black hair on the top
of their heads, surmounted by white feathers. Their voices were
harsh and they blew on an instrument with a sound like that of a
trumpet. Their canoes&mdash;of which Tasman gives a drawing in
his journal&mdash;were double, with planking between. The bay in
which this encounter took place&mdash;the first within the north
point of the South Island&mdash;was named by the Dutch
"Murderer's Bay".<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The ships now tacked up
and down the broad expanse (Zeehaen's Bocht), leading to Cook
Strait, without however discovering the latter, though hopes were
at first entertained of finding a passage through to the South
Seas.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> The sea ran so strong into the bay
that the ships could make no headway against it, and, the wind
also rising, they were with difficulty held to their anchors in
Tasman's Bay, the second on the coast of the South Island.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> It now bears the name Massacre Bay on
our maps.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> In a rough chart drawn by Visscher, the
coast line shows a gap just where the narrow part of the strait
really occurs. Even after the unsuccessful attempt to find the
strait, Tasman still thought that such might exist, by reason
that the tide ran from the south-east.]</p>
<p>On December 26, the voyage was resumed in a northerly
direction along the west coast of the North Island, and on
January 4, 1643, the cape at its northern extremity was sighted,
receiving the name Maria Van Diemen, while an island lying off it
was named Three Kings Island, as the ships were there on the eve
of the Epiphany. A heavy sea was found to run from the
north-east, which gave renewed hopes of a passage eastwards. An
attempt to replenish the water casks at the island&mdash;where
natives of tall stature were seen&mdash;having failed, it was
resolved to sail east and north in order to reach the Cocos and
Hoorn Islands discovered by Schouten, the instructions having
laid down that at least the longitude of the Solomon Islands was
to be reached before a homeward course were steered round the
north of New Guinea. A small island was sighted on January 19 and
named Hooge Pijlstaerts (Arrowtail, <i>i.e</i>. Tropic bird)
Eylandt, and on the 21st the ships came to anchor off the
north-west coast of Tongatabu, the principal island of the Tonga
group (Friendly Islands). This was named Amsterdam by the
voyagers, while the smaller island to the south was called
Middelburg.</p>
<p>The natives proved peaceably disposed, and already justified
the name subsequently bestowed on the group by Captain Cook.
After obtaining a good supply of hogs and poultry the ships
sailed north-east, and the water casks were filled at Namuka
(Anamocka or Rotterdam of the Dutch) from a small fresh-water
lake on the island. Passing Tofoa and Kao, the latter of which
was likened to Krakatau in the Sunda Straits, the navigators
became involved in the reefs in the north-east of the Fiji group,
but, finding a passage, sailed among the islands
<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> off the north-west of Vanua Levu without
suspecting the considerable size of the latter, its projecting
headlands being taken for separate islands. The weather being
stormy it was resolved to steer north and west for New Guinea,
and on April 1 the ships were off the north extremity of New
Ireland, which, like Schouten, Tasman considered to form part of
the larger island. This error was not rectified even during the
subsequent voyage round the western shores of the New Britain
group, neither of the straits separating the islands from New
Guinea and from each other being noticed, although the navigators
were in hopes of discovering a passage through to Cape Keerweer.
Beyond Vulkan Island, Schouten's track along the northern shores
of New Guinea was followed, but after reaching the extremity of
Waigiu the ships turned south through the passage between that
island and Jilolo, which till then had been unknown to the Dutch.
On May 26 Ceram was sighted, and the ships finally anchored off
Batavia, during the night of May 14, 1643.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Prinz Wyllem's Eylanden of Tasman's
chart.]</p>
<p>In this great voyage of discovery Tasman had done more than
all his predecessors to shed light on the broad geographical
questions relating to the southern parts of the globe. Once for
all the absence of any connection between Australia and any
possible south polar continent had been demonstrated, and though
all questions connected with the former were far from being
cleared up,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> the possibilities with regard to
it were now brought within comparatively narrow limits, while by
the discovery of New Zealand the last land area of any size
outside the polar regions was made known to the world. In
latitudes never before reached in this quarter of the globe the
voyage had led for more than five thousand miles through a
hitherto trackless ocean,<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> while two thousand
more remained before known regions were again entered. The nature
of the achievement is also shown by the fact that over a century
elapsed before the example thus set was followed. The success of
the voyage was no doubt due in part to the ability and experience
of the pilot-major Visscher, whose advice was constantly sought
by the commander, and who, it may be supposed, had much to do
with the excellence of the results as regards the charting of the
newly found regions. That these were not further explored was due
largely to the nature of Tasman's instructions, which laid the
principal stress on the discovery of a sea route by the south,
while to his judicious exercise of discretion in the choice of
the latitude followed was due the discovery of both Tasmania and
New Zealand.<sup><b>[3]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Tasman himself regarded both Tasmania
and New Guinea as joined to Australia, and he imagined that the
latter extended much farther eastward than it does, possibly to
about 160° E.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Between 40° and 50° it extended through
115° of longitude.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>3</b> Tasman's conclusions, based on the
direction of the oceanic swell, that no large land lay to the
south and south-east, no doubt had much to do with the selection
of the route.]</p>
<p>The final portion of Tasman's commission in 1642&mdash;that
relating to the south coast of New Guinea, and the north and
north-west of Australia&mdash;was not carried out during this
voyage. It was therefore determined early in 1644 to fit out a
new expedition in order to supply the deficiency. Three ships
were chosen, the <i>Limmen</i>, <i>Zeemeeuw</i>, and the galiot
<i>Bracq</i>, the first-named having Visscher as captain, while
Tasman also sailed in her as commander-in-chief. Full
instructions were drawn up, the principal objects in view being
(1) the search for a passage in the locality now known as Torres
Strait; (2) the exploration of the northern parts of Australia
beyond the point reached by Carstensz, in order to prove whether
they were connected with De Witt's Land in the west. Should this
not prove to be the case, the explorers were to proceed through
the passage between the two lands to the newly discovered Van
Diemen's Land (Tasmania), and afterwards complete the
circumnavigation of the discovered South Land by the east. We
have unfortunately no detailed account of this voyage, and our
knowledge of its results is almost entirely based on maps, on
which the course is laid down with great accuracy. The most
authentic of these is one prepared under Tasman's supervision,
probably with the co-operation of Visscher. From this it is seen
that for some reason or other&mdash;possibly owing to adverse
winds&mdash;the exploration of Torres Strait was not effected,
but Tasman made the same mistake as his predecessors in
considering New Guinea and Australia to form one continuous land
mass. The second part of the programme&mdash;the verification of
the continuity of the land from the Gulf of Carpentaria to the
north-west point of Australia&mdash;was however carried out
successfully.</p>

<br>
<p>The Gulf of Carpentaria was circumnavigated, the ships passing
between Groote Eylandt and the mainland, and the whole
north-western coasts were then followed as far as the Tropic of
Capricorn. Soundings were taken along all the coasts explored and
are inserted on the chart which has come down to
us.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> From a minute by the Dutch authorities
at Batavia, we find that the voyagers learnt nothing of the
interior of the country, having merely sailed along its shores.
Apparently, however, they had encountered natives, who are
described as miserably poor and of a bad disposition.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> They are also given in a chart in the

<p>The northern, western, and the greater part of the southern
coasts of Australia (which now took the name of Company's New
Netherlands, soon altered to Nova Hollandia)
<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> were thus tolerably well known as regards
their outline. The eastern shores were destined to remain
unexplored until over a century later. Although the Dutch
authorities professed the intention of further examining the
resources of the newly-found lands, little was accomplished, and
Tasman's discoveries were the culminating achievement of that
nation in the field of geographical exploration.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<h4>NORTH AMERICA, 1600-1700</h4>
<p><span class="a">It</span> has been seen that the French
navigators played but a subordinate part in the voyages to the
East Indies in the early part of the sixteenth century. We now
turn to a quarter of the globe where all the great names that
stand out as pioneers in geographical discovery during the same
period are those of Frenchmen. Even in the previous century
Frenchmen had many times turned their thoughts to North America
as a promising field for colonisation, and before 1550 fruit had
been borne in the voyages of Verrazzano and Cartier, while not
much later the religious troubles in France led to persevering
but unsuccessful attempts by the Huguenots under Villegagnon,
Ribaut, and Laudonnière. But the wars of Francis the First had
turned men's minds from these distant enterprises, and although
Norman and Breton sailors still frequented the fisheries of the
Newfoundland banks, nothing had been done before the close of the
century to extend the knowledge gained by Cartier in his voyages
to the St Lawrence. A new era began with the accession of Henry
IV (1593) so that, as has been before observed, the opening of
our period forms an important turning-point in the history of
North American discovery.</p>
<p>The name which stands out above all others in connection with
the resumption of discovery is that of Samuel de Champlain. Born
in 1567, this ardent pioneer had fought as a naval captain on the
side of Henry, and after the conclusion of peace undertook a
voyage to the West Indies and Mexico (1599-1602). Champlain's
narrative of this voyage, illustrated by quaint drawings, is
important as showing the condition of the West Indies and Mexico
under Spanish rule three centuries ago, and it is a special point
of interest that, during a visit to Panama, Champlain conceived
the idea of a ship canal across the isthmus.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup>
Soon after his return, his aid in a new Canadian enterprise was
sought by Aymar de Chastes, who had obtained a patent from the
king for the purpose. In 1603, Champlain sailed for the St
Lawrence in company with a merchant of St Malo named Pontgravé,
who had had some experience in the country, and ascending the
river reached the site of Hochelaga, the Indian village visited
by Cartier nearly seventy years before. Only a few wandering
Algonquins were met with on the spot, and an attempt to pass the
rapids above with their aid proved unsuccessful. The explorer was
fain to content himself with obtaining from his native guides
some account of the great lakes and rivers which form the system
of the St Lawrence, and returned to France to find De Chastes
dead. The enterprise was soon taken up by the Sieur de Monts, a
Calvinist, who, obtaining the grant of a monopoly of the fur
trade, sailed from Havre de Grace in April 1604. Champlain again
joined the expedition, in which another adventurer, the Baron de
Poutrincourt, also took part, while Calvinist ministers and
Catholic priests swelled the numbers of the party. Striking the
coast of Nova Scotia, De Monts resolved to proceed southwards,
and doubling Cape Sable explored the shores of the Bay of Fundy,
named by the voyagers La Baie Françoise. An islet in a river
discovered by Champlain was chosen as the site for a colony and
named Ste Croix,<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> while Poutrincourt obtained
from De Monts the grant of Port Royal, the modern Annapolis
Basin, as his domain. De Monts's colony was attacked during the
winter by scurvy, and on the approach of summer (1605) the leader
sailed with Champlain, who during the previous autumn had
examined the coasts of Maine, to search for a better site. The
voyagers followed the coast west and south, examining its rivers
and harbours, until, after passing Cape Cod, they were forced to
bring their explorations to an end for that
year.<sup><b>[3]</b></sup> De Monts returned to France, whence,
in May 1606, Poutrincourt sailed again for Port Royal (whither
the colony had been moved) with a new ally. Marc Lescarbot, to
whose pen we owe one of the fullest accounts of early French
enterprise in America. Further attempts made by Poutrincourt were
hampered by Jesuit intrigue, and a final blow was struck by the
attack of an English vessel acting under the orders of the
governor of Virginia, who considered the French settlement an
invasion of British territory.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Champlain was not the first to
entertain this idea, Gomara having made a similar proposition in
1552.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> The name is now borne by the river,
which here forms the boundary between the United States and
Canada.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>3</b> This coast had been frequented by
French fur traders during the previous century, though little
definite knowledge had been gained of its geography. It had also
been visited in 1602-3 by Gosnold and Pring. It has even been
held that the French knew the Hudson under the name of Norumbega,
and had a fort on its banks. Others have considered that the
Norumbega was the Penobscot. One or other of these streams had
been thought to communicate with the St Lawrence, while Champlain
also heard of a route to the latter by the Penobscot.]</p>
<p>Meanwhile Champlain had once more turned his attention to the
St Lawrence, whither he was despatched by De Monts in 1608. This
expedition is memorable for the founding of Quebec, at the point
where a rocky promontory narrows the St Lawrence to a mile, and
at the same time affords a site intended by nature for a
fortress. Here the winter was spent, and on the approach of
spring (1609) Champlain prepared for a long-meditated journey of
exploration through the unknown wilds that bordered the river.
Joining a war-party of the Hurons and Algonquins he made his way
southwards with two followers up the Richelieu into the
picturesque lake which now bears his name, and which was thus for
the first time seen and navigated by a European. Following the
western shore, the party of Indians soon came upon the camp of
their enemies, the Iroquois, whose five confederate tribes
occupied a part of the modern state of New York. The
consternation caused by the French firearms secured the victory
for Champlain's companions, who thereupon returned to their homes
on the Ottawa, which they invited the explorer to visit on a
future occasion. During the two succeeding summers Champlain
again visited New France, his most important work being the
establishment in 1611 of a post for trade with the Indians at
Mont Royal, since known as Montreal.</p>

<br>
<small>Samuel de Champlain.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Not till 1613 was Champlain able to resume his explorations,
but on May 27 of that year he set out with four companions on a
voyage up the Ottawa, the great northern tributary of the St
Lawrence. The impulse to this journey was given by the fictitious
story of an adventurer named Vignan, who had visited the
Algonquins and pretended to have discovered a river flowing to
the northern sea. Struggling against the current of the Ottawa,
past its furious rapids, and through the tangled forests on its
banks, the little band of explorers at length reached the
settlements of the Ottawa branch of the Algonquins near the head
of Lake Coulange, where, the imposture being discovered,
Champlain was forced for the time to give up further exploration.
His work was resumed however in 1615, when his Indian allies, the
Hurons, sought his aid against their enemies, the Iroquois, and
Champlain again set out up the Ottawa to proceed to their country
on the great lake of the same name. In this journey he was
preceded by a few days by a Recollet friar, Joseph Le Caron, one
of a band of four brought from France the same year to evangelise
the natives of Canada. Passing his turning-point of 1613,
Champlain ascended the mountain-girt upper course of the Ottawa
to the mouth of its tributary, the Mattawa; then, ascending this
stream, he crossed the narrow divide which separates it from Lake
Nipissing, and made his way by this lake and the French River to
the great Georgian Bay of Lake Huron, the first of the great
American series to meet the eye of a European. Turning
south-eastwards along its shores, he seems to have landed near
Matchedash Bay, whence he reached the Huron towns, finding Le
Caron already installed there as a teacher. The Huron warriors
set out on their meditated expedition early in September, and
Champlain threaded in their company the network of streams and
lakes leading to Lake Ontario, which was crossed at its eastern
end. The attack on the Iroquois stronghold was unsuccessful.
Champlain was wounded and, following the Hurons in their retreat,
was forced to spend the winter with his allies, joining them in
their hunting expeditions, in one of which he was lost for some
days in the woods. His interpreter, Étienne Brulé, who had
previously started on a mission to the Eries, south of Lake
Ontario, likewise spent the winter among the Indians, and in the
course of his adventures is even said to have descended the
Susquehanna to the sea and to have reached the shores of Lake
Superior. In the following spring Champlain returned by the
Ottawa route to Quebec and thus terminated his exploring labours,
the rest of his work being concerned with guiding the young
colony through a troublous period, during which Quebec was taken
by an English fleet under David and Thomas Kirk (1629), only to
be restored to France three years later. Champlain again took the
command in 1633, but died on Christmas Day, 1635, at the age of
68. To him belongs the honour of opening the path of discovery in
the northern interior of North America, where the bounds of
knowledge were thenceforth slowly but steadily extended.</p>
<p>Before Champlain's death the way had been paved for further
progress by the introduction of Jesuit missionaries to supplement
the work of the Franciscans in the conversion of the Indians; and
to their adventurous journeys in the fulfilment of their vocation
an important part of the future exploration of Canada was due. In
1634 two of their number, Brébeuf and Daniel, started westward to
establish a mission among the Hurons, and they were soon followed
by a hardy adventurer, Jean Nicollet, whose explorations were
almost as fertile in discovery as those of Champlain himself,
under whose orders he acted, and who lived long enough to learn
the results of his journey, from which he returned in 1635.</p>
<p>During a lengthened residence among the Algonquins and
Nipissings, Nicollet had become well versed in the art of travel
through the Canadian wilds, while the stories he had heard among
the Nipissings of a western people without hair or beards,
supposed by the French to be Chinese or Japanese, seem to have
supplied the incentive for his despatch on a more extended
journey. Proceeding by the usual route to the Georgian Bay and
the villages of the Hurons, Nicollet obtained guides for his
further journey from among this tribe, and launching his canoe on
the lake, reached the Sault Ste Marie at the outlet of Lake
Superior. He seems to have proceeded no further in the direction
of this lake but made his way round the projecting point of land
which divides Lakes Superior and Michigan until he reached the
Strait of Mackinaw, the connecting channel between the latter
lake and Lake Huron. Continuing his explorations on Lake
Michigan, Nicollet advanced to the southern end of Green Bay,
where he came in contact for the first time with Indians of the
Dakota stock, represented here by the Winnebagoes. Thence he
continued his way up the Fox, the river which debouches into
Green Bay, until he reached the villages of the Mascontins.
Beyond this his route is uncertain, some holding that he reached
the Wisconsin and descended it to within three days of the
Mississippi, others that he went due south to the country of the
Iroquois. In either case he seems to have returned by the west
shore of Lake Michigan, where he became acquainted with the
Potawattamies, a tribe which figures largely in the story of
subsequent exploration in this region. Thus before Champlain's
death, three of the five great American lakes had been at least
partially explored, though the knowledge of the other two, Erie
and Superior, remained quite indefinite.</p>
<br>
<p>Before continuing the story of French discovery in Canada it
will be well briefly to look at the state of affairs at this time
in other parts of the Continent. While the French were battling
against the rigours of the climate on the St Lawrence and in
Acadia, English settlements had sprung up on the more favoured
coasts further south. The spirited attempts of Ralegh to found a
colony in Virginia in 1585 and 1587 had proved a failure, but
public attention was still directed to North America as a field
for such enterprises. In 1602 Bartholomew Gosnold, sailing under
the orders of the Earl of Southampton and others, for the first
time made the direct voyage across the Atlantic to Massachusetts
Bay, afterwards doubling Cape Cod and obtaining a cargo of
sassafras root from the natives. The following year Martin Bring
made a voyage on behalf of the merchants of Bristol, urged
thereto by Richard Hakluyt, the enthusiastic supporter of
American colonisation. Reaching the coast of Maine he explored
its rivers and harbours and then proceeded southwards as far as
Martha's Vineyard. The Penobscot, the principal river of Maine,
was explored by Captain Waymouth in 1605. In 1606, two companies
were formed to carry out the colonisation of North America under
patents from King James, and in 1607 the London Company succeeded
for the first time in establishing a permanent colony in
Virginia, at Jamestown, on a river also called after King James.
The Plymouth Company was less successful in a similar enterprise
on the Kennebec in Maine, the coasts of which had been again
explored by Pring in 1606.</p>
<p>Among the first settlers in Virginia, the most influential was
John Smith, who, though less than thirty years old, had already
had a remarkable career of adventure in Europe and North Africa.
To his energy and hopefulness the success of the enterprise was
mainly due, and it was his explorations which for the first time
threw light on the geography of the surrounding country. In 1607
he penetrated some distance into the interior by way of the
Chickahominy, a tributary of York River, but was captured by the
natives and remained some time a prisoner, being only saved by
the intervention of Pocahontas, the daughter of the Chief
Powhattan. The next summer he explored, in an open boat, the
great inlet known as Chesapeake Bay, noting the mouths of the
tributary streams, including the Potomac, and preparing a map of
the country. On his return he wrote an account of the colony and
of his own adventures, which was published in London the same
year.</p>
<p>In 1614 Smith joined with some merchants of London and made a
voyage to the coasts north of the Virginian settlement, examining
the shores between Cape Cod and the Penobscot, and embodying his
observations in a map. It was at this time that Smith bestowed on
the country the name, New England, which was destined to attain
such renown in the future. He subsequently (1624) wrote a general
history of Virginia, New England, and the Somers (Bermudas)
Islands, afterwards carrying on the account to 1629. Before this,
a further step in the settlement of America had been taken in
1620 by the voyage of the <i>Mayflower</i>, carrying the Pilgrim
Fathers, when the site of New Plymouth in Massachusetts was
chosen for a colony, destined shortly to expand into a
flourishing community.</p>
<p>In 1632 Lord Baltimore, who had before attempted with little
success to plant a colony in Newfoundland, obtained from Charles
I the grant of the country north of Virginia, which he named
Maryland in honour of the queen, and four years later a
settlement was made on the shores of the Potomac. Before this
settlements had also been made&mdash;in spite of the rival claims
of the French&mdash;on the coasts of Maine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Dutch, not content with the brilliant results of
their enterprises in the east, had entered the field as
competitors of the French and English in America also. In 1609
Henry Hudson, the English Arctic navigator, had sailed on behalf
of the Dutch East India Company in search of a north-east
passage. Finding the attempt hopeless he turned westwards, and
after visiting Davis Strait sailed along the coast of America in
search of a passage to the west. Ever since Verrazzano's time the
idea had been current that a sea existed to the west of the
coasts discovered by that navigator, and that this might prove
the nearest way to China, many subsequent journeys being made
with a view to reaching it. It is said that Hudson had been
induced to undertake the search by a communication from John
Smith of Virginia, who had suggested the possibility of finding a
passage to the north of that colony. Hudson entered the river
which now bears his name, then known as Grande Rivière (the mouth
of which had been discovered by Verrazzano), and ascended it for
150 miles, entering into communication with the Mohawks who dwelt
on its banks. He had before visited the Delaware, and the two
important streams (Delaware and Hudson) were named by the
explorer Rivers of the South and North respectively. He proposed
to call the Hudson the Maurice after the Prince of Nassau,
Stadhouder of Holland, but his own name was soon afterwards
applied, and was in time universally accepted as the designation
of the stream, though the Dutch often called it merely <i>De
Groote Rivier</i>. The country bordering on the Hudson was
represented, as early as 1614, in a map presented to the States
General of the Netherlands by merchants desiring a charter for
trade with that region.</p>
<p>A Dutch post had already (1613) been established at the
river's mouth, and in 1614 a fort was built on Manhattan Island.
The Dutch West India Company, incorporated in 1621, founded in
the following year the city of New Amsterdam (now New York),
while settlements were also established both at the site of
Albany on the Hudson and on the Delaware, where for a short time
the Swedes also had a colony.</p>
<p>From these various colonies on the Atlantic seaboard the
bounds of geographical knowledge were gradually pushed towards
the interior, though with less energy than was shown by the
French in Canada. The hostility of the native tribes often proved
a serious obstacle, and it was long before the most enterprising
of the settlers ventured beyond the Alleghanies. Thus it happened
that the French in Canada soon completely shut in the English and
other colonies in their rear, as we shall see presently. Still,
explorations were carried out within British territory, the most
important at this time being those of Thomas Dermer, who in 1620
sought a passage to the Western Ocean by the inlets of the New
England coast, and those of Captain Thomas Young, who sailed up
the Delaware in 1633 in hopes of reaching the rumoured interior
sea, which, as in the case of that supposed in the nineteenth
century to exist in Central Africa, exercised an important
influence on the minds of explorers.</p>
<br>
<p>But although the English settlers were behind the French in
exploring activity in the more southern regions, in the far
north, bordering on the Arctic wilds, Englishmen (as has already
been seen in the chapter on the Arctic regions) played a
preponderating part in pushing back the bounds of the unknown.
The voyages of the Elizabethan navigators at the end of the
previous century had brought to light the wide gulf between
Greenland and the Continent, with many of its inlets&mdash;the
entrance to the vast interior basin of Hudson's Bay having been
seen by Davis in 1587. In the new century the work was continued
first by Waymouth, who appears to have passed within the entrance
in 1602, and afterwards by Henry Hudson, who sailed in 1610 (the
year following his voyage to the Hudson River) on his last and
fatal voyage to the bay which has since borne his name. The
voyages of Button (1612-13), Bylot and Baffin (1615), and of the
Dane, Jens Munk (1619-20), did much to improve the knowledge of
the shores of the bay and of the strait leading to it, though
they did not finally disprove the existence of the supposed
passage to the Pacific Ocean. Foxe and James however, in 1631-32,
showed the extreme improbability that any such passage could be
found, though they did not absolutely dispose of the
question.</p>
<p>This advance of the English to a point so near, comparatively
speaking, to the French settlements in Canada, was bound to lead
to rivalry between the two nations. Some knowledge of the
interior basin reached the French at an early date, and in 1656
an expedition was despatched from Quebec under Jean Bourdon to
take possession of the country bordering on the bay in the name
of France. Only 13 years later, after a successful trading voyage
had been carried out in 1668 under the auspices of Prince Rupert,
the Hudson Bay Company was incorporated by Charter of King
Charles I, and a prolonged conflict of jurisdiction between the
two nations was the natural result.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The exact title of the Company, as
employed in its charter, was "The Governor and Company of
Adventurers of England, trading with Hudson Bay."]</p>
<br>
<p>We must now return to the history of exploration in Canada
after the death of Champlain. Although for some years after that
event no very important discoveries were made, the bounds of
knowledge were steadily extended, thanks to the restless energy
of two very different classes of men&mdash;the Jesuit
missionaries and the fur traders. The latter, in their constant
search for new collecting grounds for the much-prized beaver
skins, led the way into distant and hitherto untrodden countries,
while the Jesuits were hardly, if at all, behind them in opening
up new stations among the outlying tribes of Indians. More is
known of the labours of the Jesuits than of the traders, as their
journeys were for the most part recorded in the <i>Relations</i>
published under the auspices of their Order in Paris. In 1641 two
of their number, Raymbault and Jogues, following in the footsteps
of Nicollet, reached the Sault Ste Marie, soon to become the base
for further discovery towards the west. Here they encountered a
large body of Indians, and from them learnt of the existence of
the Mississippi (though not by name) and of the Sioux dwelling on
its banks. In 1642 Jogues was captured by a band of Iroquois and
taken south by Lake Champlain and its continuation Lake George,
of which, after his release, he was able to give a more correct
idea than had before prevailed. The fear inspired by the
invincible Iroquois confederacy still stood in the way of a
better knowledge of the two lowest of the Great Lakes, and only
after a peace had been patched up with them in 1653 was the south
shore of Ontario explored by Father Poncet, who had undertaken
the work of evangelisation among that warlike race.</p>
<p>In the following year Father Le Moyne penetrated farther into
their country by way of the Oswego River, hearing vague but
stimulating reports of the countries to the south-west. An
advance was also made about this time in the work of western
discovery. In 1654 two traders are said to have visited the
country beyond Lake Michigan, and in 1658 the field was taken by
an enterprising pioneer named Groseilliers, who reached Lake
Superior, and, returning the following year with his
brother-in-law Radisson, explored the southern shores of that
lake. In their further wanderings they may even have reached the
Mississippi itself In 1660 Groseilliers was accompanied by a
Jesuit named Ménard, who, after a winter on Lake Superior,
started southward to seek the scattered Hurons who had fled to
this remote district after the destruction of their nation by the
Iroquois in 1649. Ménard never returned and his fate is involved
in uncertainty. In 1665 an important step was taken in the
founding of a mission station at La Pointe near the west
extremity of Lake Superior. This was accomplished by Father
Allouez, who for the first time heard of the great western river
as the "Missipi", obtaining also vague accounts of the western
plains from bands of Sioux with whom he came in contact. A few
years later Allouez transferred his labours to the neighbourhood
of Green Bay on Lake Michigan, and in 1670 penetrated to the
Wisconsin, which, he heard, led to the Mississippi, a great river
more than a league wide. His place had been taken on Lake
Superior by Father Marquette, whose name occupies an important
place in subsequent discovery, and who also collected information
as to the mysterious countries to the south-west, through which
he believed the great river to flow to the Pacific.</p>
<p>Meanwhile important changes had taken place in the government
of New France, which in 1663 had reverted to the French crown.
Supported by the great minister Colbert, the new officials,
especially the Intendant, Talon, displayed much energy in
extending French influence into the outlying districts. In 1669
Talon sent Joliet&mdash;soon to take a prominent place in the
history of exploration&mdash;to search for the copper mines of
Lake Superior. Although unsuccessful in his search, Joliet did
good work by opening up, on his return journey, a new route to
the west, <i>viâ</i> Lake Erie and the channel connecting it with
Lake Huron. Again, in 1671, Talon despatched a great expedition
under St Lusson to the Sault Ste Marie to take formal possession
of the country thereabouts in presence of the assembled Indians.
With St Lusson were associated both Joliet and Nicholas Perrot,
the latter one of the most enterprising of the French adventurers
at the time.</p>
<p>About the same time explorers were also busy in the districts
bordering on the colony to the north. In 1660 Fathers Dablon and
Druillettes <sup><b>[1]</b></sup> had reached the sources of the
Saguenay, while much further west Groseilliers and Radisson had
reached Lake Nipigon, and one of their followers named Péré
<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> had crossed the divide separating Lake
Superior from Hudson Bay.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Druillettes had already (1651) come
into notice as envoy from the French to the English at Boston,
whither he had journeyed down one or other of the rivers of
Maine.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Péré also accompanied Joliet in his
expedition to Lake Superior in 1669.]</p>
<p>Subsequent differences with the authorities induced
Groseilliers to enter into association with the English, and in
1664 and 1668 he made voyages with Captain Gillam to Hudson Bay,
the promising results of which led to the foundation of the
Hudson Bay Company. In 1671 Talon entrusted Father Albanel with a
mission to the north by way of the Saguenay, and in 1672 the
Jesuit reached the shores of the northern basin, which were taken
over in the name of the French king.</p>
<p>But already a new actor had appeared on the scene, who though
relying mainly on his own resources was to surpass the
achievements of all his contemporaries. This was Robert Cavelier
de la Salle, who in 1666 reached Canada, bent on seeking his
fortune. His elder brother was already in the country, and the
seminary of St Sulpice, to which he belonged, was at the time in
possession of seignioral rights over Montreal and the lands in
its neighbourhood. The future explorer obtained from the seminary
the grant of a large tract of land at La Chine, a few miles from
Montreal. While resident here his enthusiasm was excited by
stories brought by Indians of the unexplored lands to the
south-west, and he resolved to undertake an exploring journey in
that direction. Having sold his concession at La Chine, La Salle
started in 1669 in company with the Sulpicians, Dollier and
Galivée, and, navigating Lake Ontario, reached the Niagara river,
where they heard for the first time the roar of the great
cataract. Meeting with Joliet on his way from the Upper Lakes,
the priests were induced to take a route in that direction, while
La Salle, whose thoughts were turned towards the south,
determined to carry out his explorations separately. The priests
reached the Sault Ste Marie by Joliet's route, but returned by
the Ottawa, the principal result of the journey being the
improved knowledge of Lake Erie, and its position in the great
Laurentian system, supplied by Galivée's journal and map. La
Salle's proceedings after he left the priests are involved in
much obscurity, and have been the subject of conflicting views on
the part of historians. On the authority of a somewhat
questionable document it has been claimed that either in 1669-70
or in 1671 he actually reached the Mississippi, but this is
almost certainly incorrect. It seems probable that the traveller
discovered the Ohio in 1669 and descended it for some distance,
perhaps to the rapids at Louisville. It may also be the case that
in 1671 he explored the southern part of Lake Michigan and
reached the Illinois. That he reached the Mississippi on this
occasion is negatived by the absence of all claim to this
discovery on his behalf until some years after the authenticated
journey of Marquette and Joliet, with which we have now to
deal.</p>
<p>The energetic Talon was recalled soon after the arrival of the
Comte de Frontenac as Governor in 1672. Before his departure he
had entrusted to Joliet the work of discovering the great western
river of which so much had been heard, and tracing it to its
mouth either in the Gulf of Mexico or the Pacific Ocean. The new
governor lent his support to the proposed expedition, which
started in the summer of 1672, proceeding first to the Strait of
Mackinaw (then known as Michillimackinac) at the entrance to Lake
Michigan. Here he was joined by the Jesuit Marquette, who had for
two years been in charge of a mission station on the north side
of the strait. On reaching the head of Green Bay the two
explorers ascended the Fox past Lake Winnebago and, obtaining
guides from the Mi'amis, crossed the divide and reached the
waters of the Wisconsin. Floating down this stream they reached
the Mississippi in a week, and the great stream which had been
the subject of so many speculations was at last seen by
Europeans. Passing on through an uninhabited tract, they reached
the great prairies roamed over by herds of "buffalo." Still
floating down the great river they entered into friendly
relations with the Illinois, passed the river of the same name,
and soon afterwards the rocky cliffs then decorated with painted
monsters representing the Indian gods. The farthest point reached
was near the mouth of the Arkansas, where they narrowly escaped
an attack from the tribe of that name. Hence they retraced their
course, having done enough to prove that the great river must
enter the Gulf of Mexico, though many miles of its winding
channel still lay between them and its mouth. Ascending the
Illinois the voyagers crossed over to the south end of Lake
Michigan and reached Green Bay at the end of September, 1673.</p>
<p>Although much weakened by dysentery, Marquette returned in
1674 to the Illinois to establish a mission on its banks, but
succumbed to his malady on the shores of Lake Michigan when
retracing his steps in 1675. Joliet subsequently did good work in
other directions, journeying to Hudson Bay in 1679, and while
engaged in the fisheries acquiring a close knowledge of the St
Lawrence and the coasts of Labrador, which gained him the post of
Royal pilot and hydrographer.</p>
<p>To Joliet and Marquette belongs the merit of the first
discovery of the Mississippi, but the opening up of its valley to
French enterprise was due to the ambitious and far-sighted views
of La Salle, who saw in these vast and fertile regions a field
far surpassing in promise the frost-bound shores of the St
Lawrence.</p>
<p>Thwarted throughout by the jealousy and dislike of his fellow
colonists. La Salle found a supporter in the Governor Frontenac,
himself far from popular in the colony. A fort having been
established by the governor on Lake Ontario, La Salle obtained a
grant of the fort and the surrounding lands, and thus secured to
himself the important trade which it commanded. Here he matured
his schemes, which aimed at nothing less than the colonisation of
the fertile plains of the Mississippi valley, and the conversion
of the Indian tribes and their transformation into peaceful
subjects of the French crown. Obtaining a patent from the king,
by which he was authorised to continue his discoveries towards
the south, and to secure the country explored by the construction
of forts. La Salle obtained the co-operation of an Italian
officer then in France named Henri de Tonty, whose unswerving
loyalty proved of priceless value amid the general opposition and
treachery which beset the enterprise. Another coadjutor who
played a prominent part in it and became the chronicler of the
expedition was the Recollet friar Louis Hennepin, a Fleming by
birth, who, already stationed at Fort Frontenac, now obtained
permission to accompany the expedition. Hennepin, though not
lacking in courage, was of a vain and boastful disposition, and
grave doubts exist as to the trustworthiness of his account,
which is, however, of some value as supplementing the other
records.</p>
<p>With the aid of his associates&mdash;one of whom, La Motte by
name, took part in the early stages only of the
expedition&mdash;La Salle in the autumn of 1678 transported his
supplies to the Niagara river, where a fort was established and a
small vessel built above the cataract, of which a minute account
is given for the first time in Hennepin's journal. After a winter
of great hardship the vessel&mdash;named the <i>Griffin</i>, in
allusion to the arms of Frontenac&mdash;was ready for launching,
and the navigation of the upper lakes began.</p>
<p>The party had now been increased by the arrival of two more
Recollet friars. Fathers Membré and Ribourde. Harassed by
intrigue and desertions, as well as by anxiety in regard to his
creditors in the colony. La Salle slowly made his way past the
Strait of Mackinaw and along the shores of Lake Michigan,
encountering constant storms, and meeting with some difficulties
from the Indians. The <i>Griffin</i> had meanwhile been sent back
with a cargo of furs, while Tonty, who had been sent to the Sault
Ste Marie, only arrived after much delay at the fort of the
Mi'amis built by La Salle at the mouth of the St Joseph. It was
not till December, 1679, that a start could be made up the St
Joseph for the portage to the Kankakee, down which river the
voyage was pursued to the Illinois, until an encampment of that
nation was reached. Still pursued by intrigue and desertion, and
threatened with ruin by the loss of the <i>Griffin</i> either by
storm or treachery. La Salle returned for fresh succour, leaving
his small force under Tonty with instructions to commence the
building of another vessel at a newly-constructed fort which he
named Crèvec&oelig;ur in token of the low ebb of his
fortunes.</p>

(From his <i>Nouvelle Découverte</i> of 1697.)</small></p>
<br>
<p>After a winter journey of incredible hardships La Salle
reached the French settlements and raised funds for the renewal
of his undertaking, only to learn of the desertion of the greater
part of the men left with Tonty. That officer with two or three
faithful followers became involved in an invasion of the Illinois
country by the Iroquois, and only after great sufferings made
their way back by the west shores of Michigan, just when La Salle
was bringing aid to them by the opposite side. After a vain
search for his followers, during which the Illinois was descended
to the Mississippi, La Salle wintered at Fort Mi'ami, engaged in
the re-organisation of his enterprise, which had now to start
afresh from the beginning. Meanwhile Hennepin, who with two
companions, Accault and Du Gay, had been despatched from Fort
Crèvec&oelig;ur on an exploring trip down the Illinois, had
ascended the Upper Mississippi and undergone many adventures
among the Sioux, by whom he was captured. The exact extent of his
journeys cannot be determined owing to the suspicion which
attaches to his veracity. In a second edition of his work,
published after La Salle's death, he made the fraudulent claim to
the discovery of the whole Mississippi to the sea, but his
pretended descriptions are known to have been borrowed from the
journal of Father Membré, who accompanied La Salle on his
successful journey of 1681. While on the Upper Mississippi
Hennepin fell in with an enterprising French pioneer, Du Luth (or
Du Lhut) by name, who had for two years been exploring near the
head of Lake Superior and the head-waters of the Mississippi. He
had thus preceded Hennepin in his visit to the Sioux towns, and
it is apparently from one of his companions that Lake Pepin
derives its name. In his company Hennepin made his way to Green
Bay and Mackinac, and thence to Montreal, his connection with La
Salle now finally ceasing.</p>
<p>Having guarded against danger from the Iroquois by forming a
defensive alliance between the Mi'amis and Illinois, La Salle
returned to Canada to complete his arrangements for a final
attempt to descend the Mississippi to the sea. At Mackinac he met
with Tonty and Membré, who again joined him, whereupon, in
December 1681, the re-organised expedition once more set out from
Fort Mi'ami, and, descending the Illinois in canoes, entered the
Mississippi in the following February. Floating on past the mouth
of the turbid Missouri, the explorers, this time blessed with
better fortune, soon reached the Ohio, and on March 13 heard,
through the fog which enveloped the stream, the war drums of the
Arkansas tribe near the river which now bears their name.
Friendly relations were however established and the voyagers
passed on, visiting the great town of the Taensas and meeting
with a cordial reception from other riverine tribes. Avoiding a
hostile demonstration of the Quinipissas, on April 6 they reached
the beginning of the great delta, and, dividing their forces,
descended the three main channels into which the river divided,
uniting again on the shores of the Gulf of Mexico. Here a
ceremony was enacted by which La Salle took possession of the
whole Mississippi valley in the name of the French king, in
honour of whom the vast region received the name of
Louisiana.</p>
<p>A great triumph had been won, but a toilsome voyage up the
great river still awaited the explorers. During this some
fighting occurred, and the leader was prostrated by illness, but
travelling by slow degrees was able to reach Mackinac before the
end of September. In order to develop the resources of his new
domain La Salle proposed to found two colonies, one on the
Illinois as a centre of the fur trade of that region, and one at
the mouth of the Mississippi to secure an outlet in that
direction. The former first engaged his attention, and a fort was
built on a rock overhanging the Illinois, which received the name
of Fort St Louis; around it a large body of Indians soon
assembled, seeking protection against the Iroquois foe.</p>
<p>During La Salle's absence a new governor&mdash;La
Barre&mdash;had arrived in Canada, and the explorer soon found
cause to lament the loss of his protector Frontenac. Thwarted on
all hands he returned to France, and finding favour at court,
obtained the support of the king for a new enterprise on the Gulf
of Mexico. By undertaking to break the Spanish monopoly on the
waters of the gulf he secured the equipment of an expedition of
four ships, two of them manned with a force of soldiers and a
body of colonists and artificers. Three Recollet friars, Membré,
Douay, and Le Clerc, joined the expedition, as well as La Salle's
brother already alluded to and two other Sulpicians. The command
of the vessels was given to a naval officer, Beaujeu, an
unfortunate decision, as the divided command soon led to friction
which boded ill for the success of the enterprise. Misfortunes
indeed pursued the adventurers from the outset. Delays occurred
in the preparations, and when in July, 1684, the expedition
sailed, disputes soon broke out between the commanders. During
the stay in the West Indies, La Salle was seized with severe
illness, which for a time totally incapacitated him. Arrived at
length in the gulf, a search was made in vain for the mouth of
the Mississippi, of the longitude of which La Salle was ignorant.
By an unfortunate mistake he landed his men among the lagoons on
the north-western shore of the gulf, over 400 miles from the
object of his search, while to add to his distress the ship laden
with all the stores for the colony was wrecked on attempting to
enter a neighbouring bay.</p>
<p>A temporary station was established, but disaster still
attended the party. The natives were hostile, the crops soon
proved a failure, and the one small vessel which remained to La
Salle after the departure of Beaujeu suffered the fate of the
store-ship. Returning to the temporary fort after a vain attempt
to make his way overland to the Mississippi, the leader formed
the desperate resolution of leading his party overland to Canada,
leaving a few men only to represent him on the gulf. Crossing the
prairies, roamed over by herds of buffalo, which occupy the
basins of the Brazos, Trinity, and other Texan streams, the
expedition had not yet passed into the Mississippi valley, when a
tragedy occurred which finally broke up the ill-starred
expedition. Discontent had for some time prevailed in the party,
and it reached a climax (March, 1687) in the murder, first of La
Salle's nephew Moranget and two subordinates, and finally of La
Salle himself. The loyal remnant of the party now consisted only
of Joutel, a gardener's son, who had throughout shown himself one
of the leader's most efficient and trusty lieutenants, with two
priests and three youths, one of whom was nephew to La Salle.
These were helpless to avenge the murders, but, after some time
had been spent among the Cenis Indians, the ringleaders fell at
the hands of their own followers and Joutel was able to make his
way with a small party to the Arkansas, where he met with two of
Tonty's subordinates, left by that officer during a descent of
the Mississippi in search of his missing chief. Tonty had even
reached the mouth of the great river a second time while La Salle
was engaged in his weary search for it on the plains of Texas.
Joutel now made his way with his companions to the fort on the
Illinois (1687), and it is to his pen that we owe the best
account of the fatal expedition. The memoirs published by Tonty
are a valuable authority for both of La Salle's expeditions in
which he took part, while the results of the discoveries are well
shown on the great map of Franquelin, hydrographer at Quebec,
published in 1684.</p>
<p>Two expeditions, undertaken about the time of La Salle's
death, deserve mention. The one, led by Nicholas Perrot, somewhat
extended the bounds of knowledge in the region of the Upper
Mississippi, the other, under De Troyes and Iberville, was
directed against the English on the shores of Hudson Bay.
Iberville was soon to take a prominent place in the history of
the French in America.</p>

<br>
<p>La Salle's death forms a fitting conclusion to the first great
period of geographical discovery in the interior of North
America. Although some have tried to disparage his services,
while his proud and reserved nature in some degree unfitted him
to be a successful leader of men, there can be nothing but
admiration for the indomitable will which helped him to persevere
in the face of untold difficulties in the task which he had set
himself Although not crowned with success during his lifetime,
his schemes had far-reaching effects on the future of the
Mississippi basin, where his steps were soon followed by his
compatriots, and where, for a time at least, French influence was
secure from the encroachments of rivals. The period which now
ensued&mdash;ushered in by the revolution in England&mdash;was
marked by political rivalries with that nation and gave little
scope for great pioneering journeys, so that the vast regions of
the far west were not thrown open till a much later date.</p>
<p>Throughout the century now closing, the brilliant geographical
achievements in North America were all the work of Frenchmen. For
the very reason which made them more successful as colonists, the
English settlers were less given to the wandering life which
carried the French fur-traders into the remote wilds of the
continent; and though attempts have been made to prove that
English explorers entered the Mississippi basin at an early date,
the accounts of their journeys rest on too insecure a basis to be
definitely accepted as facts.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<h4>NORTHERN AND CENTRAL ASIA, 1600-1750</h4>
<p><span class="a">As</span> in other parts of the world, so in
Northern and Central Asia, the opening of the seventeenth century
marks the beginning of a rapid advance in geographical knowledge;
an advance so effectual that, before the century closed, the
geography of the whole northern zone of the continent, till then
wrapped in almost complete obscurity, was already known in its
broad outlines. Even the history of American discovery records no
instance of an equally vast land area brought to light within so
short a space of time, while the physical obstacles encountered
add to the greatness of the achievement, and to our wonder at the
hardihood of the agents by whom it was performed. It is all the
more striking that in the whole story of early Siberian discovery
no one name stands out as worthy of a place in the roll of the
world's great explorers, but that the work was mainly
accomplished by a host of obscure adventurers, who, in the ardent
pursuit of the fur-trade, or in the role of freebooters, added a
new empire to the dominions of the Russian Czar.</p>
<p>It was, however, considerably before the end of the sixteenth
century that a knowledge of Western Siberia began to be acquired
by those of the Russians whose attention was turned in this
direction. Even in the eleventh century some of the bolder
spirits had pushed beyond the Ural, reaching the lower Ob early
in the twelfth. A fairly continuous intercourse with this region
was thenceforth maintained, and during the fifteenth century
raids of a quasi-military character strengthened the connection
still further. During the sixteenth century the commercial
enterprise of the Strogonoffs directed attention to this quarter,
and the maps of Münster and Herberstein, with the commentaries of
the latter, show that some accurate knowledge had already been
gained.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> In 1556 troops were sent across the
Urals by Ivan the Terrible, who two years later took the title of
"Lord of Obdoria Ugria and Sibir." <sup><b>[2]</b></sup> It was,
however, the campaign of the famous Cossack leader Yermak
Timofeief which first prepared the way for permanent occupation.
During this campaign (1579-1582) Sibir, then the residence of the
Tartar chief Kuchum Khan, was taken, and though Yermak soon
afterwards perished, his conquests were prosecuted by the Russian
government. In 1687 the fortress of Tobolsk was erected a few
miles from the site of Sibir, and this became the capital of the
Russian Asiatic dominions, which now extended to the Ob. Thus
before the close of the sixteenth century the Czar had already
established a firm footing east of the Urals.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Herberstein's map of 1550 marks the
"Oby" with a river "Sibur" as its tributary. The details are of
course inaccurate, <i>e.g</i>. the Ob is made to issue from a
lake Kythay, near a city Chumbalyk, derived apparently from the
accounts of the medieval travellers to China. The Samoyedes, who
are mentioned in Herberstein's account, had already figured in
Waldseemüller's map of 1516.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Sibir, from which the whole of northern
Asia was eventually named, was a fort near the junction of the
Tobol with the Irtish.]</p>
<p>Little resistance was now encountered in the further advance
eastward, which took place with extreme rapidity. In 1604 Tomsk
was founded, and expeditions were pushed forward from this as a
base. Meanwhile the fur-traders, who directed their attention
chiefly to the more northern regions, were pushing beyond the
lower Ob, discovering the Taz, and in 1610 reaching the Yenesei,
where the town of Turukhansk was soon afterwards founded. The
Yenesei was soon passed and the Piasina discovered; the whole
coast of Asia as far as the latter river being shown on the map
of Isaac Massa published in Holland in 1612. An attempt to
advance eastward by sea from the Yenesei mouth having failed, a
more southerly route was adopted by way of the Lower Tunguska,
which led the adventurers into the Lena basin. At the same time a
second line of advance brought the Cossacks from Tomsk to the
Upper Yenesei, where Yeneseisk was founded in 1619 and
Krasnoiarsk in 1627. On reaching the Angara the Russian pioneers
met with some resistance from the warlike Buriats, but this was
overcome, and the shores of Lake Baikal were for the first time
trodden by European foot. The Lena basin was approached from this
direction also, and before long the adventurous hunters had
extended their operations over a large part of its area, levying
tribute, as was their wont, from the native tribes with which
they came in contact. In this direction they encountered the
Yakuts, who had already fallen back before the Buriats from their
original home near Lake Baikal, and who now, unable to withstand
the Russian freebooters, continued their northward migration
towards the shores of the Arctic ocean. In 1632 the town of
Yakutsk, now the capital of the largest province of the Russian
Empire, was founded in the Yakut territory, and became the base
for further explorations towards the north and east. In 1617 the
Cossack Elisei Busa reached an arm of the Lena delta, and turning
westward, discovered the Olenek, where he wintered. The following
year he returned to the Lena, which he descended in boats to the
sea. He then followed the coast eastward to the mouth of the
Yana, which river he ascended for some distance, continuing his
explorations in this region for over two years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile others had pushed on eastward from Yakutsk, crossing
the range which bounds the Lena basin to the east, and descending
its eastern slopes to the sea of Okhotsk, where in 1638 a station
was founded on the site of the modern town of Okhotsk. The whole
breadth of the continent had thus been crossed in little over
half a century since the capture of Sibir by Yermak. Further
north the Indigirka was discovered by Ivanof Postnik, whose
followers built boats and traced the river downwards to its
mouth, afterwards continuing their course eastward to the
Alaseya. About the same time the Kolyma, the last important river
of the northern Asiatic coast, was discovered, and on its banks a
station was founded in 1644 by Mikhailo Stadukhin on the site of
Nijne Kolymsk. Stadukhin heard here for the first time of the
Chukches, who inhabit the remote north-eastern corner of Asia,
and seems also to have gained some intelligence of the New
Siberian Islands and Wrangel Land, though the two were
confounded. Another great river was said to enter the sea further
east, but this proved eventually to have an easterly and not a
northerly course. The Chukches were visited in 1646 by Isai
Ignatief, and in the following year an expedition was prepared on
a more important scale and placed under the command of Feodot
Alexeief. It proved unsuccessful, but is noteworthy from the fact
that in it took part the Cossack Simeon Deshnef, who though long
unknown to fame, in course of time acquired some celebrity as the
first (if his claim is to be believed) actually to prove the
existence of a strait between Asia and America.</p>
<p>The history of the notions then current with respect to such a
strait deserves some attention. During the greater part of the
fifteenth century one of the problems which chiefly exercised the
minds of geographers was the so-called Strait of Anian, supposed
in some way to connect the Atlantic and Pacific, though the
origin of the name is lost in obscurity. The idea is said to date
from the voyage of Cortereal to Labrador in 1500, which seemed to
indicate the existence of a passage to the north of America. But
it is remarkable that none of the early maps place the strait of
Anian in this locality, but in the position of Bering Strait as
now known. It appears thus in the map of Zaltieri (1566) and in
various other maps, some anonymous, of the latter half of the
same century, including that of Frobisher (1578). Anian also
appears as the name of the country on one or the other side of
the strait. The discovery of such a passage more than once
engaged the attention of the Spanish authorities in Mexico, and
was the principal motive of the voyage of Vizcaino in 1596. A
note on the famous map of 1600 ascribed to Edward Wright throws
doubt on the existence of any narrow strait, the voyage of
Francisco de Gali in 1583 having been supposed to show that its
place was occupied by a wide sea. After the voyage of Martin
Vries described in the third chapter, the Dutch believed in the
existence of a large land (Compagnies Landt) to the east of Yezo,
occupying a large part of the Pacific north of 40"; but the
strait of Anian still appeared in some maps as separating this
land from America, the strait on the western side being named
after Vries. These ideas continued to hold their own for many
years after the date of the Russian voyage now to be described,
the results of which long remained unnoticed by the rest of the
world. Those results were indeed not incompatible with the old
notions, as Compagnies Landt might have lain entirely to the east
of the seas navigated by Deshnef.</p>
<p>As stated above, the first attempt at exploration, in 1647,
was unsuccessful, but in the following year a new expedition,
originally consisting of seven boats, was fitted out, three of
the boats, which alone persevered in the enterprise, being
commanded respectively by Deshnef, Alexeief, and another Cossack
named Ankudinof.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The mouth of the Kolyma was
left in June, and an easterly course steered until the eastern
extremity of Asia had been rounded. This seems to have been the
great cape of the Chukches (Chukutskoi-nos) of Deshnef, though
the name is now more usually applied to the point at the
north-eastern extremity of the gulf of
Anadyr.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> Two islands lay off the Cape, which
pointed between north and north-east, while beyond it the coast
was rounded off towards the Anadyr&mdash;the principal object of
search on the part of the expedition. Hereabouts Ankudinof's boat
was wrecked, the crews being distributed between the other boats,
which afterwards became separated. That of Deshnef was driven
about by contrary winds until it was finally cast ashore at the
mouth of the Olutorsk, near the northern extremity of Kamchatka.
Hence the Cossack and his men made their way overland to the
Anadyr, where they wintered, founding a station on the site of
the future Anadyrsk. This remained their headquarters for several
years, during which other parties arrived from the Kolyma, the
chief men among them being Simeon Motora,
Stadukhin,<sup><b>[3]</b></sup> and Selivestrof. The Anadyr
region was thus more or less thoroughly explored, while the
natives after some fighting were compelled to pay tribute. The
fate of the rest of the party which had rounded the eastern
extremity of Asia with Deshnef is involved in uncertainty.
According to intelligence obtained by Deshnef among the Koriaks,
many died either from disease or at the hands of the natives, but
some escaped in their boats. A tradition was afterwards current
in Kamchatka that some of the party had reached that country and
even doubled its southern point. If this was really the case,
they preceded by almost fifty years the eventual conqueror of
Kamchatka, Vladimir Atlassof.</p>

light in the 18th century by G.F. Müller (see p. 261

36, p. 81).]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> The eastern point of Asia, long known
as East Cape, was in 1898 renamed Cape Deshnef, in honour of the

<p class="foot">[<b>3</b> Stadukhin had previously (1647-49)
sought for the Anadyr along the northern coast of Siberia, but
only advanced seven days' journey beyond the mouth of the
Kolyma.]</p>
<p>As a result of these various voyages the coasts of Siberia
east of the Lena were now known almost throughout their whole
extent, and the few remaining gaps were soon filled
up.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> From the Lena to the Kolyma the coasts
were much frequented by traders in their "kotches" or
flat-bottomed boats. The sea route to the Anadyr taken by Deshnef
was not used, however, after the discovery of the shorter
overland passage. West of the Lena the coast was little explored
until the next century.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Sviatoi cape, the nearest point to the
New Siberian Islands, seems to have been first rounded in 1650 by
Andrei Goreloi, but the island opposite (Liakhof) is not known to
have been visited until some years later. Reference may be made
to the sketch-maps in Chapter x.]</p>
<p>While the adventurous hunters and traders were thus pushing
their explorations towards the extreme north-east, others were
extending the bounds of knowledge in the south-east of Siberia
also, with the result that in less than fifty years the general
features of the Amur system became known, while settlements
sprang up at various points. In 1639 a party of Cossacks built a
station on the shores of the Sea of Okhotsk, near the mouth of
the Ulya, and gained from the Tunguses some intelligence
respecting the countries to the south. Reports of the Shilka, one
of the upper branches of the Amur, were also heard by a party
which reached the Vitim daring the same year. To discover this
river an expedition was despatched from Yakutsk in 1643 under the
command of a Cossack named Poyarkof, who ascended the Aldan and
its southern feeders the Uchur and Konam, leaving a part of his
men in winter quarters on the north side of the divide, while
with the rest he crossed the mountains and reached the Brianta, a
tributary of the Zeya. Pushing on down this stream Poyarkof
encountered a Tungus tribe, and afterwards came to a Daurian
village at the mouth of the Umlekan. Here food ran short, while
the overbearing conduct of the Russians led to fights with the
natives, and only half the advance guard remained alive when help
was brought by the party left on the Konam. The journey down the
Zeya was now continued, and in five days the Amur was reached.
Descending in turn the main stream of the Amur, Poyarkof passed
the Zungari and the territory of the Natki, reaching the mouth of
the Amur after a voyage of nearly three months. Here he wintered,
and during the summer of 1645 made his way by sea to the mouth of
the Ulya, not reaching Yakutsk till June 1646. The last of the
great Siberian rivers had thus been discovered and navigated for
nearly half its length. The Russian discoveries from the west had
also approached within a short distance of those of the Dutch
from the south, though it was some time longer before a
connecting link was established between the work of the two
nations.</p>

<br>
<p>The route followed by Poyarkof was long and difficult, but
information was soon obtained of a better way by the Olekma,
whose upper basin closely approaches that of the Shilka. In 1648
a small party entered the Upper Amur basin by way of the Urka,
striking the main river a little below that tributary's mouth.
Here they obtained intelligence of a chief named Lavkai, whose
fame had already reached the Russian authorities from other
directions. In 1649 an adventurer named Khabarof undertook a new
expedition, which wintered on the Tungir, one of the upper
branches of the Olekma, and proceeded onwards towards the Amur in
January, 1650, the divide being crossed on sledges. On reaching
Lavkai's country negociations were carried on unsuccessfully with
the Daurians, who fled, abandoning their forts. Leaving the
greater number of his men here, Khabarof returned to Yakutsk for
reinforcements, with which he again reached the Daurian country
in 1651. In June he set out on a voyage down the Amur, capturing
<i>en route</i> an important Daurian
stronghold.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> After an attack on a Daurian
village below the mouth of the Zeya, the chiefs acknowledged the
Czar's authority, but, the people soon deserting their village, a
forward move was necessary. Passing down the river to the
territory of the Achani (the Natki of Poyarkof) Khabarof decided
to go into winter quarters. Here again the exactions of the
Russians led to fighting, in which the natives were aided, but to
no purpose, by the Manchus. In the following spring Khabarof
reascended the Amur, and after passing the defile of the Bureya
mountains met with reinforcements under Chechegin and
Petrillofskoi. But a mutiny among his men put a check on his
schemes of conquest, and all that he could effect was the
occupation of a post above the mouth of the Zeya, subsequently
known as Kumarsk from the stream which there enters the Amur. On
his reascent of the Amur from the Achani country Khabarof had
missed a party of men descending to meet him under one Nagiba,
who continued his journey to the mouth of the Amur, defeating the
Giliaks who opposed him, and, after various adventures on the
shores of the Sea of Okhotsk, eventually made his way overland to
the Aldan and thence to Yakutsk.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The tribes on the Amur acknowledged in
some measure the authority of the Manchus who now reigned in
China.]</p>
<p>So far the work had been left to irresponsible adventurers
whose brutality towards the natives had ruined the prospects of
peaceful settlement. The government now resolved to intervene,
and in 1652 despatched Dmitri Simoviof to prepare the way for
further explorations by way of the Olekma and Tungir. In 1653 he
arrived on the Amur, sending Khabarof to Moscow to report to the
Czar, while future operations were entrusted to Onufrei Stepanof.
This officer visited various parts of the Amur, and on one
occasion ascended the Zungari for three days, but did not effect
much. Establishing himself at Kumarsk for the winter of 1654-55,
he was besieged by a large Chinese army, which however at last
withdrew. Subsequently Stepanof was joined by a force under
Feodor Pushkin, which had established a post at the mouth of the
Argun (Upper Amur), and the two commanders went to the lower
river, where they built a fort in the Giliak country. Stepanof
was slain in 1658 in a great battle with the Manchus near the
mouth of the Zungari, and the greater part of the Amur basin was
for a time withdrawn from Russian authority.</p>
<p>Before this, however, other explorations had been effected in
the upper basin of the river, where parties from Yeneseisk had
reached the Shilka. In 1652 an expedition under the Cossack
Beketof, with Maximof as lieutenant, crossed Lake Baikal, and
after wintering at the mouth of the Selenga, ascended that stream
to the Khilok and Lake Ilgen. In 1654 the divide was crossed to
the Ingoda, and the latter river descended to the Shilka, a fort
being built opposite the mouth of the Nercha. But things soon
went badly, and Beketof, with a part of his men, was forced to
join Stepanof on the lower Amur. In 1656 a new expedition under
Pashkof started from Yeneseisk, following in Beketofs steps, but
not reaching the Shilka till early in 1658. The town of Nerchinsk
was founded at the mouth of the Nercha, and though Pashkof met
with no great success in his endeavours to establish Russian
authority, the town in time acquired some importance under his
successors. In 1669 a band of adventurers under a Polish exile
Chernigofski reached the Amur by way of the Tungir, and founded a
settlement at Albazin opposite the mouth of the Albazikha, which
enters the Amur from the south a little below the junction of the
Shilka and Argun. Albazin soon became the most important Russian
settlement in the Amur region, cultivation being carried on with
some success. In the region of the Zeya also, stations soon
sprang up, including one at Aigun a little below that river's
mouth, and in 1681 the country in this direction was further
explored by Ignati Milovanof, who soon afterwards established, by
order of the government, a fortified post at Selimbinsk on the
Selimja (Silinji) river. About this time two of the northern
tributaries of the lower Amur, the Bureya and Amgun, came within
the sphere of Russian activity, and a station was founded on the
latter by Gavrilo Feolof. Thus, after various fluctuations,
Russian supremacy seemed at last established over the whole
northern and central basin of the Amur, but it was not destined
to last long.</p>
<p>As has been already mentioned, the Manchu rulers of China
claimed a sort of jurisdiction over the tribes of the Amur basin,
and, being now represented by the great Emperor Kang-hi, were not
disposed to look quietly on at these proceedings of the Russians.
As early as 1653, after the first collision with the Manchus, a
Russian envoy had been despatched to Peking to come to some
arrangement, but was slain on the way by his guides. In 1676,
however, an embassy headed by Nicolas Spafarik, a Greek,
succeeded in making its way across Manchuria to Peking by way of
Tsitsikhar, and as a result of the negotiations orders had been
given to the authorities on the Amur to abstain from action on
the lower river; but they had remained a dead letter. The Chinese
now resolved to eject the Russians by force, and soon drove them
from the lower river, while in 1684 the garrison of Albazin was
forced after a siege to evacuate the place. Its reoccupation was
followed by a second siege, but meanwhile negotiations were
commenced, which finally resulted in the evacuation by Russia,
for over a century and a half, of the whole eastern part of the
Amur basin. The treaty by which this was arranged was negotiated
at Nerchinsk, where, in 1689, the Russian envoy Golovin met the
Chinese plenipotentiaries, accompanied as interpreters by the
Jesuits, Gerbillon and Pereyra. Of the extensive travels of
Gerbillon we shall speak in a subsequent section.</p>
<p>Three years later (1692), an embassy was despatched by the
Czar to the Emperor of China by way of Siberia and Manchuria. The
envoy, Everard Ysbrantz Ides, who was a Dane by birth,
subsequently wrote an account of his travels, which found a place
in several of the old collections, and thus did much to spread a
knowledge of the newly-acquired possessions of the Russian crown.
Ides describes the Ostiaks, Tunguses, Buriats, and other peoples
of Siberia, besides giving particulars respecting the country. In
speaking of the mammoth&mdash;which some of the natives believed
to live underground, though the Russians regarded it as an
antediluvian inhabitant of the country&mdash;he gives a good
description of the breaking up of the ice in the Siberian rivers,
by which the banks are washed away, and the carcases exposed. The
embassy travelled <i>viâ</i> Irkutsk (recently rebuilt and
already becoming a town of some importance) to Nerchinsk, and
thence through Manchuria to Peking. From Nerchinsk the route led
first to the Argun, where the Russians had a fort, and then
across the mountains to the valleys of the Yalo and Nonni, thus
just missing Tsitsikhar. Ides was the first European traveller to
give an account of this country, though the southern part of
Manchuria had already been visited by the Jesuits from
Peking.</p>
<p>Although, as we have seen, Russian enterprise was now cut
short on the Amur, it had already made known the geographical
features of the whole of that region, while the diplomatic
relations with China had drawn a connecting link across the
obscure region of Manchuria. The chief area of unknown ground
still remaining in north-eastern Asia lay between the Sea of
Okhotsk and the farthest outposts of the Russian traders on the
Anadyr; and even this was in part brought within the bounds of
European knowledge before the close of the century.</p>
<p>In 1696 Atlassof, commanding the post of Anadyrsk, sent the
Cossack Moroskoi to extend Russian influence towards the
south.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Moroskoi reached the neighbourhood of
the Kamchatka river on the east side of the peninsula, finding,
in a native fort which he took, traces of the previous arrival of
Japanese castaways. In the following year (1697) Atlassof himself
proceeded south and built a fort on the Kamchatka river, which
subsequently became the centre whence the whole country was
subjugated. The completion of the work was not, however, effected
till the next century, while it was long before the true
relations of Kamchatka with other lands to the south were
understood, some even taking that peninsula to be continuous with
Yezo. The first discovery of the west coast of Kamchatka of which
certain information exists took place in 1716, when a vessel
commanded by the Cossack Sokolof, aided by Swedish prisoners of
war, who had been sent to eastern Siberia on account of their
skill in shipbuilding and navigation, made the voyage from
Okhotsk to the Tigil river, and down the coast to the
Kompakova.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> The first authenticated rounding
of the southern extremity of the peninsula belongs rather to a
new period of exploration, which will be dealt with in a
subsequent chapter.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The dates of Moroskoi's and Atlassof's
expeditions are here given on the authority of G.F. Müller, but
it should be noted that Krasheninikof, in his <i>History of
Kamchatka</i> (see p. 262, infra), places them both two years
later, <i>i.e</i>. in 1698 and 1699.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Reports of an earlier voyage down the
east coast of Kamchatka, and round its southern extremity, may
have some basis of fact, but in any case nothing certain is known
about it (cf. p. 123, <i>ante</i>).]</p>
<br>
<p>Before proceeding to speak of the extension of geographical
knowledge during the seventeenth century from the side of China,
two journeys undertaken from India during the early part of that
century may be described. The first is that of Bento (Benedict)
de Goes, a lay member of the Jesuit order, who in 1603 set out
from India in search of the Great Empire of Cathay, of which the
fame had long before been noised abroad by the medieval
travellers. During the two centuries and a half which had elapsed
since the days of the Franciscan missionaries and other early
visitors to China, no European had reached that Empire by the
land route followed, for the last time of which we have any
knowledge, by John de Marignolli, envoy from Pope Benedict XII to
the Great Khan in 1338. Some intelligence had, it is true, come
through by native agency, while even after the sea route had been
opened up by the Portuguese, information respecting Cathay was
obtained during the journey to Bokhara of Anthony Jenkinson and
his companions in 1558-9. But so vague were the current ideas
respecting Central Asian geography that it was far from generally
recognised that Cathay and China were but different names for one
and the same empire. The arrival at the court of Akbar, just
before the end of the sixteenth century, of a Mohammedan merchant
from China (Cathay), which he had reached by way of Kashgar,
turned the attention of the Jesuits in India to that empire as a
field for missionary labour, and Goes, with other missionaries,
was chosen to carry out a journey of exploration in that
direction.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Goes was a native of San Miguel in the
Azores, and had apparently reached India as a soldier on board a
Portuguese fleet.]</p>
<p>The journey&mdash;which ended fatally for the traveller,
though not before he had reached the borders of the land he
sought&mdash;was a very remarkable one, leading as it did through
countries not again visited by Europeans until the nineteenth
century; but the details which we possess about it are
unfortunately of a very fragmentary character. Goes left Agra,
where Akbar then held his court, in 1602 or early in 1603,
choosing the route, most used by merchants, round the western
extremity of the Himalayas and by the cities of Eastern
Turkestan. His track cannot be followed with precision even in
the light of recent discovery, but the general direction was as
follows. Crossing the Indus at Attok he reached Kabul by way of
Peshawur, and crossed the Hindu Kush ("very lofty mountains") by
a pass to the north or north-west of the former city. Reaching
Talikhan he passed on through a district in which civil war was
raging, and traversing some exceedingly difficult country,
entered the "defile of Badakshan", in which the road ran above a
river, possibly the Panj or Upper Oxus, or perhaps one of its
tributaries. An open desolate tract (one or other of the various
Pamirs) was then crossed, and after it a steep mountain, beyond
which lay the province of Sarikol. Hence the meridional range
which culminates in Mustagh-ata was crossed by the Chichiklik
pass, and the route continued <i>viâ</i> Tangitar to Yarkand.
After waiting a year, during which he paid a visit to Khotan,
Goes, in November 1604, joined a new caravan, bound for China,
which took the route across a corner of the desert to Aksu, and
then east along the southern foot of the Tian Shan by Kucha and
Turfan to Kamil or Hami. Before this our traveller had learnt
from merchants travelling on the return journey that Cathay was
indeed China, as the Jesuits in Peking had conjectured even
before Goes set out on his search. Crossing the steppes infested
by roving bands of "Tartars", and passing through the Great Wall,
Goes arrived at Suchou, whence, after some difficulty, he
communicated with his co-religionists at Peking. A native
Christian was sent to escort him, but on arriving at Suchou in
March, 1607, found Goes prostrated by illness, which ended
fatally eleven days later. Some suspicion was entertained that
the traveller was poisoned by the Mohammedans, who at Suchou had
given him constant trouble, and who after his death seized all
his goods. Among these was a carefully kept journal, which, had
it come down to us, would have given most valuable information on
a route not again traversed by a European for some 250 years.</p>
<p>The second traveller above referred to was also a Jesuit,
Antonio de Andrade by name, who went to India as a missionary
early in the seventeenth century, and in 1624 started, like Goes,
from Agra on an adventurous journey into the unknown lands beyond
the Himalayas. The journey was a remarkable one, being the first
recorded instance of the passage by a European of the mountain
barrier which shuts in India on the north, while it was also the
first made by a European into Tibet since that of Friar Odoric
early in the fourteenth century. Joining a party of pilgrims,
Andrade ascended the head-stream of the Ganges, by the sacred
shrine of Badrinath, to its source in a small glacier lake on the
Mana pass (18,000 ft). Pushing on, he reached the then important
centre of Chaprang on the Upper Satlej, in the elevated region
often known as Little Tibet, returning thence to India before the
end of the year. On this first journey he was accompanied by
Emmanuel Marques, and on returning to Chaprang in 1625, by
Gonzales de Sousa as well.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> This was the
beginning of a long intercourse of Europeans with Tibet&mdash;one
which lasted, with breaks of greater or less duration, till the
beginning of the nineteenth century. The next important journey
after that of Andrade was undertaken from the direction of China,
to which we must now turn our attention.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> For further note on Andrade's journeys
see Appendix.]</p>
<p>Although during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries China
had been made more or less known to Europe by the travels of
Marco Polo and others, and the missionary labours of the devoted
Franciscan Friars, headed by John of Montecorvino, an almost
complete break in the intercourse between east and west had
supervened, for more than a century before the Portuguese ships
made their way for trading purposes to the coasts of the far
east. Their intercourse with China&mdash;confined to one or two
ports&mdash;did little to improve the knowledge of the interior,
and it was not until the arrival of a new band of missionaries
that any great advance was made in this respect. Already, towards
the close of the sixteenth century, a first step had been made by
the labours of Juan Gonzalez de Mendoza, a Spanish missionary,
who published an account of the Chinese Empire in 1585.</p>
<p>In 1578 the Jesuit Valignan visited Macao, and recommended the
despatch from India of one or more priests to commence work in
southern China. Three Italians were soon afterwards sent, among
them being Matthew Ricci, who had studied geography in Rome under
the celebrated Jesuit mathematician, Clavius. After a few years
the missionaries were permitted to establish themselves on the
mainland of Kwangtung, and in 1595 Ricci set out overland on a
journey to Peking, where he hoped to gain influence at court; but
on this occasion he failed to obtain an audience, and was obliged
to retire to Nanking. Hence he again proceeded to Peking in 1600,
being this time well received, and allowed to establish himself
in the capital, whence, as we have already seen, he despatched a
native adherent to meet Goes on the interior frontier of China in
1606. Ricci and his associates found favour with the Chinese on
account of their scientific attainments, and their services were
called in for the reform of the Chinese calendar.</p>
<p>After the death of Ricci in 1610, his papers, which gave a
full account of the establishment of the mission, were edited by
Father Nicolas Trigault and published at Augsburg in 1615, while
his work was continued in China by Johann Adam Schall, and
afterwards by Ferdinand Verbiest, a Fleming.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup>
But no great additions to geographical knowledge were made for
some years, the first important contribution being the
publication of the <i>Atlas Sinensis</i> of Father Martini
(1655). This was based entirely on Chinese sources, and is one
among many proofs that the knowledge possessed by the Chinese of
their own country was far from despicable, however crude were
their ideas as to the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Ricci's <i>Comentari</i> and
<i>Lettere</i> were first printed in full in 1910-11, after being
long lost sight of.]</p>
<p>About this time the Dutch began to scheme for the
establishment of trade with China, and for this purpose sent
several embassies to Peking and elsewhere, but with little result
as far as their chief object was concerned. They led, however, to
some increase in European knowledge of China, for the envoys
travelled overland, and full accounts of their routes were
afterwards published. In 1655 Pieter van Goyer and Jacob van
Keyser started from Canton by the great water-route to the north,
crossing the mountains which separate the basins of the Si-kiang
and Yangtse, and journeying down the Kia-kiang, the southern
tributary of the latter; then descending the Yangtse to the Grand
Canal, by which they continued their journey north. The account
of the journey was written by Jan Nieuhoff (known also for his
travels in Brazil and elsewhere), who embellished his narrative
with a large number of views and plans of cities, drawings of
animals, and the like. Another embassy was headed in 1666 by
Pieter van Hoorn, who, making Fuchou in Fokien his point of
departure, ascended the Min or Si-ho, crossed the divide into
Chekiang, and descended the Tsientang to Hangchou; finally, like
his predecessors, following the course of the Grand Canal. The
account of this journey, compiled by Arnold Montanus, was
published at Amsterdam in 1670, with other narratives of the
Dutch proceedings in China. To the same period belong the travels
of the Spanish Dominican Navarette, who, after spending some
years in the Malay Archipelago, passed over in 1658 to China,
making his way from Macao through the coast provinces to Peking.
He afterwards published (Madrid, 1676) a diffuse account of the
Empire of China, with the narrative of his travels through
Mexico, thence to the Philippines and China, and home by India,
Madagascar, and the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>We now come to the second great journey through
Tibet&mdash;that of Fathers Grueber and Dorville. Johann Grueber
was born at Linz in Austria in 1623, and started for China as a
missionary in 1656, travelling through Armenia and Persia to
Surat in India. Here he was delayed some time, and only reached
Macao in 1659, afterwards proceeding to Peking. Being directed to
return to Rome, and the sea route being closed by a Dutch fleet,
he set out with Dorville by the overland route in April, 1661,
travelling <i>viâ</i> Singan-fu to Sining in Kansu, near the
borders of Koko Nor.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The latitude of this
important mart was determined, and the great wall was seen and
described, as well as the steppe or desert to the north, roamed
over by wild beasts, and inhabited by Tartar tribes, known to
Grueber as Kalmucks. Passing the Koko Nor the travellers must
have traversed the salt plain of Tsaidam and then crossed the
high ranges and plateaux about the sources of the Yangtse-kiang;
this being described, under the name
Toktokai,<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> as a very fine river as large as
the Danube, though shallow. The kingdom of Lhasa, said to be
called Barontala <sup><b>[3]</b></sup> by the Tartars, and also
styled Tangut in the narrative, was then entered. Grueber
describes the Grand Lama, or supreme head of Buddhism in Tibet,
as the Lama Konju,<sup><b>[4]</b></sup> and the secular king or
regent as Deva or Teva.<sup><b>[5]</b></sup> He drew a portrait
of the former, and also made a picture of his palace or monastery
at Potala. During his stay he fixed the latitude of Lhasa by
astronomical observations. Resuming their journey, the travellers
crossed a very high pass&mdash;where they experienced difficulty
in breathing on account of the rarefied air&mdash;subsequently
turning south and crossing the main Himalayan chain into Nepal,
near the frontier town of Kuthi or Nilam. Here they visited the
city of Khatmandu, and another which Grueber names Baddan, and
which must stand either for Bhatgaon or Patan, both of which were
important towns in the Khatmandu valley. Finally, passing through
Morung, a district of the Tarai, they made their way to Patna on
the Ganges, and thence by Benares to Agra, eleven months after
leaving China.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The only accounts of the journey extant
are an anonymous "Relation" in Italian, and fragmentary notices
derived from Grueber's letters. They give signs of much
confusion, doubtless due to imperfect memory. Thus the Hwang-ho
is said to have been twice crossed between Singan-fu and Sining,
and the latter town to be situated at the Great Wall.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> The Toktonai-ulan-muren, still
imperfectly known in our own day, is one of the branches of the
Mur-ussu or Upper Yangtse, but, being much smaller than the
latter, can hardly be the river spoken of by Grueber.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>3</b> Barontala is said to signify the
country on the right, Dzungaria is similarly said to be derived
from <i>jion kai</i>, "left-hand." Another Mongol name for Lhasa
is Barun-tsu, which is translated "Western Sanctuary."]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>4</b> The Dalai Lama had only recently
attained supreme power at Lhasa. The holder of the title at the
time of Grueber's visit had originally been Grand Lama at Tashi
Lhunpo in southern Tibet. He rebuilt the monastery of Potala at
Lhasa in 1643, and was recognised as Dalai (ocean) Lama by the
Emperor of China in 1653.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>5</b> Although <i>depa</i> or <i>tepa</i> was
in later times the title given to a special functionary who
conducted the civil government for the Dalai Lama, Grueber seems
to allude to one of the Mongol kings of the line of Guchi Khan,
prince of Koko Nor, who are said to have held office about this
time as military defenders of the kingdom. He says that the Deva
was descended from an ancient race of Tangut Tartars.]</p>

Illustrata</i>.)</small></p>
<br>
<p>At Agra Dorville died, but Grueber continued his journey
through Persia and Asiatic Turkey to Europe. Being again ordered
to China he thought to open a road through Russia, but his plans
were frustrated owing to an invasion of that country by the King
of Poland. He was attacked by dysentery and seems to have turned
back without getting much beyond Constantinople dying in Germany
in 1684. Some of Grueber's letters were published in the <i>China
Illustrata</i> of Athanasius Kircher (Amsterdam,
1676),<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> and others in a small volume
published at Florence in 1687, all being reproduced by Thévenot
in his well-known collection of travels.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Kircher was a German Jesuit of great
learning, who held the post of Professor of Oriental languages at
Wurzburg. The China Illustrata gives a general description of the
country, with an account of the early explorations of the
Jesuits.]</p>
<p>The next Jesuit journey to Tibet was made early in the next
century for the purpose of establishing a mission at Lhasa.
Meanwhile much had been done to improve the knowledge of China
proper, the chief workers being now a body of French Jesuits, the
first of whom left France in 1685 in the suite of M. de Chaumont,
ambassador from Louis XIV to the King of Siam. They had been
chosen for their knowledge of mathematics and kindred sciences,
this being the most useful credential in the eyes of the Chinese
emperor, now the famous Kang-hi of the Manchu dynasty. Of the
party which left France, five, viz., Gerbillon, Bouvet, Le Comte,
Fontaney, and Visdelou,<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> were destined for
China, where in 1688 they were received by the Emperor on the
recommendation of Verbiest.<sup><b>[3]</b></sup> The journey to
Peking was made overland from Ningpo, through the provinces of
Kiangnan and Shantung, and the route (as well as others
subsequently followed) was fully described in the great work of
Du Halde, to which reference will be made later. The French
missionaries found favour at the court of Kang-hi, and one of
their number, Jean François Gerbillon, was, as we have seen,
despatched with the embassy to Siberia in 1688-89, subsequently
accompanying the emperor on various expeditions to the Mongol
countries north of the Great Wall. His journals, afterwards
published by Du Halde, contain much information respecting those
regions.<sup><b>[4]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> The sixth Jesuit was Père Tachard, who
afterwards wrote the account of the embassy to Siam. The mission
to the latter country included other ecclesiastics.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>3</b> During the minority of Kang-hi most of
the missionaries had been banished from Peking to Macao, but
Verbiest had subsequently been employed as astronomer, and had
persuaded the Emperor to relax the stringency of the decree.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>4</b> Two journeys in the Emperor's train to
Manchuria and Mongolia had already been made by Verbiest, but his
accounts of them are but brief. On the first occasion (1682),
Kirin on the Upper Zungari was reached, and Verbiest heard of the
famous Chang-pei-Shan, in which that river rises.]</p>
<p>In 1688 Gerbillon proceeded north-west and west, crossing both
branches of the Great Wall, to Kuku Khoto, and turning north
across the steppes and sandy deserts inhabited by the Khalkas,
then being attacked by the Eleuths. Great numbers of partridges
and some deer were seen. Owing to the war, the Chinese embassy
was recalled by the emperor, messengers being sent to acquaint
the Russians with the reason, but it set out again the following
year. This time the envoys took a nearly northerly course,
passing the wall by the great gate near Kiu-pi-kiu. Then
ascending the valley of the Lan-ho, past hills clad in oaks and
pines, they crossed the desert with its hills of shifting sand,
and passed the "Karu" or limits of the empire a little south of
the Chona rivulet.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Beyond the desert they
came upon the Kerlun or Kerulen, some eighty miles above Lake
Kulun or Dalai Nor. It was not more than fifteen paces wide and
three deep. They soon entered a region partly covered with forest
and intersected with many streams running west to the "Saghalien"
or Shilka. Their banks were much incommoded with quagmires. The
Shilka itself was finally reached opposite Nip-chu or Nerchinsk,
being there over seven hundred yards wide, and deep throughout.
Nerchinsk is placed by Gerbillon in 51° 56' N., which is
approximately correct.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> In about 46° 30' N. according to
Stieler's <i>Handatlas</i>.]</p>
<p>The negotiations having been brought to an end, the Chinese
envoys returned by the same route for the greater part of the
way. The Kerlun was now so swollen by rains that the horses could
only cross by swimming. After passing the steppe&mdash;where, in
October, sharp frosts are experienced&mdash;they took a more
easterly route by Mount Pe-cha, reaching Peking on October 22.
Gerbillon subsequently made various journeys with the emperor
through eastern Mongolia. In 1696 he accompanied the force which
Kang-hi led against the Eleuths to the head waters of the Kerlun,
and late in the year took part in a visit to the Ordos country
within the bend of the Hwang-ho. In 1697 a more extended journey
was made somewhat in the same direction, the Hwang-ho being
crossed at Pao-te, the Great Wall skirted within Chinese
territory, and the river again crossed to Ning-hia. On the return
march the expedition proceeded north along the Alashan range and
followed the course of the Hwang-ho, more or less closely, round
its great northern bend to the point where it again turns south.
Over forty observations for latitude were made during this
journey.</p>
<p>The next year, 1698, Gerbillon made a still more extensive
journey, this time in company with three Chinese officials sent
by the emperor to hold assemblies of the Khalkas of Eastern
Mongolia. The expedition left Peking in a N.N.E. direction,
crossing the wooded ranges of Northern Pechili, and proceeding
northwards across the western basin of the Liau-ho. The Khingan
mountains, mentioned by Gerbillon as separating the streams
flowing to the northern and southern oceans, were then crossed,
and the first place of assembly was reached a little north of
Pwir Nor, the effluent of which, the Urson, flows to Lake Kulun
or Dalai Nor. Starting afresh in a northerly direction the
expedition struck the south-western shore of Dalai Nor, where
Gerbillon collected information respecting the lake and
surrounding mountains, and then ascended the valley of the
Kerlun, crossing and recrossing the stream as it swept to the
south or north, and passing the ruins of Kara-hotun, built in the
time of the Yuen dynasty. Near the point where the Kerlun first
assumes its easterly direction that river was left, and the Tula,
the first stream belonging to the Yenesei system, was struck.
Both the Kerlun and Tula were correctly described to Gerbillon as
rising in the Kentei mountains to the north. The country now
became more agreeable, the Tula&mdash;considerably larger than
the Kerlun&mdash;forming many tree-clad islands, and flowing
rapidly through pleasant meadows and woods. Crossing the
mountains to the north-west of the Tula, amid woods carpeted with
wild strawberries, the expedition finally camped on the angle of
ground between the Tula and Orkhon, where the second assembly was
held. Here Russian merchants were encountered, from whom, and
from a Khalka in their service, Gerbillon obtained much
geographical information regarding the southern borders of
Siberia. Among other points he learnt of the existence of the
Altai, Khangai, Tannu, and other chains which give rise to the
great Siberian rivers; obtaining besides a correct account of
Lake Baikal from a Russian who had traversed it from end to end
on the ice, as well as of the Jabkan and Kobdo rivers of northern
Mongolia and the lakes in which they terminate. The camp near the
Orkhon formed the turning point of the expedition, which made its
way from the Kerlun across the Gobi desert to Kuku Khoto near the
Hwang-ho, and thence to Peking. A large number of latitudes were
again observed, which for the first time supplied the means of
mapping with some accuracy a tract of country till then almost
entirely unknown.</p>
<p>The mapping of the Chinese Empire was soon, however,
undertaken on a more systematic plan. As we have seen, the
Chinese maps of the nearer portions of the empire gave a fairly
correct idea of its geography, but could not, of course, equal
those based on astronomical observations. To revise and extend
the existing maps was the task entrusted by Kang-hi to the French
Jesuits, who in 1699 received a large accession to their numbers.
In that year Bouvet returned from a visit to Europe with nine new
missionaries, among them being Jean Baptiste Régis, whose name is
above all associated with the great survey soon to be carried
out. Already before 1705 the Jesuits had been commissioned to
execute a survey of the plain south of Peking, where the emperor
wished to restore the works of defence against inundations, and
in 1708 they began a more extended survey in the neighbourhood of
the Great Wall. In 1709 Régis, assisted by Jartoux and Fridelli,
surveyed Manchuria from May to December, passing beyond the Amur,
and also visiting the Ussuri region. The account of the journey
contains a correct description of the Chang-pei Shan or
Ever-white Mountain, which was found to owe its whiteness, not to
snow, but to the loose gravel of which it is in part composed. It
is not quite certain whether the Fathers actually visited the
mountain, the time at their disposal having been scanty
considering the great area with which they had to deal. They were
near enough, however, to obtain some knowledge of northern Korea,
and to prove once for all that that country formed part of the
continent, as indeed had been shown in the best maps previously
published. The interior of Korea remained outside the sphere of
operations, but Régis afterwards gained some knowledge of the
country from an ambassador sent there by Kang-hi.</p>
<p>On their return from Manchuria the Fathers surveyed the
province of Pechili, the work being finished in 1710. The next
year Régis turned his attention to Shantung, and subsequently,
assisted by De Mailla and Henderer, to the other eastern
provinces from Honan to Fokien. Finally, in 1715, after the death
of Bonjour, who had begun the survey of Yunnan, the work was
completed by Régis, who had then material for the whole map of
the empire with the exception of Tibet.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> For
the astronomical survey of that country two lamas, who had
received a mathematical training from the Jesuits, were
despatched thither by the emperor, and in 1717 the results of
their labours were placed in the hands of Régis. Though imperfect
in many ways,<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> owing in part to the invasion
of the Eleuths, the map, supplemented by information collected by
Gerbillon and others, was a great advance on any which had been
made previously, and until recent times was almost the sole basis
for our knowledge of Tibetan geography. The courses of the
Tibetan rivers, including the Sanpo, were laid down, and though
their lower portions remained unknown, they were rightly
considered to form the head-waters of the Yangtse, and of the
great rivers of the Indo-Chinese peninsula. The information
collected by the missionaries was eventually (1735) published in
Paris by the Jesuit, Du Halde, accompanied by an atlas of maps by
the celebrated geographer d'Anville; a second edition, with
supplementary matter, being issued in 1736 at the Hague. Many
interesting letters of the Jesuits were also published in the
<i>Lettres Édifiantes et Curieuses</i>, edited first by Legobien
and afterwards by Du Halde.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Others of the missionaries who by their
letters did much to increase the knowledge of China were
Parennin, Premaire, Jartoux, and Gaubil.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Parts of the map were laid down merely
from information derived from the lamas.]</p>

<br>
<p>Brief mention must be made of the European journeys to Tibet
made during the first half of the eighteenth century. In 1707 a
party of Capuchins (Montecchio, De Fano, etc.) reached Lhasa. In
1715 Hippolito Desideri, a Jesuit, was directed to establish a
mission at Lhasa, and succeeded in making his way, with Manoel
Freyre, through Kashmir over high passes to Leh, and thence in
1716 to Lhasa, where the Fathers remained till 1729. Desideri
gave a vivid account of the horrors of the mountain passes, the
bare remembrance of which, he said, caused him to shudder. Soon
after Desideri's arrival at Lhasa, a large party of Capuchin
missionaries headed by Orazio della Penna, an Italian, made their
way (1719) to the same city, travelling through Nepal. The
mission established by Delia Penna laboured at Lhasa for over
twenty years, having been reinforced in 1740 by a new party of
friars taken out by the founder after a visit to Rome in
1735-38.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> During this time a journey through
Tibet, from India to China and back, was made by an adventurous
Dutch traveller, Samuel van de Putte, who reached India in 1624
<i>viâ</i> Aleppo and Persia, and after travelling for several
years in the dress of a native, arrived at Lhasa, where he dwelt
for some years. His journey to China was made in company with a
Tibetan embassy, and led him across the Upper Yangtse ("Bichu",
<i>i.e</i>. the Di-chu of modern maps) which, being probably in a
state of flood, it took him over a day to cross. The remaining
route was probably that by Koko Nor and Southern Mongolia, but
little definite information exists as to Van de Putte's travels,
his voluminous papers having been destroyed, by his orders, after
his death at Batavia in 1745.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The party included Cassiano Beligatti,
whose account of the journey to Lhasa was printed in Italy for
the first time in 1901-2.]</p>
<p>With the decline of the influence of the Roman Catholic
missionaries after the death of Kang-hi, the forward steps in
geographical knowledge ceased for a time, China becoming once
more closed to European travellers. The Jesuit accounts remained
the principal authorities on the geography of the country, and
not till the middle of the nineteenth century did explorers again
visit the remoter regions of the interior.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<h4>AFRICA, 1600-1700</h4>
<p><span class="a">The</span> greatest advance in geographical
knowledge during the seventeenth century occurred in those
quarters of the globe which, in the great discoveries of the
previous period, had remained comparatively untouched by the
explorer. In Australasia, in Northern Asia, and in North America,
new lands were brought to light of which only the vaguest ideas
were current during the Spanish and Portuguese period. Those
regions, on the contrary, which had formed the special spheres of
activity of early explorers, now entered upon a period of
stagnation, and though some slight additions continued to be made
to the general knowledge, these bear a relatively unimportant
part in the history of geographical discovery. This is
particularly the case with Africa, the continent which in the
time of Prince Henry of Portugal saw the first systematic
attempts to disperse the mists of obscurity which during the
middle ages had enveloped more than half the surface of the
globe. As has been often pointed out, Africa long felt the
effects of a position on the road to the more attractive regions
of the east and west, to the development of which all the
resources of the conquering and trading nations of Europe were
devoted. Whatever posts were established on the African coasts
were regarded either as ports of call on the routes to the East
or West Indies, or as stations for the supply of slaves to the
plantations of the latter. Deprived thus of her labour-supply for
the benefit of other newly opened lands, Africa was for over two
centuries condemned to remain all but stationary both as regards
the development of her resources and the prosecution of
geographical discovery.</p>
<p>It was chiefly in the portion of the continent which lay
nearest to Asia and was thus most in touch with events in the
East Indies that the bounds of knowledge were extended, and here
too, as in so many parts of the world at the time, the progress
effected was mainly the work of Jesuit missionaries. Attention
had long been directed to Abyssinia through the fame of its
Christian potentate erroneously identified with the "Prester
John" of earlier times, who was in reality an Asiatic prince.
Even in the middle of the fifteenth century the famous world map
of the Venetian Fra Mauro, constructed for King Alfonso V of
Portugal, exhibited a surprising acquaintance with the geography
of Abyssinia and the Galla countries to the south, though its
author was naturally ignorant of the true relation of these
countries to the rest of the continent.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Fra Mauro's map (1457-59) showed, among
other features, the Abai with Lake Dembea, the Hawash, Lake Zuai,
the Gibie (Xebe), Mount Zukwala (Xiquala), and the provinces of
Amhara, Gojam, and Shoa (Saba) in fairly correct relation, though
pushed far too much to the southward.]</p>
<p>The embassies of Payva and Covilhão (begun in 1487), of
Alvarez (1520&mdash;27), and of Diaz and Rodriguez (1555), as
well as the military expedition of Don Christopher da Gama in
1541, gave the Portuguese a personal acquaintance with the
country and paved the way for the arrival of the Jesuits. The
first party, headed by Bishop André de Oviedo, landed at Arkiko
on the Red Sea in March, 1557, and though the reception accorded
was not altogether favourable, the mission was maintained for 40
years without a break, the chief centre of activity being at
Fremona in the province of Tigre. In 1597 the last representative
of the first mission died, and work was in abeyance for several
years.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> An attempt to reach Abyssinia had
been made in 1588 by Fathers Antonio de Monserrate and Pedro
Paez, but being taken prisoners at Dhofar they were sent to Sanâ,
the capital of Yemen, passing on the way the ruins of the ancient
Melkis. Returning to India after seven years' captivity, Paez
again set out for Abyssinia, which he reached in safety in 1603,
being favourably received by the Emperor Asnaf Segued (or Za
Donghel) in 1604. Paez resided in the country until his death in
1622, travelling, generally in the emperor's retinue, through its
various provinces, and becoming acquainted with its geography and
history. He wrote an account of the country and of its early
rulers which after his death was placed in the hands of another
missionary, Manoel d'Almeida, who embodied it in his <i>Historia
de Ethiopia a Alta</i>, a volume which remained in manuscript
down to the present day.<sup><b>[3]</b></sup> It seems, however,
to have been utilised in the compilations of Balthasar Tellez,
Kircher, and Ludolf, which present a general account of the
history of the Jesuit mission in Abyssinia. Paez seems to have
visited the source of the Blue Nile in 1613 (not 1618 as given by
some authors), and his description, as given by d'Almeida and the
historians just mentioned, is wonderfully accurate. He describes
the course of the Abai through Lake Dembea and the rugged
mountains of Gojam, with the cataracts of Alata, whose noise was
said to make the inhabitants in their neighbourhood deaf. Paez
also gives the correct explanation of the inundations of the Nile
which had puzzled so many of the ancients, attributing them to
the excess of rain which falls during the wet season in the
Abyssinian highlands.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> The Jesuits are said to have been
represented during this period by a secular priest, a native of
India, Da Sylva by name.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>3</b> It was printed in 1905-6 by Beccari in
his <i>Rerum Æthiopicariun Scriptores</i>. Either the original or
a copy is now in the British Museum.]</p>
<p>But the most adventurous journey undertaken by any of the
Jesuits was that of Antonio Fernandez, who in 1613-14 penetrated
far into the Galla countries south of Shoa. This missionary
reached Fremona, by way of Suakin and Massaua, in July, 1604, in
company with F.A. de Angelis. The Emperor Sultan Segued (or
Socinios), who after some opposition finally established himself
on the throne in 1607, showed much favour to the missionaries,
who were settled near his Court on the shores of Lake Dembea.
Being desirous of sending an embassy to the King of Portugal, and
fearing the machinations of the Turks at Massaua, the emperor
thought it preferable to despatch the expedition southwards
towards Melinde. The Jesuits having been asked to send one of
their number with the envoy, the lot fell upon Fernandez, who,
though fully conscious of the difficulties of the route chosen,
set out from Dembea in March, 1613. His journey, which is
described by Tellez in his <i>History of Ethiopia</i>, led, in
fact, through countries not again traversed until the latter part
of the nineteenth century, but can by the help of modern maps be
followed without difficulty for the greater part of the way. The
most obscure part of the outward route is the first section,
which led in a south-west direction through the country of the
pagan Gongas to the Blue Nile at a place called Mina or
Mine.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> This was said to lie in 12° N., nearly
due west of the source of the river, at the point where it begins
to turn north, but as the centre of the province of Dembea was
placed in 13° 30', or a degree too far north, we may look for the
crossing point somewhere about 11°. This would place it in a
region still very imperfectly known at the present day. Hence the
journey was continued due south through the country of the Gallas
to Narea or Enarea, next visited over two centuries later by the
French traveller d'Abbadie; a large stream named Maleg (probably
the Didessa or one of its tributaries) being crossed on the way.
The people of Enarea (which is correctly placed in 8° N.) made an
excellent impression on the traveller, no less for the sincerity
of their character than for their fine physique. They carried on
an active trade with their Negro neighbours in gold and other
commodities.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Mina is shown on some modern maps just
north of the Blue Nile, in about 36° E., but on what authority
does not appear.]</p>
<p>The ruler of Enarea put obstacles in the way of a further
advance southward, insisting that the ambassador should take the
easterly road through Bali, a district bordering on the Danakil
country.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> In this direction the first country
passed through was that of Gingiro (Janjero of modern maps) which
formed a sort of peninsula encompassed by the River Zebee
(Gibie).<sup><b>[3]</b></sup> This had therefore to be crossed
twice, on each occasion with some difficulty and danger.
Fernandez learnt that Gingiro signifies monkey and considered
that the name suited the king well in regard to both his personal
appearance and habits. The travellers now entered the kingdom of
Kambat and thence after a long detention proceeded to
Alaba.<sup><b>[4]</b></sup> Still pursued by intrigues, the
ambassador and his Portuguese companion were unable to advance
further, but made their way back, with many adventures, by a new
route apparently leading nearly due north from Alaba. Coming at
last to an Amba or mountain inhabited by Christians, they
received orders to repair to the Court, which was reached in
September, 1614.</p>

<p>Another Jesuit traveller, better known to English readers than
either Paez or Fernandez through the translation of his narrative
by Dr Samuel Johnson, was Father Jerome Lobo. This missionary
embarked for Goa in 1622 in the fleet of Count Vidigueira, and
being chosen soon afterwards for the Abyssinian mission, sailed
from India in January, 1624, with the intention of finding an
overland route from Melinde secure from Turkish
interference.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Landing at Patta or Pate on
the island of the same name, Lobo left his companion there and
proceeded north along the coast in a native bark to the
neighbourhood of the Juba river. Here he came in contact with the
Gallas, who gave him no hope of finding a practicable route to
Abyssinia, telling him of the constant wars that raged among the
various nations on the way. The two missionaries therefore made
their way back to India, where they found the Patriarch Alfonso
Mendez about to set out for the mission. In his company Lobo
reached the Red Sea, the various ports of which he accurately
describes. The name of the sea he derives from the presence of a
reddish seaweed growing in the shallow waters. A landing was
effected at Bailur or Bailul, one of the less frequented ports
just within the straits of Babel-Mandeb, and the missionaries
made their way across the burning sands of the Danakil country,
incurring some danger from the predatory bands which infested the
country, but arriving safely at the mission station of Fremona
after ascending the plateau escarpment. During his lengthened
residence in the country Lobo became well acquainted with its
various provinces. He frequently visited Gojam, the Agau
countries, and other districts adjoining the Blue Nile, of which
he gives a detailed description so far as it flows within the
borders of Abyssinia.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> He knew little of the
countries beyond those borders to the west except that they were
inhabited by Negroes with curled hair, whom the Abyssinians had
been unable to subdue. The district of Fazokl near the point
where the Blue Nile leaves the mountains was, however, known to
him under the form Fazulo. Being assigned by his superior to the
mission in Damot, Lobo crossed the Blue Nile and gained some
knowledge of the southern portion of Damot, which then lay to the
south of that river, though since overrun by the Gallas. The
district of Ligonus, in which his work lay, is described by him
as one of the most beautiful and agreeable places in the world,
the air being healthful and temperate, and the hills shaded with
cedars.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Four of the party of missionaries who
set out about this time for Abyssinia arrived in safety by the
Red Sea route. Two others, however, after landing at Zeila, were
beheaded by the native ruler. Another accompanied Lobo.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> One journey was undertaken for the
purpose of searching for the remains of the chivalrous but
unfortunate Don Christopher da Gama, in which, to his great joy,
he was successful.]</p>
<p>After the death of Sultan Segued a persecution arose, and some
of the Jesuits were obliged to flee the country, while others
suffered martyrdom. The same fate befel a party of Capuchins who
thought to re-establish a mission in Abyssinia, and though an
attempt was again made by the Jesuit Charles de Brevedent at the
close of the seventeenth century and by German Franciscans early
in the eighteenth, practically no addition was made to our
knowledge during the century and a half after Lobo's time.</p>
<p>The work of the Portuguese Jesuits, recorded by the historians
already alluded to, rendered Abyssinia the best known part of
Africa during the period with which we have to do. In 1683 Ludolf
constructed a map, based to some extent on one by Tellez, which
is surprisingly correct in its general outlines. A photographic
reproduction of its western half is given on p. 147. The former
writer, who acquired much of his information at first hand from a
native of Abyssinia named Gregorius Abba, severely criticises the
maps of Africa produced by the Dutch or Flemish school of
cartographers (Mercator, Ortelius, Janssonius, Blaeu, etc.) which
were quite incorrect in their delineation of Abyssinian
geography. Unfortunately these Flemish maps attained a wider
currency than the more correct maps based on the Jesuits'
accounts, and thus contributed to the maintenance of erroneous
ideas respecting Central African geography. The manner in which
they had been gradually evolved by stay-at-home geographers, on a
Ptolemaic basis, has been spoken of in the introductory chapter,
and is illustrated by the accompanying sketch-maps.</p>

<br>
<p class="negindent4"><i>Note</i>. Waldseemüller's map of 1516
was preceded by that of 1507, in which the general idea was the
same, though less developed. Mercator's of 1569 was similarly
preceded by his globe of 1541, on the same general lines.
Gastaldi's map of 1564 was the one most closely followed by
Dapper and other compilers of the succeeding century.</p>
<p>One or two of the later journeys to Abyssinia, made about the
close of the seventeenth century, deserve special notice on
account of the different route adopted&mdash;that by Egypt and
the Nile Valley. Father de Brevedent set out from Cairo in June,
1698, accompanied by a French doctor, Charles Poncet, whose
narrative is our only authority for the events of the
journey.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Beyond Siut, where the Nile was
crossed by a stone bridge, the travellers took the route across
the desert, by way of the oases, then usually followed by trading
caravans bound for the Sudan. Poncet states that the Sudan lay to
the west of Sennar, and that merchants went there in quest of
gold and slaves. He mentions the great oasis&mdash;the last
territory subject to the Grand Seignior&mdash;under the name
Helawe&mdash;no doubt a corruption of El Wah, "the oasis." At
Shabbe (Esh Shebb) the kingdom of Dongola was entered, and after
the Selimeh oasis had been passed the Nile was again struck in
the vicinity of the third cataract. After a halt at Dongola, the
travellers entered the kingdom of Sennar, leaving the Nile at
Korti and crossing the Bahiuda ("Bihouda") steppe to Derrera just
below the sixth cataract. They did not see the confluence of the
White and Blue Niles, as they crossed to the east bank and struck
across to the Blue Nile above the confluence, this being still
considered by Poncet as the main stream. On March 21, 1699, they
were in the town of Sennar, the latitude of which is given as 13°
on the authority of an observation by Father de
Brevedent.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> The heat was here found to be
almost insupportable. The place was populous but ill-built; goods
of all sorts were cheap, and a large trade with the East by way
of Suakin was carried on by its merchants. Leaving Sennar, the
travellers recrossed the Blue Nile and continued their route to
the south-east, passing by Debarke (on the Dinder) to Giesim,
half-way between Sennar and Abyssinia, wrongly placed by the
father in 10° N., if Poncet's statement is to be
trusted.<sup><b>[3]</b></sup> Subsequently crossing the Gandwa
(Gundwa), the head-stream of the Atbara, Poncet and his companion
reached the borders of Abyssinia, where, on the threshold of the
hoped-for scene of his labours, the Jesuit father succumbed to a
malady from which he had long been suffering. Poncet continued
his journey to Gondar, where he claims to have been warmly
received by the emperor, but some doubts have been thrown on the
accuracy of this part of his narrative. His descriptions of the
outward route are evidently faithful, and supply an interesting
view of the political state of the country at the time, as well
as details of its natural history. He says a good deal about
Abyssinia, also describing the source of the Nile and Lake
Dembea, to which last he gives the greatly exaggerated length of
100 leagues. After some stay in Abyssinia, his health compelled
him, early in 1700, to turn his steps homewards, which he did
through the provinces of Wogera ("Ogara"), Shire ("Siry"), and
Adna, crossing the Takazze ("Tekessel") and Mareb ("Moraba"), and
finally reaching Massaua, where he was well received by the
Turkish governor. The English were at the time attempting to open
a trade with Abyssinia, and an English vessel arrived at Massaua
during Poncet's stay.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> An abridged version of Poncet's
narrative was published in the <i>Lettres Édifiantes et
Curieuses</i>. From the statements of Father Krump, whose journey
will be mentioned later, it appears that three Franciscans also
accompanied Brevedent.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> The true latitude is 13° 36'.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>3</b> Giesim is placed in some maps near the
source of the Dinder in 12° N.]</p>
<p>The journey to Abyssinia by the Nile route was again
undertaken more than once within a few years of Poncet's
return.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> In 1700 the Minorite Friar, Theodore
Krump, received a commission from his superiors to join the
expedition to Abyssinia then being organised by Pope Innocent
XII. From Rome he went to Tunis, where he visited the town of
Susa as well as the capital, and thence took ship for Alexandria.
From Rosetta he went by boat to Cairo, and eventually to Siut,
where he joined the bulk of the expedition. Six other fathers
started with him for Abyssinia, the party including the Jesuits
Grenier and Paullet, as well as four of his own order. From Siut
the caravan took a somewhat different route from Poncet's,
keeping to the river as far as Girgeh and then striking across
the desert to the Ruins of Thebes. At Esneh the desert was again
entered, and Poncet's route was joined at the oasis of Esh Shebb,
beyond which it was followed pretty closely as far as Sennar. The
desert routes from Girgeh to Thebes and from Esneh to Esh Shebb
were not again followed, or at least not described by any
European traveller, until recent years. At Sennar Krump remained
behind to place his medical knowledge at the disposal of the
ruler, while the rest of the party made their way to Abyssinia,
accompanied by Paschalis, who had before resided at Sennar. So
far as can be judged from Krump's account, they took a somewhat
different route from Poncet's, but the party finally reached
Gondar with the loss, through death, of one of their number.
Having, after much opposition, obtained the adhesion of the
emperor to the Roman Church, the survivors of the party started
homewards. By this time several had succumbed to illness, and
others fell victims to the climate during the return. Krump
likewise started homewards from Sennar (June, 1702), and the
journey was made by the already-followed route as far as Selimeh.
Beyond this a new course was adopted, which took the caravan by
an oasis called Luach by Krump, the identity of which seems
doubtful. Krump published in 1710 a lengthy account of his
journey, which contains detailed descriptions of the places
visited in Egypt and Nubia. Like Poncet's narrative, with which
it generally agrees, it emphasises the trade importance of Siut
and Sennar.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Poncet himself is said to have started
again in 1703, accompanied by Father Du Bernat, but, on arriving
at Jidda on the Red Sea, to have absconded into the interior of
Yemen with the presents intended for the king, afterwards
proceeding to Surat and Isfahan.]</p>
<br>
<p>Some geographical results were obtained by travellers on the
west coast of Africa during the seventeenth century, but they
were of much less importance than those gained in Abyssinia. In
Senegambia and Upper Guinea the chief activity was displayed by
the agents of trading corporations, which, though generally
confining their activity to the coasts, made some attempts to
penetrate to the supposed rich regions of the interior. Further
south, in the old kingdom of Congo, some journeys were made by
missionaries, but none of these extended to a great distance,
though they did something to diffuse a knowledge of the countries
visited.</p>
<p>The Portuguese monopoly of trade to West Africa had been
challenged long before any voyages to the East Indies had been
ventured on by the rivals of that nation. During the sixteenth
century various trading voyages had been made to West Africa,
particularly by the French from Dieppe, who directed their
attention chiefly to the Senegal. From 1550 onwards English
adventurers followed in their track in fairly quick succession,
and in 1588 the first English Company for West African trade
obtained a charter from Queen Elizabeth. In 1618 a more serious
undertaking was set on foot, chiefly at the initiative of Sir
Robert Rich, which led to the incorporation of the "Company of
Adventurers of London trading into Africa." This company turned
its attention to the Gambia, by which river it was hoped that a
road might be found to the famous city of Timbuktu and the
gold-producing regions of the Western Sudan.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup>
A vessel of a hundred and twenty tons was despatched in 1618,
under the command of George Thompson, who ascended the Gambia
with the ship as far as a place named Kassan in 15° W. Proceeding
to explore the river further in boats he made his way for some
distance, but on his return found that the ship had been seized,
and the crew murdered, by a party of Portuguese. The following
year he again ascended the river, passing the Barrakonda falls
and reaching Tinda, 25 or 30 leagues beyond. During this journey
he learnt particulars of the caravan trade of those parts, and
was already meditating the establishment of fortified posts on
the river when his overbearing conduct led to his death at the
hands of one of his men.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> A story is told by Barros to the effect
that Timbuktu was reached by two Portuguese envoys towards the
close of the fifteenth century, but the correctness of this is
extremely doubtful.]</p>
<p>In 1620 two ships were fitted out and placed under the command
of Captain Richard Jobson, who likewise ascended the Gambia as
far as Tinda, and made enquiries relative to trade; but want of
suitable goods for barter made the venture a failure. On his
return Jobson wrote a full record of his proceedings, entitled
<i>The Golden Trade</i>, with some account of Thompson's also and
a description of the country and its inhabitants, so that the
voyage led to some increase of knowledge. A fort seems to have
been built on the Gambia in 1618, but it was afterwards
abandoned, and Fort James was not finally established until many
years later. On the Gold Coast, too, a fortified post was
established in 1618 by the British Company.</p>
<p>It was to this latter coast that the Dutch turned their chief
attention during this period. The formation, in 1621, of the
Dutch West India Company, with a sphere of operations extending
likewise to West Africa, was quickly followed by the
establishment of posts on the shores of the Gulf of Guinea, where
Fort Nassau, a little to the east of Cape Coast Castle, was
founded in 1624. Before long the Dutch possessed no fewer than 16
stations on the Gold Coast, Elmina, wrested from the Portuguese
in 1637, being the chief. Before the end of the century both the
Danes and Brandenburgers also established themselves on the same
coast, the former retaining their settlements until the middle of
the nineteenth century. This commercial activity, though not
leading to any journeys of exploration into the interior, did
much to bring about a better acquaintance with the coast lands,
which had its outcome in the careful descriptions of Dutch
writers, such as Bosman and Barbot. The former lived 14 years on
the coast, and, as most of his information is at first hand, his
work is the most valuable early authority we possess on the
Guinea coast. It includes also two letters written to him by
other factors of the Company, the one, by J. Snoek, describing
the Ivory and the Grain Coast, the other, by David van Nyendael,
of special importance as one of the few original accounts of the
country of Benin down to quite recent years.</p>
<p>The relations of the Dutch and other nations with the Guinea
Coast extended round the head of the Gulf to at least as far as
Cape Lopez, the numerous estuaries of the rivers being constantly
visited for the purpose of obtaining cargoes of slaves. The Non
and other branches of the Niger delta were known (though not
suspected to be the mouths of a great river), as well as the Old
and New Calabar, and many other streams. The account is extant of
voyages to New Calabar and Bonny by James Barbot, brother of John
Barbot, author of the <i>Description of Guinea</i>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the French, as already stated, confined their
attention almost entirely to the region of the Senegal, where
they continued to trade, though for many years their posts were
limited to the vicinity of the coast. The first French company
seems to have been formed a little before 1626 among the
merchants of Dieppe and Rouen, and not many years afterwards the
first voyage up the Senegal of which we have any account took
place. It is described by an adventurer who took part in it,
Claud Jannequin, Sieur de Rochefort. The expedition, under the
command of Captain Lambert, made the coast of Barbary and coasted
down to Cape Blanco, where the adventurers landed to build a
small vessel for the exploration of the Senegal. The country was
found to be barren and waterless and the inhabitants wretchedly
poor, living chiefly on fish. On reaching the Senegal the ship
was left outside the bar, which was with difficulty crossed in
the boat. Within the mouth of the river a small fort was
built&mdash;apparently near the village of Biyurt on the east
bank, not on the site of St Louis&mdash;and the voyage up stream
commenced. The furthest point reached, "Terrier Rouge", is said
to have been 70 leagues from the mouth and is placed on old maps
in 15° W. During the ascent, trade was carried on with the
Negroes for hides, ivory, gum arable, ostrich feathers, etc., but
the season&mdash;the beginning of the rains&mdash;being
unfavourable, it became necessary to return. The inundations of
the Lower Senegal are accurately described by Jannequin, who,
however, accepts the popular belief of the time that that river
was the lower course of the Niger, or rather one branch of it,
two others being supposed to enter the sea north and south of the
Senegal respectively.</p>
<p>The Rouen Company was in 1664 merged into the French West
India Company, which soon joined in the slave trade for the
supply of the West Indian plantations. This turned its attention,
like that of other European nations, to the Slave Coast and
adjoining regions. One of the first voyages made on behalf of the
West India Company was that of Villault de Bellefond (1666), who
sailed along the Guinea Coast from the Senegal to the Gold Coast,
touching at many points. An account of his voyage, with
descriptions of the places visited, was published on his return,
and soon afterwards translated into English. The account is also
extant of a voyage by the Sieur d'Elbée to Ardrah or Jakin on the
Slave Coast in 1670. It contains an account of the kingdom of
Ardrah, which then occupied a large part of the present Dahomé.
On the Senegal <sup><b>[1]</b></sup> operations were not attended
with great success until the arrival of an energetic and capable
Director-general in the person of André Brue (1697), who during
his period of administration greatly extended the knowledge of
the Senegal river.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> In July, 1697, Brue set
out on his first voyage, which had for its object the regulation
of the trade with the Fuli (Fulas) on the north bank of the
river, then ruled by a chief named the Siratik, whose residence
was in about 13° W. The Senegal was full at this season, and with
its wooded banks afforded a scene of great beauty. Owing to the
strength of the current the boats were towed by Negroes, who
worked often up to their waists in the water. The ledge of rocks
called Platon de Donghel, which obstructs the river at low water
in about 14° W., was passed without difficulty and, soon after,
the furthest point previously reached by the French was passed.
Brue did not himself advance beyond the Siratik's district, but
sent on some agents, who reached the frontiers of Galam near the
mouth of the Faleme, where they opened a trade in slaves, gold,
and cotton cloths.<sup><b>[3]</b></sup> The Fulas were found to
be of a distinct race from the Negroes, being tawny instead of
black. They carried on a trade in gold and ivory with the "Moors"
of the neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Some information respecting the
countries adjoining the Lower Senegal was given by Le Maire, a
French surgeon, who made the voyage there in 1682.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Before this the West India Company had
made over its rights as regards the Senegal to a subsidiary
association, in whose service Brue went out, succeeding the Sieur
Bourgignon as Director. It should be noted that at least one
journey, attributed by Labat to Brue, has been shown to have
really been made by his predecessor La Courbe.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>3</b> Barbot says that the Chevalier des
Marchais ascended the Senegal to Galam about this time, and it is
suggested by the editor of <i>Astley's Voyages</i> that the
French traveller had been with Brue on this occasion. This is
improbable, as Des Marchais himself says nothing about such a
circumstance.]</p>
<p>Brue's second voyage up the Senegal was undertaken in 1698,
when Galam was successfully reached, and Fort St Joseph
established near the town of Dramanet, a little above the mouth
of the Faleme. The inhabitants were for the most part
Mohammedans, and the merchants traded as far as Timbuktu, said to
be 500 leagues beyond. Brue obtained here some information
respecting the intervening kingdom of Bambara, whence slaves were
brought to Dramanet. After building the fort, he continued his
ascent of the river as far as the rock Felu, which, stretching
across the channel, formed a fall entirely obstructing
navigation. This fall was examined by Brue on foot, the boat
having been left two leagues below. It had been his intention to
proceed as far as the Guina ("Govina") falls, but a sudden drop
in the level of the river, amounting in 24 hours to no less than
18 feet, warned him to begin the return journey. During this
expedition information was obtained of the gold-yielding country
of Bambuk, and of the trade carried on by the Mandingos in those
regions. Brue also made enquiries regarding Timbuktu, and was
told that the city was not, as had been supposed, on the Niger,
but at some distance from it. The accounts, however, were
somewhat conflicting and threw some doubt on the identity of the
Niger with the Senegal. Some years later Brue sent some of his
men to push the discovery further, and these succeeded in
reaching the Guina Falls (32 days' journey from the head of
navigation on the Senegal), but advanced no further. One of
Brue's agents named Apollinaire was stationed at Dramanet (Fort
St Joseph) after the Director's return, in the hope of being able
to make his way to Bambuk. In this he was unsuccessful, though he
ascended the Faleme to the first rapids above its mouth and
entered into friendly relations with the native chief of Kaynura.
Things soon went badly, however, at Fort St Joseph, which had to
be evacuated in 1702.</p>
<p>Brue does not seem again to have ascended the Senegal to so
high a point as in 1698, though active in visiting other parts of
Senegambia in the endeavour to stimulate trade. After
negotiations with the English on the Gambia in 1700, he is said
by Labat to have made his way overland to Cacheo, but this
journey is now attributed to La Courbe. During a second tenure of
office as Director-general he made an unsuccessful attempt (1714)
to reach the lake of Kayor, to the north of the Lower Senegal,
and in 1715 visited the country north of the mouth of the river,
gleaning information respecting the gum trade, and the country
which produced that commodity.</p>

<br>
<p>On his return to the Senegal Brue had at once taken steps to
re-establish a trade on the upper river, where, in addition to
Fort St Joseph, a station (Fort St Pierre) was now established on
the Faleme. In 1716 the Sieur Compagnon, a chivalrous and
enterprising pioneer, made his way to Bambuk, and his various
journeys threw much light on the district between the Senegal and
the Faleme. Campagnon first made his way across from Fort St
Joseph to Fort St Pierre, afterwards following the east bank of
the Faleme for a considerable distance, and striking across
country to the gold district of Tambaura. He met with much
opposition, but his affability and liberality finally overcame
all obstacles, and he was able to examine the principal so-called
"mines" in the country. The gold was found in alluvial deposits,
but though the native methods of washing were very primitive, a
considerable amount was obtained. Compagnon made a good map of
the country between the Senegal and the Faleme, marking on it the
positions of all the gold-yielding localities. He also collected
information as to the plants and animals of the country,
including a bird called the "Monoceros", which seems to have been
a species of hornbill. Compagnon's explorations were not followed
up for many years, and Bambuk formed the limit of the French
acquaintance with the interior at this time.</p>
<p>The accounts of Brue and other officers of the French company
were utilised by the Dominican editor of travels, J.B. Labat, in
his <i>Nouvelle relation de l'Afrique Occidentale</i>, published
in 1728, which contains a general description of the West African
coast lands from the Senegal to Sierra Leone. Labat subsequently
(1731) published an account of the voyage of the Chevalier des
Marchais to the coasts beyond Sierra Leone in 1725-27. Des
Marchais had made previous voyages to the same coasts, and
Labat's work, which seems to have embodied other material
collected by him, is one of the best authorities on the state of
those countries at the time. It was illustrated by many maps and
cuts&mdash;the former the work of the great French geographer
d'Anville.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Only the first half of the work relates
to Guinea, the latter part dealing with Cayenne, the ultimate
destination of Des Marchais's voyage.]</p>
<p>We must now return to English enterprise on the Gambia, which,
after the early voyages of Thompson and Jobson, was in abeyance
for some years. In 1663, the year after the incorporation of a
third English African Company named the "Company of Royal
Adventurers of England trading to Africa", Captain Holmes, who
had been sent to protect British trade in West Africa, founded
Fort James on an island 20 miles from the mouth of the Gambia,
and this soon became one of the most important trading stations
of the English in the whole of Guinea. The Royal African Company,
which in 1672 took the place of the Company of Royal Adventurers,
endeavoured early in the eighteenth century to extend its
operations inland, and attempts were made to explore the upper
course of the Gambia in the hope of discovering gold mines in
that direction. In December, 1723, Captain Bartholomew Stibbs
started from Fort James on a voyage up the river with the ship
<i>Despatch</i>, a sloop, and five canoes, the whites of the
party numbering eighteen. The <i>Despatch</i> was left at
Kuttejar (in about 14° 35' W.) and the sloop at Barrakonda, the
voyage being continued in the canoes. The time of year was
unfavourable, the start having been delayed, contrary to Captain
Stibbs's wishes, until too late in the dry season, and much
difficulty was experienced from the lowness of the river. The
first fall occurred about three leagues from Barrakonda, and
extended right across the stream, so that almost a whole day was
occupied in getting the canoes past it. Shallows became numerous
above, and, after passing two more rocky falls, progress was
completely stopped by the shoals at a point about 59 miles above
Barrakonda. Stibbs sent one of his men to search for the reported
York River, said to be situated 17 leagues above Barrakonda, but
he returned without success, having, during a day's journey,
found only dry channels entering the main stream. This was so
shallow that it had several times been forded. The result of this
voyage was to induce Stibbs to doubt the correctness of the
current idea that the Gambia formed one of the mouths of the
Niger, for he had heard from the natives that it came from the
gold mines, twelve days' journey from Barrakonda, and that it had
no connection with lakes or any other river. He was also correct
in supposing that the Senegal also was independent of the Niger,
rising comparatively near the coast; but his views did not meet
with general acceptance, and the old idea maintained its ground
many years longer.</p>
<p>One of the fullest accounts of the countries on the Gambia at
this time is that of Francis Moore, who went out at an early age,
in 1730, as factor under the Royal African Company, and during
his residence in the country made many journeys up and down the
river. His book, published in 1738, is in the form of a journal,
but contains many descriptions of places on the river and the
state of trade at the time. It includes the account of Captain
Stibbs's voyage, and some particulars respecting Job ben Solomon,
a native of Futa Jallon, who had been taken as a slave to
Maryland, but had been redeemed and sent back to his country.
During his stay in England, an account of his life and adventures
had been drawn up by a Mr Bluet, and this contains some
information respecting the then unvisited country of Futa Jallon.
Moore's book contains, in addition to various cuts, a map of the
Gambia as far as Barrakonda, based on a survey by Captain John
Leach, which a comparison with modern maps shows to have been
remarkably accurate.</p>
<br>
<p>Passing now to the more southern parts of West
Africa&mdash;Congo, Angola, and neighbouring regions&mdash;we
have again to do principally with the work of missionaries, who
were now the most energetic travellers in the Portuguese
colonies. The Congo river and the kingdom of the same name were,
it is true, visited by Dutch traders before the end of the
seventeenth century, but they added little to the geographical
knowledge of those countries. The missionaries who laboured in
Congo and Angola during the seventeenth century belonged to the
order of Capuchins, whereas in the sixteenth the work had been
carried on by Dominicans and Franciscans. The best authority on
the travels of the Capuchins and on the geography of the region
in question, as known towards the end of the seventeenth century,
is the work of G.A. Cavazzi da Montecuccolo, who himself laboured
and travelled in those countries. It is entitled <i>Istorica
descrizzione del tre regni Congo Matamba e Angola</i> (1687).
This work formed the basis of a description of the country by
Labat, who, after publishing the accounts of Upper Guinea to
which reference has been made above, turned his attention to the
more southern regions with a view to completing his account of
the whole west coast. His <i>Relation Historique de l'Ethiopie
Occidentale</i> which is the title of the third of the series,
was published in 1732 and, like the former works, contains maps
by the great French geographer d'Anville. The journeys of some of
the Capuchin missionaries extended a considerable distance into
the interior&mdash;in some cases through districts hardly visited
by Europeans since their time. Their routes cannot be laid down
with precision, but the approximate direction followed by each
can be guessed at with some confidence, confirmation being
supplied in some cases by the light of recent discoveries. One of
the most important journeys from a geographical point of view was
that of Girolamo de Montesarchio, who in 1657 is said to have
made his way from San Salvador&mdash;the capital of
Congo&mdash;to Sundi on the Congo (evidently the country of the
Basundi tribe) and thence along the north bank of the river to a
place named Concobella, supposed to lie on the borders of the
kingdom of Makoko. One of Dapper's names for the inhabitants of
the kingdom (Meticas) enables us to identify it with the land of
the Bateke north of Stanley Pool. The return journey was made by
a more easterly route by the "sacred tree" at Gimbo Amburi. This
would seem to be not a solitary instance of penetration to so
high a point on the Congo, for, in the account by the Capuchin
Merolla of a voyage to Congo, etc., in 1682, we are told that a
certain missioner travelled into the country of Makoko and died
there after baptising 50,000 souls. The country, however,
remained practically a <i>terra incognita</i> until Stanley's
great journey of 1877.</p>
<p>Another important journey seems to have been made beyond San
Salvador on the south side of the Congo as far as the Kwango, its
first great southern tributary. Nothing appears to be known of
the name of the traveller who made this journey, but from the
fact that the route is laid down with considerable detail in the
map accompanying Dapper's Africa, and reproduced by Delisle,
d'Anville, and other cartographers of the first half of the
eighteenth century, there seems little doubt that such a journey
was made. On the map alluded to, the route is shown as running
generally parallel with the lower Congo at a little distance to
the south, but this probably is due to accident, as it does not
touch the river at any point, and our present knowledge enables
us to trace the general direction of the march at an average
distance of perhaps 100 miles from the river. From San Salvador
it led almost due north-east, finally striking the Kwango at a
place called Condi, with Canga on the further
bank.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Now, apart from the correct name given
to the river, these two places can be identified as representing
the town of Muene Kundi or some other centre of the land of the
Bakundi, which lies on the Kwango at just the point where it was
most likely to be struck; and the adjoining country of the
Bokange or Bocanga. The places inserted on the earlier part of
the route cannot be positively identified, but in general form
and the prefixes employed they agree well with those of the
country which would be passed through.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The Condi country was also known to
Dapper from the reports of the Dutchman, Jan van Herder, who had
heard that beyond the Kwango dwelt a race of men of light
complexion and long hair.]</p>

<br>
<small>D'Anville's map of Angola and neighbouring regions. (From
Labat.)</small></p>
<br>
<p>From Dapper's time onwards the Kwango figured in maps of
Africa, either correctly as a southern branch of the Congo
(representing the Barbela of previous writers) or, as in
Delisle's map, as the main stream of the river. The fact that
Delisle and others who followed him pushed the upper course of
the Kwango much too far to the east, coupled with the similarity
of names, has led some to the incorrect conclusion that the
central course of the Congo was known to the Portuguese. That
this was not the case is further shown by the fact that the upper
courses of the Kwanza and Kunene are pushed as far to the east as
that of the Kwango, all being placed near together between Lat.
6° and to° S. In Delisle's map the large Lake Aquiluna of
Pigafetta, which was retained by Dapper, is shown merely as a
swamp of comparatively small extent.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> It was
the merit of the great geographer d'Anville to reduce the mapping
of the known regions adjoining the African coasts to fairly
correct proportions, bringing out clearly the extent of quite
unknown country in the interior. His justification for this
course is well stated on the map in Labat's work on Congo and
Angola, of which an outline sketch is here given.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The Lake is named "Chilande" (Kilande)
or Aquilonda by Cavazzi da Montecuccolo, and is said to be
situated in Sissama, a part of Matamba (see next page). It is
probably represented by one of the small lakes recently found to
the north of Matamba. The effluent of the lake "Barbola" is said
by the same writer to be a tributary of the Kwango, not, as
Dapper thought, the Kwango itself.]</p>
<p>Another missionary journey which deserves mention is that of
Fathers Bonaventura and François van Batta from San Salvador to
the east and south-east in 1649. Passing the district of Zombo
(the Zombo plateau of modern maps) these travellers reached a
place called Inkussu, which name may possibly represent the
Lukussu, a branch of the Inkissi, which joins the Congo below
Stanley Pool. Further south, the upper course of the Kwango was
reached by more than one missionary, including Cavazzi da
Montecuccolo himself. This traveller, as we learn from Labat,
made his way from the Kwanza to the camp of the Jaggas near
Kassanje.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> He seems to have crossed the Tala
Mungongo range by a pass considerably to the south of Kassanje,
for the last three days of his journey led north through rich and
well-cultivated plains. Dapper, who published his work in 1668,
had of course no knowledge of the results of this journey, which
were however utilised by Delisle, who marks Kassanje and the
Jagga country on the left bank of the Kwango. Kassanje was also
reached (before 1667) by Jean Baptiste de Sallizan, who, as we
learn from Angelo and Carli's account of their journeys, likewise
meditated a visit to the country of Matamba to the north. This
district, which appears on Pigafetta's map and on most maps of
the period, seems to have been fairly well known to the
Portuguese, for its queen was said to have adopted the Roman
Catholic religion.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The Jaggas were a warlike tribe which
came from the east and devastated this part of West Africa during
the seventeenth century.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Carli calls the country Malemba or
Mattemba, while Dapper, following Pigafetta (map of Congo), gives
Matemba and Matama, though the latter in the map of Africa has
Matemba only. There is possibly a confusion with the district of
Malemba south of the Kwanza. Matamba of modern explorers is a
district west of the middle Kwango.]</p>
<p>Several other accounts of the country were written by members
of the Capuchin missions, though as a rule they deal little with
geography. The best account of the earlier stages of the Congo
mission is that of Fragio (1648). Better known&mdash;by reason of
their having been translated into English&mdash;are those of
Angelo and Carli (1672) and of Merolla de Sorrento (1692) already
referred to; while, still later, an account of travels
principally to the coastland south of the Congo was published by
a missionary named Zuchelli (1712).</p>
<br>
<p>In South and South-east Africa very little advance was made
during the seventeenth century. The establishment of a settlement
by the Dutch at the Cape (1652) brought little addition to
geographical knowledge until much later. A short description of
the Hottentots was published by a Dutch traveller, William Ten
Rhyne, who visited the Cape in 1673; but a fuller and more
reliable account was that of Peter Kolbe, a German savant sent
out at the beginning of the next century to make astronomical
observations at the Cape. His work also gives an account of the
Dutch settlements, limited at the time to the extreme south-west
corner of the present Cape Colony, and it is illustrated by maps
and plans and contains numerous observations. His general map
shows the usual tendency to exaggerate the distances of interior
places from the coast.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The Portuguese
territories on the east coast were already verging on decadence
at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and although the
Monomotapa's kingdom was still frequented for a time, both by
adventurers and missionaries, hardly any additions to
geographical knowledge were made. A single exception is perhaps
the journey of Bocarro to the north of the Zambezi in 1616.
Bocarro seems to have reached the neighbourhood of Lake Nyasa, of
which thenceforward some vague notions were current among the
Portuguese settlers. It was not, however, till early in the
eighteenth century that cartographical representations of the
lake gave any indication of its actual
form.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The beginnings of exploration in the
latter part of the seventeenth century are spoken of in Chapter
xv.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> D'Anville's map (see p. 164) shows a
long and narrow lake, named Maravi, in the position of
Nyasa.]</p>
<p>In Madagascar and the neighbouring islands the seventeenth
century brought some additions to knowledge, through the
endeavours made by the French to establish settlements in them
The first steps for this end were taken in 1642 by the
inauguration of the <i>Société de l'Orient</i>, which soon sent
out agents who took possession, in the first place of Antongil
Bay and the small island of Sainte Marie, and subsequently of
other places on the east coast of Madagascar. The chief station
was founded near the south end of this coast, and named Fort
Dauphin.</p>
<p>In 1648 an energetic governor arrived in the person of Étienne
de Flacourt, who established French influence over a considerable
area and explored some of the interior. After his return to
France he published (1648) an account of Madagascar which marked
an important advance in knowledge respecting the island. In 1664
the French settlements passed to the newly-formed East India
Company, but little was effected, and only six years later they
became the property of the French Crown. During the Company's
connection with the island the Governors were respectively MM. de
Rennefort and Mondevergue, the former of whom wrote an account of
his voyage to Fort Dauphin. Between 1669 and 1672 Madagascar
(then known as Dauphiné) and Réunion (Bourbon or Mascarenne) were
visited by a M. Dubois, who in 1674 published an account of his
voyages, with descriptions of the remarkable fauna of Réunion,
including the dodo and the gigantic land tortoises. A most
interesting account of Rodriguez and its equally strange
fauna&mdash;which modern research has shown to be very
accurate&mdash;was written some years later by François Leguat,
one of a party of Huguenot exiles who attempted in 1691 to found
a colony in the island. Réunion had been the original destination
of the party, but the plans were changed when it became known
that the more fertile island had been annexed for the French East
India Company. After many hardships, including an imprisonment by
the Dutch, Leguat reached Europe in 1698, but his MS. was not
printed until 1708. In Madagascar no geographical results of
importance were achieved after the time of Flacourt until past
the middle of the eighteenth century.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>
<h4>SOUTH AMERICA, 1600-1700</h4>
<p><span class="a">The</span> course of discovery in South
America during the seventeenth century presents many analogies
with that in Africa, and may be suitably spoken of in this
chapter. The two continents had both been the scene of important
events during the century or more which had preceded the opening
of our period, and in both cases this was followed by a time of
relative standstill, in which no sensational discoveries were
made, though the work of a multitude of lesser men gradually
added to the accumulated stock of knowledge. In both continents
the work of missionaries, especially of the Jesuits, played an
important part in the process, though in South America, more than
in Africa, this was supplemented by the quest for gold and other
minerals, and the raiding for slaves, especially in eastern and
southern Brazil. In South America far more had been done than in
Africa during the sixteenth century, and the farther advance was
therefore made from more forward bases. The extent of country of
which a more or less accurate knowledge had been acquired before
the beginning or middle of the 18th century was thus far greater
in the western continent, and while at the close of our period
the greater part of inner Africa remained a complete blank, it
was only the most remote recesses of South America that were
still quite unknown at the same point of time.</p>
<p>The advance in South America was carried on from three main
quarters,&mdash;the Spanish settlements in the La Plata region;
the Portuguese settlements in the eastern and southern parts of
Brazil; and Peru. In the region of the La Plata, and the various
great rivers which pour their waters into its estuary, it was to
the Jesuits that the results achieved were especially due. While
the principal government stations were on the sea-board or in the
lower basin of the great rivers, the missionaries pushed farther
afield, and during the seventeenth century brought into existence
a vast system of "Reductions", as the settlements of converted
Indians were then called. From the older centres they kept
spreading their influence over the more remote districts, and a
good deal of new country was thus brought within civilised
ken.</p>
<p>In the early decades of the century one of the most active
among the Jesuits of this region was Father Roque Gonzales de
Santa Cruz, who, after being for some time at the head of the
reductions of the Paraná, in 1620 founded a new centre on the
Uruguay. In 1623, the governor of Buenos Aires, Don Luiz de
Cespedes, sent the Jesuit Romero to explore the latter river from
mouth to source, and the journey, though only in part successful,
brought the traveller to the first Guarani tribes, 100 leagues
from the starting point. In 1626 Gonzales attempted the
exploration of the Sierra de Tape, a beautiful mountainous
district east of the Paraguay province, drained in part by the
Ybicui, a tributary of the Uruguay. It was his great desire to
open a direct road to the sea from the Paraná missions, and with
this view he now explored the country of the Caaroans, near the
Uruguay. But misfortunes awaited these promising endeavours,
Gonzales being murdered by natives in 1628, while in 1630 the
Spanish missions had to suffer from the incursions of lawless
adventurers from the Portuguese province of São Paulo, whose
inhabitants had shown particular activity in pushing west into
the unknown interior. Attacking the mission stations, they
carried off numbers of the converts into slavery, and caused such
general havoc that the Jesuits found it necessary to evacuate the
whole of the Guayra district, and embark on the Paraná and seek a
home less exposed to attacks from the north. Further misfortunes
overtook the fugitives during this arduous journey. Some new
attempts to open settlements were made in the Sierra de Tape and
in the district of the Itatines tribe east of the Paraguay, but
the Paulistas again attacked and devastated the missions, and the
fathers were forced to remove to the narrowest part of the tract
between the Paraná and the Uruguay. The missions thus entered
upon a period of retrogression, and though some advance was again
made before the close of the century, it was rather from the side
of Peru that subsequent forward movements were initiated.</p>
<p>From the side of Brazil, although considerable activity was
displayed by Jesuit missionaries, it is rather to the journeys of
lay adventurers in quest of slaves and minerals that the breaking
of most new ground is to be credited. The daring enterprises of
the Paulistas or settlers in the province of São Paulo have
already been referred to. Although slave-hunting was the motive
of many of their raids, they also turned their energies to the
search for mines, though in this they met with rivals from other
provinces, with whom they eventually came into open conflict. It
was only after many years of arduous endeavour that the rich
mineral deposits, both of gold and precious stones, were at last
brought to light. About the middle of the seventeenth century,
one Marcos de Azevedo pushed his way up the Rio Doce and Rio das
Caravellas, bringing back specimens both of silver and emeralds.
His refusal to divulge the locality in which they occurred
brought him into conflict with the authorities, and he died a
prisoner. The search was taken up some years later by the
government, but with little success until an enterprising
prospector came forward in the person of Fernando Diaz, a veteran
of 80, but possessed of such energy that within a few years he
explored almost the whole of the future province of Minas Geraes,
opening up settlements and prosecuting his journeys amid great
difficulties and hardships. He was rewarded by the discovery of
emeralds, but soon afterwards died of a fever. The next
adventurer deserving mention is Bartolomeu Bueno de Sequeira, who
carried on a successful search for gold during the last decade of
the seventeenth century. Early in the eighteenth, a great influx
to the mines took place, and the province of Minas Geraes became
thoroughly opened up. That of Goyaz, another of the provinces
rich in minerals, had to wait longer for its development,
although certain adventurous spirits had penetrated to this
remote region before the close of the seventeenth century. The
first of these is said to have been one Manoel Correa, a
Paulista, who was followed by Bartolomeu Bueno&mdash;the elder of
two individuals, father and son, bearing that name. The exact
routes followed by this adventurer cannot now be laid down, but
he seems to have found gold in the basin of the Araguaya (the
great western branch of the Tocantins or Pará river) and to have
possibly entered the neighbouring basin of the Xingu, one of the
great southern tributaries of the Amazon. It was not till the
third decade of the eighteenth century that these discoveries
were followed up, Bartolomeu Bueno the son being then one of the
first to form a regular settlement at the site of the future
mines.</p>
<p>In northern and north-eastern Brazil we again find Jesuits
among the most active agents in the opening up of new districts,
though some notable journeys were made in quest of the mythical
realm of "El Dorado" (the "golden" monarch). Thus in the first
few years of the seventeenth century Gabriel Soares undertook
this quest, making his way to the head of the Rio São Francisco
and beyond; but he was forced to return, though not before he had
done something to extend the bounds of knowledge. Two separate
expeditions were undertaken about this time by Pedro Coelho de
Sousa, who in the second of them, accompanied by a large party of
adventurers, went overland from Maranhão to Ceará, and thence
reached a point not far from the Serra de Ibiapaba, separating
the basin of the northern Paranahiba from some of the western
tributaries of the São Francisco. The Jesuits, too, took up the
attempt to reclaim the Tapuyas of this range, though it was not
until some time later that any great progress was achieved. From
Pernambuco, where, during the war with Spain and Portugal, the
Dutch had established themselves in 1631,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup>
some journeys were likewise made into the interior for the
purpose of searching for mines. Two Dutch deputies are said to
have made their way across country as far as Cuyaba, a journey of
some 1500 miles in a direct line, through country then but
imperfectly known. Among the Dutch officials who added to the
general stock of knowledge was Jan Nieuhoff, whose journeys were
described in an illustrated work which was long one of the
standard sources of information on Brazil.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Bahia, then the capital of Brazil, had
been captured by the Dutch in 1624, but had been retaken in
1625.]</p>
<p>An event which proved of much importance for the opening up of
the Amazon valley was the founding, in 1616, of the city of Pará,
or, to give it its full name, Santa Maria de Belem de Gran Pará.
This took place while Caspar de Sousa was governor of Maranhão,
the officer entrusted with the task being Francisco de Caldeira.
Although the actual site of the settlement was ill-chosen, its
position relative to the two great river systems of the Amazon
and Tocantins (the latter named, like so many of the Brazilian
rivers, from the tribe on its banks) gave it particular
advantages as a starting point for expeditions into the interior,
though for some time those in charge signalised their periods of
office chiefly by carrying devastation into the neighbouring
districts. The impulse towards more extended exploration came
from the side of Peru, and the fact that since 1580 the Spanish
and Portuguese dominions had been united under one crown was of
importance as encouraging co-operation between the Spanish and
Portuguese authorities on the opposite sides of the continent.
The progress of missionary enterprise from the side of Peru will
be spoken of presently, but it must be mentioned here that a
party of Franciscans had been despatched from Quito in 1635 to
evangelise the Indians on the Aguarico, a tributary of the Napo,
and that they were escorted by an officer, Juan de Palacios, who
had previously been in charge of a fort in the upper basin of
that river. Palacios founded a settlement near the mouth of the
Aguarico, among a tribe of Indians known to the Spaniards as "Los
Encabellados", in reference to their long hair, but was attacked
and killed by these people, most of his companions making their
escape to Quito. Two friars, however (Domingo de Brieba and
Andres de Toledo), with six soldiers, happening to be away at the
time of the attack, did not return with the rest, but launching a
canoe on the Napo (June, 1637) committed themselves to its waters
and those of the main Amazon, and after an adventurous voyage
finally reached Pará in safety. This was but the third time, so
far as is known, that the descent of the Amazon had been
accomplished, the two previous voyages being those of Orellana
and of the "tyrant" Aguirre, both in the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>This event naturally directed attention to the possibility of
navigating the Amazon, and an expedition was at once organised at
Pará under Pedro de Teixeira to explore the river route to Quito.
This officer had already been employed on important undertakings,
having been with Caldeira at the founding of Pará, of which
settlement he became governor, for a time, in 1618. He had also
fought successfully against the Dutch, and had ascended the
Amazon and its tributary, the Tapajos, in quest of slaves. He
started on his new mission towards the end of 1637. The ascent of
the great river was naturally a more arduous undertaking than its
descent by the two friars, and though these accompanied him on
the journey, their voyage had been too hurried to permit of
surveys which might have helped the Portuguese explorer to trace
his upward route. Sending forward his associate, Colonel Bento
Oliveira, a man known and respected by the Indians, to
reconnoitre, Teixeira followed with the main body, and thus
little by little accomplished the tedious journey, until
territory under the jurisdiction of Quito was at last
reached.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Here the main body was left behind
under Pedro da Costa, while the commander pushed on to Quito,
which he reached in safety in the autumn of 1638.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> After leaving the main Amazon, the
party does not seem to have ascended the Napo, but another stream
named by the voyagers Quijos, from the tribe living on its
banks.]</p>
<p>But his task was not yet ended, for he was ordered by the
authorities to return to Pará by the same route, in order to
perfect his survey of the rivers. Two Jesuit priests, Cristoval
d'Acuña and Andres de Artieda, were assigned to him as
companions, and were instructed to note down all that was of
interest regarding the country and peoples passed on the way. The
account published by Acuña in 1641 contains the observations of
the fathers, and forms one of the most important early documents
on the Amazon and its tribes that we possess. The voyage was
carried out in 1639, being begun in February of that year, and
this time the route down the Napo was the one adopted. During the
further voyage the mouths of all the great tributaries of the
main river were noted, and they are mentioned by Acuña under
names differing little from those still in use. We find the
Portuguese names for the two greatest tributaries&mdash;Rio Negro
and Madeira&mdash;already established, the former given on
account of the clear black water,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> the latter
in reference to the amount of driftwood brought down by the
current. Information was likewise obtained of the connection
between the systems of the Amazon and Orinoco by means of the
Cassiquiari, though Acuña refused to admit that the northern
river he heard of was the Orinoco. A project was set on foot by
some of the party to ascend the Rio Negro in quest of slaves, but
it was frustrated through the influence of the priests. Lower
down, however, Teixeira found slave-hunting operations in full
swing on the part of the Portuguese from
Pará.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> Like other travellers nearer our own
time, Acuña gave credit to the accounts of tribes of Amazons
(female warriors) living in the interior districts, and he
narrates the usual fanciful details about them. Finally the
expedition reached Pará on December 12, 1639, the double journey
across the continent having thus occupied just two years.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The black water of many of the South
American rivers, especially those which flow through the
forest-clad regions, is a remarkable phenomenon, which has long
engaged the attention of geographers.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Intercourse with the region of the
lower Amazon and its tributaries had been maintained for some
years before this, on the part not only of the Portuguese but of
the Dutch and English. Between 1614 and 1625 the Dutch had forts
both on the main Amazon and on the Xingu. Acuña heard a story of
an English vessel which had ascended the lower course of the
Tapajos.]</p>
<p>About the middle of the century a new turn was given to
affairs in northern Brazil by the association of two men of high
character who laboured with single aim for the improvement of the
lot of the natives, whom the rapacity of the settlers had too
often reduced to a state of misery. These were Vidal, governor of
Maranhão, and the Jesuit Vieyra, who both worked zealously for
the freeing of slaves and the civilisation of the Indians of the
interior. Two Jesuits were despatched up the Tocantins to
"reduce" the Topinambazes of that region, while a little later
Father Manoel de Sousa made his way to the Xingu and Tapajos
rivers and the country of the Juruunas. About the same time
expeditions were undertaken in search of minerals to the Serra
dos Pacajas, but they met with no success.</p>
<p>One of the chief preoccupations at this time, both of the
civil government and of the Jesuits, was the opening of an
overland route from Maranhão to the south-east, or towards
Pernambuco. After several vain attempts had been made, the Jesuit
Ribeiro succeeded in reaching the Serra de Ibiapaba, already
mentioned. Here a mission was established, and the desired
overland communication with Pernambuco at last opened. Ascents of
the Amazon and its tributaries continued to be made. In 1656
Francisco Velloso and Manoel Pires brought back slaves from the
mouth of the Rio Negro, and soon afterwards Pires, accompanied by
Father Francisco Gonçalves, ascended that river and returned to
its mouth with over 600 ransomed captives. The father, however,
soon afterwards died. A military expedition, also accompanied by
Jesuits, ascended the Tocantins, the fathers reaching a point in
6° S. The interior thus gradually became better known, and, with
the eventual advance on Goyaz from the south, there remained but
a small part of eastern Brazil altogether untouched by Portuguese
enterprise. Large tracts within the Amazon basin still remained
unknown, both north and south of the main river, and some
portions remain unexplored at the present day.</p>
<p>From the side of Peru by far the greater part of the advance
during the seventeenth century was due to the missionaries. From
Quito, the Jesuit Rafael Ferrer went in 1602 into the country of
the Cofanes Indians, where he established a mission, afterwards
(1605) pushing on down the Napo to the Marañon. He was murdered,
however, in 1611. In 1616 some Spanish soldiers made their way
into the country of the Maynas, in the valley of the Marañon,
where a settlement was soon afterwards founded by Don Diego de
Vaca y Vega. In 1638 a Jesuit mission was established in this
district by Fathers Cueva and Cujia, who with some others also
explored some of the neighbouring regions. Somewhat later, much
exploring activity was shown by Father Raymundo de Santa Cruz,
who from his station among the Cocomas of the lower Huallaga
opened up a route to Quito by way of the Marañon and Napo. He was
attempting the ascent of the Pastaza in 1662 when he was drowned
by the upsetting of his canoe in a rapid. Still later, from 1684
onwards, the names of two Germans, Henry Richter and Samuel
Fritz, were notable among the many missionaries who laboured in
the region of the Marañon and made journeys on the various
rivers, or through the dense forests. Fritz in particular
descended the whole course of the Amazon to Pará and wrote a
valuable account of the great river, besides compiling a map.</p>
<p>Meanwhile other missionaries, from a more southern
starting-point, had pushed east into the valleys of the
south-western tributaries of the Amazon, including the various
branches of the Ucayali, which has some claim to be considered
the real headstream of the great river. Here it was the
Franciscans who did the chief pioneer work. In 1631 Father Felipe
de Lugano set out from Huanuco and, after pushing east to the
valley of the Huallaga, established a mission. In 1637 Jeronimo
Ximenes and Cristoval de Larios descended the Perene, but both
were murdered by Indians. Others, however, followed in their
steps and founded stations on the Chanchamayu, but, pushing on by
the Perene to the Ucayali, they too fell victims to their zeal,
being murdered by the Setebos Indians. Though many others
ventured into these pathless wilds, the missions in this region
encountered unusual obstacles, and many were the vicissitudes
they passed through.</p>
<p>The head-waters of the great Madeira, largest of all the
Amazon tributaries, were also reached from Peru both by
missionaries and by lay adventurers. About the middle of the
seventeenth century, some advance was made into and beyond the
province of Carabaya, south-east of Cuzco, towards the country
watered on the north-west by the great river known to the
Spaniards as Madre de Dios,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> and on the east
and south by the Beni. The people of this region were known to
the missionaries as Chunchos. One of the first to undertake the
conquest of this country was Don Pedro de Allegui Urquizo, who,
among other posts, founded that of Apolobamba. He had with him
some Augustinian friars, but these do not seem to have done much
in the way of missionary work among the Indians, and it was to
the Franciscans that the results achieved somewhat later were
principally due. On the lay side, a special incitement to
exploration was supplied by legends of a remnant of the old Inca
dominion, supposed to have maintained itself in the vast forests
to the east, when Inca rule on the Andean table-land was brought
to an end by the Spanish conquerors. A ruler named Paytiti was so
constantly spoken of as holding sway in these regions that some,
even in modern times, have thought that a real foundation for the
story must have existed. Be this as it may, several expeditions
were undertaken in quest of this supposed kingdom, one of the
most important being that carried out under the orders of Don
Benito Quiroga in 1670. Crossing the eastern range of the Andes,
and launching a fleet of canoes on one of the great rivers
(apparently the Beni), the expedition pushed down stream for some
distance, but was compelled to beat a toilsome retreat. In 1680 a
party of Franciscans, including Fathers Sumeta, Corso, and De la
Peña, began their labours in the district of Apolobamba, where
they and their successors in time established a number of
stations, besides pushing a considerable distance into the wilds
beyond.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> If the account of the adventurous
journey of Maldonado (sixteenth century) is to be trusted, this
"conquistador" had then made his way down the course of the Madre
de Dios, but this advance was not followed up at the time.]</p>
<p>A more easterly headstream of the Madeira&mdash;the Guapay or
Mamore&mdash;was the scene of an important Jesuit mission, which
laboured among the Moxos or Mojos Indians.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup>
The first attempt on the part of the Jesuits to convert these
people seems to have been made about 1668, by Fathers José
Bermudo, Julian de Aller, and others. A few years later Brother
José del Castillo made his way to the Moxo country, and it was
through his influence that Father Cypriano Baraze, the most
devoted of all the missionaries to this tribe, was induced to
offer himself for the work. During his many years' labours among
the Moxos (in which his first coadjutor was Father Pedro Marban),
Baraze made extensive journeys into the surrounding regions,
descending the Mamore a long distance, and extending the work of
evangelisation among the tribes beyond the Moxos. One of his most
arduous journeys was that in which, after previous vain attempts,
he succeeded in tracing a direct route across the mountains from
the Moxo country to Lima. This is said to have been in part the
same as that followed by Quiroga (see above) a few years
previously. Like so many others of these daring pioneers, Baraze
lost his life through the excess of his missionary zeal, being
murdered in 1702 by the Baures, a tribe dwelling to the
north-east of the Moxos, into whose territory he had penetrated
in the course of his wanderings.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Belonging strictly to a tribe on the
banks of the Mamore, the term Moxos was often used at the time in
an extended sense to include the various peoples of this part of
the Amazon basin. Thus some of the tribes among whom the
Franciscans worked in the district of Apolobamba are also spoken
of as Moxos.]</p>
<p>Another tribe of this region, the Chiquitos, dwelling to the
east of the upper Mamore, was also brought under the influence of
the Jesuits about this time, though from the side of Paraguay,
not Peru. Even in the sixteenth century the Chiquitos had been
brought into relations with the Spaniards during the expeditions
of Nuflo de Chaves, the founder of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. But
it was only in the last decade of the seventeenth century that
any serious attempt to evangelise the tribe was made, the pioneer
in the work being Father de Arce, who after a preliminary
reconnaissance in the country of the Chiriguanas, founded several
stations among the Chiquitos in 1691.</p>
<p>With the close of the seventeenth century the advance of the
missions into the unknown lands east of the Andes entered upon a
less active phase, and though the work was continued in the
districts already occupied, not much more was done to bring new
lands within the ken of civilisation. By about 1700 the
Portuguese from the east and the Spaniards from the west had met
at more than one point in the centre of the continent, the
superior activity of the Portuguese (at least of the lay element
among them) giving them the larger share of the newly opened
territories.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> It was not, however, till 1777
that the mutual frontiers of the two nations were finally fixed
by formal agreement, which gave to Brazil, broadly speaking, the
limits which she has to-day.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The Portuguese adventurers from
southern Brazil had already, at this time, made their way as far
as the head-waters of the Madeira, where the Spanish missions,
like those on the Paraná, had to suffer from their incursions. A
party which attacked the missions among the Chiquitos suffered a
defeat, however, at the hands of a Spanish force from Santa Cruz
de la Sierra. These Portuguese raiders had made their way from
São Paulo across the region of the upper Paraná and
Paraguay.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<h4>THE SOUTH SEAS, 1650-1750</h4>
<p><span class="a">With</span> the two voyages of Tasman
described in Chapter iii, the great period of discovery ushered
in by the labours of Prince Henry of Portugal ("the Navigator")
and the discovery of America may be said to have closed. The
great highways of intercourse between the continents were now
well known to navigators, and the European nations were too much
absorbed in the fierce competition for the trade of the East and
West Indies to be inclined to devote much time or attention to
voyages for purely geographical discovery. In saying this we
allude primarily to the course of maritime discovery, for on
land, as we have seen in previous chapters, an advance continued
to be made in the wide areas of Asia and North America
(especially the latter), which in the middle of the seventeenth
century still offered a virgin field to the pioneers of the
nations owning settlements on their borders. But by sea it was
otherwise, and the hundred years from 1650 to 1750 formed on the
whole a period of relative barrenness as regards important
discoveries. Voyages were made, it is true, but the navigators of
the period kept in the main to the beaten tracks, and any
additions to knowledge were due rather to accident than to a
settled purpose of solving the geographical problems which still
remained obscure. Some few exceptions of course there were,
notably in the case of William Dampier's voyage of 1699-71 [sic],
and it is this name&mdash;with one or two others&mdash;that most
deserves to be remembered in connection with the history of
maritime discovery during the period dealt with in this
chapter.</p>
<p>Many of the best-known voyages of the latter part of the
seventeenth and first half of the eighteenth century were of a
piratical or privateering character, but in spite of the small
amount of positive discovery that resulted from them, they
deserve some attention from the indirect influence they exercised
on the course of maritime history. Of those who took part in them
many were intelligent observers, and left behind narratives which
did much to familiarise the English people with the remote parts
of the world, and to keep alive a spirit of enterprise, which
subsequently had its outcome in more valuable contributions to
geographical knowledge. It will be well to depart somewhat from
strict chronological order in speaking of the voyages, and group
together those of each one of the several nations concerned.</p>
<p>Of the English voyages to the South Seas during the period in
question the first in point of time was that of Sir John
Narborough, who in 1669 was despatched by the British Admiralty
with the double object of trade and discovery. From the latter
point of view the aims of the promoters seem to have been
somewhat ambitious, as they included the survey of the north-west
coast of America from California northward with a view to the
discovery of a passage to Europe by the far north, if we may
credit the statement of Captain Grenville Collins, who when a
young man sailed with Narborough on this voyage. If such were the
case the results fell far short of the expectations, for the
expedition advanced no farther than Valdivia in Chile. The reason
of this is said to have been the abandonment of the voyage by the
second of the two ships which originally sailed&mdash;the pink
<i>Batchelour</i>&mdash;which turned back before the Strait of
Magellan had been reached. Narborough himself in H.M.S.
<i>Sweepstakes</i> spent some time on the eastern coast of
Patagonia and did not enter the Straits till October 1670.
Reaching the Pacific in the following month the Commander went
<i>viâ</i> Chiloe Island to Valdivia, whence, difficulties having
arisen with the Spaniards, he sailed on the return voyage on
December 21, leaving behind four men who had been seized by the
authorities. The second object of the expedition, that of opening
trade with Chile, thus failed equally with the geographical one.
Narborough seems to have been a good seaman, and his chart of the
Strait of Magellan, first published in 1694, showed a
considerable improvement on those previously in use. His journal
also contains sensible observations on the places visited, so
that the voyage was not entirely without result.</p>
<p>A few years after Narborough's return in 1674, a trading
voyage to Peru, through the Strait of Le Maire to the east of
Tierra del Fuego, is said to have been made by one Antoine de la
Roche, a London merchant of French parentage. Some doubt attaches
to the circumstances of this voyage, as it is mentioned by only
one authority&mdash;the Spanish writer Seixas y Lovera, quoted by
Burney. We know however that other trading voyages by this route
were undertaken about this time, and there seems no valid reason
to doubt the fact of the voyage having been made. It is of
interest on account of the statement that during the return
voyage, being carried by winds and currents from Le Maire Strait
and Staten Island, La Roche lighted upon certain lands to the
east, the existence of which had not previously been known. He
would seem to have passed round the south and east coasts of a
small island with snow-capped mountains, from which other high
snow-covered land was visible to the south-east; and then, after
sailing four days to the north-west and north, to have come upon
land (also supposed to be an island) in 45°. As no island exists
in this latitude in the South Atlantic it is natural to suppose,
with Burney, that this land was really a point on the east coast
of Patagonia,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> but with regard to the lands
first seen it is not so easy to find an explanation. The
Falklands and South Georgia have both been suggested as the lands
seen by La Roche, but in neither case is the description of a
passage between the high lands, occupying but a short space of
time, borne out. Such a passage exists further south between the
South Shetlands and the still more southern lands, but it would
perhaps be hazardous to conclude that so high a latitude as this
(62°&mdash;63°) had been reached, although the name of Dirck
Gerritsz still given to a portion of this archipelago testifies
to the belief of some that a still earlier navigator had made his
way into these seas.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> This would not be an isolated instance
of a point on the coast being mistaken for an island, if the
theory of Commander Chambers (<i>Geog. Journal</i>, XVII. 421) is
correct, that the Maiden Land of Hawkins and the Pepys Island of
Cowley (to which we shall refer presently) were in reality parts
of the mainland.]</p>
<p>We may here depart from strict chronological sequence in order
to mention a somewhat similar voyage made in 1689-90 by Captain
John Strong to the coast of Chile and Peru, It is noteworthy for
the discovery, during the outward voyage, of the sound or passage
between the two main islands of the Falkland group&mdash;a name
which likewise owes its origin to this voyage. The commander
sailed from the Downs on October 12th in the <i>Welfare</i>, and
on January 27th, 1690, came in sight of the Falklands&mdash;then
known as John Davis's South Land. Steering east, Strong reached,
on the 28th, the northern end of the sound, through which he
sailed, emerging at the south-west end on February 1st. The
passage is said to have been much impeded by floating weeds, and
foxes were seen on the land, the existence of which led the
commander to make the shrewd suggestion (shrewd for the time in
which he lived) that a connection had once existed between the
group and the mainland of South America. Strong named the passage
Falkland Sound, and the name has since been transferred to the
group as a whole. The rest of the voyage was without important
incidents.</p>
<p>We must now go back somewhat in time to the first irruption of
the buccaneers of the West Indies across the Isthmus of Panama,
which led eventually to many adventurous voyages in the South
Seas, and some geographical discoveries. The daring exploits of
Drake and other Elizabethan seamen in the West Indies were in
later times emulated by a host of English and French adventurers,
who set at naught the exclusive policy of Spain and carried on a
clandestine trade with the Spanish settlements in Hispaniola and
elsewhere. Like the Spanish "matadores" they frequently occupied
themselves with the hunting of cattle, both for the provisioning
of their ships and for the purpose of trading with the hides,
tallow, etc. The meat was cured after the Carib fashion by being
dried on a grate or <i>barbecu</i> over a slow fire, and to it
was applied the Carib term <i>boucan</i>. From their use of this
commodity the adventurers came in time to be called by the French
<i>boucaniers</i>, a term which was englished as buccaneers, the
name by which these daring sea-rovers have been most generally
known. By their bold and reckless hardihood, the buccaneers
became a terror to the peaceable inhabitants of the West Indian
seas, and deeds of almost incredible cruelty and violence were
perpetrated by them, though a few names stand out in more
pleasing light and relieve the general gloom of the picture.</p>
<p>Encouraged by the attempts at settlement inaugurated by the
French and British Governments, the buccaneers extended their
aggressive operations against the Spanish settlements, and in
1670, in spite of the treaty concluded in that year between Great
Britain and Spain, went so far as to plan an expedition against
the city of Panama, which, under their famous leader Morgan, they
took and pillaged after a fierce fight in 1671. This seems to
have turned their thoughts to the South Seas as a promising field
for their lawless doings, and in 1680 they again crossed the
isthmus, descending the river of Santa Maria in boats, and
capturing Spanish ships, in which they carried out their
piratical cruises. Among this band of adventurers the most noted
leaders were John Coxon, Peter Harris, Richard Sawkins, and
Bartholomew Sharp, while it also included William Dampier
<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> (afterwards famous for his more legitimate
voyages of discovery) and Basil Ringrose, who, like Sharp, wrote
a narrative of the doings of his associates.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Dampier had already had a varied and
adventurous career, having made voyages to Newfoundland and Java;
served under Sir Edward Spragge and taken part in two engagements
with the Dutch; lived over a year in Jamaica, and worked among
the log-wood cutters of Campeachy.]</p>
<p>After carrying on their lawless operations for some time on
the western coasts of Central and South America, a party of these
buccaneers, including Dampier and Lionel Wafer (the latter of
whom subsequently wrote an account of his adventures among the
Darien Indians), returned across the isthmus, while another band,
headed by Sharp, made the voyage round the southern extremity of
the continent, exploring <i>en route</i> some of the intricate
sounds and channels on the west coast of Patagonia. The island
still known as Duke of York's Island was so named during the
voyage. South of Cape Horn, land is said to have been seen in 57°
50' S., but this was probably a mass of floating ice, other
masses of which were afterwards seen in 58° 30'. A course was now
steered for the West Indies, where the crew dispersed. Sharp and
some others returning to England.</p>
<p>The second and still more important undertaking of the
buccaneers in the South Seas, which has acquired celebrity from
the narratives of Dampier and Cowley, who both took part in it,
had its origin in this wise. One John Cook, who like Dampier had
returned from the first expedition across the Isthmus of Darien,
had taken service with a Dutch privateer, and, a prize having
been taken, was given the command of her, Dampier forming one of
the crew. Subsequently, after various adventures. Cook sailed to
Virginia and there fitted out another captured vessel for a
cruise to the South Sea. Among the crew, besides Dampier, were
such well-known characters as Ambrose Cowley, Edward Davis, and
Lionel Wafer. Sailing on August 23rd, 1683, they made their way
to the coast of Guinea, where they took a large Danish ship and
transferred themselves into her, naming her the <i>Batchelor's
Delight</i>. During the passage across the South Atlantic land
was seen, according to Cowley in 47° or 47°
40',<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> and was named by him (or by Hacke, the
editor of his journal) Pepys Island, in honour of the celebrated
Secretary of the Admiralty. According to Dampier and also
Cowley's MS. journal, the land seen was the Sebald de Wert or
Falkland Islands, and this has generally been accepted as the
fact; but as the latitude does not agree it is probable that
instead of an island they really sighted a projecting headland of
the Patagonian coast. Owing to the statement in Cowley's journal
an imaginary Pepys Island long figured in the maps in 47° S.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The first latitude is given in the
printed Journal, the latter in the MS.]</p>
<p>After rounding Cape Horn out of sight of land, they touched at
Juan Fernandez and, having been joined by a second ship under
John Eaton, visited the Galapagos group. Of this the captains
drew the first fairly accurate chart, which was published with
Cowley's journal and long remained the standard authority on the
group. A copy, taken from Hacke's collection, is here given. The
buccaneers stayed some time in the islands, and gave names to all
the principal of them, most of which have held their own to the
present day. Dampier's and Cowley's journals also give good
descriptions of the islands, and of the gigantic turtles from
which they obtained their Spanish name.</p>

<br>
<small>The Galapagos, by Eaton and Cowley.<br>
(From Hacke's <i>Collection of Original Voyages</i>.)</small></p>
<br>
<p>From the Galapagos the buccaneers sailed for the coast of New
Spain (Mexico), where John Cook died, his place being taken by
Edward Davis. Other parties of buccaneers (including one Townley,
who had crossed the isthmus) as well as a trading ship from
London, the <i>Cygnet</i>, Captain Swan, associated themselves
from time to time with Davis, and many piratical cruises were
made on the coasts of Peru, New Spain, and Central America, into
the particulars of which it is unnecessary to enter. Meanwhile
Cowley, who had transferred himself to Eaton's ship, sailed away
with that commander to the East Indies, stopping on the way at
Guam in the Ladrones, where the natives were treated with much
barbarity, and proceeding thence to Canton and Batavia. Nothing
of geographical importance occurred, and Cowley finally completed
the circumnavigation of the globe on a Dutch ship.</p>
<p>Davis joined, for a time, a band of French adventurers, among
whom the best known are Le Picard, Grogniet, and Raveneau de
Lussan, the last as the author of a journal describing his
various adventures. The buccaneers now had a fleet of ten
vessels, and were able to defy a Spanish fleet which came across
them in the Bay of Panama. Davis afterwards attacked and burnt
the city of Leon in Nicaragua, and among other exploits of
himself and of his confederates were the taking and ransoming of
the city of Guayaquil, and the successful fight with two Spanish
ships in the gulf of the same name. Before finally leaving the
South Seas Davis paid two more visits to the Galapagos for the
purpose of refitting and provisioning his ship, apparently
visiting different islands from those touched at during his first
stay. On the third occasion it has been supposed that he put in
at the modern Charles or Floriana Island, which is either omitted
or incorrectly placed in Cowley's chart. Hence Davis sailed
south, and in 27° or 27° 20' S. came upon a small low sandy
island with higher ground visible to the west. It was said by
Wafer, who wrote an account of his voyages with Davis, to lie 500
leagues from Copiapo and 600 from the Galapagos. It was concluded
by Burney, whose ideas have been adopted by many other writers,
that the distance from the coast of South America was
under-estimated and that the island was in reality Easter Island
and was thus a new discovery by Davis. There are several
difficulties in the way of this identification. The buccaneers
were bound for Juan Fernandez, at which they subsequently
touched, and, even allowing for the influence of the south-east
trades, it is hardly likely that they would be carried so far out
of their course as to sight Easter Island, especially as we are
told that they had in the meanwhile, when in 12° 30' S.,
approached to about 150 leagues from the mainland of America, and
that the course was afterwards east of south. Again, if Easter
Island were the high land seen to the west, there is nothing to
represent the island actually reached. The small islands of San
Ambrosio and San Felix (discovered in 1574 by Juan Fernandez) are
just in the position in which we should expect to find Davis's
island, apart from the statement (made it is true both by Wafer
and Dam pier) that the distance from South America was 500
leagues; while the respective positions of these islands agree
well with the statements of the two writers. Neither, however,
could be spoken of as a low sandy island, San Ambrosio reaching
930 feet, with precipitous cliffs, and San Felix 600 feet; so
that the difficulties in the way of this identification would be,
perhaps, as great as in the case of Easter Island. We must
therefore be content to leave the question unsolved.</p>
<p>From Juan Fernandez, after touching at Mocha and Santa Maria
Islands, the buccaneers rounded Cape Horn without sighting land,
though they fell in with many islands of ice, and sailed east so
far that it was necessary afterwards to steer west 450 leagues
(according to Wafer's account) in order to make the South
American coast in the latitude of the Rio de la Plata. They
arrived in the West Indies early in 1688, Davis afterwards
returning to England.</p>
<p>Dampier had not been with Davis during the cruises just
related, having transferred himself to Swan's ship when off the
coast of Nicaragua in 1685. This captain, accompanied for a time
by Townley, remained cruising off the Mexican coast for some
months longer, and Dampier's account contains a detailed
description of many of the features of the coast as far as the
entrance to the Gulf of California. The buccaneers had hopes of
intercepting the Manila galleon, and for this purpose cruised for
a time off Cape Corrientes, but without success. Other points
visited, during the various expeditions undertaken in hopes of
plunder or of obtaining supplies of provisions, were the Bay of
Band eras, the Tres Marias Islands, and the rivers and towns of
Mazatlan and Santiago, near the latter of which they experienced
a disastrous defeat. On March 31st they finally left the American
coast on the voyage across the Pacific, first steering south of
west to 13°, and afterwards keeping on west along that parallel
in order to make the island of Guam, according to the general
custom of those crossing the Pacific westward in those days. Here
they learnt of the arrival of the Spanish Acapulco ship, but Swan
hesitated to make any attempt upon it. Continuing their voyage,
they reached the island of Mindanao, where they were well
received by the Sultan of the southern part of the island. A
mutiny eventually broke out, and a part of the crew, among whom
was Dampier, sailed away leaving the captain behind. Passing
round the south and west coast of Mindanao they went to Pulo
Condore and made various cruises in the southern Chinese seas,
afterwards visiting the Bashi Islands between Formosa and Luzon,
and again cruising among the Philippines, and making their way to
Celebes and Timor.</p>

<small>William Dampier.</small></p>
<br>
<p>So far the wanderings of this party of buccaneers had led them
little off the beaten tracks, although Dampier's full
descriptions of the countries and people visited contributed much
to improve the knowledge of his countrymen respecting them. From
Timor, however, they struck out a new line for themselves by
determining to visit the coasts of New Holland, hitherto almost
the exclusive preserve of Dutch navigators. On December 27, 1687,
they passed the island of Rotti and stood south-south-west across
the open sea lying before them towards the south.</p>
<br>
<p>In the third chapter we have sketched the early voyages of the
Dutch to the west coast of Australia, but before following
Dampier and his companions thither we must briefly refer to the
further relations maintained by the Dutch with that coast after
the second great voyage of Tasman (1644).</p>
<p>We have seen that the voyage just mentioned had for the first
time completed the knowledge of the coasts of Australia from the
north-west point of the continent to the Gulf of Carpentaria, so
far as their main outline was concerned. Subsequent voyagers
could therefore make no new geographical discovery of importance
in these quarters, but on the other hand could do much to
increase the knowledge of the country and its inhabitants,
especially as no narrative of the 1644 voyage has come down to
us. Four years after this, in 1648, a successful voyage along the
north-west coast was made by Jan Janszoon Zeeuw in the yacht
<i>Leeuwerik</i> ("Lark"), with the object of testing the
possibility of carrying supplies from Batavia to Banda by a
course which should avoid the strong head winds of the direct
route. A journal of the voyage was kept and a chart made by the
skipper, but both have been lost. However, from the instructions
laid down beforehand, and the letter sent home by the
Governor-General in the following January, we may conclude that
the ship sailed (June 28) south from the Strait of Sunda to about
32° or 33° S. and then, after turning east, coasted along the
shores of New Holland until the most suitable point was reached
for turning north for the Aru group. The voyage occupied two
months and twenty-three days. Fuller details have been preserved
of the voyages to the Southland undertaken in search of the
survivors of the merchant ship <i>Vergulde Draak</i>, which
sailed for the East Indies in 1655 with a rich cargo, and was
lost on April 28, 1656, off the Australian coast, in 30° 40' S.
The news was brought to Batavia by one of the ship's boats, and
two small vessels&mdash;the <i>Witte Valk</i> and the <i>Goede
Hoop</i>&mdash;were at once despatched for the purpose of
rescuing the remainder of the survivors. Both vessels reached the
South land&mdash;the <i>Goede Hoop</i> at the very spot where the
wreck was said to have taken place&mdash;but, meeting with bad
weather, returned without effecting anything. Early in the
following year instructions were given to the skipper of the
<i>Vink</i> to touch at the Southland on the voyage from the Cape
of Good Hope, but after sighting the land he was compelled by
violent storms to desist from the search. In January, 1658, the
ships <i>Wakende Boei</i> said <i>Emeloord</i> were sent from
Batavia to make further search, and also to execute a survey of
the coast. The journals of the skippers, Samuel Volkersen and
Aucke Pieterszoon Jonck, have been preserved, as well as various
charts of the coast of Eendrachtsland made during the voyage. The
ships were separated, but both reached the scene of the disaster
independently, and sent boats ashore, firing shots also as
signals. The only trace discovered either of men or wreck was in
the form of planks, etc., evidently derived from the lost ship.
Thus ended the further search, but in the same year, 1658, the
South-land was again struck&mdash;in 31½° S.&mdash;by the flute
<i>Elburgh</i>, J.P. Peereboom master, natives being subsequently
seen near Cape Leeuwin and specimens procured of a hammer used by
them and of a red gum employed in fixing its head. Twenty years
later (1678) a further examination of a portion of the north-west
coast was made by Jan van der Wall during a voyage from Ternate
to Batavia. Apart from a reference to the voyage in a despatch by
the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, the only evidence
respecting it is the chart made during the voyage, which lays
down the coast line from a point due south of Rotti (? Cape
Levêque) to the modern Exmouth Gulf. This was the last of the
Dutch voyages prior to the first visit of Dampier to the coast of
New Holland, to which we must now return.</p>
<br>
<p>Sailing due south from the west end of Timor, the
<i>Cygnet</i> passed a shoal in about 13° 50' S. and fell in with
the land of New Holland in 16° 50', on January 4, 1688,
afterwards running along the coast to the east and north-east.
Dampier considered that New Holland was placed in the then
existing charts some 40 leagues too near the Archipelago, but he
admits the bare possibility that the ship had been carried
westward by currents. While off the New Holland coast, he had
several opportunities of observing the natives, of whom he gives
some account, calling them the "miserablest people in the world",
poorer even than the "Hodmadods" (Hottentots). The country was
found to be all low land with sand-hills by the sea-side, and
woods&mdash;not particularly thick&mdash;further inland. Good
water was procured from wells dug in the sand, but no stream or
springs were seen. The ship was taken into a small sandy cove,
where at the neap tides it was left high and dry, and it was
therefore possible to clean it, the sails being also mended and a
supply of water taken in.</p>
<p>Early in March they set sail for Cape Comorin, intending to
visit the Cocos or Keeling Islands in 12° 12' S., but passed that
latitude without sighting them, though in 10° 30' they came upon
a small island, Christmas Island, of which the existence was then
not generally known and of which Dampier's scanty account was for
long the only one extant.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> A boat was sent to
look for water, but, though a stream was seen, the high sea
prevented the crew from reaching it, though a landing was
effected elsewhere, for a tree was cut down and a number of land
crabs (which still swarm on the island) were caught.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Documents brought to light in 1911
prove that the discovery and naming of Christmas Island were due
to Captain William Minors, in 1643 (see <i>Geogr. Journal</i>,
Vol. XXXVII. p. 281).]</p>
<p>After sailing along the south-west coast of Sumatra the
<i>Cygnet</i> reached the Nicobars, where Dampier, at his own
desire, was put ashore with two others, Messrs Hall and Ambrose.
During the passage to Atjeh in a native canoe they were nearly
lost in a storm, and reached the land half dead with fatigue.
After various other adventures, in the course of which he
visited, among other places, Tongking, Dampier reached the
English factory at Bencoolen, and served there as a gunner in the
fort. In January, 1691, he sailed for England, and arrived in the
Downs on September 16 of that year, more than 12 years after he
had last left his native country, and eight since he had sailed
from Virginia with Cook.</p>
<p>Dampier's narrative, first published in 1697, is noteworthy
for the fullness and general accuracy of its information, and it
brought him into considerable notice in England, so that, having
formed the design of sailing on a new voyage of discovery, he
gained the support of the Earl of Pembroke, then Lord High
Admiral, and was placed in command of His Majesty's ship
<i>Roebuck</i>, provisioned for a voyage of 20 months. The
voyage, therefore, supplies one of the earliest examples of a
government expedition sent out purely for purposes of discovery.
The <i>Roebuck</i> sailed from the Downs on January 14, 1699,
and, having touched at the Canaries and Cape Verdes, made the
coast of Brazil at Bahia on March 25. Thence, after a stay of
over a week, which gave Dampier an opportunity of learning
something of the country, its products and trade, the voyagers
sailed for the coast of New Holland without attempting to touch
at the Cape, the extent of ocean crossed without sight of land
covering, according to Dampier's reckoning, 114° of longitude.
Signs of land were seen early in July, in the form of floating
weeds, at about 90 leagues distance, and kept increasing until
land was finally sighted on August 1st in about 26°
S.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Not till the 7th was a suitable anchorage
found, this being near the mouth of the principal opening on the
west coast of Australia, named by Dampier Shark's Bay&mdash;a
name which it still continues to bear. His reckoning placed the
longitude of the mouth of the bay in about 87° E. of the Cape of
Good Hope, which led him to suppose that the charts then in use
placed the coast line some 195 leagues too far east. In this,
however, he was mistaken, for the actual difference in longitude
is about 94½°.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> During the interval which had elapsed
since Dampier's first visit, the Dutch expedition under Willem de
Vlamingh had surveyed this coast, including the Shark's Bay of
Dampier. It will be spoken of later.]</p>
<p>The serious work of the voyage now began, for the commander
had proposed to himself to make an accurate survey of the coast
with its various shoals and rocks, hoping also to come upon some
fertile land which might be a suitable field for English
enterprise. For some weeks he cruised along the coast,
occasionally meeting with natives, but disappointed in his hopes
of meeting with a good water supply. The barren nature of the
country lent little attraction to the voyage, apart from the
pleasure derived from exploring a new country, however
uninviting.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> As usual, Dampier's journal
contains an accurate picture of the nature of the country and its
productions, both vegetable and animal. The most attractive
objects observed were the flowers&mdash;of various colours,
especially blue, and some of them fragrant. Among other vegetable
products were the seeds of <i>Abrus precatorius</i>, the "ratti"
of India, where Dampier had seen them used for weighing gold.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> In the interval between Dampier's two
visits, Willem de Vlamingh had examined the same coast (see p.
208).]</p>
<p>The voyage was rendered difficult and dangerous by the
numerous rocks and shoals, and by the strong tides, but in spite
of this a fairly accurate knowledge was obtained of the coast for
a distance of 300 leagues, and Tasman's chart corrected in many
particulars. Dampier had an idea that a passage eastward into the
Great South Sea might exist hereabouts, but he was forced to
defer further exploration owing to the need of proceeding to some
more hospitable coast; his men&mdash;who throughout were
half-hearted as regards the geographical objects of the
voyage&mdash;being much in need of fresh provisions and water. He
therefore left New Holland and early in September sailed
northward for Timor.</p>
<p>After sailing round the greater part of Timor, and filling up
his water casks in spite of the suspicious attitude of the Dutch
Governor, Dampier proceeded on his voyage (December 12, 1699) in
the execution of the second principal item of his
programme&mdash;the exploration of the north coast of New Guinea
and the lands adjoining. On New Year's Day the coast of New
Guinea was sighted at a point due east of Ceram, and several
weeks were spent in navigating the shoal waters off the
north-west end of the great island. On February 4 the
<i>Roebuck</i> was off the supposed north-west point of New
Guinea (really part of a small independent island) and then
passed through the strait between New Guinea and Waigiu, since
known from its discoverer as Dampier Strait. After passing near
the Schouten Islands the voyagers stood out to sea, sailing
nearly due east and sighting no land until February 24, when an
island was seen to the southward and named Matthias, it being
that saint's day. The island does not seem to have been sighted
by former navigators and the name given by Dampier is still
retained. Dampier did not land on the island, and it has remained
until quite recent years one of the least known of the whole
Archipelago east of New Guinea. Steering south-east, Dampier put
into a bay on the still imperfectly known north-east coast of New
Ireland, named by him Slinger's Bay from an assault made by the
natives with stones, and then sailed past the various islands
lying off the main island to the east, until the latter was seen
to fall away to the southward. In this direction no previous
navigator had traced the coast line, so that Dampier had now an
opportunity, of which he was not slow to avail himself, of making
some new discoveries. Passing the south point of New Ireland,
which he named Cape St George, he entered the mouth of the strait
between New Ireland and New Britain, but not far enough to
recognise it as a strait. He therefore gave it the name St
George's Bay. Continuing his voyage, he for the first time traced
the south coast of New Britain, on which Capes Dampier and
Roebuck on either side of Montague Bay still record his visit. In
Montague Bay (so named by Dampier in honour of his patron) the
voyagers were able to hold some intercourse with the natives, and
to obtain a supply of wood and water as well as some hogs. The
land was mountainous and woody, full of rich valleys, and the
soil promised excellently for plantations. Sailing hence on March
22, and witnessing a terrific volcanic eruption on an island off
the coast, Dampier entered the strait between New Britain and New
Guinea, and thus for the first time proved the former to be an
independent island, which he named Nova Britannia, calling the
most prominent point on the coast of New Guinea opposite. King
William's Cape. He did not pass through the main channel of the
strait, but turned north between the west end of New Britain and
the island of Umboi, to which he gave the name of Sir George
Rook. The further course lay among the chain of islands which
adjoins the north coast of New Guinea, some of which contained
other active volcanoes, but after passing these no attempt at
further discovery was made, the homeward voyage being now
commenced.</p>

<br>
<p>Again passing between New Guinea and Jilolo, the
<i>Roebuck</i> took the route to Timor between Ceram and Buru,
and then proceeded to Batavia. After touching at the Cape and St
Helena, the <i>Roebuck</i> made the island of Ascension, but here
sprung a leak, which resisted all attempts to stop it, so that it
was found necessary to abandon the ship, the crew being
eventually taken by three English men-of-war to Barbados (May 8,
1701), whence Dampier returned home on board the
<i>Canterbury</i>, East Indiaman.</p>
<p>The voyage, though it did not lead directly to the advantages
to the British nation hoped for by Dampier by the opening of a
profitable trade with the tropical countries visited, had been
far from fruitless in results from a geographical point of view.
The discovery of the insular character of New Britain was perhaps
the most important of these, although by joining New Britain and
New Ireland, the inner sides of which still remained unknown,
Dampier retained one error in regard to these islands which was
not finally swept away till many years afterwards, no effort
being made at the time by the British Government to follow up his
discoveries in far eastern waters.</p>
<p>Dampier's next voyage was undertaken under different
circumstances, which rendered it of much less importance from the
point of view of discovery. War had broken out between England
and Spain, and the opportunity was seized by British merchants
for a privateering venture into the South Seas, from which they
expected to derive much profit at the expense of the enemy. Two
ships were fitted out, the <i>St George</i>, under Dampier's
command, and the <i>Fame</i>, under Captain Pulling. A
disagreement between the captains led to the withdrawal of the
latter with his ship, but at the last moment a small vessel, the
<i>Cinque Ports</i>, took its place. The expedition left the
Downs on April 7, 1703, and sailed round Cape Horn to Juan
Fernandez. The ships then cruised for some months on the American
coast, taking a few prizes; but the operations seem to have been
badly planned, while Dampier's violent temper caused a quarrel
between himself and Captain Stradling of the <i>Cinque Ports</i>,
which led to their separation in the Bay of Panama (May 7, 1704).
Stradling's ship was ill prepared for the lengthy voyage home,
and after touching at Juan Fernandez, where the famous Alexander
Selkirk&mdash;the original of Robinson Crusoe&mdash;was put on
shore, she foundered off the American coast, only the Captain and
six or seven men being saved. In spite of the alleged
unseaworthiness of his ship Dampier persisted in remaining in the
Pacific, and his obstinacy caused him to be left by two other
parties of his men, who severally made their way across the
Pacific, one under his mate, afterwards Captain Clipperton, the
other under William Funnell, who wrote an interesting account of
the voyage&mdash;the only full narrative published, and therefore
our principal authority respecting the whole course of the
undertaking. Clipperton made his way to the Philippines, and
ultimately to Macao, where his company dispersed, while Dampier,
after plundering the small town of Puna and taking a Spanish
vessel, sailed in this for the East Indies, where the vessel was
seized by the Dutch, and the crew were forced to shift for
themselves. Funnell's narrative allows us to follow the doings of
his party in greater detail. On February 3, 1[7]05, they sailed
from Amapalla Bay on the coast of Central America, and, standing
somewhat south of west until 10° N. was reached, then bore away
west-north-west with the help of the trade wind in order to make
the island of Guam. The crew were on short rations throughout and
endured much misery, but at last (April 11) sighted an island in
13° N. to which the name Magon is given. Guam was sighted but not
touched at, and a course was then shaped for New Guinea, a group
of inhabited islands not marked on the existing charts being
passed on the way. In passing between New Guinea and Jilolo
Funnell missed the usual passage, but after some trouble found
one further west among a multitude of islands, naming it St
John's Strait. At Amboina, which was reached on May 31, the ship
and all the effects of the party were seized, and after some
detention the men were sent to Batavia, whence they obtained a
passage home <i>viâ</i> the Cape in the Dutch East India
Fleet.</p>
<p>Funnell's narrative contains a large amount of information on
the countries visited and their animal and vegetable productions.
His stay at Amboina enabled him to collect a good many details
respecting that island, and, among other points, he refers to the
bird-of-paradise skins which there formed an article of trade,
but of the country of origin of which he was ignorant.</p>
<p>Dampier's conduct of this expedition was not such as to
encourage the merchants to put him again in command, although he
was once more employed on a similar venture, this time in the
capacity of pilot, for which his long experience of navigation in
the South Seas eminently fitted him. In June, 1708, a company of
Bristol merchants placed two ships, the <i>Duke</i> and
<i>Dutchess</i>, under the orders of Captain Woodes Rogers (who
sailed in the <i>Duke</i>) for the purpose of cruising against
the Queen's enemies on the coasts of Peru and Mexico. The
<i>Dutchess</i> was commanded by Captain Stephen Courtney. The
expedition was more successful than many from the point of view
of plunder, but the scheme of the voyage was too similar to
others of its class for any decided gain to geography to result
from it. The chief exploits were the taking of Guayaquil in Peru,
and of the smaller Acapulco galleon off the coast of Mexico.</p>
<p>On touching at Juan Fernandez, Alexander Selkirk was rescued
from his life of solitude, which had then lasted over four years,
and some account of his experiences is given in Woodes Rogers's
narrative. The Galapagos were twice visited, and Rogers obtained
some information from a Spanish prisoner regarding the island
known to the Spaniards as Santa Maria de la Aguada, which he
identified with that visited by Davis the buccaneer, and which,
as we have seen above, was probably the modern Charles Island.
The northernmost point reached was on the coast of California,
whence the Pacific was crossed to Guam and the Dutch East Indies,
the circumnavigation of the globe being completed (1711) by the
Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>The next of the British voyages of circumnavigation were those
of Captains Clipperton and Shelvocke, which were undertaken after
an interval of eight years, with similar objects to the last. The
<i>Speedwell</i> and <i>Success</i> were fitted out in 1718, it
being at first intended that they should sail under the Emperor's
commission, with crews in part composed of Flemish sailors. War,
however, again breaking out between Great Britain and Spain, the
expedition eventually sailed (1719) under a commission from King
George. Shelvocke had been intended for the chief command, but
was replaced by Clipperton&mdash;a slight which naturally caused
some soreness in his colleague.</p>
<p>The ships soon separated in a gale, and only met
again&mdash;and that accidentally&mdash;after reaching the South
Seas, so that the voyages were really quite independent. Captain
Clipperton sailed in the <i>Success</i>, and during the passage
through the Strait of Magellan made some attempt to discover a
passage southward into the South Sea through Tierra del Fuego,
but without success. After taking many prizes in South American
waters he proceeded to the coast of Mexico, where he fell in with
Shelvocke, and crossed the Pacific <i>viâ</i> Guam to China. At
Amoy the crew mutinied, and soon afterwards dispersed, the
<i>Success</i> having been condemned and sold at Macao through
their machinations. Clipperton look passage in his old ship to
Batavia, and thence sailed for Europe, reaching Galway in Ireland
in June, 1722, in broken health, and only surviving his return a
week. His death was said to be due in part to distress at the
failure of the enterprise, though his owners were in some measure
recompensed for their outlay by a portion of the prize-money
which he had sent home from China.</p>
<p>Shelvocke's voyage was in some ways more adventurous, but
still more unsuccessful than Clipperton's. Disagreements broke
out among his crew, leading at times almost to open mutiny, and
his conduct of the voyage met with severe censure from one at
least of his associates, though the charges made against him by
personal enemies cannot be regarded as fully proved, while his
own account must likewise be accepted with caution. After a stay
of some days on the coast of Brazil the <i>Speedwell</i> had a
stormy passage through Le Maire Strait and was carried south to
61° 30'.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Returning north, an unsuccessful
attempt was made on the island of Chiloe, then but little known
to English sailors. After cruising on the American coast for some
time, Shelvocke proceeded to Juan Fernandez, where he lost his
ship, but, in spite of the mutinous conduct of his crew, in time
succeeded in building a small vessel, in which he made a perilous
voyage to the mainland. Attacks were made on various Spanish
settlements, and prizes taken, which enabled the voyagers to make
good the loss of their ship. After the meeting with Clipperton on
the Mexican coast, negotiations took place with a view to joining
company, but they came to nothing. Further hardships and
adventures awaited the diminished crew, but the taking of a large
Spanish ship at last put them in better circumstances, and it was
resolved to sail for Canton, the coast of California being first
visited. Here friendly intercourse was opened with the natives,
of whom Shelvocke gives a very favourable description. On this
coast a deposit was discovered containing grains which strongly
resembled gold-dust, but as the sample taken was subsequently
lost, the truth of the matter was never made clear. At no leagues
from Cape San Lucas an island was sighted, which is spoken of by
Shelvocke as a "discovery", but it was afterwards shown by Burney
to be the Roca Partida seen by Villalobos and, later, by
Spilbergen. On the voyage and at Canton further troubles were
experienced, and, having sold the ship at the latter port,
Shelvocke took passage home in one of the East Indiamen then
about to return from China, landing at Dover in July, 1722. He
was prosecuted by his employers for alleged fraud, but eventually
compounded with them. His narrative of the voyage, published in
1726, was written with a view to presenting his case in a
favourable light.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> A noteworthy incident in this part of
the voyage was the shooting of an albatross by Simon
Hatley&mdash;an occurrence which supplied Coleridge with the
groundwork of the "Rime of the Ancient Mariner."]</p>
<p>During Shelvocke's first cruises on the Pacific coast of South
America several of his crew, including two of the superior
officers Hatley and Betagh, were taken prisoners by the
Spaniards. Betagh returned to England after two years' captivity,
during which he was able to collect information as to Shelvocke's
proceedings, and in 1728 published a book which traverses the
latter's statements in almost every particular. It also contains
much information on the then state of Peru and Chile, their
trade, and the manner of working the mines; a striking account
being given of the overland trade from Buenos Aires and of the
activity of French interlopers from St Malo on the coast of
Chile, which had led to the despatch against them by the Spanish
king of a squadron under their compatriot Martinet.</p>
<p>With this voyage the despatch of English expeditions to the
South Seas ceased for a time, some twenty years elapsing before
the most famous voyage of the whole series&mdash;that of
Commodore Anson&mdash;took place. It will be noticed that for a
number of years all the voyages to this part of the world were of
a privateering character, no enterprise being undertaken in the
South Seas for purposes of legitimate trade. This was in part due
to the formation, in 1711, of the famous South Sea Company, to
which was injudiciously granted the exclusive privilege, among
British subjects, of carrying out voyages to those seas. The
Company consisted not of merchants, but of financiers who had
taken over a large part of the public debt of the nation, in part
return for which these extravagant privileges were granted. They
were thus little fitted or disposed to carry out commercial
enterprises in distant regions, and while debarring their
countrymen from the benefit of such undertakings, made absolutely
no use of the monopoly granted to them. It was therefore only the
existence of a state of war which gave an opportunity for South
Sea voyages, which were thus, as we have said, commonly at this
time undertaken for the sake of plunder.</p>
<p>Anson's expedition, of which we have now to speak, was one of
this class, war having been again declared with Spain in 1739;
though it differed in being a Government expedition carried out
with ships of the Royal Navy, under the command of regular
officers. Geographically, like so many of the voyages of the
period, it added little in the way of positive knowledge, but it
acquired celebrity by reason of the high qualities of its
commander (who possessed an unusual influence over his inferior
officers and crews), by the great difficulties and dangers
surmounted, and by the vast amount of treasure which was captured
from the enemy. As originally fitted out, the expedition
consisted of six ships and two tenders, the flagship being the
Centurion, of 60 guns, which carried a crew of 513. The squadron
sailed from the Isle of Wight on September 18, 1740, and in
March, 1741, was off the coast of Tierra del Fuego, having
touched, among other places, at Port St Julian on the coast of
Patagonia. Le Maire Strait was passed without difficulty, but
disasters now followed fast upon one another. Heavy gales were
experienced which severely tried the rigging and equipment of the
ships, while scurvy, that bane of seamen in those days, raged
among the crews. Of the seven ships which passed through the
strait, only four&mdash;the <i>Centurion</i>, the
<i>Gloucester</i>, the <i>Trial</i> sloop, and the <i>Anne</i>
pink&mdash;reached Juan Fernandez, the first appointed rendezvous
in the Pacific, and these in the most miserable condition. Some
had been driven back through the strait, while the <i>Wager</i>,
whose commander had incautiously ventured near a lee shore, was
wrecked between two small islands five miles from the mainland.
The adventures of the crew, a part of whom made their way back
amid great hardships to the coast of Brazil, have been rendered
famous by the narrative of the Hon. John Byron, afterwards
commodore and commander of an expedition round the world, who
sailed in the <i>Wager</i> as a midshipman. An account was also
given by Bulkeley and Cummins, the ship's gunner and carpenter
respectively.</p>
<p>The stay at Juan Fernandez enabled the voyagers to recruit to
some extent, and the main object of the expedition, the raiding
of the Spanish settlements, commenced. The <i>Trial</i> and
<i>Anne</i> were soon condemned, and the <i>Centurion</i> and
<i>Gloucester</i> alone remained of the original squadron. After
taking and plundering Payta, Anson proceeded to Acapulco, where,
however, nothing was to be had in the way of plunder, as the
annual fair, held on the arrival of the Manila galleon, was then
over. The two ships sailed for China on April 30, 1742, but both
were in a rotten condition, and the <i>Gloucester</i> became so
leaky that she had to be abandoned and destroyed. Sickness had
played havoc with the crews before the <i>Centurion</i> reached
Tinian in the Ladrones or Mariannes, the course sailed having
brought the voyagers somewhat north of Guam, At Tinian they again
refreshed, but came near a serious disaster, the ship, with a
portion of the crew only on board, being carried out to sea by a
gale. The narrative of the voyage contains many particulars
respecting the nature and production of the Ladrone group, from
which they finally sailed on October 22, 1742, sighting Formosa
<i>en route</i> for Macao. Here Anson's firmness procured him
from the authorities at Canton the necessary facilities for a
thorough refit, and enabled him to carry out his long-formed
design of cruising for the Acapulco galleon. At length the
vessel, <i>N.S. de Covadonga</i>, was encountered off the
Philippines on June 21, 1743, and, having been taken after an
obstinate fight, in spite of the overwhelming superiority of the
Spaniards both in men and armament, was found to contain a vast
amount of treasure in coin and bullion. It again proved necessary
to proceed to a friendly port in order to refit, and this time
Anson took the much-battered Centurion up the Canton river to the
Bocca Tigris, successfully resisting the claim of the authorities
for port dues on the ground that his ship was a man-of-war.</p>
<p>The homeward voyage was begun on December 7, the ship passing
between Bangka and Sumatra on the 29th, and through the Sunda
Straits on January 3, 1744. Christmas Island was sighted on the
15th, and Table Bay reached on March 12, the Centurion finally
anchoring at St Helen's in the Isle of Wight on June 16, after a
voyage which had lasted four years.</p>
<p>The celebrity which has always attached to Anson's voyage
arose largely from its success from the point of view of plunder;
from the perils and hardships successfully overcome during four
years' incessant battling with adverse circumstances; and in part
no doubt from the unusually full and informing accounts of the
voyage which were published after its completion.</p>
<br>
<p>We must now glance rapidly at the South Sea voyages of other
nations during the same period&mdash;less numerous, it is true,
and less important than those of the British adventurers, though
in many cases their failure to attain the celebrity of the latter
was no doubt due to the want of capable chroniclers. In the case
of the French, the most important voyages were again the indirect
outcome of the hardy exploits of the Buccaneers, which turned the
attention of more responsible persons at home to the South Seas
as a field for enterprise. The first passage of the French
freebooters into the Pacific by the Straits of Magellan took
place in 1684, and for some years from this date these men
continued their depredations on the coasts of Chile and Peru.
Some at length made their way back to France with tales of the
rich booty to be made in those seas, and as France was then at
war with Spain, the idea of a French Government expedition
against the Spanish South American colonies soon took shape. The
command was given to the Comte de Gennes, who sailed from La
Rochelle on June 3, 1695, with a squadron consisting in all of
six vessels, of which the two largest were the <i>Faucon</i> and
the <i>Soleil d'Afrique</i>. On the outward voyage De Gennes
touched at the coast of West Africa, where various French
commercial companies had been at work for many years, and he
there effected the capture from the English of Fort James on the
Gambia, although it was shortly afterwards restored by the Peace
of Ryswick. Proceeding on the voyage by the Cape Verdes and
Ascension, the squadron touched at Rio, and finally entered the
Strait of Magellan on February it, 1696. Cape Froward was doubled
on February 26, but contrary winds prevented further progress, so
that after returning to take shelter in a bay which they named
Baie Française, and making another ineffectual effort to advance,
it was at last determined to give up the attempt. The straits
were left early in April and the return voyage made by way of
Cayenne and the West Indies, the voyage thus proving an entire
failure so far as its main object was concerned.</p>
<p>In spite of the small success of this venture, projects were
soon set on foot for a renewed attempt, a company being formed
(the "Compagnie Royale de la Mer Pacifique") and a squadron
fitted out, of which the command was again offered to De Gennes.
He at first accepted, but difficulties and delays occurred which
led him to resign his commission, and the command was then given
to an experienced captain in the merchant service, the celebrated
Beauchêne Gouin (or Gouin de Beauchêne) who had a few years
before (1693) commanded one of the French frigates despatched by
the Government to attack the Dutch whaling fleet in Spitsbergen
waters. The number of ships was also reduced to three, the
commander sailing in the <i>Phélipaux</i>, while the
<i>Maurepas</i> was commanded by Lieut, de Terville.</p>
<p>This expedition, which sailed from La Rochelle in December,
1698, met with better success than the preceding. During the
passage of the straits, which was not made without the usual
difficulties and delays, Beauchêne entered into friendly
relations with the natives of Tierra del Fuego, and while at
Elizabeth Bay, beyond the furthest point reached by De Gennes,
sent his boats to explore a channel opening off the main strait
to the south. He gave French names to various islands, bays, and
waterways, and took possession of the island of Louis le Grand
(south-west of Tierra del Fuego), and the neighbouring Baie
Dauphine. At length, after more than seven months' difficult
navigation within the straits, the South Sea was reached on
January 21, 1700. The French were received with suspicion by the
Spaniards along the coast, and at Valdivia the <i>Maurepas</i>
was treacherously fired on, but at Arica some small amount of
trade was done. The Galapagos were visited, but in view of the
bad condition of the ships it was then determined to begin the
homeward voyage. Being carried south of the western entrance of
the straits by currents, Beauchêne made the passage round Cape
Horn, which he proved to He in a lower latitude than that (58°
30' or 59°) then shown on the charts. He passed near the
Falklands, giving his name to one of the south-eastern islands of
the group, which appeared to be not marked on the maps. Finally,
after touching at the coast of Brazil, he reached La Rochelle on
August 6, 1701, after an absence of nearly three years.</p>
<p>Soon after this, French ships began to frequent the coasts of
South America in large numbers, the Spanish throne being now
occupied by a grandson of Louis XVI, so that the rivalry of the
two nations was for a time checked. The port of St Malo took the
lead in sending out these ships, several of which touched at the
Falkland Islands, still imperfectly known, which from this
circumstance began to be called by the French name "Malouines",
which they bore for some time. Besides the ships which made their
way to the Pacific through the straits or round Cape Horn, there
were many which crossed the Pacific on the return voyage from
China, without however adding much to the knowledge of that
ocean. The commercial activity displayed by the French at this
time had led, in the last years of the seventeenth century, to
the formation of a "Compagnie de la Chine", on whose behalf the
<i>Amphitrite</i> had made a pioneer voyage to China in
1698.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The voyage of the <i>Amphitrite</i> is
the first of the French voyages to China of which definite
information exists, but it is probable that others had been made
previously. In 1667 Jean Baptiste de la Feuillade, captain of a
Rouen ship, seems to have made a voyage to the far east,
afterwards crossing the Pacific, and in spite of the wreck of his
ship near the Strait of Magellan, appears to have continued his
voyage across the Atlantic in a small vessel made out of the
remains of his own.]</p>
<p>The relations thus inaugurated were kept up with vigour for
some years, and the Pacific route was often adopted for the
homeward voyage. Thus in 1709 the <i>St Antoine</i>, commanded by
M. Frondac, crossed from China by a more northerly route than was
then usual, striking the coast of California. Of the voyages by
the south of South America some account is to be found in the
works of Père Louis Feuillée and of Amédée François Frézier. The
former went out in 1707 in the capacity of mathematician and
botanist to the French king, and between that year and 1712 made
scientific observations on the coasts of Chile and Peru, which he
published after his return to France. Frézier was an engineer
officer who sailed in 1712 in the <i>St Joseph</i>, a ship of St
Malo commanded by M. Duchêne Battas. He seems to have been
commissioned to collect information on the places he visited, and
his narrative, published in Paris in 1716, contains much of
interest on the natural features and inhabitants of Chile and
Peru, besides giving a map and plans of the coasts and harbours
touched at. In particular he describes the Chonos of Chiloe
Island and its neighbourhood, and a supposed race of giants
dwelling further inland. From information collected from various
French captains, Frézier made a chart of the southern extremity
of South America and its archipelago of islands, which was in
many ways an improvement on those previously existing. In 1714
Frézier sailed for France in the <i>Mariane</i>, and during the
passage of the Atlantic touched at the small island of Trinidad,
which, however, he designates Ascençao, as he imagined, like
others of his time, that there were two separate islands in this
part of the Atlantic, and that the one touched at was not the
real Trinidad. The fact that but one island exists in reality had
been previously recognised by Dr Edmund Halley, who had touched
there during his voyage for magnetic research in 1698-1700.</p>
<p>Among the French voyages, that of M. Marcand in the <i>Sainte
Barbe</i> deserves mention from the fact that a new exit from
Magellan Strait to the Pacific was discovered, to the south of
the ordinary channel. This was in 1713, and an account of the
discovery is given by Frézier in his book. In the following year
a voyage round Cape Horn to Peru and across the Pacific to Guam
and China was made by a French ship, name and captain unknown, in
which one Le Gentil de la Barbinais went, probably in a
mercantile capacity. He wrote an account of the voyage in the
form of letters, but these do not contain anything of much value.
He refers to the large number of French ships then frequenting
the coasts of South America and mentions that <i>La
Découverte</i>, commanded by M. du Bocage of Havre, had during
the voyage to China discovered in 4° N. an isolated rock
surrounded by a sandbank, and had named it <i>Isle de la
Passion</i>. This would seem to be the islet touched at in 1787
by Mr Charles Duncan, which appears in some maps as Duncan
Island.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy French voyage of this period, however, was
that of Lozier Bouvet, not so much on account of the actual
results at the time, as from the influence which it exerted on
subsequent explorations in the Southern Ocean. Bouvet was a
captain in the service of the French Compagnie des Indes, who,
moved by the recollection of the reputed discovery of land by
Gonneville south of the Atlantic or Indian Ocean in the early
part of the 16th century, pressed to be entrusted with an
expedition for its re-discovery, pointing out the use that might
be made of such a land as a point of call on the way to India.
His project was an ambitious one, as it also embraced exploration
in the Southern Pacific Ocean and an eventual circumnavigation of
the globe, much on the lines afterwards followed by Captain Cook.
Gonneville's land was supposed to He south or south-west of the
Cape of Good Hope, where the maps of the day showed a "Terre de
Vue", based, it is true, on no better foundation than the
hypothetical representation of the Southern Continent in 16th
century maps, on some of which a "Terra de Vista" figured in this
position. Bouvet's plea at last prevailed, and he was granted the
use of two ships, the <i>Aigle</i> and the <i>Marie</i>, a second
captain, Hay by name, being associated in the command. They left
Lorient in July, 1738, and after touching at the Brazilian coast,
reached the scene of their search in November. Much hindrance was
caused by fog as well as by dense masses of sea-weed. Although
summer in those latitudes, the weather was cold, and on reaching
48° S. the first ice was met with, icebergs of vast size and in
large numbers, as well as fields of broken ice, rendering
navigation dangerous. On January 1, 1739, a high, snow-clad land
was sighted, and to its most prominent point, in honour of the
day, Bouvet gave the name Cape Circumcision. It afforded no
chance of landing, and, as the fog and ice continued to impede
navigation, the ships sailed north-east, giving up the search for
more land when 43° S. had been reached. The <i>Aigle</i>
proceeded to Réunion, while the <i>Marie</i> returned to France,
reaching Lorient on June 24, 1739. There is little doubt that the
land discovered in the South Atlantic was that re-discovered in
our own time by the German expedition in the
<i>Valdivia</i>&mdash;a quite small island to which Bouvet's name
has fitly been given. The reports brought back by Bouvet had an
important influence on the plans of Cook's second voyage.</p>
<p>It remains to speak of two or three Dutch voyages of this
period, particularly that under Commodore Roggeveen in 1721-22.
Before dealing with this we must touch upon two voyages, later
than those mentioned on pp. 189-90, by which some further
addition to the knowledge of the Australian coasts was made. The
first was that of Willem de Vlamingh, which sailed for the East
Indies in 1696, <i>viâ</i> Tristan da Cunha, the islands of
Amsterdam and St Paul, and the west coast of Australia. The
commander sailed in the <i>Geelvink</i> (a name which has
attained almost equal celebrity with his own), while, of the two
other ships, one had as skipper Gerrit Collaert, the other
Cornelis de Vlamingh, son of the commodore. Sketches were made
both of the islands and of various points of the South-land
visited, and a survey of the whole western coast of
Australia&mdash;more accurate than any previously in
existence&mdash;was executed. This showed for the first time the
belt of islands enclosing Shark Bay&mdash;itself discovered by De
Vlamingh&mdash;and various other features, while the Swan river,
destined later to give its name to the first British settlement
on this coast, was visited, three of the black swans to which it
owed its appellation being captured alive. Excellent charts
showing the results of the voyage were made after its completion
by Isaac de Graaf, the cartographer to the Dutch East India
Company. An interesting point connected with this voyage was the
discovery of the pewter plate affixed to a pole, which had been
set up in 1616 in commemoration of Dirck Hartog's visit to this
coast (see p. 79, <i>ante</i>). It was brought away as a
curiosity, but another was left bearing a copy of the original
inscription with a statement of the circumstances of De
Vlamingh's visit.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> De Vlamingh's record was found, half
buried in sand, by Captain Hamelin of the French Expedition of
1801, and was by him fixed to a new post. In 1818 it was brought
away by Louis de Freycinet. The posts now (or till lately)
existing on the island, as described in the <i>Adelaide
Register</i> of June 15,1907, seem to be of later date.]</p>
<p>The next Dutch voyage of importance to this part of the world
was that of Maarten van Delft, commanding the <i>Vossenbosch</i>,
with which sailed two other vessels with skippers hailing from
Hamburg. These ships sailed from Batavia to Timor, which was left
on March 2nd, 1705. Land was struck near Cape van Diemen (the
north-west point of Melville Island) and the coast of this island
and of the Coburg peninsula was examined with some care, the
resulting map being in many ways an improvement on Tasman's chart
of this coast. One of the vessels penetrated some distance into
Dundas Strait, and the idea was entertained that this inlet might
run right through to the south side of New Holland, the
treacherous character of the natives seen being considered an
indication that they might be islanders. The comparatively small
size of Melville Island was not however recognised, for on the
chart of the voyage it is shown as continuous for a long distance
with the land to the south-west. The examination of the coast was
continued until July, when, owing to the increasing sickness
among the crews, the return voyage was commenced. Before the
<i>Vossenbosch</i> reached Macassar the skipper and several
officers had died.</p>
<p>The famous voyage of Jacob Roggeveen,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> the
last of the great Dutch voyages of circumnavigation, was, like
that of Schouten and Le Maire, undertaken independently of the
Dutch East India Company, standing apart from most of the voyages
of that realm in this respect, as well as in the considerable
interval which had elapsed since the last previous undertaking of
similar magnitude. The Dutch had in fact long devoted their
energies to their well-established commerce with the East and
West Indies, and had little inclination, at this time, for
voyages of discovery pure and simple to other parts of the world.
It was the monopoly held by the East India Company of the trade
by the Cape route which led to the adoption once more of the
western route across the Pacific, so often followed by Dutch
expeditions a century or so earlier. The proposal for the voyage
was made to the West India Company by Jacob Roggeveen, who had
previously been in the service of the East India Company in a
legal capacity, and whose father, some fifty years earlier, had
put forward a similar scheme. One of the objects, as in so many
other Pacific voyages, was the search for the great southern
continent in the part of the ocean where land had been seen by
the buccaneer Edward Davis. The proposal was accepted, and on
August 21, 1721, Roggeveen sailed from the Texel with three
ships&mdash;the <i>Arend</i> (Eagle), <i>Thienhoven</i>, and
<i>African Galley</i>. For many years no trustworthy account of
the voyage was available, and though two narratives existed,
neither could be entirely relied on, and there were serious
discrepancies between the two in respect of the positions
assigned to the islands touched at and other
matters.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> But after long search Roggeveen's
original journal was brought to fight during the first half of
the nineteenth century, and was printed at Middelburg in
1838.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The correct spelling seems to be
Roggeveen, as here used, though the form Roggewein has become
more or less established in English writings about him.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> One of these narratives, in Dutch, is
anonymous, the other, written in German and afterwards translated
into French, was by Carl Friedrich Behrens, commander of the
troops of the expedition.]</p>
<p>After touching at the coast of Brazil and looking in vain for
Hawkins's Maiden land, Roggeveen passed with two ships through
the strait of Le Maire, while the <i>Thienhoven</i>, which had
been separated in a tempest, made the passage of the Strait of
Magellan, and was rejoined by the others at Juan Fernandez.
Hence, with the aid of the south-east trade, the ships sailed
west-north-west, and though the track followed did not greatly
diverge from those of former navigators, Roggeveen was fortunate
in bringing to light several islands that had not previously been
touched at. The first and perhaps most interesting discovery was
that of Easter Island (made on April 6, 1722), for, as we have
seen above, the idea that this had been reached in the previous
century by the buccaneer Edward Davis rests upon insufficient
foundation. The natives were friendly though timid, but, as on
other occasions during the voyage, Roggeveen assumed a
threatening attitude unjustified by the circumstances, and a
fatal collision resulted.</p>
<p>During their stay the voyagers gained a knowledge of the
remarkable stone figures, which are still the most noteworthy
features of the island, and which were described for the first
time in the narratives of the voyage. Proceeding on their course,
after some delay through adverse winds, the voyagers sighted
another island named by them Carlshof&mdash;which seems to have
been Aratika in the Low Archipelago&mdash;and soon afterwards
fell in with a group of islands and rocks amid which the
<i>African Galley</i> was wrecked. They were named from this
event the Schaadelyk or Harmful islands and were probably the
Palliser group. Other islands met with soon after were named
Dageraad ("Daybreak") and Avondstond
("Eventide"),<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> the latter being thought to be
the Vliegen of Schouten (Rairoa in the Low Archipelago), but no
stay was made until the arrival at an elevated island which has
been identified with Raiotea in the Society group. It was named
Verquikking, from the refreshment gained in the form of herb for
those sick with scurvy. A collision with the natives ensued,
again owing to the inconsiderate conduct of the Dutch, who lost
several of their number. The next group visited was named the
Bouman islands from the Captain of the <i>Thienhoven</i>, and,
from the descriptions given, it seems probable that these were
some of the Samoa group. The crews were now suffering severely
from sickness and also becoming discontented at their hardships,
so that Roggeveen resolved to make for the East Indies with as
little delay as possible. Several islands were sighted, and after
touching at the coast of New Britain, and Arimoa off the north
coast of New Guinea, the ships sailed between the latter and
Jilolo, finally (after a stay at Japara in Java) reaching
Batavia, where they were seized on the score of having made the
voyage without a licence from the East India Company. The crews
returned in homeward-bound ships and an appeal to the
States-General resulted in full restitution being made by the
East India Company.</p>

German forms Dageroth and Abendroth.]</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>
<h4>THE PACIFIC OCEAN, 1764-1780</h4>
<p><span class="a">With</span> the years of profound peace
ushered in by the Treaty of Paris in 1763 a new period of
geographical discovery may be said to have begun, marked by a
more systematic investigation of those parts of the world which
still remained unvisited by Europeans. In no part was this change
for the better more marked than in the Pacific Ocean, where, as
we have seen, the work so far accomplished, at any rate during
the century which preceded, had been mainly incidental to voyages
undertaken by private adventurers for the sake of plunder or
warlike operations. We now reach a period when distant voyages
were undertaken by European governments or scientific bodies with
the direct object of extending the bounds of knowledge. In this
new movement Great Britain led the way by the despatch of
Commodore Byron in 1764 to explore the vast area which still
remained unknown in the Southern Pacific, and in which there
still seemed a possibility that large land masses suitable for
European settlement might exist. It must not be supposed that no
expedition for purely scientific objects had hitherto been sent
out from Europe, for even in the seventeenth century France, as
represented by the Academy of Sciences, had shown great
enterprise in despatching her foremost savants to distant regions
for the purpose of making observations to determine the figure of
the earth and the exact position of places on its surface. But
the remoteness of the Pacific, and the difficulty of replenishing
supplies at a distance from any permanent settlement, naturally
caused it to remain long outside the field of such labours, and
even when, in the latter part of the eighteenth century,
attention was turned to it, the actual results of each voyage
were for some lime small in proportion to the distances covered;
for, even when new routes were adopted, it was frequently
necessary to follow a more or less direct course and leave the
areas on either side unexamined. The discovery of the few small
islands which happened to lie on such a course was therefore all
the positive result, though the negative result gained by the
elimination of new areas from the possible sites of a southern
continent was not without value. The story of the voyages is
therefore marked by a certain sameness, the usual incidents being
the discovery of verdure-clad islands inhabited either by
truculent savages or by a simple confiding folk; too often
followed, even in the latter case, by misunderstandings leading
to bloodshed and disaster to one side or the other.</p>
<p>Commodore John Byron, who a quarter of a century earlier had
taken part in Anson's voyage, sailed from the Downs on June 21,
1764, in command of the <i>Dolphin</i> and <i>Tamar</i>; the
former a sixth-rate man-of-war, the latter a frigate commanded by
Captain Mouat. After touching at Rio, the expedition put into
Port Desire towards the end of November, and after making a
survey of the harbour set out in search of the supposed Pepys
Island&mdash;said by Cowley to lie in 47° S. and so placed in the
chart of the great astronomer Halley&mdash;the correct location
of which was named in Byron's instructions as one of the objects
of the expedition. As has been stated in an earlier chapter, it
is probable that the land seen by Cowley was really the coast of
South America, but as no such island as he had reported has any
existence, the search was of course fruitless. Byron next entered
the Strait of Magellan, where he held friendly intercourse with
the Patagonians, many of whom seemed to him to approach a height
of seven feet. After visiting Port Famine and taking in wood and
water, he sailed, on January 4, 1765, for the Falklands. While
examining the north coast he discovered a fine harbour, which he
named Port Egmont after the first Lord of the Admiralty.
Although, as we shall see shortly, a French expedition under
Bougainville had settled a French colony not far from Port Egmont
in the early part of the preceding year, Byron took possession of
the group for King George III, under the name Falkland
Islands.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> He came to the conclusion, though
hardly on good grounds, that it was the Pepys Island of Cowley.
Leaving Port Egmont, Byron completely circumnavigated the group,
making a more accurate chart of its coasts (to which he assigned
the exaggerated circuit of 700 miles) than previously existed. He
also ascertained that the islands were quite devoid of trees;
what had previously been taken for such, when seen from a
distance, being merely tall reeds. The fauna included sea-lions
and foxes, as well as geese which the men knocked down with
stones.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Strong had already named the passage
between the two main islands "Falkland Sound."]</p>
<p>On February 17, 1765, the Strait of Magellan was once more
entered, and soon afterwards a French ship was sighted, which
proved to be the <i>Aigle</i> under Bougainville. The passage
through the strait was slow and dangerous, but Byron still
considered it preferable to the route round Cape Horn, if only
for the scurvy-grass and other vegetables there procurable, to
which he attributed the excellent health of his crew at this
time. After touching at Masafuera, Byron attempted to sail west
in about 27° 30' S., in search of the land called in the charts
Davis's Land, and supposed to have been reached by the buccaneer
Edward Davis. Failing, however, to pick up the trade wind, he was
obliged to decrease his latitude considerably. On May 15 and 16
indications of land to the south were noticed, and on various
occasions large birds were seen, but the swell from the south
made it necessary to haul more to the north. A serious outbreak
of scurvy made it imperative to find land, but none was sighted
until June 7, when, on approaching some islands, they were found
bordered by steep coral rock which rendered landing impossible.
The position obtained was 14° 5' S., 145° 4' W., and the group
was named Islands of Disappointment. They lie in the extreme
north of the Low Archipelago, though considerably east of the
position assigned to them by Byron. About 200 miles farther west
two more islands were met with, but still no anchorage could be
found, though a landing was effected, and some coconuts,
scurvy-grass, etc., were obtained, which gave some relief to the
sick. The islands, which were named King George's Islands, were
inhabited, but only at the second visit could friendly relations
be established. At the first visit the carved head of the rudder
of a Dutch longboat, and other relics, were seen. As they
proceeded westward, vast flocks of birds and other indications of
land to the southward were seen, and if wind had not failed in
higher latitudes Byron felt sure that he should have fallen in
with it.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> As it was, the course led past a
few more small islands only, some of which (named Danger Islands
from the rocks and breakers with which they were surrounded)
belonged to the Tokelau or Union Group. Another was Nukunau or
Byron, in the group since named the Gilbert Islands, a more
northerly course having now been adopted with a view to obtaining
refreshments at Tinian. This was sighted on July 30, a landing
being effected at the spot where Anson had put in in the
<i>Centurion</i>. Here the voyagers suffered considerably from
fever and flies, but some supplies were obtained, while the
<i>Tamar</i> examined the island of Saypan. The voyage was
resumed on October 10, and early in November the ships reached
the island of Tioman off the east coast of the Malay Peninsula,
having passed between Formosa and the Bashi Islands. Batavia was
reached on November 27 and left again on December 10, the voyage
being brought to a close at Deal on May 9, 1766, having occupied
22 months in all.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> No land larger than the island of
Tahiti would, however, have been met with.]</p>
<p>Only three months after Byron's return the <i>Dolphin</i> was
again despatched, this time under the command of Captain Samuel
Wallis, to prosecute further discoveries. She was accompanied by
the <i>Swallow</i>, a sloop commanded by Captain Philip Carteret,
and by the <i>Prince Frederick</i> store-ship, whose part in the
expedition was to cease at the Strait of Magellan. The passage of
the strait was again a tedious affair, and occupied four months.
On meeting the Patagonians, Wallis for the first time caused
exact measurements of the people to be taken, with the result
that the tallest individual was found to have a height of 5 ft 7
in. only. When at Port Gallant, about mid-way, a high mountain
was climbed by the master of the <i>Swallow</i>, who left a
record in a bottle which, in the opinion of the writer of the
narrative, might "possibly remain there as long as the world
endures." At the exit from the strait, the <i>Dolphin</i> and
<i>Swallow</i> parted company, owing to the bad sailing qualities
of the latter, never again to come together, so that, as it
turned out, each completed an independent circumnavigation of the
globe, making separate discoveries <i>en route</i>. The
<i>Dolphin</i> was again forced by unfavourable weather to go
north, and thus lost the chance of searching for land in a high
latitude. In spite of all precautions&mdash;scrupulous attention
to cleanliness, and the use of supposed curatives such as wort
made of malt, pickled cabbage, vinegar, etc.&mdash;scurvy
attacked the crew, and an anxious look-out was kept for land. The
first seen was in the south of the Low Archipelago, and was named
Whitsun by Wallis. Other small islands were named Queen
Charlotte, Egmont, Gloucester, Cumberland, and Prince William
Henry. At the first of these some coconuts, scurvy-grass, and
water were procured. The Commander, however, had by this time
fallen seriously ill, and remained so for a considerable time,
though continuing to give orders to his officers. Some of these
were also incapacitated, and much of the work devolved on the
second lieutenant, Furneaux by name. After passing a small island
named Osnaburgh in honour of Prince Frederick, who was bishop of
the see of that name, Wallis lighted upon an island, of
considerable size and rising into high mountains, which proved to
be Otaheite (Tahiti), the most important in Eastern Polynesia.
The credit of the first discovery of Tahiti seems undoubtedly to
belong to Wallis, the idea that this island was the La Sagittaria
of Quiros having been shown by the late Admiral Wharton to be
without foundation. A long stay was made here, intimate relations
being at last established with the inhabitants, in spite of some
preliminary difficulties leading on two occasions to hostilities.
Another danger arose from the ship striking a reef of sharp rock,
from which, however, she was got off with little damage. Supplies
were obtained in exchange for various objects, especially nails,
which were greatly prized by the natives, though the market was
spoilt for a time by the behaviour of the sailors, who drew the
nails out of various parts of the ship to carry on traffic on
their own account. During the stay Wallis sent a party into the
interior of the island, which made its way to a considerable
height among the mountains and brought back an enticing account
of the fertility and verdure everywhere to be seen. Eventually
the friendship of an important chieftainess was secured, who
conceived such a partiality to the Commander as to evince the
utmost distress when the time came for the ship to sail. This
took place on July 27, 1767, the harbour in which the
<i>Dolphin</i> had stayed being named Port Royal Harbour. The
health of the crew benefited greatly during the stay, there being
now no invalid on board except Captain Wallis and the two
lieutenants, and even these were recovering. The island struck
the voyagers as one of the most healthy and delightful spots in
the world, and no sign of disease was seen among the
inhabitants&mdash;a state of things too soon to give place to one
less satisfactory. The name King George III Island, given by
Wallis to Tahiti, never came into general use.</p>

<br>
<p>Passing in sight of Eimeo, Moörea, or Duke of York's Island,
the <i>Dolphin</i> held a nearly west course till about 175° W.,
when, like Byron, Wallis steered for Tinian. Only a few small
islands were sighted <i>en route</i>, among them Uea or Wallis to
the north of the Tonga group, and Rongelap in the northern part
of the Marshall Islands of modern maps. At Tinian refreshments
were obtained in the form of beef (procured by hunting the almost
wild cattle), pork, and fruits of various kinds, including limes,
by means of which the sick were greatly benefited. Observations
for latitude and longitude were taken, those for longitude giving
a result within two or three miles of the true position. The rest
of the voyage, made by the usual route, calls for no detailed
description. At Batavia, where a vain attempt was made to procure
anchors and cables, many of the men fell sick, and it was not
till they had been landed at the Cape (reached on February 4,
1768) that their health was re-established. Frequent astronomical
observations were again made here, the longitude obtained being
18° 8' E., or about 4 less than it is in reality. Finally, on May
20, the <i>Dolphin</i> arrived in the Downs, 637 days, or the
best part of two years, from the date on which she sailed out of
Plymouth Sound.</p>
<p>The route followed by Carteret in the <i>Swallow</i> lay on
the whole to the south of that of Wallis, but not far enough in
this direction to throw much additional light on the important
groups, hitherto but slightly known from the voyages of Quiros
and Tasman, lying in the Western Pacific to the south of 10° S.
Important discoveries were made, but not until the confines of
the Australasian region in the neighbourhood of New Guinea were
reached. After taking in water during stormy weather at
Masafuera, Carteret sailed west in about 28° S.&mdash;a course
which Wallis had found impossible&mdash;searching in vain for the
islands of St Ambrose and St Felix laid down to the west or
north-west of Juan Fernandez in some of the charts and works of
navigation of the time. He also sailed across the supposed
position of Davis Land without finding it, and only when 130° W.
had been reached was land discovered in the form of the small
isolated Pitcairn Island (so named from the youth who first
sighted it) to the south of the Low Archipelago. Gales and dark
cold weather had been experienced, and, as in Wallis's case, it
was found impossible to keep in a high southern latitude. The
ship, however, took a course to the south of Tahiti, and only one
or two of the small isles in this direction were sighted. One of
these received the name Osnaburgh, already given by Wallis to a
more northerly one. The ravages of scurvy made it necessary, for
the sake of procuring refreshments, to still further diminish the
latitude, hopes of discovering continental land to the south
being for the present abandoned. Carteret was surprised at
finding no trace of the Solomon Islands, which, misled by the
erroneous maps then current, he expected to find east of 177° W.
Early in August the current was for the first time observed to
set to the south, and he deduced therefrom the existence of a
passage between New Zealand and New Holland. On August 12, 1767,
the Santa Cruz group (named by Carteret Queen Charlotte's
Islands) was reached. Although discovered by Mendaña a century
before, and the scene of that navigator's death, the position of
the group had been very imperfectly known, and Carteret may be
credited with its re-discovery. The largest island&mdash;Santa
Cruz&mdash;he named Lord Egmont's Island, or New Guernsey.
Hostilities occurred here, and the master and others were
wounded. The voyage was continued to the north of the main
islands of the Solomon group, but, a current having set the ship
to the southward, Gower was sighted on the 20th, and Malaita
(named Carteret) on the 21st. The former was afterwards visited,
and coconuts were obtained from a body of natives with whom some
hostilities took place. The next land seen was the "Nine Islands"
(since known as the Carteret group), which Carteret wrongly
identified with the Ontong Java of Tasman. After passing between
the Green Islands and Buka, which were named respectively Sir
Charles Hardy and Winchelsea, the south point of New Ireland was
sighted.</p>
<p>Carteret's most important discovery now awaited him. The
strait between New Ireland and New Britain, it will be
remembered, had been taken by Dampier for a deep bay only (St
George's Bay). But when, after refreshing in a sheltered cove
just within the supposed bay (described as much the best that had
been met with since leaving the Strait of Magellan), Carteret
attempted to continue his voyage by the route followed by
Dampier, he found himself carried to the north-west into a deep
gulf, which proved to be a strait between two separate islands.
The channel, which was divided in two by an island (Duke of
York's Island), received the name St George's Channel, and the
land to the east that of New Ireland&mdash;the old name, New
Britain, being kept for the more westerly land. At the northern
extremity of the latter land were sighted the remarkable peaks,
still known by the names given them by Carteret, the Mother and
Daughters. A strong westerly current carried the ship along the
inner coast of New Ireland, and between this and the populous
Sandwich Island, with whose black woolly-headed inhabitants some
intercourse was held. The name New Hanover was bestowed on the
high tree-covered island which continues the trend of New Ireland
to the north-west, and that of Byron Strait on the intervening
channel. The passage thus effected, involuntarily in the first
instance, proved to be much better and shorter than that outside
the islands. The Captain, however, was much dispirited by
sickness&mdash;so much so as to be almost ready to sink under the
arduous duties devolving upon him.</p>

<br>
<p>The further voyage led past the south side of the Admiralty
Islands&mdash;the name bestowed by Carteret, though the group had
been discovered in 1616 by Schouten and Le Maire&mdash;where
hostilities with the unfriendly natives occurred. The small
islands of Durour and Matty, the latter named after a friend of
Carteret, were afterwards discovered. Friendly intercourse was
held with the inhabitants of Pegan or Free Will&mdash;the latter
name being given from the readiness with which one of the natives
accompanied the voyagers&mdash;and Carteret then sailed on a N.W.
by N. course, which took him north of the equator. After one or
two other small islands had been passed, the island of Mindanao
was reached on October 26. The southern coast of this island was
examined, but no refreshments being procurable a course was laid
for Celebes, where, after some difficulty, supplies were obtained
at Bonthein in the southern extremity of the island. Batavia was
reached on June 3, 1768, and the Cape on November 28. The
<i>Swallow</i> finally anchored at Spithead on March 20, 1769,
having, soon after leaving Ascension, met with the French
navigator Bougainville, then also returning from his voyage of
circumnavigation.</p>
<p>It was but a few months after the last two of these British
expeditions set out, and while both were still absent, that Louis
Antoine de Bougainville, the first of the great French
circumnavigators, though not the first seaman of his nation to
complete a voyage round the world, embarked on an undertaking
very similar to theirs, and one which took him over a route in
the main corresponding with those of the English voyagers.
Destined for the law by his parents and educated at the
University of Paris, Bougainville felt himself drawn instead to
the military profession, albeit fond of scientific studies and
author of a treatise on the integral calculus. He took part in
the campaign in Canada which ended so disastrously for the French
power in North America, and after the conclusion of the Treaty of
Paris entered on a naval career, though he still retained his
military rank. At his suggestion, the project for the
colonisation of the Malouines or Falkland Islands was undertaken
in 1763, and on September 15 of that year he sailed for those
parts with the <i>Aigle</i> and <i>Sphinx</i>, repeating the
voyage, with supplies for the colonists, in 1765. But the rival
claims of the English and Spaniards soon caused the enterprise to
be abandoned, and on December 5, 1766, he sailed south, for the
third time, in the frigate <i>La Boudeuse</i>, charged with the
commission of ceding the settlement to Spain, and continuing his
way across the Pacific. The second in command of this famous
expedition, to which in 1767 was attached the store-ship
<i>Étoile</i>, was Duclos Guyot. On the outward voyage
Bougainville examined the Salvages, dangerous rocks between
Madeira and the Canaries, and visited Rio de Janeiro and the
estuary of the La Plata, whence, on November 14, 1767, he finally
sailed from Montevideo for the Strait of Magellan. After the
usual experiences in the strait, he entered the South Sea at the
end of January, 1768. Two months later he sighted various islands
of the Tuamotu group, which he named Dangerous Archipelago. Early
in April the ships anchored off the coast of Tahiti, discovered
by Wall is eight months before, one of its high peaks receiving
the name Le Boudoir or Peak of La Boudeuse. The luxuriant aspect
of nature in this island struck the navigators with delight,
while the mild and peaceful disposition of the inhabitants,
contrasting strongly with those of some of the other Pacific
groups, accorded well with their surroundings. The reception
given to the French was a most cordial one, and though the
intercourse was for a time marred by the murder of several of the
islanders by the sailors, friendly relations were again
established. Bougainville waited, however, only until the
necessary supplies of wood and water had been obtained and the
health of the sick somewhat re-established to continue the
voyage. To the group of which Tahiti formed one unit he gave the
name Bomba Archipelago, though this soon gave place to Cook's
designation, the Society Islands.</p>
<p>Continuing the voyage early in May, 1768, Bougainville next
discovered several islands of the Samoa group, to which he gave
the name Navigators' Islands, which, concurrently with the native
name, it still bears. The absence of roadsteads prevented him
from landing, though some intercourse was maintained with the
people, who showed little of the good faith and confiding
disposition, and little too of the artistic skill, of the
Tahitians. Still less pleasing were the inhabitants of the next
islands visited&mdash;certain of the New Hebrides, called by
Bougainville the Grand Cyclades&mdash;a collision with whom took
place during an attempt to obtain refreshments. The inhabitants
were of the thick-lipped black type common to the islands of this
part of the Pacific, from which it has gained the name
"Melanesia." An outbreak of scurvy had now assumed serious
proportions, and as the food supplies were running short much
distress was experienced.</p>
<p>In spite of his wish to verify his belief that he had reached
the "Austrialia del Espiritu Santo" of Quiros, the commander
found himself compelled to continue his westerly course in order
to reach the Moluccas as soon as possible. But in so doing he
continued to make discoveries, soon becoming entangled among the
islands and channels lying off the eastern extremity of New
Guinea, among which he had to submit to an enforced detention. To
the gulf in which he found himself he gave the name Louisiade,
which has since been applied to the whole archipelago. On at last
finding a passage round the cape named by him Cape Deliverance,
he sighted further islands not previously visited, and passed
through the strait since known by his name, touching at Choiseul
in the Solomon group. Hostilities with the cannibal natives
ensued, and the river, which was the scene of attack, was called
Rivière des Guerriers, the island receiving the name which it has
since retained. Bougainville and Buka Islands, in the same group,
were next sighted, the latter name being a word constantly
repeated by the natives during their intercourse with the French.
The winds and currents then made it necessary to continue the
voyage to New Britain. Coming to anchor in a supposed bay near
the east end of that island, the navigator found traces of the
recent visit of Carteret, who, as already related, had proved
that a wide strait separated New Britain from New Ireland. The
stopping place was named by Bougainville Port Praslin. No
supplies being obtainable, famine stared the navigators in the
face as they continued their voyage to the north-west, and
matters grew worse as time went on. The islands named by
Bougainville Île des Anachorètes and Échiquier were sighted, as
also the coast of New Guinea, the end of which island was
rounded. Finally, after approaching Ceram to no purpose,
refreshment was at last found at Kajeli in Buru, whence the ships
made their way to Batavia. Here, as far as geographical discovery
was concerned, the voyage was over, the return being made by
Mauritius and the Cape to Ascension, the <i>Boudeuse</i> finally
casting anchor at St Malo on March 16, 1769, after an absence of
two and a half years. The <i>Étoile</i> returned later, having
been left behind at Mauritius to refit.</p>
<p>This voyage of circumnavigation was one of the first in which
the interests of science were provided for by the inclusion,
among the staff, of scientific experts, namely the botanist
Commerçon and the astronomer Verra, both of whom stayed at
Mauritius on the homeward voyage to complete their work. The
example thus set was followed throughout a long series of
important voyages, French and English, the results of which were
proportionately enhanced in value.</p>
<br>
<p>This is perhaps the most suitable place in which to refer to
one or two voyages made about this time to the eastern parts of
the Malayo-Papuan Archipelago, though being more or less isolated
undertakings they do not quite fall into line with the other
voyages dealt with in this chapter. As just stated, the botanist
Commerçon, of Bougainville's expedition, had remained behind at
Mauritius for further research in that region, and in the
execution of this task he had the aid of a French official of the
marine department, Pierre Sonnerat, who was presently to make
himself a name for natural history researches of his own. An
expedition was soon afterwards fitted out at Mauritius under the
Chevalier de Coetivi, having among its objects an examination of
the products of the Eastern Archipelago, especially the
Philippines and the islands to the south-east of them. A start
was made on June 29, 1771, Sonnerat sailing with Coetivi in the
<i>Isle de France</i>, which was accompanied by the corvette
<i>Nécessaire</i>. The voyage resulted in valuable additions to
the knowledge of the zoology and botany of the region visited,
which included some of the western outliers of the Papuan
islands, though the mainland of New Guinea itself was not
visited. In 1766 Sonnerat published a narrative of the voyage
under the somewhat misleading title <i>Voyage à la Nouvelle
Guinée</i>. The small island of Coetivi, in the Indian Ocean
south of the Seychelles group, was discovered and named during
the outward voyage.</p>
<p>Shortly after this an English voyage to the same part of the
Eastern seas was carried out by Captain Thomas Forrest, on behalf
of the East India Company. The Company had at this time an
establishment at Balambangan, a small island off the northern end
of Borneo, and as the authorities here received reports of the
occurrence of nutmegs and other spices in Western New Guinea,
outside the Dutch jurisdiction, Forrest offered to undertake a
voyage thither to ascertain whether a profitable trade in these
commodities could be opened. Sailing in November, 1774, in the
<i>Tartar</i> galley, a prau or native craft of ten tons burden,
he visited the Moluccas, and eventually, in 1775, reached Dorey
harbour, on the north coast of Western New
Guinea.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> He spent some time in an examination
of the neighbourhood, and after much search the nutmeg tree was
found growing wild. But the hopes of establishing a trade were
not realised, and Forrest returned to the English factory in
Borneo, which he reached, after some stay in Mindanao and other
islands <i>en route</i>, in February, 1776.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup>
Forrest published an interesting account of the voyage in
1780.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> This locality became noteworthy in more
recent times from the visit paid to it by the
naturalist-traveller Alfred Russel Wallace.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Balambangan had by this time been
evacuated.]</p>
<br>
<p>The interest in Pacific discovery was now thoroughly aroused,
and expeditions followed each other so fast that two if not three
were sometimes in the field in one and the same year. Even before
the return of Wallis, and while both Carteret and Bougainville
were still at the opposite side of the globe, preparations were
already on foot for a new British voyage, which was to usher in a
period of more rapid progress than had been seen since&mdash;more
than a century earlier&mdash;Tasman's voyage brought to a close
the great discoveries of the sixteenth and early seventeenth
centuries. The immediate inducement to the voyage was not purely
geographical, being supplied by the calculation of astronomers
that a passage of the planet Venus across the sun's disc would
take place in 1769, and that the transit could best be observed
in some part or other of the Pacific Ocean. The Royal Society was
foremost in urging on the Government the desirability of
despatching an expedition to that region, to be accompanied by a
competent astronomical observer, and its representations proved
successful. But geographical research was not left out of sight
by the promoters. Among the Fellows of the Royal Society at the
time was Alexander Dalrymple, an enthusiastic believer in the
existence of a great Southern Continent, who by his writings did
much to bring the question before the public, and who, being well
versed also in astronomy, was at first selected to take charge of
the observations, though his refusal to serve in a position
subordinate to a naval officer made it necessary to arrange
otherwise. The choice of commander fell on Lieutenant James Cook,
and proved in every respect a most fortunate one. In his three
voyages of discovery, occupying the greater part of ten years.
Cook showed himself the most successful navigator produced by
this or probably any other country, the extent of unknown seas
traversed rendering those years one of the decisive turning
points in the progress of geographical discovery.</p>

<br>
<small>Captain James Cook.</small></p>
<br>
<p>The son of a Yorkshire farm-labourer, Cook's passion for the
sea was first gratified at the age of eighteen. After passing
some years in the merchant service with credit, he entered the
royal navy on the outbreak of war in 1755, and did important
service in Canadian waters under Captain (afterwards Sir Hugh)
Palliser, afterwards carrying out valuable surveys in the same
quarter of the globe. He had but lately returned when the
preparations for the proposed expedition were set on foot, and he
was appointed to command the <i>Endeavour</i>, a stout Whitby
ship built for the coal trade, but chosen for the voyage by Sir
Hugh Palliser. An astronomical observer was found in the person
of Mr Charles Green, assistant to the Astronomer Royal, while
permission was given to Mr (afterwards Sir Joseph) Banks, who had
lately been elected an F.R.S., to accompany the expedition, with
his friend Dr Solander and several assistants, for the purpose of
making researches in natural history. The association of such a
competent scientific observer with the commander was of the
utmost advantage, and to Banks's enthusiasm and loyal
co-operation a large part of the success of the expedition was
due. A further point of superiority in this over previous similar
undertakings, consisted in the measures taken to combat the
dreaded scurvy&mdash;which so often played havoc with the crews
of ships engaged in lengthened voyages&mdash;by the supply of
lime-juice and other remedies.</p>
<p>The <i>Endeavour</i> sailed from Deptford on July 30, 1768,
and in the following January successfully doubled Cape Horn
without experiencing any of the storms for which that region is
famous.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> While in its neighbourhood a serious
misadventure befel a party which had gone inland to examine the
country and was forced to camp out during a night of such
piercing cold that two Negro servants of Mr Banks succumbed. The
charts of this region proved very incorrect, and the surveys
effected were thus of much value. The voyage to Tahiti, which
from the experience gained during Wallis's voyage had been chosen
as the locality in which to observe the Transit, passed without
important incidents, only a few small islands being sighted <i>en
route</i>. On April 13 the <i>Endeavour</i> entered Port Royal
Harbour, and intercourse with the natives was quickly
established. During the three months' stay, thanks to the strict
discipline maintained by Cook, the relations with the people were
on the whole thoroughly friendly, although their pilfering habits
once or twice threatened difficulties. The Transit was
successfully observed at two or three different localities, and
excursions inland and along the coast to the eastward of the main
station added to the explorers' knowledge of the island. On
leaving, a native named Tupia was taken on board at his own
desire, and proved of much service during the further course of
the voyage. From the point of view of geography, the chief
interest was now only beginning, for a serious attempt was to be
made to solve the problems presented by the unknown area in the
south-west of the Pacific Ocean, which had baffled the efforts of
so many previous voyagers. With the exception of Tasman in his
famous voyage of 1642, none of the navigators who had traversed
the Southern Pacific during the previous centuries had passed to
the south of 30° between 100° west of Greenwich and the coasts of
New Holland, so that a vast virgin field lay open to the voyagers
in the <i>Endeavour</i> when they set out in 1768. Even on the
route from Cape Horn to Tahiti Cook had followed a more southerly
course than his predecessors, and so had pushed outward the
possible limits of land in this direction. But the results after
leaving Tahiti were to be still more important. Cook first
visited several of the other islands lying to the west of Tahiti,
giving to the whole group the name of Society Islands, after the
scientific body which had inspired the voyage. He then boldly
steered for the unknown south, discovering on the way the small
island of Rurutu, in the Austral group (spoken of by Tupia as
Oheteroa), but seeing no other land until, on September 1, the
furthest south was reached in a little south of 40°. Birds,
however, were seen, sometimes in great numbers.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> A chart showing Cook's routes on his
three expeditions is given opposite p. 254. It has been based, by
permission, on the chart (on a larger scale) given by Mr Kitson
in his recent work, <i>Captain James Cook, the
"Circumnavigator</i>."]</p>
<p>A more or less westerly course was now sailed, and on October
8, 1769, the coast of New Zealand&mdash;hitherto visited only by
Tasman, in 1642&mdash;was struck between latitudes 38° and 39° S.
It formed white chalk-like cliffs on either side of an open bay,
with low land between, backed by ranges of mountains. This
locality, which was named Poverty Bay, lay in about 38° 40' S. on
the east side of the North Island&mdash;the side opposite to that
visited by Tasman. After sailing southwards past Hawke's Bay to a
point named Cape Turnagain, the ship's head was put in the
opposite direction, and the coast followed north of Poverty Bay,
communication being frequently opened with the natives, who were
in general friendly, though one or two hostile collisions
occurred. As usual, they showed thieving propensities, and proofs
were more than once seen of their cannibalism. Mr Banks and Dr
Solander constantly added to their botanical collections, and a
transit of Mercury was successfully observed by Mr Green. After
reaching the most northern point, the <i>Endeavour</i> turned
south and followed down the west side of the North Island,
afterwards passing through Cook Strait and so definitely proving
the division of the main body of New Zealand into two distinct
islands. Valuable observations of the country and people were
made. The latter on the west coast were frequently found dwelling
in forts placed in strong situations and called Hippahs. Cape
Turnagain having been once more sighted, the ship's head was put
south and the circuit of the South Island made in the reverse
direction from that in which the North had been circumnavigated.
Few incidents of importance occurred, no native being seen during
the whole passage. The track led round the south end of Stewart
Island (the insular character of which was not discovered), and
during the voyage up the west coast the great snowy range of the
New Zealand Alps was kept constantly in sight. Reaching Cape
Farewell and once more entering the mouth of Cook Strait, the
navigators disproved once for all the idea that New Zealand
formed part of a great continental mass. Such might nevertheless
exist more to the south, and, had the condition of the ship
permitted, an attempt would have been made to solve this question
by taking the Cape Horn route and keeping in high southern
latitudes. This was felt to be impossible. Still, as provisions
for six months yet remained, it was determined to attempt further
geographical work by steering westward for the east coast of New
Holland, then quite unknown, and following it northward as far as
possible. Apart from the question of the Southern Continent, this
was undoubtedly the most important piece of geographical work
remaining to be done, and its successful accomplishment, after so
long a time had been already spent on the voyage, bears witness
to the keenness for discovery animating the navigators. In the
end they were put to some straits before reaching a port at which
they could renew their supplies, the length of time during which
fresh provisions had been scarce causing some of the crew, as
well as the Tahitian Tupia, to be attacked by scurvy.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image31" id="Image31"></a><img alt=""
src="1305581h-images/Image31.jpg"><br>
<br>
<small>Sir Joseph Banks.</small></p>
<br>
<p>The <i>Endeavour</i> sailed from Cape Farewell on March 31,
1770, and on April 19, after premonitory signs had been noticed
during several days, land was sighted by the first lieutenant, Mr
Hicks, a prominent point receiving his name in consequence. This
was a little south of 37° on the coast of New South Wales. By
thus making the first authentic discovery on this side of the
great island Cook achieved a success which was destined in time
to decide the fortunes of the whole of Australia. Landings were
soon made and natives encountered, but it was with difficulty
that they were induced to put aside their suspicions. At one
place the botanical labours of Banks and Solander met with such a
rich reward that the bay there formed between two green headlands
received the name of Botany Bay, which it has ever since borne.
Soon afterwards, on May 6, Port Jackson, the site of the future
city of Sydney, was discovered and named. The voyagers were now
approaching a region exceedingly dangerous by reason of the
shoals and coral reefs, which there attain an extent unsurpassed
in any part of the globe. The utmost vigilance was therefore
necessary. Passing Cleveland Bay, Rockingham Bay, Trinity Bay,
and other coast features which still bear the names then assigned
them, the voyagers used every opportunity of observing the nature
of the country inland. On the 10th a disaster befel them which,
but for the utmost good fortune, might well have proved fatal to
the whole crew. After successfully passing some dangerous shoals
and reaching, as it seemed, deeper water, the <i>Endeavour</i>,
with hardly any warning, struck on an invisible rock and remained
immoveable at a distance of eight leagues from land, which, even
were it possible to reach it, could not afford more than
temporary sustenance to so large a body of
men.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> All depended on the chance of saving
the ship, and the amount of damage caused by the sharp coral rock
rendered such chance extremely slight. The men worked incessantly
at the pumps, and by throwing overboard everything that could
possibly be spared, the ship was at length so far lightened as to
float at the second high tide after striking. That she did not
now sink was due only to the happy chance that the largest hole
had been plugged by a portion of the rock remaining fixed within
it. By passing an old sail covered with wool and oakum under the
damaged portion of the hull, the leak was further checked, and it
became possible to navigate the vessel to a sheltered harbour
which was found not far off, within the mouth of the Endeavour
River (still so named). Here the ship was brought to the shore,
and by hard work the damage to her bottom was at last repaired.
During the stay the country inland was examined, and the
kangaroo, the largest Australian mammal, was here for the first
time seen and secured.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The point of land abreast of the reef
on which the ship struck received the name Cape Tribulation, in

<br>
<p>The voyage was resumed on August 4, and the intricate and
difficult navigation through the reefs which fringe the coast was
successfully accomplished, though the ship was again more than
once in a position of great danger. Cape York, the northern
extremity of the north-east peninsula, was reached on the 21st,
and by sailing between this and the islands to the north, Cook
demonstrated once more the separation of New Guinea from New
Holland&mdash;a fact which had been proved by the voyage of
Torres more than a century and a half before, but was not a
matter of general knowledge at the time. The name Endeavour
Strait was given to the channel nearest the mainland, through
which the ship sailed. Having passed through this, Cook steered
north for the almost unknown south coast of New Guinea; but the
shallowness of the sea off the latter, and the uncertain
character of the inhabitants, made it impossible to do much
towards its examination. On landing, Mr Banks found the
vegetation, though luxuriant in growth, by no means rich in
species. The natives that were seen assumed a threatening
attitude: as had been observed by Tasman long before, they made
use of fire to throw at their enemies for the purpose of blinding
them, though without much effect. Continuing the voyage, the
navigators passed Timor and Rotti, and reached the small island
of Savu, where was a Dutch resident and where with some
difficulty they obtained fresh provisions for the sick. Thence
the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed for Batavia, where extensive repairs
were found necessary, and during the delay thus occasioned many
of the officers and crew fell ill with fevers and other ailments,
to which both Tupia and his boy Tayeto succumbed. On December 27,
1770, the <i>Endeavour</i> sailed from Batavia, and after a ten
days' stay at Prince's Island, steered for the Cape. There was
now more sickness than at any other time throughout the voyage,
and deaths occurred frequently, Mr Green the astronomer and Mr
Parkinson, who had accompanied Mr Banks as draughtsman, being
among the victims. After a month's stay at the Cape, in March and
April, the voyage was continued, and after touching at St Helena
<i>en route</i> the <i>Endeavour</i> cast anchor in the Downs on
May 12, 1771, having been absent a little over two years and nine
months.</p>
<p>Fruitful as this voyage had been&mdash;for, besides proving
that no continental land occupied any part of the south-western
Pacific north of 40° S., Cook had for the first time
circumnavigated New Zealand, and explored almost the whole of the
eastern coast of Australia&mdash;it was only the beginning of a
long series of equally important discoveries. Recognising the
unusual qualifications of the commander, which consisted not only
in his zeal for discovery but also in the excellent discipline he
maintained and the constant care he evinced for the welfare of
his crew, the Government at once decided to send him out again,
this time with the sole object of geographical discovery.
Although on the former voyage he had proved that no continental
land existed in the Southern Pacific between Tahiti and New
Zealand, there still remained a vast area encircling the South
Pole and reaching in many parts as far north as 40°, which was
still absolutely unknown, and which might contain a continent
rivalling in extent those of the known world. To throw light on
this great unknown area was the primary object of the new voyage,
and we shall see that it met with a degree of success which cast
into the shade all previous efforts in this direction. Two
practically new ships, built like the <i>Endeavour</i> at Whitby,
with a tonnage of 462 and 336 tons respectively, were purchased;
the larger, the <i>Resolution</i>, being placed under Cook's own
command, while the command of the smaller, the <i>Adventure</i>,
was given to Tobias Furneaux, who had done good service under
Wallis as second lieutenant. Banks, who had so large a share in
the success of the former voyage, seems to have entertained the
idea of once more accompanying the commander, but it was not
carried out. Instead, a naturalist of German extraction, Johann
Reinhold Forster, was chosen to go in that capacity, and was
accompanied by his son. Immense pains were taken in the fitting
out of the expedition, which was probably better equipped than
any previous one had been. The ships were ready by the middle of
1772, and left Plymouth on July 13. In the instructions given to
him, dated June 25, Cook was directed to proceed to the Cape, and
after refreshing there to apply himself first to the search for
land in the almost untraversed ocean to the south. It will be
remembered that early in the century the French navigator, Lozier
Bouvet, had sighted land in this region and given to it the name
Cape Circumcision. The search fox this land had just now been
taken up in France, and it is necessary to speak of one or two
French voyages before following Cook in his new undertaking.</p>
<p>Ives Joseph de Kerguelen-Trémarec, an enterprising navigator,
though a man of somewhat imperious temper, had prevailed on the
Government to despatch him on the quest above referred to. He had
sailed in 1771, and returned to France in the very month in which
Cook sailed on his second voyage. From Mauritius he had sailed
south in January, 1772, and in February had discovered the island
which has ever since borne the name Kerguelen Land&mdash;the
largest of the scattered islands in the Southern Indian Ocean.
Though in reality one of the most dreary and inhospitable spots
on the surface of the globe, Kerguelen had formed the most
extravagant ideas of its value, and, as he had seen but a part of
the island, he imagined it to be merely an advanced outpost of
the long-sought southern continent. Being sent out again in 1773
to make further examination of this supposed south land, he
realised the mistake he had made, and gave to the land he had
discovered the appropriate title, Land of Desolation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile another enterprising French navigator,
Marion-Dufresne, with Crozet as second in command, had undertaken
a somewhat similar voyage. On his return to France Bougainville
had brought with him a young native of Tahiti, whom it was
necessary to take back to his home, and Marion, eager to
distinguish himself by geographical discovery, volunteered for
the task, offering to provide one ship and to bear the expenses
of another. The young Tahitian had been sent to Mauritius, and
Marion sailed thence in October, 1771. His charge was, however,
attacked by smallpox at the isle of Réunion and died, so that it
became possible at once to undertake the search for new lands.
His own vessel was named the <i>Mascareigne</i>, while the second
ship, the <i>Marquis de Castries</i>, was commanded by the
Chevalier Duclesmeur. After visiting the Cape, Marion sailed
south at the close of 1771, or before Kerguelen had effected his
discovery, the early part of his voyage having been devoted to
the more northern parts of the Indian Ocean. On January 13, 1772,
Marion discovered a snow-clad mountainous land in 46° 45' S.,
and, like so many others in like case, flattered himself that it
was part of the supposed southern continent. It consisted,
however, merely of two small islands, with other islets near
them, being identical with the group afterwards named Prince
Edward Islands by Cook. The larger and more southern was named by
Marion Terre d'Espérance, while the more northern received the
name Île de la Caverne. The former is now known, from its
discoverer, as Marion Island. This land was not identical with
that seen by Bouvet, as its latitude was less, while it lay a
long way to the east of the longitude assigned by that navigator,
though even this eventually proved to have been too easterly.
Fearing to become entangled in the ice if he went further south,
Marion steered east, and sighted the group now known as the
Crozet Islands on January 22-23. He ordered Crozet to land on the
largest and take possession in the name of the King of France, a
circumstance from which it still bears the name Possession
Island. It supported neither tree nor shrub, but rose into high
snow-clad peaks. The search for the continent was now abandoned,
and the ships steered for Van Diem en's Land, which had not been
touched at since discovered by Tasman in 1642. Here difficulties
arose with the natives, and the ships sailed for New Zealand.
Friendly intercourse with the natives was there maintained for
some time, but it ended in a catastrophe, the commander and some
sixteen others being murdered during a visit to a chief on the
shores of Cook's Bay of Islands. Crozet and Duclesmeur therefore
sailed away for the islands of St Paul and Amsterdam, the
remainder of the voyage yielding no result in the way of
discoveries.</p>
<br>
<p>We must now return to Cook and his comrades, who, after
touching at Madeira and the Cape Verdes, sighted land in the
vicinity of Table Bay on September 29. The Dutch authorities
obligingly gave the necessary facilities for making up their
supplies, and on November 22 the southward voyage was commenced,
warm clothing being distributed in view of the meditated approach
to the cold and stormy regions in this direction.</p>
<p>Difficulties soon began, a violent gale driving the ships to
the eastward, while, after the winds moderated, they were
frequently in danger from fog and ice, the first iceberg being
seen on December 10. Arrived at the latitude in which Cape
Circumcision had been placed by Bouvet, a keen look-out was kept
for land, for although they were some degrees to the east of the
assigned longitude, the idea that the cape formed but the most
prominent point of a larger mass encouraged the expectation that
such land might be found to extend some distance to the east. No
land was, however, sighted, and the constant fog, rain, and snow
made navigation dangerous in a sea encumbered with ice. An
attempt to go west proved unsuccessful, but on sailing south the
Antarctic Circle was crossed, for the first time in the history
of Man, on January 17, 1773. This alone would have been an
achievement sufficient to make the voyage memorable, and it
clearly proved that the ocean extended, in this quarter of the
globe at least, far to the south of the position in which land
had hitherto been imagined to exist. Although the sea was fairly
open, Cook thought it unwise to venture beyond 67° 15', but
determined to sail east for the lands discovered by
Marion-Dufresne and Kerguelen, of which he had had tidings while
at the Cape. On February 4 those in the <i>Resolution</i> had the
misfortune to part company with the <i>Adventure</i> during a
dense fog, and every effort to regain sight of her was
unavailing. It was decided to sail for New Zealand, which had
been named as a rendezvous in case of separation. It was reached
without accident on March 26, on which day they entered Dusky
Bay, near the south-west extremity. Some time was spent here
examining the shores of the bay and the forest-covered country
behind it, intercourse being opened with the natives. Sailing
north on May 4, they entered Queen Charlotte's Sound, and soon
saw the <i>Adventure</i> at anchor. After the separation Captain
Furneaux had been prevented by a severe storm from returning to
the spot where the <i>Resolution</i> had been last seen, and
after cruising about for some time made sail for Van Diemen's
Land, where he hoped to effect some repairs before making for the
rendezvous in New Zealand. On March 11, the <i>Adventure</i> came
to anchor in an excellent harbour, but, on sailing with a view to
testing the continuity of Van Diemen's Land with New Holland,
encountered a gale which thwarted this purpose. Furneaux went
north along the east coast, and, passing near the end of this,
sighted the islands in the south of Bass Strait since known by
his name. He seems to have been by this time convinced that no
strait existed here; so, turning east, he steered for New
Zealand, arriving in Queen Charlotte's Sound early in April. The
natives, who before Cook's arrival seem to have meditated an
attempt to get possession of the <i>Adventure</i>, subsequently
became friendly. and Cook planted a garden with European
vegetables for their benefit. The voyage was resumed on June 7,
the first task undertaken being the search for the southern
continent to the east of New Zealand.</p>

Society.)</small></p>
<br>
<p>By enforcing the use of wild celery and scurvy grass, Cook
kept the crew of the <i>Resolution</i> in good health, but scurvy
prevailed for a time on board the <i>Adventure</i>. No land being
found between New Zealand and 133° W., the ships turned north,
and after passing near Pitcairn Island and crossing 20° S.,
steered for Tahiti, which was reached on August 16, 1773. A good
many changes had taken place since the <i>Endeavour</i> left the
island in 1769. The voyagers, however, were again well received
and visited various parts of the coast; but finding it difficult
to obtain the needed supplies, they sailed on September 2 for
Huahine. Here Cook saw again his old friend Oree, and obtained a
large number of pigs, afterwards passing over to Ulietea, and
thence sailing west for the islands discovered by Tasman in 1643
and named by him Middelburg and Amsterdam. During the voyage
thither the Hervey Islands were discovered, on September 23,
1773. The native name's of Tasman's islands were found to be Eua
and Tongatabu, the latter being the largest of the group known as
Tonga, and by Cook designated the Friendly Islands, from the
harmony that seemed to reign among the natives and their
courteous reception of their visitors. Their double canoes were
much admired for their workmanship and sailing qualities.</p>
<p>Before resuming his exploration of the ocean to the south,
Cook decided to return to New Zealand for wood and water, as also
for the purpose of visiting the natives on the east coast of the
North Island. On October 21 they reached the neighbourhood of
Cape Kidnappers, and, having left with the natives some of the
pigs, seeds, etc., they had on board, sailed south, but,
encountering stormy weather, lost sight of the <i>Adventure</i>
on the 30th. They made their way through Cook Strait to Queen
Charlotte Sound, but having searched the whole of this part of
the coast without finding a trace of their consort, and repaired
the ship as far as possible, they sailed for further exploration
on November 25, steering this time more south than east, and thus
extending their search for land into latitudes never before
approached on this side of the globe. On December 14 islands of
ice were seen, and for the next six weeks antarctic conditions of
sea and weather prevailed, the Antarctic Circle being twice
crossed, in the neighbourhood of 140° W. and 106° W.
respectively. In the latter longitude the parallel of 70° S. was
crossed for the first time in the world's history, and on January
30, 1774, they reached the edge of the solid ice-field, rising
into ridges like ranges of mountains. To have attempted to push
farther south would have been a rash undertaking, and Cook
resolved to go north, having ascertained beyond a doubt that no
continent existed unless far to the south.</p>

<br>
<p>Instead, however, of returning at once to the islands already
visited, he steered somewhat east of north, and on again turning
west the first land reached was the small Easter Island in the
Eastern Pacific. During the passage thither Cook became seriously
ill, and had only partially recovered when the island was reached
on March 11. After endeavouring, without much success, to obtain
fresh provisions, and examining the gigantic statues for which
the island is famous, the voyagers returned west, touching at
Hiwaoa of the Marquesas group (La Dominica of the Spanish
discoverers) and afterwards at Tiokea (Takaroa), discovered by
Byron in 1765, before reaching Tahiti. During their stay here
they had a sight of an imposing fleet of war canoes and
transports which had been got together to operate against the
island of Eimeo, the aggregate of the crews being estimated at
over 7000 men. Here, as well as at Huahine and Ulietea, they met
with the usual hospitable reception, and, sailing from the
last-named, left behind the native Oedidee, who had been with
them since their visit to the group in 1773. Steering nearly due
west, they sighted, on June 16, an atoll composed of several
rocky islets, and named it Palmerston, after one of the Lords of
the Admiralty. Niue, to the south of the Samoa group, was next
reached, and named Savage Island, from the character of the
inhabitants. They then proceeded to Namuka (Rotterdam of Tasman)
to procure water and fresh fruits, and on leaving this sighted
the volcanic peak of the island of Tiafu (Amatafu), guessing at
its character from its appearance. Cook next visited the
important group lying west of the Fiji Islands, which has ever
since retained the name bestowed by him on this
occasion&mdash;the New Hebrides. Its northern portion had been
discovered by Quiros over a century and a half previously, but
the southern islands were quite unknown until visited by Cook.
The first islands he touched at were in the north&mdash;Lepers',
Aurora, and Whitsuntide or Pentecost; but, leaving these, he
anchored in a harbour on the north-east side of Mallicolo, which
he named after the Earl of Sandwich. Steering south, he sighted
in turn the volcanic islands of Ambrym; Api, and a small island
near it; and Efat (which he also named Sandwich). At the last of
these some hostilities occurred, and no long stay was made. The
people seemed to be of a different race from those of Mallicolo,
and spoke a different language. Sailing on, the voyagers passed
the island of Erromango, and soon afterwards sighted a volcano
pouring forth fire and smoke, which proved to be on the island of
Tanna, which was accordingly visited. Showing suspicion at first,
the natives became in time more friendly, and some attempt was
made to examine the geography of the island. A party made its way
for some distance inland in the hope of getting a nearer view of
the volcano, which continued to show activity, but the broken
nature of the ground and the thickness of the woods forced them
to desist.</p>
<p>Cook had now explored almost the whole of the group&mdash;one
of the most important for the number and size of its islands in
the whole of the Western Pacific, though, owing to international
rivalries, it has been the last of all to be brought under
definite European control. But before leaving it, he returned up
the west side of the several islands and surveyed the coasts of
the largest and longest-known island, the Tierra del Espiritu
Santo of Quiros. Leaving this on August 31, he sailed south-west,
and was rewarded by the discovery of the largest of the Pacific
islands proper, which was struck near its north-west end. Here a
landing was effected and friendly relations established with the
natives. An eclipse of the sun was observed and a portion of the
coast surveyed, while a party pushed some little distance among
the hills and obtained a view across the island. No native name
could be found for it as a whole, and Cook therefore bestowed
upon it that of New Caledonia, which it bears to this day. Off
its south-east end he made the circuit of the Isle of Pines, and
landed on a small island which he named Botany Island, from the
interest its vegetation afforded to the botanists who accompanied
him.</p>
<p>It was now time to think of commencing the homeward voyage,
but before doing this Cook once more put the ship's head for New
Zealand, with the purpose of obtaining some refreshment before
launching out on the watery expanse of the Southern Pacific. For,
not content with his previous work in these high latitudes, he
still proposed, instead of taking a frequented route homewards,
to prosecute the main object of the voyage by once more crossing
a part of the ocean first traversed by the <i>Resolution</i> in
the previous year. On the way to New Zealand he made the
discovery of a small island lying in the broad ocean and only
some five miles in length. It was named Norfolk Island and was
found to be covered to a great extent with a large coniferous
tree, since generally known as the Norfolk Island pine, though
botanically not a true pine. Some of the birds resembled those of
New Zealand. Arrived once more at Queen Charlotte Sound, the
voyagers found evident signs that the <i>Adventure</i> had been
there since their last visit, evidence confirmed also by the
natives. On November 10 they once more sailed, steering
south-east until about the latitude of Cape Horn, and then
keeping on nearly due east until the coast of Tierra del Fuego
was reached, on December 17, not far from the western end of the
Strait of Magellan. In the whole of this course no land whatever
was seen, and the last remaining chance that land of any extent
might reach a latitude of from 50° to 60° to the south of the
Pacific Ocean thus disappeared. But the indefatigable navigator
had not yet done with discovery, for after doubling Cape Horn and
passing through Le Maire Strait he continued to steer east, and
in about 39° W. came upon one of the bleak and inhospitable lands
which mark the approach to the Antarctic region. It was named
Isle of Georgia in honour of the King, and bears the name (in the
form South Georgia) to this day. The <i>Resolution</i> skirted
the north-east coast of this island, which was much cut up with
bays and harbours, though rendered inaccessible by ice for the
greater part of the year. Continuing towards the south-east
through a sea strewn with loose ice and icebergs, Cook sighted
still another new land, calling the high promontory which came to
view on February 1. Cape Montague, while the group of islands of
which it forms a part was named Sandwich Land, the southernmost
receiving the name Southern Thule. The easterly course was
maintained until February 22, when they had almost reached the
longitude in which they had searched for Bouvet's land while on
the outward voyage. As therefore it was impossible that any
extensive land could exist in this region, the commander at last
turned the ship's head north and made his way to the Cape,
anchoring in Table Bay on March 21st, after first speaking a
Dutch and an English East Indiaman and obtaining news of the
<i>Adventure</i>. They learnt that this ship, which had parted
company off the coast of New Zealand towards the end of 1773, had
reached the Cape twelve months previously by a somewhat similar
route across the South Pacific after the crew of one of her boats
had been murdered and eaten by the people of New Zealand. During
the homeward voyage from the Cape, Cook was still mindful of the
cause of geographical science, for on touching at the Azores he
stopped long enough to permit of observations for the better
determination of the longitude of the group. Finally the
<i>Resolution</i> anchored at Spithead on July 30, after an
absence from England of a little over three years. The
<i>Adventure</i>, which during the voyage across the South
Pacific had reached the latitude of 61° S., and had afterwards
searched in vain for Bouvet's Cape Circumcision in the South
Atlantic, had completed the voyage just over a year earlier,
anchoring at Spithead on July 14, 1774.</p>
<p>Thus ended one of the most fruitful voyages of discovery in
the whole history of maritime enterprise. Its happy results were
in great measure due to the precautions taken to preserve the
health of the crews, precautions so successful that only one man
had been lost by sickness during the whole three years. It had
been possible to return again and again to the task in hand,
which was not finally abandoned until the general character of
the vast area lying around the South Polar region had been fully
demonstrated, while the knowledge of the island groups of the
Pacific had been no less materially advanced.</p>
<p>Cook's experiences while battling with the ice of the southern
regions had convinced him that any further advance in this
direction would be impracticable, and the home authorities were
content with what had been already done, making for the time
being no attempt to penetrate the mysteries of the Antarctic. But
at the opposite or northern extremity of the Pacific there still
remained a large region very imperfectly known, although the
labours of the Russians, since the beginning of the century, had
thrown much light on the relations of Asia and North America, to
the latter of which several Russian explorers (including Bering
and Chirikof) had penetrated. In 1767 a government expedition
under Lieutenant Synd had visited the American coast, and, during
the decade immediately preceding Cook's return from his second
voyage, hunters were active in the same region. But the results
of these enterprises were little known to the outside world, and
the British Government, which had already displayed its interest
in northern discovery by the despatch of Captain Phipps in 1773
to the sea east of Greenland, considered the geographical
problems awaiting solution in the far north-east as worthy of the
despatch of a new expedition. Although lately appointed Governor
of Greenwich Hospital, Cook once more expressed his readiness to
take command. The sloops <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Discovery</i>
having been fitted out for the proposed voyage, Cook received his
instructions from the Earl of Sandwich and his colleagues of the
Admiralty. He once more sailed in the <i>Resolution</i>, while
the <i>Discovery</i> was placed under the orders of Captain
Charles Clerke, who had been both with Byron and with Cook on his
two previous voyages. Lieutenant King, who sailed in the
<i>Resolution</i>, undertook the necessary astronomical
observations on that ship, while Mr William Bailey was to perform
a similar task on board the <i>Discovery</i>. Mr Webber was
engaged as draughtsman, and Mr Anderson (surgeon on board the
<i>Resolution</i>), who had already taken part in Cook's second
voyage, undertook the researches in natural history, as also in
matters connected with the manners, customs, and languages of the
natives who should be met with. Mr W. Bligh, master of the
<i>Resolution</i>, who had already served under Cook in the
second voyage, became afterwards known as commander of the
ill-fated <i>Bounty</i>. Lieutenant Burney, of the
<i>Discovery</i>, subsequently made a name as chronicler of
voyages to the Pacific and the far North-east, while one of the
midshipmen was Mr G. Vancouver, who lived to command in a
subsequent voyage of discovery. Omai, a Society Islander who had
been brought to Europe by Furneaux in the second voyage,
accompanied the expedition, and proved of great service in
dealing with the peoples visited, down to the time when he was
finally left behind in his South Sea home. A number of domestic
animals were also taken in the hope that they might become
established in the countries visited.</p>
<p>On June 25, 1776, Cook sailed from the Nore in the
<i>Resolution</i>, finally leaving Plymouth on July 12, the
<i>Discovery</i> following on August I. The island of Tahiti was
once more chosen as the place of refreshment whence the final
start for the northern region should be made, and to reach this
destination the route <i>viâ</i> the Cape and New Zealand was
again adopted. It is unnecessary to dwell upon the outward
voyage, during which, in December, the ships touched land at
Adventure Sound, Tasmania, holding some intercourse with the
natives, who were found to differ from those seen on the first
voyage on the east coast of Australia. The stay here lasted from
January 26 to 30, 1777. On the latter date the voyagers sailed
for New Zealand, arriving at Queen Charlotte Sound on February
10, and resuming the voyage on the 25th, taking with them two of
the natives. Before reaching Tahiti they touched at several
hitherto undiscovered islands, besides others previously visited
by them. The first touched was known to the natives as Mangea,
and at the second Omai found some of his countrymen who had been
carried out of their course during a voyage and had arrived there
after suffering great hardships. At Watiu (Atiu) as also at the
Hervey (since known also as Cook's) Islands, which had been
discovered in 1773, the natives were found to speak a tongue
closely resembling that of Tahiti, though physically the Hervey
islanders recalled the New Zealanders in their fierce and rugged
aspect. Diverging somewhat to the north, Cook reached Palmerston
(discovered in 1774) on April 13, and spent some time examining
the nine or ten low islets of which it is composed. After passing
Savage Island (also visited in 1774), he put in at Namuka and
thence visited Hapai, as also the islands of the Friendly group
which had not before been examined, cordial relations being
maintained throughout with the natives. A lengthened stay was
made at Tongatabu, where an eclipse was observed on July 5, and
soon afterwards final leave was taken of the Friendly Islands,
after a total visit of nearly three months.</p>
<p>On August 8, land was again seen and proved to be the island
known to its inhabitants as Tubuai, of the group since called the
Austral Islands. Tahiti was reached on the 12th, and the
experiences of the voyagers during their stay in the
neighbourhood of this island were in the main a repetition of
those of the former visit. Intelligence was obtained of the
recent visit of Spanish ships to Tahiti, but it was ascertained
from individuals who had been left behind that they had already
taken their departure. Before finally leaving, the remaining
domestic animals were landed, and Omai was left at Huahine, where
a small house was built for his use, and an inscription with the
names of the ships and their commanders cut upon its outside.
Cook left the island on November 2, 1777, and, after a month's
stay at Ulietea and a shorter stay at Borabora, sailed away to
begin the real purpose of the voyage&mdash;the examination of the
Northern Pacific and the possibility of a route thither
<i>viâ</i> the Arctic Ocean. On December 22, the equator was
crossed (in 156° 45' W.), and two days later a low-lying atoll
with a few clumps of coconuts was discovered in the midst of the
ocean. Here an eclipse of the sun was observed on December 30,
and the voyage was resumed on January 2, the name Christmas
Island having been given to the atoll from the fact that the
voyagers had there spent their Christmas. The land next sighted
(January 18) was an island belonging to the important Sandwich
group, now known by the native name of Hawaii. These islands had
almost certainly been visited by the Spaniards in the sixteenth
century, but no practical result had ensued, and the group was to
all intents and purposes unknown until Cook's visit. In spite of
the distance from other Pacific groups the language of the
islanders was found to be closely akin to that of Tahiti, so that
intercourse could be easily established. Captain Cook stayed some
days at Atui (Kauai), the people proving friendly, and made an
excursion into the interior. The ships subsequently touched at
Niihau, and on February 2 stood away to the north, having laid in
a fair supply of fresh provisions and water. Five separate
islands had been seen, all lying towards the north-west end of
the group, and of these only three, viz. Oahu, Atui (Kauai) and
Oneehow (Niihau), were of any size. The group received the name
by which it was long afterwards known in honour of the Earl of
Sandwich, to whom recourse had already been had more than once as
sponsor for new lands discovered by Cook. The natives had made a
good impression by their frank and friendly nature as well as by
their excellent physique and expertness as swimmers.</p>
<p>On March 7, the north-west coast of North America, here known
at the time as New Albion, was reached. An important field for
discovery now lay before the voyagers, for this coast from about
40° northwards was perhaps the least known of any of the
continental outlines outside the polar regions. Some slight
results, it is true, had been attained by the Spaniards, and we
may here pause to consider the various efforts made by them, down
to 1778, to extend their knowledge of the coast line north of
their settlements in Western Mexico.</p>
<p>During the sixteenth century several voyages had been made,
the most important being that of Cabrillo and Ferrelo (1542), who
reached the outer bay of which the modern bay of San Francisco is
an inlet. Early in the seventeenth century Vizcaino had sailed
along the coast and claimed to have discovered an excellent port
in 37° N., to which he gave the name Monterey. From the date of
his voyage (1603), practically nothing further was done for over
a century and a half, but in 1768 a movement was set on foot for
the resumption of discovery, and it resulted in the despatch of
expeditions both in 1769 and 1770 under Don Gaspar de Portola,
who in the former year made his way by land to a point not far
south of the Golden Gate or entrance to San Francisco Bay, while
the southern part of that bay was for the first time examined.
The chief result of the expedition of 1770 was the founding of
the "Presidio" or government station of Monterey. In 1772 a land
expedition under Don Pedro Fagés explored the country round San
Francisco Bay, and in 1775-6 a presidio and mission were founded
on the site of the modern city of San Francisco. Meanwhile the
work of exploration was being pushed further north by the naval
expeditions of Juan Perez in 1774, and of Heceta and Quadra in
1775. Perez sailed from Monterey in the <i>Santiago</i> on June
11, 1774, and reached the latitude of 55°, though without finding
any good port on the part of the coast examined. But on the
return voyage he touched at the harbour afterwards known as
Nootka Sound, in 49° 35', naming it San Lorenzo. In 48° 10' he
saw a snow-white mountain, which he named Santa Rosalia, but
which subsequently became known as Mount Olympus. In 1775 the
chief command was given to Don Bruno Heceta, who sailed in the
<i>Santiago</i>, while the <i>Sonora</i> had as captain Don Juan
Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, of whom more will be heard
later. These voyagers went as far as 56° 47' N., touching at
various points (including, possibly, the mouth of the Columbia
River), but without making a precise survey of the coast.</p>
<p>Such was the state of knowledge when Cook took up the task,
much still remaining to be done before the Spanish surveys in the
south could be satisfactorily linked with those of the Russians
in the north.</p>
<p>The point at which the American coast was struck by Cook was
in about 44½° N., where the land was found to be well-wooded and
diversified with hills and valleys. After coasting along,
hindered by contrary winds, until March 29, the ships came to
anchor near an inlet in which a snug cove was found, offering a
good opportunity for overhauling the ships and for the supply of
the wants of the crews. This was at Nootka Sound on the western
side of Vancouver Island, though the insular character of this
was not recognised, the strait at its southern end having been
passed unobserved. The neighbourhood was inhabited, and friendly
intercommunication with the natives prevailed during the whole
stay, much interesting information being obtained as to their
habits and mode of life. The masts of the ships having been
refitted by the help of trees cut down near by, and other
necessaries completed. Cook sailed on April 26, in spite of
threatening weather which compelled him to seek the open sea.
Partly on this account and partly from the wish to press on to
the scene of the contemplated exploration in the north, no
attempt was made to follow the coast line, which Cook would
otherwise have done, in order to clear up the question of the
strait supposed to have been discovered by Admiral Fonte. The
next place sighted (May 1) was Mount Edgecumbe, soon afterwards
followed by the Bay of Islands and Mount Fairweather near Cross
Sound, and, a week later, by Mount St Elias. Cape Suckling,
Bering's Bay, and Kaye Island were seen and named, the last in
honour of Dr Kaye, afterwards Dean of Lincoln, who had shown much
interest in the voyage. Arrived at the inlet to the east of the
Kenai Peninsula, which he named Prince William's Sound, Cook
explored it with a view to finding a passage to the north.
Unsuccessful in this&mdash;after passing, among other points, one
which he identified with the Cape Hermogenes of Bering&mdash;he
made his way, west of the same peninsula, to the still larger
inlet which has since borne his own name. Although very doubtful
of the existence of a passage in this direction, he determined to
settle the question by a thorough examination. By ascending both
the main and the eastern arm (the latter named Turnagain) until
they became narrow and nearly fresh, he conclusively proved that
no passage either to Baffin or Hudson Bay was to be found in this
locality. Returning to the open sea, he followed the coast round
the Alaska peninsula, frequently in sight of high rugged
mountains, some volcanic, and, passing Unalaska and others of the
Aleutian Islands, went up the east side of the Bering Sea to the
westernmost extremity of the continent, separated from Asia only
by Bering Strait. To this he gave the name Cape Prince of Wales.
Although the strait had been brought to light by Russian
travellers many years before, the results of their labours were
so little known in Western Europe that no accurate representation
had found its way into the maps, and some at least of these had
placed the extremity of America much to the east of its true
position.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Before reaching this point,
various traces of the presence of the Russians had been seen,
while the natives had been found to differ much from those
encountered further south. The sea-otter, the much-prized fur of
which was soon to offer so powerful an incentive to voyagers to
this coast (as it had already begun to do in the case of the
Russians), had been observed by the naturalists during the
voyage, and a drawing, here reproduced, had been made by the
artist.</p>

Voyage.)</small></p>
<br>
<p>Crossing the strait to a bay on the Asiatic side Cook made
acquaintance with the Chukches of this region, and then returning
to the American side endeavoured to push northwards, reaching
Cape Lisburne, where the coast bends decidedly to the east. The
sea was however so encumbered with ice that further advance
proved impossible, and the same difficulties were encountered
both in the open sea and on the Asiatic coast, which was followed
to Cape North. The season was so far advanced that it seemed
unwise to continue the search for a passage to the Atlantic, and
it was resolved to defer the attempt till the next summer.
Returning south through the strait, Cook examined the deep bay on
the American coast which has ever since retained the name Norton
Sound, given by him in honour of the Speaker of the House of
Commons. Proof was obtained of the non-existence of the large
island shown on some maps as lying between Asia and
America,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> though one or two small islands in
the northern part of the Bering Sea were touched at. The largest
of these received the name Clerke's Island, though since better
known by the name St Lawrence given it by the Russians, Hence the
voyagers made their way back to Unalaska, where the ships were
once more overhauled. During the stay several Russians were met
with, the principal of whom, named Ismaelof, was well acquainted
with the geography of these regions, and supplied Cook with
information about it, and with charts. He also took charge of a
report (with chart) from the English Captain to the Lords of the
Admiralty. Cook's own observations enabled him to lay down the
positions of several of the Aleutian Islands, and the latitude of
the harbour in Unalaska in which he stayed was accurately
determined. From the information given by Ismaelof, it appeared
that the Russians had not yet succeeded in extending their
settlements to the American mainland.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The belief in the existence of such an
island had evidently originated in the idea that the western part
of Alaska was separated from the Continent.]</p>
<p>It was now necessary to return south to suitable winter
quarters, and Cook considered that the Sandwich group would in
every way be most suitable for this purpose. The first island to
be sighted was Maui, which had not been visited on the former
occasion, and soon after the ships approached Hawaii, the largest
island and the one situated most to the south-west of the whole
group. The voyagers were surprised to see the summits covered
with snow. They brought the vessels to anchor in the bay on the
west side of the island, soon to be the scene of the tragedy
which deprived the expedition of its commander. The reception
given to the voyagers was remarkably cordial, Cook being regarded
with an almost superstitious reverence and all the wants of the
crews supplied with the utmost liberality. After some stay the
ships took their departure, the natives remaining still the best
of friends. But the ships had hardly sailed any distance before
the <i>Resolution's</i> mast was found to be urgently in need of
repair, and Cook, after some hesitation, decided, with lamentable
consequences to himself, to complete the refit in the bay which
had just been left. The beginning of troubles came, as was so
often the case in such voyages, from the pilfering habits of the
people, which forced the crew to have recourse to reprisals. All
might still have gone well, but for some unfortunate
misunderstandings which turned the once hospitable people into
temporary foes. While on shore with a small party Cook was
attacked by an excited crowd and almost immediately received a
fatal wound. The whole of the ships' companies were for a time in
imminent danger, for, flushed with their success and mistaking
the pacific overtures of the English for cowardice, they assumed
a contemptuous and threatening attitude, which made reprisals
necessary, deeply as they were regretted by Captain Clerke, who
had now assumed command. The result was an eventual resumption of
friendly relations, which proved the essentially pacific
disposition of the islanders, or at any rate of most of their
chiefs. The fatal occurrence was in fact all the more melancholy
from the circumstance that it was the result of no premeditated
hostility, but of one of the sudden misunderstandings which had
so often before been successfully smoothed over.</p>
<p>Thus perished, to the profound sorrow of all his associates,
to whom he had become endeared by his thoughtful consideration
for their welfare, the most distinguished navigator Great Britain
has ever produced. His fame could hardly have been increased had
he lived to complete the voyage, for the task to which he had
devoted himself, the filling in of the broad outlines of the
geography of the Pacific and Southern Oceans, had already been
achieved. Although a new attempt to return by a northern route
was to be made, it could, under the conditions then prevailing,
lead to no other result than the negative one already
obtained.</p>
<p>The loss of their beloved commander in no way deterred the
survivors from prosecuting the task committed to them, and, after
brief visits to some of the other islands, Captain Clerke
resolved to sail for Kamchatka, there to prepare for the
northward voyage in the ensuing summer. As his route would cross
an almost unvisited part of the Pacific Ocean, he hoped to be
rewarded with the discovery of some new island, though, as it
turned out, this ambition was not gratified. During the passage
to Kamchatka difficulties were experienced owing to bad weather,
and to a leak which had showed itself in the <i>Resolution</i>.
The snow-covered land was however sighted on April 23, soon after
which the ships entered Avacha Bay, and the needed supplies were
obtained through the courtesy of the Russian Commander of
Bolcheretsk. Bering Strait was reached on July 5, but the ice
immediately afterwards encountered diminished the hope of
advancing further to the north. The difficulties were in fact not
a whit less than in the previous year, and after tacking in
various directions amid the ice and attempting in vain to push
along both the American and the Asiatic coasts, Captain Clerke
was at last obliged to fall back upon the circuitous route
<i>viâ</i> the Cape of Good Hope, the highest latitude attained
having been 70° 33'. But he did not live to complete much of the
homeward voyage, for his health, which under the attacks of
consumption had for some time been gradually declining, now
became rapidly worse, and he expired on August 22, 1779, the day
before the ships reached Petropaulovsk. Here he was buried, a
monument (still to be seen) being erected over his grave. The end
had no doubt been hastened by the rigorous climate and the
anxieties to which he had lately been subjected, but which he had
cheerfully encountered in the determination to do all in his
power to carry out the object of the voyage. The chief command
now fell on Captain Gore, who had commanded the <i>Discovery</i>
since Cook's death, and who now removed to the <i>Resolution</i>,
while Lieutenant King, whose journal supplied the official
narrative of the voyage after the death of Cook, was promoted to
the command of the <i>Discovery</i>. The return was successfully
accomplished by way of Macao, the Straits of Sunda, and the Cape,
and although war had now broken out with France, Spain, and the
revolted American Colonies, the orders given by the respective
governments to refrain from molesting the voyagers enabled them
to escape all hostilities <i>en route</i>. The west coast of
Ireland was sighted on August 12, 1780, and on October 4 the
ships arrived safely at the Nore after an absence of over four
years. Only five men had been lost by sickness during the whole
of that period.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the last of Cook's great voyages of
discovery forms a fitting close to the present chapter, and
before continuing the narrative of Pacific exploration it will be
desirable to look back at the course of discovery by the Russians
during the eighteenth century in Northern and North-Eastern Asia,
with which the work of Pacific navigators had begun, as we have
seen, to show points of contact.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>
<h4>RUSSIAN DISCOVERIES IN THE NORTH-EAST, 1700-1800</h4>
<p><span class="a">It</span> has been seen in a former chapter
that the journeys of the Russian adventurers who had spread over
Siberia during the seventeenth century had brought about a
general knowledge of that vast region as far as the shores of the
Pacific. The extremity of the Old World had, it is claimed, been
rounded by the Cossack Deshnef, while the remote shores of
Kamchatka had been brought within the cognisance of the Russian
authorities. But the results of these journeys had never become
widely known, and there was much vagueness in the information
acquired by the travellers themselves. In the eighteenth century
these rough and ready methods began, here as elsewhere, to give
place to more precise and scientific procedure, leading to
results not entirely to be dispensed with at the opening of the
twentieth century. The impulse towards further effort was due to
Peter the Great, who during the latter part of his life showed a
keen interest in the acquisition of a better knowledge of these
remote parts of his Empire, especially as regarded the relations
of Asia to America. He did not live to see much of the work
accomplished, but a good beginning, at least, had been made
before his death.</p>
<p>About 1710, attention was called to reports of the existence
of islands in the frozen sea to the north of the Siberian coast,
and in the following year two separate expeditions were equipped
for the purpose of settling the question. The first, destined for
the coast east of the Yana, was entrusted to the Cossack Merkurei
Vagin, and he was accompanied as guide by Jacob Permakof, who had
deposed to having once seen an island on the far side of the
Sviatoi Nos. The explorers reached this cape, and, sailing north,
discovered (so it was said) an island 9 to 12 days in
circumference, beyond which they thought they saw another large
land. On the return the party suffered so much that both Vagin
and Permakof were murdered by their men, in revenge for having
involved them in such hardships, and great doubt exists as to the
reality of the supposed discovery. The second expedition, under
Vasilei Stadukhin, reached a promontory running east from the
mouth of the Kolyma, but the way was stopped by ice, and no
island could be seen. In 1715, Alexei Markof went north from the
mouth of the Yana, travelling over the ice with sledges, but he
too saw no trace of islands. In 1724, one Feodot Amossof searched
for islands, first sailing east from the mouth of the Kolyma and
afterwards going over the ice with sledges. He reported the
discovery of land, on which were huts covered with earth, but it
was of no great size and only distant a day's journey from the
coast, so that in any case the discovery was of slight
importance, while some have altogether doubted the truth of
Amossof's statements. Thus the efforts in this direction led for
a time to exceedingly slight results, and even if the island said
to have been seen by Vagin was one of the New Siberia group, it
was not until many years later that the discovery was effectively
followed up.</p>

<br>
<p>In an easterly direction, the newly awakened enterprise of the
Russians was decidedly more successful. We have seen in a former
chapter that Kamchatka had been reached by Atlassof about 1697,
and that Russian influence soon began to extend over the greater
part of the country. The enquiries here made elicited some vague
information about the islands beyond, and some indications of a
large land to the east&mdash;probably the American
continent&mdash;seem also to have been gathered. In 1706 the
southernmost point of Kamchatka was reached, and the nearest of
the Kurile Islands sighted. In 1710, some shipwrecked Japanese
fell into the hands of the Russians, and supplied information on
the geography of the lands to the south. In 1712 and 1713, two
expeditions to the Kuriles were conducted by the Cossack Ivan
Kosirevski, who collected some fairly precise information and put
down the results in a series of charts. With regard to the
Japanese islands, the enquiries led to the belief that Yezo
really consisted of several distinct islands, though it had been
shown correctly as one by the Dutch navigator Vries in the
<i>Kastrikom</i>, whose voyage has been spoken of in a former
chapter. The route hitherto followed to this remote region was
the difficult northern one by the Anadyr, but about this time
efforts were made to open up a shorter and more southerly route
across the Sea of Okhotsk. In 1712 and 1713, two parties of
Cossacks explored the shores of that sea and examined the Shantar
group of islands lying in about 55° N. In 1714, orders came from
the Czar Peter to attempt the voyage to Kamchatka, and the
Cossack Sokolof was sent with some sailors and ship's carpenters
for this purpose. Among the sailors was a Dutchman from the town
of Hoorn, Henry Busch by name. A vessel was built and a first
voyage undertaken in 1716. The navigators at first followed the
coast in an easterly direction, but encountering an adverse wind
were driven across to the west coast of Kamchatka just north of
the Tigil. The coast was examined as far as the mouth of the
Kompakova, where they wintered, returning to Okhotsk the next
year after a tedious voyage, owing to obstructions caused by
ice.</p>
<p>In 1719, the Czar himself issued instructions to the surveyors
Evreinof and Lushin for an expedition across Siberia to
Kamchatka, and thence to the region where the two continents were
expected to approach most closely. The text of this
document&mdash;still in existence&mdash;was annotated by the
Emperor's own hand. The venture was not successful, for the
farthest point reached seems to have been one of the Kurile
Islands. But the project was not allowed to lapse, and before his
death in 1725, the Emperor once more drew up instructions for an
expedition, this time placed under the command of Vitus Bering,
then a captain in the Russian navy. The choice was a fortunate
one, for Bering, by his skill and determination, achieved results
which place him in the front rank of explorers of the far
North-East. With his coadjutors Lieutenants Martin Spangberg and
Alexei Chirikof, he set out from St Petersburg in February, 1725,
and, after some time had been spent in the tedious work of
transporting the stores across the whole length of Siberia, the
party was at length reunited at Okhotsk in July, 1727. Even then
there was much to be done before the real work of discovery
began. A new vessel had been built at Okhotsk, and in this the
expedition crossed over to Kamchatka, which was crossed by means
of sledges during the winter. At the Nishne Kamchatka fort, the
principal settlement on the east coast, another vessel was built
and named the <i>Gabriel</i>. In this the explorers set sail on
July 20, 1728, following the coast to the north-east and
carefully charting it. On August 10 they sighted the island which
still bears the name St Lawrence, given to it on this occasion
from the Saint associated with that date in the calendar, and on
the 15th reached a point (in 67° 18' N. according to their
observations), where the coast bent decidedly to the west, and
Bering correctly concluded that he had passed the farthest
extremity of Asia. The point seems to have been that known to the
Russians as Serdze Kamen (in 67° N., according to Nordenskiöld),
and Bering had therefore followed the northern coast of the
continent beyond the point where it approaches nearest to
America. He for the first time laid down the coast-line
accurately in a map, and though the voyage of Deshnef had, many
years earlier, shown to those acquainted with its results that
the continents were separated, the intervening strait deservedly
bears the name of the later and more scientific
explorer.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Bering now turned, as he feared he
might be entangled in the ice, but did not give up the hope of
effecting some discovery to the east. After reaching the
Kamchatka river on September 20 (old style), and spending the
winter in that region, he set out again in June, 1729. But
adverse winds prevented him from reaching any land, so turning
back, and rounding the south point of Kamchatka, he reached
Okhotsk on July 23. One useful result of this voyage was the
determination of the exact position of the south end of
Kamchatka, for many false ideas were current in Europe at the
time, some supposing (and the idea held its ground to some extent
even after Bering's voyage) that this peninsula and Yezo formed
one continuous land, as may be seen delineated in some maps of
the period.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Within recent years Deshnef's name has
been given to the easternmost point of Asia.]</p>
<p>Some time now elapsed before Bering renewed his efforts at
exploration to the east of Kamchatka, but meanwhile Afanasei
Shestakof, commander of the Cossacks at Yakutsk, came forward
with proposals for a new attempt. He was successful in his
application, and a large expedition was set on foot, the command
being given jointly to himself and to Dmitri Paulutzki, a captain
of dragoons, while among the subordinate members was Michael
Gvosdef, a surveyor. The two leaders separated (apparently owing
to a dispute), each prosecuting the enterprise independently.
Shestakof reached Okhotsk in 1729, and sent his cousin, Ivan
Shestakof, in the <i>Gabriel</i> (Bering's ship) to map the
islands between Okhotsk and Kamchatka. He himself followed in the
<i>Fortuna</i>, but met with shipwreck, and, though then escaping
the fate of most of his men, subsequently lost his life in an
engagement with the Chukches. At the same time a voyage seems to
have been made independently, under his orders, and in it Gvosdef
apparently took part, for it is recorded that in 1730 he reached
a land opposite the Chukche country in 65° 66' N., which must, it
seems, have been the American continent.</p>
<p>Paulutzki had meanwhile made his way overland to the posts on
the Kolyma, and in 1731 proceeded against the Chukches, his march
helping to a somewhat better knowledge of the region of the Upper
Anadyr. Several engagements were fought, and the force made its
way along the north coast beyond the "Chukotskoi Nos", apparently
as far as Bering's turning point. The geographical results of the
whole undertaking were, however, by no means striking.</p>
<p>It was in the following year that, largely through Bering's
initiative, but with the warm support of Kirilof, secretary of
the Senate, a series of expeditions was planned, which proved of
the greatest importance for the geography of north-east Asia. A
comprehensive scheme was drawn up and preparations were made with
the greatest thoroughness. The aid of the Academy of Sciences was
invoked, and some of its members&mdash;Gmelin the naturalist, De
la Croyere the astronomer, and the historian G.F.
Müller&mdash;volunteered to take part in the enterprise for
purposes of research, while a number of naval officers were
appointed to command the several expeditions contemplated. The
objects in view were not only the exploration of the still
unknown area between Asia and America, but the complete survey of
the northern coasts of Siberia, as well as explorations within
the vast interior of that country.</p>
<p>The work to which the greatest importance was attached was the
prosecution of discovery east of Kamchatka, this being entrusted
to Bering himself (appointed Commodore), and his associates
Spangberg and Chirikof. Spangberg was sent forward with the
heaviest materials in February 1733, and proceeded to Okhotsk to
superintend the building of ships. A start was made during the
same year by Bering and by the members of the Academy, Chirikof
bringing up the rear still later. A good deal of delay occurred
in the preparations for the eastern voyage, and the interval was
utilised by the Academicians in surveys and scientific researches
on land. De la Croyère accompanied Chirikof to the mouth of the
Ilim and thence went <i>viâ</i> Irkutsk to Lake Baikal and the
Upper Amur. Gmelin and Müller ascended the Irtish, and proceeding
by Tomsk to Yeneseisk, spent the summer of 1735 examining the
region east of Baikal, while in 1736 they turned their attention
to the upper basin of the Lena. Unfortunately a fire at Yakutsk
caused the loss of all Gmelin's itineraries, and he therefore
returned in 1737 to the Upper Lena, while De la Croyère went to
the lower parts of the same river and thence to the Olenek.
Meanwhile Müller, as his health had broken down, gave up the idea
of proceeding on the eastern voyage, but was commissioned to stay
in Siberia and extend his knowledge of that country by further
travel. Gmelin also obtained his recall, but the loss of these
helpers was made good by the arrival, in 1738, of the naturalist
George William Steller, who eventually took part in the main
expedition. A student named Krasheninikof had already been sent
forward to Kamchatka, and it is to him we owe the first
scientific account of the country.</p>
<p>By these several journeys a scientific basis was for the first
time supplied for the mapping of Siberia in its broad outlines,
though large gaps of course remained, and have only been
partially filled in in our own day. During the same period
several voyages were undertaken on the north coast with a view to
testing the possibility of a passage by sea, such as had been the
dream of so many of the early navigators in the sixteenth and
early seventeenth centuries. The first of these was devoted to an
examination of the most westerly part of the route, from
Arkhangel to the Ob. This voyage was under the command of
Lieutenants Pavlof and Muravief, who sailed in 1734 and entered
the Kara Sea, but returned to winter at Pustozersk on the
Pechora. In 1735 they again passed through the Yugor Shar into
the Kara Sea and followed the coast as far as 77° 30' (by their
reckoning), but then turned back without reaching the Ob. In 1736
and 1737 the quest was taken up by Lieutenants Mlyagin and
Skuratof, who passed the Yamal (Yalmal) peninsula and sailed up
the gulf into which the Ob debouches. The next section of the
passage, between the Ob and the Yenesei, was successfully
accomplished in 1737, after three previous failures, by
Lieutenant Owzin, accompanied by Ivan Koshelef. During Owzin's
four voyages the shores of the gulfs of Ob and Taz were carefully
mapped. In 1738 the work was continued by Minin (who had
previously been with Owzin and Koshelef), with Sterlegof as mate.
During the first two summers little advance was made, but in the
winter of 1739-40 Sterlegof pushed on with sledges along the west
coast of the Taimur peninsula as far as 75° 26', and in the
following summer the ship was taken almost as far, the voyagers
then returning on account of snow-blindness. They had done a
creditable piece of work, for the coast beyond the Yenesei,
almost as far as the Lena, was till then virtually unknown; the
great northward projection of the peninsula terminating in Cape
Chelyuskin, and the remoteness of this part of the coast from the
main centres of Russian occupation in Siberia, rendering it the
least accessible of all. Meanwhile exploration of the section
east of the Taimur was being carried out from the Lena as a base,
whence voyages were made both to the west and east. Setting out
from Yakutsk in 1735, Lieutenant Prontchishchef, with the mate
Chelyuskin, wintered on the Olenek, and during the next summer
passed the mouths of the Anabara and Khatanga. But he found his
way barred by islands and ice-bound channels before reaching the
extremity of the Taimur peninsula, though he reached the latitude
of 77° 25' (or 29' according to one account) in the endeavour to
turn these obstacles. He died soon after his return, and his
young wife, who had accompanied him, two days later. The task was
taken up in 1739 by Lieutenant Khariton Laptef, assisted by
Chelyuskin and Chekin. After reaching Cape Thaddeus, on the east
side of the Taimur peninsula, during the first summer, Laptef
took his ship back to winter-quarters on the Khatanga, but lost
it in 1740 while attempting to return. The rest of the journeys
had therefore to be carried out by land, but they were successful
in affording surveys of the greater part of the coast of this
northern extremity of Siberia as far as the Yenesei. In one of
his journeys, carried out in 1742, Chelyuskin seems to have
rounded the northern extremity of the Old World&mdash;the cape
which now bears his name.</p>

<br>
<p>From the Lena eastward the sea had frequently been navigated,
as we have already seen, though the vessels employed had been
little fitted for successful voyages in such seas. Small success
likewise attended the newer efforts. In 1735 Lieutenant
Lassinius, who had started from Yakutsk with Khariton Laptef,
advanced hardly 100 miles east of the Lena delta, and on
wintering in this region his party was attacked by scurvy, and
the leader and many of his men died. The attempt was renewed in
1736 by Dmitri Laptef, who, however, hesitated to risk an advance
through the ice, and returned without effecting anything. In 1739
he succeeded in rounding the capes east of the Lena (Borkhaya and
Sviatoi)&mdash;which had seemed impossible on the former
voyage&mdash;but was then frozen in. During the winter some good
survey work was done. In 1740 Laptef sailed past the Bear
Islands, but was brought up by the ice off Great Cape Baranof. He
remained in this region till 1742, and, his efforts to advance by
sea being still frustrated, went overland to the Anadyr and made
a survey of the route. This closed the attempts at exploration on
the north coast for a time.</p>
<p>While superintending the general progress of the whole series
of expeditions, Bering's own preparations for his eastern voyage
advanced but slowly, and he had seen all the subordinate
undertakings well under way before finally setting out himself.
The last of those expeditions to be spoken of is that of Bering's
old associate Spangberg, to whom was committed the task of
exploring the region between Kamchatka and Japan, about which, as
already mentioned, much uncertainty still prevailed. Three
vessels in all took part in the voyage&mdash;the <i>Archangel
Michael</i> under Spangberg himself, the <i>Hope</i> under
Lieutenant Walton, and the <i>Gabriel</i>, previously used for
the first Kamchatka expedition, under Midshipman Sheltinga. The
start was made from Okhotsk in June, 1738, the sea having till
then been blocked by ice. After making arrangements for wintering
in Kamchatka, Spangberg undertook a preliminary reconnaissance of
a part of the Kuriles (as far as 46° N.), postponing the main
voyage till 1739. In May of that year the explorers again sailed
for the Kuriles, but in the following month the commander and
Lieutenant Walton became separated in a gale, and continued the
voyage independently, both reaching Japanese territory and
opening up friendly intercourse with the inhabitants. Spangberg,
accompanied by Sheltinga, struck the coast of the main island
(according to his reckoning) in 38° 41' N., and advanced south to
38° 25'. On the return voyage he touched at a part of the island
of Yezo, placed by him in 43° 50' N., and here made the
acquaintance of the hairy Ainus. He continued his explorations in
this region, and again sighted land (Matsumai) in 41° 22' N.,
apparently taking it to be a different island from that already
visited, though it must really have been the southern extremity
of Yezo. He thus failed to set at rest all the uncertainties
about the lands north of Hondo, though he did good service in
determining the position of Japan relatively to Kamchatka. He was
back at Okhotsk early in September.</p>
<p>Walton touched at various points on the Japanese coasts,
reaching a town of some size in the neighbourhood of 33° 48' N.,
and seeing a large number of Japanese vessels. Before beginning
the return voyage he stretched eastward with a view to
ascertaining if more land existed in that direction, but, not
finding any, made his way to Kamchatka and Okhotsk, reaching the
latter more than a week before Spangberg. For the purpose of
verifying and completing his surveys, Spangberg undertook a
second expedition in 1741-42, but as he hardly advanced beyond
the most northern of the Kuriles, it was entirely without
result.</p>
<p>The preparations for the eastern voyage under Bering himself
had meanwhile at last been completed, and the two vessels <i>St
Paul</i> and <i>St Peter</i> left Okhotsk September 4, 1740,
under the respective commands of Bering and Chirikof. The winter
was spent at the port in Avacha Bay which has ever since been
known as Petropavlovsk from the names of the two ships. The real
voyage of discovery&mdash;the most important yet made in these
seas&mdash;commenced June 4, 1741, the scientific experts,
Steller <sup><b>[1]</b></sup> and De la Croyère, having meanwhile
joined the ships. The expedition sailed at first a little east of
south, but finding no land in this direction, stood to the
north-east and soon encountered a severe storm, in which the
ships became separated, never to meet again during the whole
voyage. On July 29 (new style) Bering sighted the great peak of
Mount St Elias, which received its name on this occasion. It was
taken to be a volcano&mdash;erroneously, as we now know. Hence he
endeavoured to follow the coast to the north-west, but was
hampered by constant fog. It is somewhat difficult to trace his
movements in detail, but he is known to have passed close to the
outer side of Kadiak Island, to have sighted a portion of the
Alaska peninsula, and to have spent some days at the Shumagin
Islands, afterwards passing south of the line of the Aleutian
Islands. Some of the volcanoes in these were sighted from a
distance, and thus for the first time brought to light. Meanwhile
Chirikof had reached the American coast considerably more to the
south and east (in about 56° N.), and a few days earlier than
Bering. A disaster occurred almost immediately, for two boats'
crews, which had been sent on shore in succession, were never
again heard of, having in all probability been killed by the
natives. The loss of the boats was a great calamity, for it was
now impossible to land, though the coast was followed for some
distance. About the middle of August the two ships seem to have
been simultaneously in about the same locality (south-east of the
Shumagin Islands), but they did not sight each other. Like
Bering, Chirikof was much delayed by adverse winds and fog, and,
water falling short, the crews suffered greatly, and their case
was rendered worse by the appearance of scurvy, the astronomer De
la Croyère being one of the victims to this disease when actually
in sight of land. Avacha Bay was, however, reached by the scanty
remnant of the original crew on October 11, 1741.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> This naturalist had come out with a
view to taking part in Spangberg's second voyage, but was
persuaded by Bering to change his plans.]</p>
<p>Bering was not so fortunate, being himself attacked by scurvy,
while so many of his men were disabled that the ship could not be
navigated among the many dangers of these unknown seas. The chief
responsibility now devolved on Lieutenant Waxel, whose efforts
were zealously seconded by the naturalist Steller. But the ship
drifted about at the mercy of the elements, and, on reaching the
island which has since borne Bering's name, it was almost by a
miracle, in the enfeebled state of the crew, that it found its
way into a sheltered basin, nearly surrounded by rocks, on
November 15, 1741. The island, which was at first supposed to be
a part of the mainland, was a new discovery, and the enforced
stay during the winter of 1741-42 produced valuable additions to
knowledge through Steller's admirable descriptions of the animal
life and the general character of the region. The now extinct
marine mammal known as Steller's sea-cow (<i>Rhytina gigas</i>)
was here observed for the first time. The island was devoid of
trees and human habitations and the only means of obtaining
shelter was by enlarging some pits found in the sandhills and
covering them with the ship's sails. Bering was already greatly
enfeebled at the time of his arrival, and he died on December 19,
only a month after being carried on shore. Many of the crew, of
whom the scurvy had taken too firm hold to permit them to benefit
by the stay, also died, among them the pilot Hasselberg, aged 70,
and the mate Chitaingof. Steller alone maintained his health, and
he was untiring in his efforts to better the condition of the
men, of whom 45 lived to see the advent of spring. They supported
life on the flesh of various marine animals, including
sea-otters, whose skins formed likewise a valuable commodity.
During the winter the vessel was stranded and became a total
wreck, so that the only means of safety left was to build a new
vessel with the material saved from the old one. This work was
successfully accomplished under the direction of a Cossack named
Starodubzof, who had been employed in a subordinate capacity in
ship-building at Okhotsk. The vessel was launched on August 21,
1742, and the voyage to Petropavlovsk was accomplished without
mishap, that port being reached on September 5. Thus ended this
unfortunate voyage, which had nevertheless done much to improve
the knowledge of the coasts of North-West America and of their
relation with those of Asia. With Bering's previous voyages, it
entitles the Danish captain to a high place among the world's
navigators.</p>

<br>
<p>A large part of the results attained had been due, as we have
seen, to the energy of the naturalist Steller, who unfortunately
met with a fate little in accordance with his merits. Having
stayed in Kamchatka for purposes of research, he became embroiled
with the authorities and was called to Yakutsk to answer for his
conduct. He made so good a defence that he was allowed to start
homewards, but was recalled through orders from St Petersburg,
and died&mdash;of a fever according to Müller&mdash;at Tiumen in
November, 1746. Müller and Gmelin had completed their researches
and reached St Petersburg early in 1743, with which year the vast
efforts put forth by the Russian Government to increase the
knowledge of Siberia and neighbouring regions reached, for the
time, its conclusion. Something was, however, done, largely by
private individuals, to extend the knowledge thus gained.</p>
<p>The conception current about this time of the geography of
this region, and particularly of the relations between Asia and
America in the far north, is well shown by the map published by
Müller in 1754 (and in a revised form in 1758) under the auspices
of the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences. An outline sketch of
this, as reproduced by the French cartographer Bellin in 1766
(and soon afterwards by Thomas Jefferys in this country) is given
on the opposite page.</p>
<p>Russian hunters and trappers now began to push over to the
American side of Bering Sea, and the numerous islands of the
Aleutian Archipelago began gradually to appear, though but
vaguely, on the charts. Among the names most deserving of mention
in the ranks of these early pioneers are those of Nevodsikof, who
in 1745 first examined the Fox Islands (as the eastern section of
the Aleutian Archipelago was then called); and Stephen Glottof,
who, with the <i>Andrean</i> and <i>Natalia</i>, in 1762 sailed
beyond the Fox Islands to Kadiak, of which he gave the first
definite account. In 1764 Lieutenant Synd undertook a voyage to
the more northern parts, near Bering Strait, but it was only in
1767 that he made any great advance. After visiting certain
islands in the Bering Sea (said to be between 61° and 62° N.) he
reached a land which he considered to be the American continent
between 64° and 66° N., but made no effort to survey it, and soon
afterwards began the return voyage. In 1768 and 1769 a government
expedition under Krenitzin and Levashef resumed the examination
of the Fox Islands and coast of Alaska, on which last Krenitzin
wintered. This brings us to the position of affairs at the time
of Cook's third voyage, spoken of in the last chapter, which did
more to shed a clear light on the geography of this region than
al] the voyages since Bering's time. By this date a Russian
company had been formed for the exploitation of the fur trade on
the American side, and an important step was taken by Shelekof,
between 1783 and 1787, in the founding of a station on Kadiak
Island, which served as a base for operations on the coasts
beyond. Meanwhile, aroused by the brilliant results of Cook's
voyages, other nations came forward to take part in the work, and
the exploration of this same region was part of the programme of
the celebrated French voyage under La Pérouse. From the English
side, too, the work was continued by a series of voyages which,
like the French voyage just alluded to, will be spoken of in the
next chapter. They were to a large extent contemporaneous with
the Russian voyages now to be mentioned, so that in considering
these it must be remembered that the results achieved had in many
cases been anticipated by the rival claimants. for the profits of
the fur trade.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after the station on Kadiak had been
established, an important voyage was undertaken by the pilots
Ismaelof <sup><b>[1]</b></sup> and Becharof, under the orders of
the Governor-General at Irkhutsk. Sailing from Kadiak in 1788, in
the galiot called the <i>Three Holy Fathers</i>, they explored
the neighbourhood of the Bay of Chugatsk&mdash;the Prince William
Sound of Cook&mdash;and afterwards examined portions of the coast
to the east and south-east, including Yakutat Bay, already
visited by the English Captains Portlock and Dixon. The farthest
point reached seems to have been in about 57° or 58° N., where a
bay was examined which was probably that discovered by Portlock
in the previous year, and since known as Portlock Bay. Scurvy now
made its appearance, and the voyagers turned their vessel
homewards, postponing further attempts at discovery.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Met by Cook and by him called Smyloff
(see p. 252).]</p>
<p>The only other Russian expedition to this region, undertaken
before the close of the century, which need be mentioned here, is
that entrusted to Captain Billings, an officer in the Russian
service who had taken part in Cook's last voyage and who had made
an abortive attempt to push east by sea from the mouth of the
Kolyma in 1781, The proposal for this expedition was made by Dr
William Coxe, the English historian of these Russian voyages,
through the well-known naturalist Pallas. Billings had with him
as secretary Martin Sauer, to whom we are indebted for the
fullest account of the voyage. Nothing of great importance was
effected. In 1785 the explorers started from St Petersburg and
proceeded to Okhotsk, where two vessels&mdash;the <i>Glory of
Russia</i> and <i>Good Intent</i>&mdash;had meanwhile been built.
Billings sailed in the first of these in October, 1789, and after
wintering at Petropavlovsk, started thence in May, 1790. He
visited Shelekof's settlement in Kadiak Island, then under the
charge of Delaref, and touched at Montague Island, Prince William
Sound, and Kaye's Island, from the last of which he sighted Mount
St Elias in the north-east early in August. But his stock of
provisions was now failing, and he sailed back to Kamchatka,
reaching Petropavlovsk at the end of October, after considerable
sufferings from want of food and water. The <i>Good Intent</i>
had been wrecked at the outset of the voyage, but as a second
attempt was to be made in 1791, another vessel was built during
the winter under the direction of Captain Hall, who was to
command her. Billings sailed first in the <i>Glory of Russia</i>,
but after reaching Unalaska early in July he gave up the idea of
further exploration eastward, and quitted the ship, hoping to
survey the Siberian coast during a land march to the Kolyma. But
the veiled hostility of the Chukches frustrated this design, and
no results of importance were gained by a six months' journey,
during which the party suffered much from cold and want. The
command of the <i>Glory of Russia</i> had meanwhile been taken
over by Captain Sarychef, who joined Hall at Unalaska. The crews
passed a miserable winter at Illuluk Bay, returning to Kamchatka
in the following spring. Little had therefore been gained, in
spite of the elaborate preparations; the principal result being
the observations on the countries and people visited, which were
put down by Sauer in his narrative. Thus ended, for the time, the
Russian enterprises for the exploration of the American coasts
opposite Eastern Siberia.</p>
<br>
<p>During the latter half of the eighteenth century some attempts
were once more made to throw light on the northern coasts and
islands. A Yakutsk merchant, Shalaurof, made an expedition at his
own expense in 1760-62, but though he rounded the Sviatoi Nos and
sighted Liakhof Island, he seems neither on this nor on a
subsequent expedition in 1766, which proved fatal to his whole
party, to have rounded the north-eastern point of Asia. In 1763 a
sergeant, Andreief, was sent on a journey northward over the ice,
and is said to have reached some islands, but these cannot be
identified with certainty. Three surveyors&mdash;Leontief,
Lussof, and Pushkaref&mdash;continued the search in 1769-71, but
accomplished nothing. In 1770 a beginning of exploration of the
New Siberia Islands was made by Liakhof, whose name has since
been attached to the most southern island of the group. He also
discovered Maloi and Kotelnoi islands. The work was prosecuted by
various adventurers, among them Sannikof, who in 1805 discovered
two more islands, and Hedenström, an exile who executed a partial
survey of the group under government orders, in 1809-10. Sannikof
also continued his explorations, and reported that he had seen
land to the north-east from New Siberia, the existence of which
remained still a subject of discussion nearly a century later.
But these and subsequent journeys belong rather to a later period
than that dealt with in the present work.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>
<h4>THE NORTHERN PACIFIC, 1780-1800</h4>
<p><span class="a">We</span> now resume the story of exploration
in the Pacific, as pursued by the nations of Western Europe. The
unequalled success attained by Cook in his three voyages drew
universal attention to this field of research, and it was but a
few years after his death that a new French expedition was
organised to continue the work of the English navigator. During
the war between Great Britain and her revolted colonies, in which
France had intervened on the side of the latter, King Louis XVI
had shown sufficient enlightenment and interest in scientific
discovery to order that the French war-ships should in no way
molest the English navigators, should they be encountered; and
when peace was at last concluded in 1783, he took a personal
interest in the preparations for a French expedition, the command
of which was entrusted to François Galaup de la Pérouse, an
officer who had distinguished himself during the war by several
successful actions against the British. In particular, he had
been in command of the daring expedition to Hudson Bay in 1782,
during which, after successfully overcoming the risks of
navigation through the ice and fogs of that region, he had taken
and destroyed the British posts at the south end of the bay,
distinguishing himself no less by humanity to the vanquished than
by intrepidity and resolution in carrying out his task. Two
frigates, the <i>Boussole</i> and <i>Astrolabe</i> (in which
names the scientific aims of the expedition were shadowed forth,
and one at least of which was to become particularly famous in
the annals of exploration), were placed under his command, the
captain of the <i>Astrolabe</i> being the Chevalier de Langle.
The <i>personnel</i> included various scientific experts, among
others Bernizet, Lepaute-Dagelet, De Lamanon, De la Martinière,
and Dufresne. Cook's last voyage had called attention to the work
still to be done on the shores of the Northern Pacific, on which,
during the last two decades of the eighteenth century, the
efforts of maritime discovery were largely concentrated, and this
region was chosen as one of the special fields of activity of the
French expedition.</p>
<p>The ships sailed from Brest on August 1, 1785, and early in
the following year the passage round Cape Horn was effected
without difficulty. After touching at the coast of Chile and at
Easter Island, La Pérouse steered at once for the Sandwich group,
sighting Hawaii on May 28, 1786, and coming to anchor off Maui
the following day. No long stay was made in the group, but after
obtaining some refreshments, the voyagers stood over for the
American coast, which was reached near Mount St Elias. Following
the coast to the east with a view to finding shelter for the
ships. La Pérouse passed Cape Fairweather on July 2, and found a
nearly land-locked bay, which received the name Port des
Français. Its latitude was found to be 58° 37' N. and it was
therefore situated a little south of Mount Fairweather. Some
dealings were had with the natives, who made but a poor
impression on the voyagers, nor did their country arouse much
enthusiasm. It was on preparing to leave this bay, where some
refreshment had been obtained, that the first misfortune, of the
many which overtook the expedition, was experienced. Three boats
had been sent to buoy the channels of the bay, and of these, two
became caught by the strong current, and their occupants, 21 in
all, were drowned. Continuing his voyage on August 1, 1786, La
Pérouse traced the coast southwards, and came to the correct
conclusion that it was fringed by an archipelago of islands,
though only the outer side of these was examined. A fine bay was
named after the Russian navigator Chirikof, and a group of
islands after his associate, the French savant De la Croyère.
Arriving at a projecting headland, which he named Cape Hector
(the southern point of the group since known as the Queen
Charlotte Islands), he partially examined the inlet running up
behind it, which received the name Fleurieu Gulf. Passing and
naming the Sartine and Necker Islands, he finally put in at
Monterey Bay in California, having examined the greater part of
the North American coast south of Mount St Elias. Part of his
survey was a duplication of the work of the Russians and English
about the same time, but even here it was of value as supplying
an independent and trustworthy delineation of this little-known
coast-line.</p>

<br>
<p>The expedition made a stay of some weeks in Monterey Bay, and
then, in November 1786, sailed for China, passing north of the
main islands of the Sandwich group, and narrowly escaping
disaster on a reef which was named Basse des Frégates Français.
The volcanic island of Assomption (Asuncion) in the Ladrones, and
the Bashi islands, were afterwards sighted, and Macao was reached
at the beginning of January, 1787. Finding no despatches here,
the commander decided to refit in the Philippines, and while in
the port of Manila received a visit from the frigate <i>La
Subtile</i>, under De Castries, which had just taken part in a
voyage with D'Entrecasteaux by an unusual route (unusual at least
for the time of year) from Batavia to Canton, east of the
Philippines. This was the first geographical achievement of
D'Entrecasteaux, who was destined to distinguish himself in the
search for the ill-fated expedition now being described. Two
officers and eight men were received from <i>La Subtile</i> to
partly replace those that had been lost.</p>

<br>
<small>La Pérouse's routes in the seas north of Japan.<br>
(<i>Outline sketch of his chart</i>.)</small></p>
<br>
<p>La Pérouse now began the second part of his
programme&mdash;the examination of the coasts of North-eastern
Asia between Japan and Kamchatka. In spite of all the Russian
enterprise in this region, and in particular the creditable
results of Spangberg's voyage, a good deal remained to be done to
elucidate its geography. It was still quite uncertain whether
Sakhalin was, or was not, a part of the mainland, while the exact
relations of the island of Yezo were equally obscure. Setting
sail on April 9, 1787, the ships passed Formosa and the Liu-kiu
group, and though much impeded by fog, sighted the island of
Quelpart on May 19, and passed through the strait between Japan
and Korea, hugging the coast of the latter. Making a zigzag
course through the Sea of Japan, and then sailing along the coast
of Manchuria, the navigators were deceived by a strange optical
illusion, caused by a thick bank of fog, which presented all the
appearance of a mountainous coast line to the south, seamed by
ravines and seeming to be separated from the continent by a
narrow strait. On June 23, the ships anchored in a bay on the
coast of Manchuria which received the name of Ternay. On the 27th
they proceeded along the coast and soon sighted the opposite
coast of Sakhalin, where La Pérouse entered into friendly
intercourse with the natives and gained intelligence as to the
geography of the surrounding region. He advanced north almost to
the narrowest part of the strait separating Sakhalin from the
mainland, but then found progress stopped by a submarine bank
stretching across the channel. He therefore put into a bay on the
side of the mainland, which he named De Castries, and on August 2
turned south in order to round the southern point of the island.
This he did successfully, naming the point Cape Crillon. By thus
passing between Sakhalin and Yezo, by the strait which now bears
his name, La Pérouse did a useful piece of work, showing that the
two islands were entirely separated. With these discoveries he
was for the time satisfied, and made his way through the Kuriles,
by La Boussole Strait, to Kamchatka, reaching Avacha Bay on
September 7. Here news from home at last reached the wanderers.
La Pérouse receiving intimation of his promotion to the rank of
"Chef d'Escadre." At Petropavlovsk, M. Lesseps was left behind
for the purpose of taking home despatches by the overland route
through Siberia, a task which he successfully accomplished. The
ships sailed south on September 30, and in the following December
reached the Navigators' Islands of Bougainville, anchoring off
Manua. The reception by the islanders was at first friendly, but
an unfortunate occurrence marred these good relations. Captain De
Langle and a number of his men, including the naturalist Lamanon,
being massacred during a visit to the shore. Magnanimously
refusing to make reprisals, the commander sailed away to the
south-east, reaching the Friendly Islands before the end of the
year, and making his way, by the end of January, 1788, to the
coast of New South Wales, where he found the English busy with
their new settlement at Port Jackson, and met with a friendly
reception. He sailed away in February and no direct news of his
expedition was ever again received. The search carried out by
D'Entrecasteaux led to but negative results, and it was only
about 30 years later that some light was accidentally thrown on
the closing scenes of the voyage by the English Captain
Dillon.</p>
<p>While touching at the island of Tucopia (north of the New
Hebrides) in 1826, Captain Dillon found European objects among
the natives, including a sword-hilt of French manufacture, and
learnt that two European ships had many years before been lost
off the coast of Manicolo or Vanikoro in the Santa Cruz group
(sometimes considered part of the New Hebrides), and that these
articles had been derived from the wrecks. On reaching Calcutta,
he prevailed upon the Indian government to despatch him for the
purpose of clearing up the mystery, and rescuing any possible
survivors. The voyage was accomplished in spite of many
difficulties, and the enquiries made at Vanikoro left no doubt
that the ships wrecked had been the <i>Boussole</i> and
<i>Astrolabe</i>. Many other articles, undoubtedly once belonging
to their equipment, were obtained, and Captain Dillon learnt by
careful enquiry that the ships had struck on the reefs on the
west side of the island, one being lost immediately; that the
crew of this ship escaped to the shore, but were murdered by the
natives; and that those on board the other, which did not break
up at once, built a smaller vessel out of her timbers, and
eventually sailed away. Even if the latter information was
correct, there can be no doubt that these too ultimately
perished, though their exact fate must for ever remain a mystery,
as no further traces of the expedition have ever been met
with.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> An attempt has lately been made in
Australia to connect a wreck found in 1861 on the Queensland
coast with the vessel built by the survivors of La Pérouse's
voyage; but the evidence in favour of the theory seems quite
insufficient.]</p>
<p>While the French government had thus taken up the work of
Captain Cook with a single eye to the enlargement of geographical
knowledge, a number of other undertakings were set on foot at the
same time with a view to commercial profit through the
exploitation of the fur trade on the north-west coast of
America.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> These too contributed not a little,
incidentally, to a better knowledge of that complicated coast,
with its archipelagos and labyrinths of channels. In 1785 a ship
named the <i>Sea Otter</i> was fitted out by English merchants in
China, and sailed under Captain Hanna, who visited Nootka or King
George's Sound and examined various bays and islands on the
neighbouring coast. Among the former was Fitzhugh's Sound, a
little north of Vancouver Island, which still retains the name
given it on this occasion. Hanna returned to the same coast in
1786, which year saw the arrival in these parts of three other
British expeditions, each of two ships, in addition to that of La
Pérouse. One had been fitted out in England in 1785 by a body of
merchants (among them Richard C. Etches) who obtained from the
South Sea Company licence to trade on the coast of North-West
America for a term of years. It was commanded by Captains
Portlock and Dixon, both of whom had taken part in Cook's last
voyage, and who sailed in the <i>King George</i> and <i>Queen
Charlotte</i> respectively. In 1786, the Bengal merchants fitted
out the <i>Nootka</i> and <i>Sea Otter</i>, commanded
respectively by Captain Meares and Lieutenant Tipping; while
those of Bombay despatched Captains Lowrie and Guise in the
<i>Captain Cook</i> and <i>Experiment</i>, the commercial
operations being in the hands of Mr James Strange.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> It was the sea-otter, abundant at the
time on this coast, which supplied the bulk of the skins. A
drawing of it made during Cook's third voyage is reproduced on p.
251.]</p>
<p>Portlock and Dixon made their way to Cook's River, but went
south to winter in the Sandwich Islands without accomplishing
much. In the spring of 1787 they returned to the American coast,
visiting Prince William Sound to the east of Cook's River. In
this neighbourhood they encountered Captain Meares, who had
wintered not far off His crew had suffered severely from scurvy,
and Portlock was able to render him some assistance, though on
terms with which Meares saw little cause to be satisfied. In May,
Portlock and Dixon separated, both afterwards touching at various
points on the coast. The former discovered a harbour just south
of Cross Sound, to which he gave his own name. Here he had some
intercourse with the natives and sent a party to explore
eastward, but, on leaving, sailed for the Sandwich Islands and
China without making further discoveries. Dixon did somewhat
more, for after touching at Yakutat Bay (which he named Port
Mulgrave) and other points on the coast, he entered the channels
both to the north and to the south of the Queen Charlotte group
of islands (to which he gave the name of his ship), and thus
virtually proved its separation from the continent, though
without actually traversing the whole intervening space. The
northern end of the dividing channel has ever since borne his
name (Dixon Entrance). The hardships endured by Meares and his
men prevented them from making discoveries, while though Lowrie
and Guise seem to have traced a considerable stretch of
coast-line in 1786, they failed to make the results widely known.
They seem however to have touched at the outer side of the Queen
Charlotte group, and it was during the voyage of the
<i>Experiment</i> that the northern entrance to the strait which
separates Vancouver Island from the mainland received its name
Queen Charlotte's Sound. During 1787 another ship, the
<i>Imperial Eagle</i>, sailed from England for North-west America
under Captain Barclay, who examined the opening south of Nootka
Sound which is still known after him as Barclay Sound. He is also
said to have entered Juan de Fuca Strait, at the south end of
Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>In 1788 a number of ships again visited this coast. Captain
Meares joined with other merchants in fitting out two
vessels&mdash;the <i>Félice</i> and <i>Iphigenia</i>&mdash;giving
the command of the latter to Captain Douglas, who had already had
some experience on the west coast of America. The ships sailed
from China in January, taking the route down the west side of the
Philippines and almost touching the equator near the west end of
New Guinea before making any northing. Hence they continued the
voyage independently, the <i>Félice</i> steering for Nootka, the
<i>Iphigenia</i> for Cook's River and Prince William Sound. The
former returned to China before the end of the year <i>viâ</i>
the Sandwich group (some natives of which had been brought by
Meares from China), after exploring the coast to the south of
Nootka Sound. Here Meares examined both the entrance to Juan de
Fuca Strait, and also the mainland to the south of it, a high
mountain on this receiving from him the name Mount
Olympus.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> A little north of 46° he noticed an
opening where the mouth of the Columbia really is, but, failing
to recognise its true character, gave it the name Deception Bay,
and the point to the north that of Cape Disappointment. The
<i>Iphigenia</i> carried out a larger programme, tracing the
whole coast from Cook's River to Nootka Sound, and for the first
time sailing through the whole length of the channel on the inner
side of the Queen Charlotte group. After wintering at the
Sandwich Islands, Douglas returned in 1789, and made a further
examination of the Queen Charlotte group and the islands abreast
of it, nearer the mainland. Some useful work was also done by
Captain Duncan, who had arrived in the <i>Princess Royal</i> in
1788, and who laid down the results of his surveys in a chart.
The Calvert Islands, to the north of Queen Charlotte Sound, were
so named by him. Among other vessels engaged on this coast in
1788, were the <i>Prince of Wales</i> under Captain James Colnett
(belonging, like the <i>Princess Royal</i>, to the firm of Etches
and Co.), and two American sloops, the <i>Washington</i> and
<i>Columbia</i>, under Captains Gray and Kendrick, of whom we
shall have to say more shortly.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> It seems to have been first observed by
the Spanish commander Perez, in 1774. No ascent of the mountain
was made till 1907, when a party from Seattle reached the summit
for the first time.]</p>
<p>The year 1789 was noteworthy for events of a political nature,
which eventually, however, had an important bearing on the
further exploration of this region. Mention has already been made
of the renewal of Spanish activity on the west coast of North
America a little before the date of Cook's last voyage, and the
expeditions of Juan Perez, and of Heceta and Quadra, in 1774 and
1775. In 1779, the examination of the coast was continued by Don
Ignacio de Arteaga (Quadra once more sailing as second in
command), and the latitude of 61° was reached. Not unnaturally,
therefore, the Spanish government viewed with jealousy the
English activity at Nootka Sound, and early in 1789 a ship of war
was sent north from San Bias, under Don Esteban Josef Martinez,
with a view to establishing Spanish sovereignty in that
neighbourhood. Several English ships were again on the north-west
coast, including, in addition to the <i>Iphigenia</i> and
<i>North-West America</i> (the latter a vessel which had been
built by Meares before his departure), the <i>Princess Royal</i>
and <i>Argonaut</i>, which had been despatched from China by a
partnership formed between Meares and the Etches. Don Martinez
proceeded to carry out his instructions by high-handed action
against the English captains, whose vessels were seized, while
first Douglas and afterwards Colnett were put under arrest, and
part at least of their cargoes confiscated. Meares was not the
man to submit tamely to this treatment, and in 1790 he and his
partners submitted a memorial to parliament, which resulted in
the fitting out of a powerful fleet in support of a claim for
redress on the part of the British government. Relations were
very strained for some time, but the Spanish government
eventually yielded, recognising the British rights at Nootka
Sound, and agreeing to the despatch by either party of a duly
accredited representative to carry out the formal transfer of the
territory. The result was the famous expedition of
Vancouver&mdash;the British representative&mdash;which did more
than all its predecessors to bring about an accurate knowledge of
the geography of the coast in question.</p>
<p>The Spaniards had meanwhile not been idle, but had endeavoured
in various ways to consolidate their political and commercial
interests in the Pacific. One result of the new spirit of
enterprise (favoured too by the peace concluded in 1783) was the
great expedition of Alessandro Malaspina&mdash;perhaps the most
important from a scientific point of view that ever left the
shores of Spain&mdash;which may fittingly be spoken of here, even
though its bearing on the dispute on the north-west coast of
America was not very direct. Malaspina came of a noble Italian
family, but finding scant scope for his energies in his own
country, entered the naval service of Spain, and distinguished
himself in several sea-fights during the war with England in
1779-83. After the conclusion of peace his energies found an
outlet in schemes for the commercial development of the Spanish
colonies. He twice sailed to the Philippines with this object,
and did much to improve the knowledge of the hydrography of that
archipelago, whilst on the second voyage he completed the
circumnavigation of the globe. In 1789&mdash;the year in which
the above described events at Nootka took place&mdash;he was
placed in command of a still more important expedition&mdash;one
in which the furtherance of Spanish commerce was combined with an
extensive scientific programme. This embraced not only careful
surveys of the coasts to be visited, but researches into other
branches of science, this part of the work being entrusted to a
staff of experts. Exploration pure and simple was kept in view,
in so far as stress was laid on the search for the long-talked-of
strait, supposed to lead from the North Pacific to Hudson
Bay&mdash;the idea of which still continued to exercise the minds
of geographers. It was the portion of the south coast of Alaska
between 58° and 60°, and extending roughly from Yakutat Bay to
Prince William Sound, that was thought to offer especial hopes of
success in this connection, and the examination of this
coast-line was laid down as one of the tasks of the expedition.
Apart from this, attention was to be given rather to accurate
surveys of previously known coasts than to actual discovery.</p>
<p>Two ships, the <i>Descubierta</i> and <i>Atrevida</i>, were
fitted out, the command of the second being given to Captain J.
de Bustamante. Starting in the summer of 1789, they proceeded to
the Rio de la Plata, which was surveyed, and thence to the coast
of Patagonia and the Falklands. Both here, and throughout the
voyage up the west coast of South America, every opportunity,
both for hydrographical work and scientific observations, was
seized. From Guayaquil the ships proceeded (October, 1790) to the
Galapagos, and thence to Panama, both finally reaching Acapulco,
after separating for a time in the spring of 1791. The coast
survey was now abandoned for a time, and a course laid for Alaska
in order to carry out the search for the strait. Yakutat Bay was
examined and the coast followed past Mount St Elias. The great
glaciers descending from this mountain were observed, and
Malaspina's account of this region has been generally confirmed
by modern investigators. The largest glacier, with which many of
the others unite before reaching the sea, and which is perhaps
the vastest glacier existing anywhere outside the Polar regions,
has received the navigator's name (Malaspina glacier). Finding no
evidence of a strait in the latitudes mentioned in his
instructions, Malaspina sailed down the coast, touching at Nootka
and Monterey (August and September, 1791), and once more reaching
Acapulco during the autumn of that year. This concluded the work
on the coast of North America, and Malaspina now crossed over to
the Philippines, devoting a good part of 1792 to a further survey
of this group. Early in 1793 he cruised through the South-western
Pacific, passing the New Hebrides and Norfolk Island, and
touching at points on the coasts of New Zealand and New South
Wales. From the newly-established British settlement at Port
Jackson he started once more to cross the Pacific, and during the
passage made a somewhat detailed examination of the Tonga group.
Spain was finally reached in September, 1794, the whole voyage
having occupied rather over four years.</p>
<p>An immense amount of scientific material was brought home by
the voyagers, but unfortunately this was never fully utilised.
Malaspina fell a victim to political intrigues before he had done
more than make preliminary arrangements for its publication, and,
when at last released from a long captivity, he left Spain and
spent the last years of his life in retirement in his native
country. His papers were long lost, and it was not until 1885
that any considerable part of them was made accessible to the
public, though a few special memoirs had been issued earlier.</p>
<p>During the years occupied by Malaspina's great voyage,
something was also done by the Spanish authorities on the west
coast of North America to continue the work of exploration. Thus
early in 1790 an expedition had been sent north under Francisco
Elisa, Salvador Fidalgo, and Manuel Quimper, the last of whom
partially explored the Strait of Juan de Fuca during the summer.
Again, in 1791, the year in which Malaspina examined the Alaska
coast, Elisa and others continued the examination of the interior
waters, as well as of the outer coast of Vancouver Island. One
other French expedition, too, visited North-west America about
the same time, though the geographical results were not great. It
was commanded by Étienne Marchand, a captain in the merchant
service, who sailed from Marseilles in December 1790, hoping to
secure a share in the profits of the fur trade. His ship was
named <i>La Solide</i>, and among his companions were Captains
Masse and Chanal, whose names, like his own, are commemorated by
discoveries made during the voyage across the Pacific. Making a
wide circuit to the south of Cape Horn, Marchand steered for the
Marquesas, of which only the southern portion, discovered by
Mendaña at the end of the sixteenth century, had hitherto been
visited. After touching at the Santa Cristina of that navigator,
he continued his voyage to the north-west and lighted upon other
islands in this direction, to the three principal of which his
own name, and those of Masse and Chanal, were
given.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Hence the voyage was continued to
Norfolk Bay, on the north-west coast of America, whence the Queen
Charlotte Islands were visited. But little of importance was
effected, and Marchand soon decided to sail for China with the
few furs which had been obtained. Hawaii was touched at on the
way, the further route leading by the Mariannes and Formosa to
Macao. Here the captain found that the sale of furs at the
southern ports of the empire had been prohibited, and therefore
returned to France by way of Mauritius, reaching Toulon on August
14, 1792. This voyage found a chronicler in the French
hydrographer Fleurieu, and thus obtained greater notoriety than
might otherwise have been the case. The narrative was accompanied
by a comprehensive dissertation on the history of voyages to the
Pacific.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> These islands were surveyed only a year
later by Lieut. Hergest (see p. 292), without knowledge of
Marchand's voyage.]</p>
<p>It is now time to speak of Vancouver's voyage, to the
circumstances of which reference has already been made. It should
be premised that in England, as in Spain, a belief in the
existence of a passage connecting the Pacific with Hudson Bay
still held its own in some quarters, and that Meares in the
narrative of his voyages, published in 1790, endeavoured by
various arguments to show the likelihood that the so-called Juan
de Fuca Strait&mdash;into which, as already stated, he had
himself entered some distance&mdash;was the portal to an inland
sea or archipelago occupying a great part of the northern
interior of the continent. In particular he declared that the
American sloop <i>Washington</i> had in 1789 traced a
considerable part of this supposed inland navigation, and even
went so far as to show the course of the vessel on a map.
Although this proved to be a mistake&mdash;for the
<i>Washington</i> had really advanced no great distance within
the strait&mdash;the views of Meares and others had an important
bearing on the geographical side of Vancouver's task, which was
carried out with a thoroughness rarely equalled in the history of
maritime exploration.</p>

<small>Captain George Vancouver.</small></p>
<br>
<p>Like others of the navigators of this time, Vancouver had
served his apprenticeship to maritime discovery under Cook, to
whose example he no doubt owed many of the qualities to which his
success was due. Already in 1789 a new expedition for maritime
research had been planned, but its field of action was to have
been the south, not the north. Preparations had so far advanced
that the commander was named, the choice falling on Captain Henry
Roberts, likewise one of Cook's officers, with whom Vancouver was
associated as second in command. A new vessel, bearing once more
the honoured name of the <i>Discovery</i>, was chosen, and its
equipment was being pressed forward when the Spanish difficulty
caused the preparations to be abandoned, and on its eventual
settlement the <i>Discovery</i> was assigned to Vancouver for the
purposes of the expedition to North-West America, to which he was
appointed. As the second ship of the expedition, the choice fell
on the <i>Chatham</i>, with Lieut. W.B. Broughton as commander,
and among the other officers of the two ships (who one and all
proved zealous coadjutors in the survey work and whose names were
honoured by being given to many of the features of the coasts of
North-West America) were Lieutenants Zachariah Mudge, Peter
Puget, Joseph Baker, James Hanson, with the respective Masters,
Joseph Whidbey and James Johnstone. Vancouver received his
commission on December 15, 1790, and at once joined the
<i>Discovery</i> at Deptford, where he pressed forward the
equipment so energetically that the ship was ready to proceed
down the river on January 7, 1791. After some detention at
Portsmouth, the <i>Chatham</i> being not yet ready, the
<i>Discovery</i> proceeded to Falmouth, whence both ships finally
sailed on April 1.</p>
<p>For the outward route Vancouver chose that by the Cape of Good
Hope, whence, after stopping to complete his supplies, he sailed
on the voyage across the Indian Ocean on August 17, purposing to
devote what time could be spared to an examination of the
south-west coasts of New Holland. Throughout the voyage
observations were carried out with much assiduity for the
determination of longitude, chiefly by the method of lunar
distances, and the rates of the chronometers were checked
whenever opportunity offered. Much stormy weather was encountered
after leaving the Cape, and an attempted search for shoals
thought to exist near the line of route had to be abandoned.
Vancouver also failed to sight the islands of St Paul and
Amsterdam (which he had been anxious to do in order to clear up a
discrepancy in the charts as to their relative positions), though
the reckoning showed the course to lie between the two islands.
Sailing over a little frequented part of the ocean, he passed the
position assigned in the charts to Lyon's land without meeting
with it; but on September 24 soundings of 70 fathoms were
obtained, and on the 26th the Australian coast was at last
sighted, a conspicuous headland being named Cape Chatham, after
the President of the Board of Admiralty. The coast was now
explored eastwards and a spacious inlet was discovered to which
the name King George's Sound was given, and of which formal
possession was taken on September 29. The country in general
presented a desolate appearance, and the signs of human
habitation were of the most wretched description. Over a wide
area the trees and other vegetation bore signs of the ravages of
fire, the cause of which was difficult to account for. The
examination was continued past Doubtful Island Bay to a little
beyond Termination Island, in 122° 8' 30" E., when the advance of
the season rendered it prudent to sail for the Pacific without
further delay. A stretch of coast extending over some 300
nautical miles had, however, been carefully surveyed for the
first time, though some idea of it had been obtained as far back
as 1627 by the voyage of the <i>Gulden Zeepaard</i>.</p>
<p>The coast of Tasmania was sighted on October 26, but the ships
held on their course for Dusky Bay in New Zealand, where, in
spite of some severe storms, the northern arms of the inlet,
which had not been examined by Cook, were surveyed. The crews
having benefited much by their stay, the voyage to Tahiti was
resumed, the ships soon becoming separated. The <i>Discovery</i>
placed on the chart for the first time the group of rocky islets
south of New Zealand, called by Vancouver The Snares, and
subsequently lighted on the inhabited mountainous island of
Oparo, in 27° 36' S., 144° 1' 30" W. The <i>Chatham</i>
discovered Knight Island (48° 15' S., 166° 42' E.) and the
Chatham group east of New Zealand.</p>
<p>The ships eventually joined company once more at Tahiti, where
some stay was made, and it was not until January 24, 1792, that
they left for the Sandwich group, Hawaii being sighted on March
1. Visiting in turn Oahu, Atui and Niihau, Vancouver noticed
considerable changes since his visit with Cook, and deplored
especially the introduction of firearms by the fur-traders.
Putting to sea on March 17, the voyagers sighted the coast of
"New Albion" on April 17, in about 39° 30' N., and the real work
of the expedition now began, the whole coast being carefully
examined from this point northwards. Its course was generally
straight, and sheltered inlets were searched for in vain, though
the country behind was pleasant&mdash;often tree-clad and
mountainous. Cape Mendocino, where the high interior country
approaches the coast and forms a pronounced headland, was passed,
and beyond Cape Orford (a name bestowed by Vancouver) some of the
few inhabitants seen on this part of the coast were encountered,
their honesty and friendliness making a favourable impression.
The northernmost point seen by Cook was passed, and the Cape
Disappointment of Meares was soon afterwards reached. Hereabouts
the sea took the colour of river-water, but Vancouver was
unfortunate in not recognising the mouth of the Columbia river
(probably, with the exception of the Yukon, the largest river
draining the whole Pacific slope of America), to which this
discoloration was no doubt due. Before reaching the entrance to
Juan de Fuca Strait, while abreast of the high mountain named
Olympus by Meares, Vancouver spoke the American ship
<i>Columbia</i>, of Boston, commanded by Captain Robert Gray, the
same whom Meares supposed to have carried out an extensive inland
navigation in the <i>Washington</i>. It was found, however, that
he had really advanced no great distance within the strait, so
the English voyagers had not been forestalled in their task. Gray
had, however, seen the mouth of the Columbia, to which he
subsequently gave the name of his ship, and his priority in this
respect was to prove of much importance when the disputed
sovereignty of this coast had eventually to be
settled.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The actual discoverer of the mouth of
the Columbia seems to have been Captain Bruno de Heceta, of the
Spanish expedition of 1775.]</p>
<p>The entrance to the much talked-of strait of Juan de Fuca was
reached on April 29, and the ships entered the passage the same
evening. The voyagers now began a systematic survey of the whole
complicated series of channels and inlets which are such a
characteristic feature of this coast&mdash;a survey hardly to be
matched for thoroughness in the whole history of pioneer voyages.
Vancouver was determined to leave unexamined no portion of the
coast-line which might conceal a possible passage towards the
Atlantic Ocean, and owing to the intricate labyrinth of channels
which here run far into the land, an extraordinary extent of
ground had to be traversed in carrying out this task. His plan
was to find from time to time a secure anchorage for the ships,
and from this to send out boat expeditions to trace the
ramifications of the channels, especially on the continental
side, where the passage, if any, would be found. Some of these
parties were placed in charge of one or other of the officers,
while the commander also took an active part in the work himself
In the course of these operations abundant information was
collected on the physical character of the country, its
productions and inhabitants, and Vancouver's remarks as to its
future possibilities are of great interest in view of the high
degree of development it has since reached.</p>
<p>One of the first stations for the ships was Port Discovery, on
the south side of the inlet. From this point, and from a
subsequent station further to the south-east, the various
southern branches of these inland fjords were examined, one and
all proving to end more or less abruptly, after running many
miles into the interior. The most important arm received the
name, under which it has since become so widely known, of Puget
Sound, after the second lieutenant of the <i>Discovery</i>,
afterwards Admiral Peter Puget. The extreme beauty of the
landscape&mdash;forests interspersed with pleasant
lawns&mdash;made a great impression, though much of it was then
an uninhabited wilderness, the former inhabitants having to all
appearance migrated no long time before. The scarcity of running
streams was, notwithstanding, somewhat remarkable, and the great
depth of the channels, which presented, like all those of this
region, a typical fjord-like character, made it difficult to meet
with good anchorages. High snowy mountains were seen in the
interior, the most prominent being the fine peak to which the
name Rainier was given, after a naval officer who eventually
attained the rank of admiral.</p>
<p>No passage having been found in this direction, the explorers
gradually felt their way northwards, continuing the same tactics
and examining the many inlets running east from the main gulf.
which was named Gulf of Georgia in honour of the king, while
successive portions of the mainland received the since discarded
names of New Georgia and New Hanover. Before proceeding far up
the strait separating Vancouver Island from the mainland to the
east, the commander experienced some degree of mortification in
finding that he had been preceded here by rival
explorers&mdash;Dionisio Galiano and Gaetano Valdes&mdash;in
command, respectively, of a brig and a schooner belonging to the
Spanish navy. These vessels had been previously attached to the
expedition of Malaspina, whose visit to North-west America in
1791 has already been mentioned. While he was employed at the
Philippines, they had sailed from Acapulco on March 8, and after
a stay at Nootka had started on June 5 to explore the inland
passage. The means at their disposal were, however, not great,
and Vancouver had the satisfaction of finding that they had not
traced the inlet to its termination or junction with the ocean,
so that this piece of work was still to be done. Cordial
relations were kept up while the ships were in the same
neighbourhood, and on separating the English continued their
survey towards the north, finding the channel trending more and
more westwards, while the country became, in their eyes, more
desolate and forbidding. The mountains showed much bare
rock&mdash;which, however, still gave a footing for forests of
conifers&mdash;while cataracts poured down their sides in many
places. The great mountain range continued to be seen
occasionally, and appeared for a time to block all passage to the
east, though to the northward it either receded from the sea or
became lower. The survey party which traced the channel through
its narrowest portion, sufficiently far to render its junction
with the ocean north of Nootka a certainty, was in charge of Mr
Johnstone, master of the <i>Chatham</i>, whose name the strait
still bears. Natives who had had dealings with the Europeans at
Nootka were at last met with, and, in spite of the dangers of the
navigation, which placed both ships temporarily in a perilous
position, both in turn running on the rocks, Queen Charlotte
Sound was safely reached, and the ocean sighted on August 9.
Vancouver's exhaustive surveys had proved that no channel leading
across to Hudson Bay could possibly exist in these latitudes.</p>
<p>The season was still early enough to permit of further work,
so the voyagers turned their attention to the coast to the north,
attempts being made, by the agency of boat parties, to trace the
inlets running inland from Fitzhugh Sound. But having met with a
trading vessel from Bengal, Vancouver learnt that the
<i>Daedalus</i> store ship had arrived at Nootka without her
commander&mdash;Lieutenant Hergest&mdash;who with the astronomer
Mr Green and a seaman had been murdered at Oahu, in the Sandwich
Islands.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Hearing also that Señor Quadra, the
Spanish commissioner, was awaiting his arrival, the English
commander decided to defer further surveys to the north until the
next year, and sailed for Nootka, where the two ships arrived on
August 28, 1792. A friendly intercourse was soon established
between Vancouver and Quadra, but in spite of protracted
negotiations it was found impossible to come to an agreement
respecting the manner in which the terms of the treaty were to be
carried out. It was therefore decided to refer the matter to the
home governments, Vancouver sending his first lieutenant home
with despatches, in which the state of affairs was explained to
his superiors in England. He himself remained at Nootka refitting
until October 12, when, with the <i>Chatham</i> and
<i>Daedalus</i>, the <i>Discovery</i> sailed south for the coast
of California. During his stay. Lieutenant Jacinto Caamano had
arrived from the north, where he had been surveying some of the
channels beyond the point reached by Vancouver, though he had
left much to be done by the latter when he returned to the task
in 1793.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The <i>Daedalus</i> had made the voyage
by the Falklands and Marquesas, to the north-west of which latter
group Lieutenant Hergest had discovered a small cluster of
islands to which his name was given.]</p>
<p>A piece of work which the English commander hoped to
accomplish during his southward voyage was the examination of the
river spoken of by the American, Robert Gray (who since meeting
with Vancouver early in the year had succeeded in entering its
mouth), as well as of the harbour reported to exist to the
northward of it. On reaching Cape Disappointment the
<i>Chatham</i> led the way into the mouth of the Columbia,
through the breakers which almost closed it; but, bad weather
threatening, it was quite impossible for the <i>Discovery</i> to
follow. Vancouver therefore continued his voyage to San
Francisco, while Lieutenant Broughton made his way for some
distance up the river. Leaving his ship at the mouth, he
proceeded with the boats, and by seven days' hard work against
the strong current reached a point 84 miles from the entrance,
sounding the various channels, and noting the characteristics of
the country and people, the latter proving very friendly. At and
near the farthest point reached, a fine snowy mountain was seen a
little south of east, and it received the name Mount
Hood&mdash;after the distinguished sailor, Lord Hood&mdash;which
it still bears.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The result of the
exploration was to show that the Columbia could hardly be
pronounced navigable by ships, and Broughton came to the
conclusion that Gray had not advanced more than 15 miles from
Cape Disappointment, his examination having been confined to the
outer bay into which the river proper debouches. Mr Whidbey, now
master of the <i>Daedalus</i>, had meanwhile been engaged in
examining Gray's harbour north of the Columbia, which he found to
be of little importance. The two ships now proceeded south, and
the whole expedition was once more united at Monterey about the
end of November.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Mount Hood, one of the highest summits
of the Cascade range, has a height of over 12,000 feet.]</p>
<p>After staying at Monterey until the middle of January,
Vancouver sailed for the Sandwich Islands, leaving Lieutenant
Broughton to proceed to Europe with despatches, and giving the
command of the <i>Chatham</i> to Mr Puget. A search made <i>en
route</i> for islands laid down in the Spanish charts between 19°
and 21° N., 135° and 139° W., proved their non-existence, while
during the stay in the Sandwich group some surveys were effected.
On March 30, 1793, the expedition sailed once more for the
American coast, to resume the survey where it had been broken off
the previous autumn. The intricacies of the coast made the task
an arduous one, but it was carried out with the usual
thoroughness, and by the close of the summer the various channels
and inlets as far north as 56° 44' had been carefully examined
either by Vancouver or by his officers, Messrs Whidbey and
Johnstone in particular taking a large share in the work. The
farthest point reached on the open ocean was that on the western
side of the entrance to Clarence Strait, and this received the
name Cape Decision, as up to it the extent of the possible
navigation towards the interior of the continent had once for all
been decided. Other names, among many, applied during this
season's work were Chatham Sound, Portland Canal, Prince of Wales
Archipelago, and Observatory Inlet, while some at least of the
Spanish names bestowed the previous year by Caamano were
retained. Such was that of the Canal de Revilla Gigedo
(commemorating the Viceroy of New Spain); and in acknowledgment
of the help given to the expedition by his orders Vancouver
extended the name to the large island on its northern side.</p>
<p>While returning south, Vancouver paid special attention to the
examination of the external coast-line, particularly that of the
Queen Charlotte group, which, he had reason to think, had been
erroneously shown on the published charts. After coasting along
the precipitous western shores of this group, the ships passed
its southern extremity, Cape St James of Dixon, and, after some
delay from adverse weather, reached Nootka on October 5,
1793.</p>
<p>At Nootka, Vancouver stayed only long enough to effect some
necessary repairs, sailing on October 8 for the coast of
California, which he wished to examine to the south of the part
already visited. After touching at San Francisco, the ships
proceeded to Monterey, where they were joined by the
<i>Daedalus</i>, returned from a voyage to New South Wales. At
Monterey their reception was far from cordial, so Vancouver
decided to refresh once more at the Sandwich Islands, first
continuing his voyage along the American coast, which he examined
as far as San Diego. While at the Sandwich Islands he made use of
the opportunity of completing the survey of such parts as had not
already been accurately mapped, while friendly negotiations with
Tamaahmaah, the most influential native chief, resulted in the
declaration of a British Protectorate&mdash;a proceeding,
however, which led to no practical result.</p>
<p>On March 14, 1794, the <i>Discovery</i> and <i>Chatham</i>
sailed for a third summer's work on the American coast, the plan
being to begin the season's survey at Cook's River in the
north-west and work down the coast to the south-east, so as to
connect the new work with that of the previous year, which had
terminated at Cape Decision. During the passage the
<i>Chatham</i> fell behind, the <i>Discovery</i> reaching Cook's
River first, and beginning the survey independently. The weather
was still bitterly cold, and the ice and shoals in the sound
added to the difficulties of the work. For a time Vancouver
entertained the idea that the inlet would lead him far into the
interior, but after each of the several arms had been examined,
all alike proved to end more or less abruptly. During the survey,
friendly intercourse was kept up both with the natives and with
the Russians established on the shores of the sound, but the
latter proved so ignorant of geography that little information of
value could be obtained from them. Meanwhile Mr Puget, in the
<i>Chatham</i>, had also reached the inlet and had been carrying
out a part of the survey previously allotted to him, so that on
the meeting of the ships the full extent of the sound was
accurately known. In accordance with its true character, its name
was altered from Cook's River to Cook's Sound. Hence the ships
proceeded east to Prince William Sound, the shores of which were
in turn surveyed by boat parties, Messrs Whidbey and Johnstone as
usual taking a leading part in the work. Before leaving the
neighbourhood Vancouver sent on the <i>Chatham</i> to survey the
outer coast to the eastward, himself following a little
later.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to describe in detail the surveys by which
the rest of this intricate coast-line was accurately mapped down
to the point at which the work had ceased in 1793. On reaching
Port Mulgrave (Yakutat bay) Vancouver found that Puget had
finished the examination of the coast up to and including this
inlet, which was pronounced to be almost certainly identical with
the bay visited by Bering, whose name Vancouver therefore applied
to it; the supposed bay further west, called Bering Bay by Cook,
having proved non-existent.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> During the whole
voyage down the coast the majestic range of snowy mountains made
a great impression on the navigators, and Vancouver correctly
concluded that it formed a continuous barrier, precluding the
possibility of a water-passage into the interior of the
continent. On reaching Cross Sound, the northern entrance to the
labyrinth of channels partly explored in the previous seasons, Mr
Whidbey was once more sent on a boat expedition, which led him
north to the head of Lynn Canal (so named by Vancouver from his
birthplace in Norfolk), and south almost to Cape Decision,
reached in 1793. The work was rendered arduous by cold and wet
weather, and some of the natives also proved hostile. At the end
of a fortnight&mdash;the period for which the party had been
provisioned&mdash;it became imperative to return to the ship,
leaving some of the more eastern channels to be explored later.
The ships therefore sailed south along the outer coast as far as
Cape Ommaney, which forms with Cape Decision the southern
entrance to the waters lately explored, and had been examined and
named a few years previously by Colnett. A secure harbour was
found on the inner side of the island terminated by this cape,
and hence the last remaining inlets were surveyed by boat parties
under Whidbey and Johnstone. On effecting a fortunate meeting on
the conclusion of their work, these officers marked the
successful termination of the task by formally proclaiming
British sovereignty over all the coasts and islands
examined.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> Their return to the ships, some
time after the date to which the parties had been provisioned,
relieved Vancouver of much anxiety, and the happy occasion was
celebrated in fitting fashion by the whole of the crews.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The late Prof. G. Davidson, however,
who closely studied the question of the course sailed by Bering,
did not suppose that he visited Yakutat Bay.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> This did not avail, however, in the
sequel, to secure the more northern part of the coast region, now
part of Alaska, for Great Britain.]</p>
<p>The geographical work of the expedition was now accomplished.
With great determination and perseverance Vancouver had completed
perhaps the most arduous survey that it had fallen to any
navigator to undertake, and this in spite of serious ill health
during the latter part of the voyage. He now directed his course
to Nootka&mdash;still keeping an eye, <i>en route</i>, to the
improvement of the map, whenever possible&mdash;and on arrival
learnt of the death of his friend Quadra, and of the appointment,
as governor, of Brigadier-General José Alava, who had arrived
only the day before, but was still without the requisite
authority for the settlement of the pending questions. Vancouver
occupied the time until the middle of October in refitting the
ships, carrying out astronomical observations to serve as a check
on the recent survey, and in a visit to the chief Maquinna. He
then determined to sail southward, and after touching at Monterey
and one or two points off the coast of Lower California, made his
way to Chile by the Galapagos Islands, still putting additional
touches to his astronomical work. In May, 1795, the voyage was
resumed, Cape Horn being rounded (at some distance) in stormy
weather, and St Helena reached after a brief and ineffectual
search for the supposed Ilha Grande in 45° S. At St Helena the
day which had been gained during the eastward passage round the
world was dropped. War was now in progress between Great Britain
and France and Holland, and Vancouver was able to give some
slight assistance to the expedition then being organised against
the Cape. The <i>Chatham</i>, which had arrived late at St Helena
after a trying voyage, was sent with despatches to the coast of
Brazil and made her way home thence, while the <i>Discovery</i>
sailed direct in company with a convoy, reaching the Shannon in
safety on September 12, and the Thames on October 20, 1795. Only
one man of her crew had died of disease during the 4½ years the
voyage had lasted, though five had been lost by accident; while
the <i>Chatham</i> had lost not a single man during the same
period.</p>
<p>Vancouver did not long survive the completion of his important
task, but after writing the official narrative of the voyage,
died in May, 1798, at the early age of 40, while on a visit to
Richmond in Surrey, and was buried in Petersham Churchyard.</p>
<p>One more English voyage to the Northern Pacific, which may be
regarded as in some way an outcome of Vancouver's great
achievement, remains to be spoken of in this chapter. It was
carried out by Captain W.R. Broughton, who, as will be
remembered, had commanded the <i>Chatham</i> during the early
part of Vancouver's voyage, and had only relinquished his post in
order to carry home his leader's despatches. Anxious to further
distinguish himself, he applied for a new command, and was sent
out in the <i>Providence</i> sloop to complete the outline of the
North Pacific coasts by surveys on the Asiatic side, where much
remained to be done in spite of the good work performed by La
Pérouse. His first lieutenant was Zachary Mudge, who had also
been with Vancouver. The <i>Providence</i>, which had lately
returned from a voyage to the West Indies under Captain Bligh
(see p. 314, <i>infra</i>), was fitted out with every requisite,
and sailed from Plymouth Sound in February, 1795, in company, at
starting, with a convoy of merchantmen.</p>
<p>After touching at Rio, Broughton decided to take the eastward
route <i>viâ</i> Van Diemen's Land and New Holland. He
endeavoured, on the way, to fix the position of Gough Island in
the South Atlantic, but was hindered by bad weather. Nootka Sound
having been reached by way of Tahiti and the Sandwich Islands on
March 17, 1796, intelligence was obtained of Vancouver's
departure for England more than 15 months before. At length,
early in August, 1796, Broughton sailed from the Sandwich Islands
for Japan to begin the serious part of his task. His plan was to
keep to the latitude of 28½° N., thereby crossing an unvisited
part of the ocean, but though a look-out was kept for reported
islands, none was discovered. After losing her sails in a gale,
the <i>Providence</i> sighted Japan on September 7, a little
south of the strait between the main island and Yezo, called by
Broughton the Straits of Matsmai or Sangaar (Tsugaru), the name
Insu being applied by him to Yezo. The outline and true character
of this island was still largely a matter of conjecture, though,
apart from the Dutch voyage of Vries with the <i>Kastrikom</i>
and <i>Breskens</i> in the seventeenth century, its coasts had
been touched at various points both by La Pérouse and by the
Russian Spangberg earlier in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Crossing the entrance to the strait, Broughton examined
Volcano Bay on its northern side, coming across natives who were
found to be in strict subjection to the Japanese. He then
followed the east coast of Yezo and touched at several of the
Kuriles before turning south again, on the approach of winter, in
about 48° 50' N. Rough weather making it impossible to pass
through the Strait of Sangaar, he went south along the east coast
of Japan (getting a good view of Mount Fujiyama), and after
passing down the outer side of the Liu-kiu group, reached Macao
on December 13, 1796. During the 22 months' absence from England
only one man had so far been lost by sickness.</p>
<p>Some time was now spent in preparing for the resumption of
exploration towards the north in 1797, and a schooner was
purchased and made ready to accompany the <i>Providence</i>. A
new start was made in April, and after some delay Formosa was
passed and the vessels skirted the south-west portion of the
Liu-kiu group, keeping this time on the inner or northern side.
Several islands had been passed when, on May 17, the
<i>Providence</i> struck on a coral reef, and, the wind
freshening, the situation quickly became so serious that it was
necessary to take to the boats. All reached the schooner in
safety, though with the loss of everything they possessed. The
ship now became a total wreck and few stores could be saved, but
the condition of the crew was alleviated somewhat by the
ungrudging hospitality of the natives of Taipinsan Island. It was
now necessary to return to Macao for supplies to permit a
continuance of the voyage in the schooner. When the start was
once more made the season was so far advanced as to give no great
hopes of accomplishing much, and considering this and other
disadvantages, the amount that was done was most praiseworthy.
Running north along the outer coast of Nippon, the schooner
refitted at Endermo in Southern Yezo, and then passed through the
Strait of Sangaar to the town of Matsumai. Passing the western
entrance to La Pérouse Strait, Broughton coasted the island of
Sakhalin to nearly 52° N., but, like La Pérouse, turned south
without traversing the narrowest part of the strait between it
and the mainland, or reaching the mouth of the Amur. Returning
south, he followed the mainland coast, with few intermissions, to
the southern extremity of Korea, thus filling in some parts that
had been missed by La Pérouse. Few natives were seen until, after
approaching the island of Tsusima, the schooner crossed the
channel since known by Broughton's name to the port of Chosan on
the Korean coast, where some intercourse was had with the
inhabitants. After passing through a cluster of small islands
Quelpart was visited and its coasts partially examined. Hence the
schooner cruised westward, but was prevented by thick weather and
adverse winds from making the coast of China or Korea. Broughton
therefore gave up all attempt at further discovery and made his
way once more to Macao (November 27, 1797). He did not finally
reach England till February, 1799.</p>
<p>With the voyages described in this chapter, the period of
pioneer exploration in the Northern Pacific may be said to have
closed.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>
<h4>THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC, 1786-1800</h4>
<p><span class="a">While</span> the work of Cook had thus been
actively followed up in the Northern Pacific, it led to no less
immediate and important results in the southern parts of the same
ocean. Here, too, the objects in view were rather economic than
purely geographical, but in their prosecution fresh light was
incidentally shed on the seas and lands of that remote region. In
1786 a step destined to lead to the most far-reaching results was
taken in the decision of the British government to found a penal
settlement on the east coast of Australia; Botany Bay, one of the
points at which Cook and his companions had landed during the
first exploration of this coast, being selected as its site. The
command of the expedition equipped for this object was given to
Captain Arthur Phillip, an officer who had seen a good deal of
naval service during the late war with France, who sailed with a
small fleet of transports and store-ships, supported by two armed
vessels, in March, 1787. Among his subordinates, several of whom
did useful geographical work in the course of their duties, were
Captain John Hunter (who commanded the frigate <i>Sirius</i>),
Lieuts. Ball, King, and Shortland (the first in command of the
armed tender <i>Supply</i>), and Captains Marshall and Gilbert,
in charge of two of the transports. After touching at the
Canaries, Rio, and the Cape, Governor Phillip went forward in the
<i>Supply</i>, and sighted the coast of New South Wales on
January 3, 1788, Botany Bay being reached on the 18th. After the
whole fleet had arrived, an examination was made of the
neighbouring inlet of Port Jackson, which was found to possess
great advantages over Botany Bay, and was therefore chosen as the
site of the settlement. Among the many minor indentations of this
wonderful harbour the choice fell on one on the southern shore,
which received the name Sydney Cove, and on which arose in time
the city of Sydney. A thorough survey was made of the
ramifications of Port Jackson, and something was done as
opportunity offered to examine the region around, though no great
extent of country was covered by the earliest expeditions
undertaken with this object.</p>

<br>
<small>Governor Arthur Phillip.</small></p>
<br>
<p>The governor soon decided to form a subsidiary settlement on
Norfolk Island&mdash;a solitary point of land discovered by Cook
in the ocean to the east&mdash;with a view to the cultivation of
flax and other crops. He entrusted the founding of this
settlement to Lieutenant Philip Gidley King, who with a party of
marines and convicts was conveyed thither by Lieutenant Ball in
the <i>Supply</i>. The latter discovered <i>en route</i> the
small, but high and rocky, uninhabited island to which he gave
the name of Lord Howe. It was examined more carefully on the
return voyage. Meanwhile the transports had landed their stores,
and preparations began to be made for their departure. The first
to sail (May 5, 1788) was the <i>Lady Penrhyn</i>, Captain Lever,
which had on board Lieutenant Watts&mdash;an old officer of
Cook's&mdash;to whom we owe a short account of the voyage. An
easterly route was at first adopted, and it led to the discovery,
on May 31, of the small volcanic islands of Curtis and Macaulay
of the Kermadec group (so named a year or two later by
D'Entrecasteaux), a landing being effected on Macaulay&mdash;the
larger&mdash;in spite of the precipitous cliffs which surround
it. Before Tahiti could be reached scurvy had reduced the crew to
a nearly helpless condition, but the refreshments there obtained
soon improved matters. A friendly welcome was received from
Cook's old friends Otoo and Oedidee, but news was obtained of the
death of Omai. On the further voyage to Macao a low flat island
was discovered some distance north of the Society group, which
under the name Penrhyn still records the name of the ship. The
<i>Scarborough</i>, Captain Marshall, left Port Jackson only a
day later than the <i>Lady Penrhyn</i> (May 6, 1788), her
destination being likewise Macao. After touching at Lord Howe
Island, Marshall was joined by Captain Gilbert in the
<i>Charlotte</i>, and most of the voyage was made in company.
After passing Norfolk Island, and sighting a small rocky island
(Matthew's Island) in 22° 22' S., 170° 41' E., the voyagers
traversed the little-known part of the Pacific occupied by the
groups of small islands to which their names have since been
attached. A number of these islands, which were found to rise
abruptly out of a deep sea, were sighted and named, among them
Lord Mulgrave's Islands towards the south end of the Marshall
group. The natives were as a rule shy, and little intercourse was
had with them. Finally, after passing Saypan and Tinian in the
Ladrones, the ships reached Macao roads on September 7, 1788.</p>
<p>Early in July four of the transports were got ready to return
to England, Lieutenant John Shortland, who had sailed as agent
for the transports, being placed in command of the
<i>Alexander</i>, and entrusted with despatches for the Home
government. Only one of the other ships&mdash;the
<i>Friendship</i>&mdash;kept company with the <i>Alexander</i>,
these two making the voyage by a new route to the north of New
Guinea, which led to some geographical discoveries. The ships
were ill prepared for the difficulties of the voyage, having no
surgeon on board, nor any means of combating disease, which in
course of time played havoc with the crews. After passing and
naming Middleton Shoal, Shortland lighted on a high island with a
remarkable peak, which he named Sir Charles Middleton's Island.
Continuing to sail nearly due north, he sighted land on July 31,
and coasted along it to the north-west. It was a part of San
Cristobal, the most southerly of the main islands of the Solomon
Islands, the geography of which group was still very imperfectly
known. Shortland pursued his voyage along its southern border,
sighting land repeatedly and believing it to form one continuous
island, to which he gave the name New Georgia&mdash;a name still
retained for the central cluster of the southern chain of
islands, which had been till then practically unknown, and which
has been very imperfectly charted down to the present day. While
passing along the south coast of Guadalcanar he had sighted the
high peak, his name for which&mdash;Mount Lammas&mdash;is still
retained, as are also those given during this voyage to many of
the prominent headlands of the several islands. Shortland had
failed to find the passages between the more eastern islands,
supposing them to be merely lowlands intervening between the
higher lands visible, although at two points he had felt some
doubt as to the continuity of the land-mass. After passing the
westernmost of the New Georgia group&mdash;where friendly natives
were met with, who called their land Simbu&mdash;he was
successful in his endeavour to push north, making his way through
the strait between Choiseul and Bougainville Islands already
discovered by the French navigator Bougainville. While passing
through this strait, to which his name is sometimes given,
Shortland kept to the eastern side, but sighted the various small
islands which block its western half, giving them the name
Treasury Islands, though the largest (Alu), with its immediate
satellites, is now generally known as Shortland.</p>
<p>Misfortunes now began, scurvy making its appearance, and, in
the absence of fresh provisions and other remedies, running its
course unchecked. At the Pelew group a first attempt to obtain
supplies was unsuccessful, but the commander hesitated to delay
the voyage further, thus losing an opportunity which he had deep
cause to regret. The crews became more and more enfeebled, and
after the ships had narrowly escaped disaster among the reefs and
currents between Mindanao and Borneo it was found necessary to
evacuate and sink the <i>Friendship</i>. At Batavia help was
obtained from the Dutch, but on resuming the voyage only four of
the original crews were capable of duty. The <i>Alexander</i>
reached the Cape on February 18, 1789, and Shortland found
Captain Hunter there in the <i>Sirius</i>. He also learnt that
the two other transports had made the voyage by the southern
route, and had been heard of at Rio. England was finally reached
on May 28, 1789.</p>

<br>
<p>The voyages of Captain John Hunter, commander of the frigate
<i>Sirius</i>, also deserve mention. On October 2, 1788, he
sailed to the Cape for supplies by the Cape Horn route, making a
vain search on the way for the island of Diego Ramirez, supposed
to lie to the south-south-west of Cape Horn. Returning to Port
Jackson in 1789 he carried out surveys of Broken Bay, Botany Bay,
and other parts of the coast of New South Wales, also making a
voyage to Norfolk Island, where the <i>Sirius</i> was
unfortunately lost, early in 1790. On March 27, 1791, he sailed
for Batavia in the <i>Waaksamheyd</i> transport, taking, like
Shortland, a route to the north of New Guinea, which resulted in
some few gains to geography. After sighting the Isle of Pines, at
the south end of New Caledonia, and escaping with difficulty from
the dangerous reefs in its neighbourhood, he held on a course
calculated to take him to the east of the Solomon Islands,
between these and the Queen Charlotte group. No trace of the
latter could be seen, and Hunter concluded that it must lie
further east than had been shown on the charts. On May 10, in 8°
27' S., 163° 18' E. according to his observations, he came upon
five small islands, well covered with trees, which he named
Stewart's Islands, correctly judging by their position that they
must be distinct from Carteret's Islands, though in the same
latitude. On May 14 an archipelago of small islands was reached,
32 being visible from the masthead. The natives had canoes with
triangular sails. This group, along the southern side of which
Hunter sailed, received the name of Lord Howe&mdash;an instance
of the inconvenient way in which names were duplicated by the
sailors of this period, the island between Australia and Norfolk
Island having received the same name only three years before. It
was the same group as that named Ontong Java by Tasman. Passing
other islands, probably identical with some of those seen by
Carteret, Shortland and others. Hunter approached New Ireland,
and, after many difficulties caused by calms and currents, landed
at Duke of York's Island for the purpose of obtaining water. An
attack by the natives was followed by a reconciliation, and after
passing the Admiralty group and a double island to which Hunter
gave the name of his chief (Phillip Island), the voyage was
continued through the Malay Archipelago, Batavia being reached on
September 27, 1791. Thence, after purchasing the
<i>Waaksamheyd</i> from the Dutch authorities. Hunter continued
the voyage to England, which was reached on April 22, 1792.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the voyage to Batavia had also been made by
Lieutenant Ball, in the <i>Supply</i>; Lieutenant King, who had
been ordered to return to England with despatches, taking passage
with him so far. During the voyage, which was begun in April,
1790, Ball was able to add a few additional features to the
chart. A shoal was found in 21° 24' S., and was named Booby
Shoal, from the stupidity of the look-out man in taking it for
the reflection of the setting sun, though bearing east. On May 3,
when nearing the position in which Shortland had found land,
birds and floating trees were seen, and on the morning of the 5th
land was sighted stretching from north-north-west to
west-north-west. It proved to be the eastern part of the Solomon
group, and a small island at its extremity was named Sirius
Island. The land, which was high and well wooded, was kept in
view for several days, but at a distance too great to allow the
several islands to be distinguished. Like Shortland, who had
followed a parallel route on the south-west side of the group,
Ball seems to have regarded the land seen as forming one
continuous mass, to the north-east coast of which he gave the
name Ball's Maiden Land. On the 19th an inhabited island (Tench's
Island) was met with in 1° 39' S., 150° 31' E. The naked,
copper-coloured natives were remarkably stout and healthy. A
little later another island was reached, and it was named, at
King's suggestion, Prince William Henry Island, after the third
son of George III (afterwards William IV), though better known by
Dampier's name, St Matthias. A high mountain in its centre
received the name Mount Phillip. The voyage through the
Archipelago led past the islands of Karkelang and Karkarolang,
through the passage between Gilolo and Celebes and the Strait of
Salayer, and so to Batavia. Here King secured a passage home in
the Dutch ship <i>Snellheid</i>, but his experiences were far
from pleasant, a malignant fever breaking out among the crew and
causing many deaths. Ball sailed home by the Cape Horn route in
November, 1791, having on board a live kangaroo&mdash;the first
which any navigator had attempted to take to England. The voyage
was more fortunate than others, being finished in a shorter time
than any yet made by the Cape Horn route; but it did not result
in any new discoveries.</p>
<p>These various voyages, though not individually of the first
importance from the geographical point of view, had, in the
aggregate, results far from insignificant. Of these, the traverse
by Marshall and Gilbert of the hitherto almost unknown portion of
Micronesia which now bears their names, and the additions to the
knowledge of the Solomon group made by Shortland, were no doubt
the most important.</p>
<p>Voyages to the South Seas now followed in such quick
succession that many of them can be only briefly mentioned.
Another project of the British government which, though of minor
importance, led incidentally to the addition of various small
islands to the map, was that of the introduction of the
bread-fruit tree into the West Indian colonies. Three separate
voyages were made in connection with this scheme, and they were
to a large extent simultaneous with the Australian voyages above
described. At the instance of various merchants and planters
interested in the British West Indian Islands, a ship was fitted
out during the latter half of 1787, Sir Joseph Banks warmly
aiding with his experienced advice. It was named the
<i>Bounty</i>, and placed under the command of Lieutenant William
Bligh, another of Cook's old officers, who in course of time
acquired a good deal of notoriety in connection with the
settlement of New South Wales. He was an energetic and capable
officer, but somewhat overbearing and not always happy in his
relations with his subordinates. This first voyage for the
transport of the breadfruit tree was notable chiefly for the
mutiny among the crew, which frustrated its object and entailed
some harrowing experiences on the commander and those who stood
by him. The voyage was to have been made by the Cape Horn route,
but the tempestuous weather experienced in the neighbourhood of
that cape determined Bligh to bear away for the Cape of Good
Hope, whence the voyage to Tahiti was completed by way of St Paul
Island (in the Indian Ocean) and Van Diemen's Land. Beyond the
latter the <i>Bounty</i> took the route to the south of New
Zealand, lighting upon the group of islets and rocks which have
since borne the ship's name.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><a name="Image46" id="Image46"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>Captain William Bligh.</small></p>
<br>
<p>A long stay was made at Tahiti and a large number of
breadfruit trees were procured, after which, in accordance with
Bligh's instructions, the <i>Bounty</i> sailed for Java. In the
north of the Cook or Hervey group the island of Aitutaki was
discovered, but though the natives were friendly no stay was
made, as Bligh had decided to put in for refreshments at Anamuka
in the Friendly group. It was shortly after leaving the latter
island that the mutiny broke out, without the least warning, the
ringleader being Fletcher Christian, one of the master's mates.
Its main motive seems to have been the desire to enjoy a life of
ease in one of the island paradises of the South
Seas.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Bligh and 18 others (including the
master, surgeon, gunner, boatswain, etc.) were cast adrift in the
small ship's launch, with no firearms and but a scanty stock of
provisions and water. In this over-laden boat, the unfortunate
men made the long and dangerous voyage to Timor in the
archipelago, suffering intensely from hunger and thirst. At
Tofoa, the first island touched at, they narrowly escaped
disaster from a treacherous attack by the natives. Steering
without the aid of a chart, they passed various islands in the
Fiji group and northern New Hebrides, and at last made the coast
of New Holland, by good fortune finding a passage through the
Great Barrier Reef in about 13° S. A small island off the coast
was named Restoration Island, in allusion both to the date (May
29, 1789) and to the encouragement offered by their progress so
far on their journey. Some small relief in the form of oysters,
boobies, etc., was obtained during the six days' coasting voyage
which followed, and Torres Strait was successfully passed by the
channel north of Prince of Wales Island. In spite of increasing
weakness from the hardships and starvation undergone, the
voyagers sighted Timor on June 12, 41 days after leaving Tofoa,
having covered a distance of over 3600 miles. That this was
accomplished without the loss of a fife is a striking proof of
Bligh's resource and determination. At the Dutch settlement of
Kupang they were received with great humanity, and Bligh was able
to purchase a small schooner in which the voyage to Batavia, and
eventually to England, was successfully carried out. Several of
the party succumbed, however, after Kupang had been reached,
among them Mr Nelson, the botanist, who had taken part in Cook's
last voyage, and while in the <i>Bounty</i> had devoted
unremitting attention to the object of the enterprise.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The mutineers, or some of them, settled
at Pitcairn Island; which is still peopled by their
descendants.]</p>
<p>An indirect result of the same scheme as had occasioned the
despatch of the <i>Bounty</i> was the voyage of the
<i>Pandora</i>, Captain Edwards, in 1790-92. This was undertaken
partly with a view to bringing the mutineers to justice, and
partly for the purpose of effecting a survey of Endeavour Strait,
between the northern point of Queensland and Prince of Wales
Island, in the interest of navigation to Botany Bay. It likewise
proved unfortunate, though some discoveries were made. Cape Horn
was successfully passed, and after sighting Easter Island on
March 4, 1791, Edwards discovered some small islands in the Low
Archipelago, which were named respectively Ducie, Lord Hood, and
Carysfort. The two latter have been identified with those known
by the native names of Marutea and Tureia.</p>
<p>After a considerable stay at Tahiti, during which some of the
mutineers were captured, the <i>Pandora</i> resumed the voyage in
the direction of Endeavour Strait, touching at other islands of
the Society group and making a search for traces of the
<i>Bounty's</i> men at Aitutaki (May 19) and the Palmerston
Islands (May 22). At the latter the jolly-boat and her crew were
lost, and all search proved unavailing. In his further search for
the missing mutineers, Edwards now cruised over a considerable
extent of latitude, geography thus benefiting by the discovery of
several new islands. Steering at first north-west, he lighted
(June 6) on one of the islands of the Tokelau or Union group,
which he named Duke of York Island, though it seems to have been
identical with Atafu, discovered by Byron in 1765. Turning south
he next touched at Nukunono, which he named Duke of Clarence
Island, and passing rapidly through the Samoa or Navigators'
Islands made his way to Namuka in the Friendly group. Further
cruises took the <i>Pandora</i> north, past various northern
islands of this same archipelago, to Tutuila of the Samoan group
(where the ship's tender unfortunately parted company and could
not be found in spite of a careful search), and south as far as
Pylstaart in 22°23'S.</p>
<p>Resuming his voyage to the west, Edwards discovered Onooafow
(Niuafu), which he named Proby's Island, and after touching at
Wallis Island, in 13° 22' S., 176° 15' 45" W., came upon the
hitherto undiscovered island of Rotumah, which he christened
Grenville, though the native name has since held its own. It was
well peopled and the hills were cultivated to the top, but the
inhabitants, who were perfectly ignorant of firearms, showed some
inclination to hostility, and were great thieves. They are
described as uncommonly athletic and strong. A dangerous coral
reef in 171° 52' E. received the name of the ship, while a little
further to the north-west the islands of Fataka and Anuda were
discovered, and named respectively Mitre and Cherry&mdash;the
latter after the Commissioner of the Victualling Office, in
gratitude for the various luxuries provided by him. Another
island, to which the name Pitt was applied, seems to have been
Vanikoro in the Santa Cruz group, the scene of the shipwreck of
La Pérouse, though, as no landing was effected, no light was
thrown on this still mysterious catastrophe. Having reached the
dangerous neighbourhood of Endeavour and Torres Straits, the
<i>Pandora</i> became involved in the reefs, and, striking, at
once began to fill rapidly. A night of intense anxiety was spent,
and the ship went down about dawn, a number of the crew being
drowned. The rest saved themselves in the boats, and, after
sufferings fully equalling those of Bligh and his men, though
somewhat less prolonged, made their way to Timor, where, like
their predecessors, they received a warm welcome from the Dutch
at Kupang. On reaching Samarang in Java, they had the
satisfaction of finding their tender, which had been navigated by
the young officer in command, Mr Oliver. The sufferings of her
crew had, if possible, exceeded those of the wrecked crew of the
<i>Pandora</i>, and it had been necessary, in the absence of a
passage, to beat the boat over the reefs in Torres Strait.
Meeting with a small Dutch vessel, they were at first taken for
the mutineers of the <i>Bounty</i>, and were sent under escort to
Samarang, where their true character was satisfactorily
established. The survivors of the expedition eventually took
passage to Holland, and the Cape, afterwards crossing over to
England, where three of the captured mutineers were executed.</p>
<p>In 1791-92 Bligh made his way once more to the Pacific in the
<i>Providence</i> sloop, accompanied by a second vessel, the
<i>Assistant</i>. He succeeded in conveying a supply of
bread-fruit trees to the West Indies, but the voyage was not
important from the point of view of discovery. Perhaps the most
noteworthy performance in this respect was the survey carried out
on the eastern coast of Tasmania just two months before the first
visit of the French navigator next to be spoken of. A MS. chart
by Lieutenant Bond, one of Bligh's officers, shows that a part at
least of the enclosed waters of D'Entrecasteaux Strait was
reconnoitred on this occasion.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>

XXXVIII., 1911, p. 582, with reproduction of Bond's chart.]</p>
<br>
<p>Simultaneously with these English enterprises, the French
expedition under Bruni d'Entrecasteaux was busy in the Western
Pacific, though with no political aims. As has already been
mentioned, its main object was the search for the missing
expedition of La Pérouse, whose mysterious disappearance had now
given rise to serious concern for his safety. Two ships, named
the <i>Recherche</i> and <i>Espérance</i> in reference to the
objects of the voyage, were placed at the disposal of
D'Entrecasteaux, who sailed from Brest on September 28, 1791. The
<i>Espérance</i> was commanded by Huon de Kermadec&mdash;who is
doubly commemorated in the nomenclature of the South
Seas&mdash;and various scientific experts also took part in the
voyage, among them being the naturalist Labillardière, who
eventually wrote a narrative of the voyage, and the hydrographers
Rossel and Beautemps-Beaupré, who were concerned respectively
with the publication of D'Entrecasteaux's own journal after his
unfortunate death, and of the charts of the coasts visited.</p>
<p>On October 13 the ships reached Santa Cruz in Tenerife, some
of the naturalists making the ascent of the peak during their
stay. The Cape was reached in January, 1792, and here information
was obtained to the effect that Capt. Hunter, in his voyage to
Batavia after the loss of the <i>Sirius</i>, had seen uniforms of
French officers at the Admiralty Islands, north of New Guinea, to
which group it was therefore decided to direct the ship's course.
The voyage across the Indian Ocean commenced on February 16, but
progress was so slow that it became evident that the proposed
destination could not be reached by the route to the north of New
Holland, and a course was therefore steered for Van Diemen's Land
(the modern Tasmania). This course led the ships between the
islands of Amsterdam and St Paul, which, as mentioned already,
Vancouver had missed on his outward voyage in 1791; the position
of the former being determined with a close approach to accuracy.
After a passage of 64 days from the Cape the ships reached Van
Diemen's Land on April 21, putting by mistake into a bay to the
west of Adventure Bay, which seems to have been wrongly
identified with the Storm Bay of Tasman.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> In
it an excellent anchorage was discovered, to which the name Port
D'Entrecasteaux was given. Here a stay of some length was made,
the naturalists employing the time to advantage by excursions
into the country. The enormous size of the gum trees (Eucalyptus)
made a great impression, and specimens of the black swan and
kangaroo were seen and some natives encountered. Surveys of the
coasts revealed the existence of a strait leading east, and
affording an interior passage towards Adventure Bay, and this was
successfully navigated by the ships. It, too, received the name
of the commander, who was also commemorated in the name Bruni
given to the island which it separates from the mainland.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> In the charts accompanying the official
narrative of the voyage, published some years later, the name
Storm Bay is rightly assigned to the large bay east of Adventure
Bay.]</p>
<p>Having once more reached the open sea, the voyagers quickly
rounded Cape Pillar, and shaped a course for New Caledonia. This
island was sighted on June 16. Its south-west coast had not been
surveyed, Cook on his second voyage having confined his
examination to the opposite side. Like Hunter in the previous
year (see p. 306) D'Entrecasteaux and his comrades with
difficulty surmounted the dangers of navigation among the reefs
which fringe the coast, and which became still more formidable
towards the north. The examination of this side of the island was
nevertheless successfully carried out, its general form being
thus laid down with fair accuracy. The chain of mountains which
form its backbone were reckoned to extend about 80 nautical
leagues from south-east to north-west. Still hampered by reefs
and sighting various small islands, the voyagers approached the
strait between Choiseul and Bougainville of the Solomon group,
but after passing near the Eddystone rock and Treasury Islands of
Shortland held on a course to the south of Bougainville, which
was now examined for the first time on this side, as was also the
neighbouring island of Buka. Passing through St George's Channel
between New Britain and New Ireland, and putting in at Carteret's
Harbour, they eventually reached the Admiralty group, which was
examined without yielding any traces of the missing voyagers. The
natives proved friendly, though here as elsewhere much caution
was observed by the visitors. The Hermit and Échiquier groups
were next visited, and after sailing along the north coast of New
Guinea, the expedition made its way to Amboina to replenish
supplies.</p>
<p>After more than a month's stay at Amboina, the productions of
which were examined by the naturalists, D'Entrecasteaux once more
set sail, making a circuit to the west and south so as to strike
the coast of New Holland near its south-west point. The voyage
along this coast was to some extent a repetition of that of
Vancouver in 1791, but it extended farther to the east, though
not sufficiently far to clear up the question of the separation
of Van Diemen's Land from New Holland. The ships took refuge from
a storm in an anchorage discovered by Legrand, whose name was
given to it. Excursions were made on the land and its botany and
zoology studied. The roadstead was in the neighbourhood of the
archipelago of small islands at which the Dutch discoveries of
Pieter Nuyts had terminated, and the French voyagers were
surprised to find how accurately that navigator had determined
his latitudes on this coast. During a visit to the mainland, one
of the naturalists&mdash;Riche by name&mdash;lost his way and
wandered almost without food for more than two days, the search
made by his companions being almost abandoned as hopeless.</p>
<p>In their efforts to advance eastward the voyagers were much
hindered by easterly winds, and on January 5, 1793, the
water-supply having fallen very low, it was decided not to
attempt to trace the coast further, but to steer once more for
the southern part of Van Diemen's Land. The longitude reached,
according to the observations made, was 129° 10' east of Paris,
or 131° 30' east of Greenwich. The strength of the current
flowing west along the coast led D'Entrecasteaux to conjecture
that a channel existed between Van Diemen's Land and New Holland,
as was proved to be the case a few years later. On reaching Van
Diemen's Land the mountains were found to be much less covered
with snow than on the previous visit. An anchorage was found in a
bay which received the name Bay of Rocks, and here the ships
stayed some time, the voyagers entering into friendly relations
with the inhabitants, who, in spite of the coolness of the
weather, were almost entirely unclothed. An interesting account
of their manners and customs is given by Labillardière. Coal was
observed to exist in the neighbouring country. On February 15,
the ships set sail in order to pass through D'Entrecasteaux
Strait into Adventure Bay, which latter was left on March 1.
Passing near the north end of New Zealand, D'Entrecasteaux
steered for Tongatabu, discovering several small islands on the
way. From the Friendly Islands, where the ships stayed till
April, the course was due west to the northern part of New
Caledonia. Several of the southern islands of the New Hebrides
were sighted <i>en route</i>, and while passing Tanna, pillars of
smoke were seen to issue from its volcano, illumined at night by
the incandescent matter within the crater.</p>
<p>Some stay was made at New Caledonia, and advantage was taken
of this opportunity of making some exploration of the interior of
the island, excursions being made into the mountains and a view
obtained on one occasion of the sea on the opposite or
south-western side. The natives were on the whole friendly,
though some collisions occurred and unmistakable signs of their
cannibalism were seen. No traces of La Pérouse could be found,
nor were the natives in possession of any of the objects
presented by Cook, though a trace of his visit was seen in the
form of the rusty base of an iron candlestick. Before leaving the
island, the expedition had the misfortune to lose the Captain of
the <i>Esperance</i>, Huon de Kermadec, who was buried on shore,
his place being filled by the promotion of Lieut. Dauribeau of
the <i>Recherche</i>.</p>
<p>The ships now sailed nearly north to Santa Cruz, where they
met with some hostility on the part of the natives. On May 22,
the Volcano Island of Carteret was sighted, but no signs of
activity were noticed. Once more steering west, the easternmost
of the Solomon group was soon sighted, and after coasting along
the small group of the Three Sisters, the ships passed between
San Cristobal and Guadalcanar, passing along the south side of
the last-named and of New Georgia, and then steering for the
Louisiades of Bougainville. This part of the voyage&mdash;through
the labyrinth of islands east of the east end of New
Guinea&mdash;was perhaps the most important of all, for this area
had been but imperfectly known as a result of Bougainville's
voyage, and many new islands were brought to light, the names of
several of the officers (Rossel, Joannet, Renard, St Aignan,
Trobriand) being still found on our maps as alternative names for
islands now sighted, while the group of larger islands nearest to
New Guinea bears the name of D'Entrecasteaux himself. The ships
were frequently in danger from the many reefs of those seas, but
a passage was always found in the end. On May 25, the coast of
New Guinea itself was made, and the deep bay which has since
borne the name of Huon Gulf in honour of the deceased Captain of
the <i>Espérance</i> was entered for the first time. It was
bounded, especially to the north, by high mountains, terminating
in the Cape King William of Dampier, the western portal of
Dampier Strait. Through the eastern branch of this the French
voyagers now passed, as had the English navigator to whom it owes
its name. But instead of at once taking a westerly course
parallel to the north coast of New Guinea, D'Entrecasteaux sailed
east along the north coast of New Britain, the approximate form
of which he was thus the first to lay down. He did not, however,
keep near enough to the land to trace all the indentations of the
coast, and left it uncertain whether the group of peaks lying to
the north of the main mass were islands or portions of a
peninsula&mdash;an uncertainty which was not cleared up until a
century later. Having reached the north-eastern extremity of the
island he steered west for the archipelago, but on August 21 died
after only two days' illness, leaving the command to Dauribeau,
who, as already mentioned, had been lately made Captain of the
<i>Espérance</i>. D'Entrecasteaux had shown himself an energetic
and capable commander, and his loss was seriously felt by the
survivors. Disease now began to spread among the crews, who were
much weakened by it before reaching Java. On arriving at Surabaya
in October, 1793, war was found to have broken out between France
and Holland, and several prominent members of the expedition were
made prisoners of war, Dauribeau having apparently secured
favourable terms for himself at the expense of his companions. He
died soon after his arrival at Samarang, and after long delays
the prisoners (among whom was Labillardière) found their way in
1795 to Mauritius, and thence, a year later, to France.</p>
<p>Although without result as regards the search for La Pérouse,
the expedition had made some useful additions to geographical
knowledge, and the researches of the naturalists into the
little-known productions of the countries visited were of special
value. Labillardière's collections, which had been seized and
taken to England, were restored to him through the good offices
of Sir Joseph Banks.</p>
<p>A voyage which corresponded very closely with the latter part
of this of D'Entrecasteaux was that of Captain, afterwards
Commodore Sir John, Hayes of the Bombay Marine, who, obtaining
leave of absence, persuaded some Calcutta merchants to join him
in a venture for the purpose of bringing back nutmegs and other
spices from the western parts of New Guinea, thus repeating the
project of Captain Forrest, spoken of in Chapter IX. Sailing from
Calcutta on February 6, 1793, with two ships&mdash;the <i>Duke of
Clarence</i> and the <i>Duchess</i>&mdash;Hayes found the winds
unfavourable for the direct voyage to New Guinea, and he
therefore decided, after reaching Timor, to proceed first to
Tasmania and thus approach his destination from the east after a
wide circuit through the Western Pacific. He was on the Tasmanian
coast only a couple of months after D'Entrecasteaux's second
visit, of which he was completely ignorant, and his surveys there
had been anticipated by the French Admiral as well as by Bligh.
The further voyage also led him more or less in the tracks of
D'Entrecasteaux. He visited New Caledonia, and ventured closer to
land than his predecessor among the dangerous reefs which fringe
the south-west coast. Thence he sailed north-west, and reached
the Louisiade Archipelago, cruising in various directions among
these islands. Here he seems to have been in advance of his
French rival, and was the first white man to land on Rossel
Island, which D'Entrecasteaux merely named in passing. Reaching
the scene of the proposed commercial enterprise, he found the
nutmeg and other spice-producing trees growing as he had
expected, and he built a fort on which he hoisted the British
flag, taking possession of the country under the name New Albion.
He then sailed for Calcutta, but failing to obtain support, was
obliged to abandon the scheme. The journal which he kept during
the voyage was never published, though it still exists in
manuscript.</p>
<br>
<p>Voyages to the Pacific had now become a matter of yearly
occurrence, and although small islands, previously unvisited,
continued to be brought to light, the discoveries were not of
sufficient importance to call for a description of each separate
voyage. A few of those to which the discovery and naming of such
islands were due may, however, be briefly mentioned. In 1793,
Capt. James Mortlock added to the map the small group in the
Caroline Archipelago which still bears his name. Captain Butler,
who made several voyages between 1794 and 1803, lighted upon one
of the islands of the Loyalty group, which had not been seen by
Cook at the time of the discovery of New Caledonia, as well as
one or two others in other parts of the Pacific. Captain Fearn
(in the <i>Hunter</i>), and the American Captain Fanning, also
made some new discoveries, including the small islands which now
commemorate their names. In 1796, Captain Wilson, who had already
had considerable experience of Pacific navigation, was sent out
in the <i>Duff</i> on behalf of a newly-formed missionary
society, which had chosen as its field of action Tahiti, the
Friendly Islands, Marquesas, Sandwich Islands, and others. In
1797, the <i>Duff</i> reached Tahiti by a route south of Van
Diemen's Land and New Zealand, afterwards making several cruises,
in the course of which she visited the Marquesas, traversed the
Low Archipelago, and from Tongatabu made the voyage to Canton
through the Fiji and Caroline groups. Some results were gained in
the way of a more precise knowledge of some of the islands
visited, especially in the eastern part of the Fiji group, of
which, as of the island of Tongatabu, Captain Wilson gave a chart
in his published narrative. Although not entirely a new
discovery, the small Duff group, to the north of the Santa Cruz
Islands, has its name from Wilson's ship.</p>
<p>By the close of the eighteenth century the general outlines of
Pacific geography had at last been completed, the last four
decades of the century having yielded greater results than the
whole time which had previously elapsed since the first track
across that ocean had been drawn by Magellan. Future work, in the
performance of which such navigators as Lütke, D'Urville,
Krusenstern, Wilkes, and others did useful service, consisted
chiefly in the filling in of small details. The island continent
of Australia was now to form the principal field for pioneering
work in the southern hemisphere.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>
<h4>THE FRENCH AND BRITISH IN NORTH AMERICA, 1700-1800</h4>
<p align="center">I. <i>The Great North-west</i>.</p>
<p><span class="a">We</span> have seen in a former chapter how,
under the energetic leadership of men like Champlain and La
Salle, the French adventurers in Canada had, during the
seventeenth century, pushed steadily westward until the whole
region of the Great Lakes, with a large stretch of country to the
south, had been brought within their sphere of action; Jesuit
missionaries having likewise played no inconsiderable part in the
work of exploration. Farther north the still earlier voyages,
principally English, to Hudson Bay had revealed the whole outline
of that interior sea, though practically no progress had been
made towards a knowledge of the vast regions lying inland from
its shores. We have now to take up the story and show how, in the
course of the eighteenth century, the westward advance was
continued until, in the closing years of the century, the boldest
pioneers had succeeded in reaching the long-desired goal of the
western sea. During the first half of the century the French
still bore the burden of the day, the chief advance being
effected in the more southern zone, due west from Lake Superior,
towards which restless spirits like Greysolon, Sieur Du Lhut (or
Du Luth), had begun to push their enterprises, even before the
close of the seventeenth century. Some few attempts were made
from the northern base on Hudson Bay, by agents of the Hudson Bay
Company, but these remained more or less isolated episodes until,
after the middle of the century, the competition of their
southern rivals showed the company the need of more energetic
action. With the transfer of Canada to the English as a result of
Wolfe's victorious campaign, the French pioneers disappeared from
the scene, and both in the north and south the work was carried
on by men of British origin, though displaying for a time a still
keener rivalry among themselves than had been maintained between
the French and English at an earlier date.</p>
<p>We must go back to the eighties of the seventeenth century for
the first beginnings of an advance into the unknown region west
of Lake Superior. The Kaministikwia River, which enters that lake
on its north-west shore, and at the mouth of which Du Lhut had
built a fort, was ascended about 1688 by Jacques de Noyon, who
reached the "lake of the Cristinaux", since known as Rainy Lake,
and wintered at the mouth of the Uchichig or Rainy River, which
enters the lake at its western end. His farther route is somewhat
obscure, but he seems to have gone by the Rainy River to the Lake
of the Woods, which he knew by the names Lac des Assiniboiles
(Assiniboines) or Lac aux lies. It has been held that the Lac des
Cristinaux was really the Lake of the Woods, and the farthest
lake reached, Winnipeg, but for this belief there hardly seem
sufficient grounds. After this, little was done until the second
decade of the next century, when, in 1716, the governor De
Vaudreuil and the Intendant Begon drew up a report suggesting
steps for western discovery. As a result, Lieutenant Zachary de
la Noue was sent in 1717 to establish a post on the Kaministikwia
River, which he did, possibly also founding a post on Rainy Lake.
In 1718, a detailed memoir was drawn up by Father Bobé, in which
various possible routes to the west were discussed. Although
containing some judicious remarks, many of the ideas put forward
in this memoir were quite the reverse. Bobé greatly
under-estimated the difficulties to be encountered in the
exploration of a route to the Western Ocean, which he thought
could be reached with comparative ease. A few years later the
historian Charlevoix was sent to make enquiries on the spot, and
he also put down his conclusions in a report to the Government.
He suggested two possible courses, one to push west by way of the
Upper Missouri, the other to establish a mission amongst the
Sioux as a base for a farther advance. Though he was himself
inclined to favour the first of these plans, the second was
adopted, as involving a smaller amount of trouble and expense.
With this object, an expedition went, in 1727, across Lake
Michigan to Green Bay and by the Fox and Wisconsin rivers to the
Missouri, but it was without result as regards western
discovery.</p>
<p>About this time, however, there came on the scene a pioneer
worthy to be ranked with a La Salle for his whole-hearted
devotion to the cause of discovery. This was Pierre Gaultier de
Varennes, Sieur de la Vérendrye, generally known to posterity by
the last name. Born at Three Rivers in 1685, he went to Europe in
search of a more active career than offered itself in Canada,
and, entering the French army, fought and was wounded at the
battle of Malplaquet. Returning to Canada, he took to the
adventurous life of a "courreur des bois", and in 1726 we find
him in command of the trading post of Nipigon, on the northern
shore of Lake Superior. His thoughts were turned towards western
discovery by the reports of an Indian chief, Ochagach by name,
who came from Kaministikwia with accounts of a great water that
ebbed and flowed, and which La Vérendrye was sanguine enough to
take for the Western Ocean, though if the report had any
foundation it probably referred to Lake Winnipeg, whose waters
have been known to rise and fall locally under the influence of
the wind. Fired with the ambition of making his way to this sea,
La Vérendrye went to Quebec and submitted a scheme for western
discovery to the governor, the Marquis Le Beauharnois. Although
personally favourable, all the support the governor could obtain
for the would-be explorer was the grant of a trading monopoly,
armed with which the latter succeeded in persuading certain
merchants of Montreal to supply funds for the venture, and
returned to his post to make preparations.</p>
<p>It was in the summer of 1731, that, accompanied by his nephew
De la Jemeraye and three of his sons, La Vérendrye started from
Grand Portage at the mouth of the Pigeon River, near the west end
of Lake Superior, for a first advance westward. In this year he
reached Rainy Lake, and after building Fort St Pierre at the
Rainy River exit, returned to winter at Kaministikwia. In June,
1732, his party was again at Fort St Pierre, whence the Rainy
River was descended to the Lake of the Woods (Minitie or
Ministik, meaning really "lake of islands "). Here, on the
south-west side of the lake, another fort, Fort St Charles, was
built. From this as a base, Jean Baptiste, the explorer's eldest
son, descended the Winnipeg River (named Maurepas in honour of
the French Minister) to the lake of the same name, being the
first who is known with certainty to have reached its shores. La
Vérendrye's supplies were now exhausted, and he once more went
down to Montreal, where he with difficulty persuaded the
merchants to equip a new expedition. Returning to Fort St Charles
in 1736, he found the garrison in straits for supplies, while his
son arrived from Fort Maurepas&mdash;which had been built at the
mouth of the Winnipeg River&mdash;with the unfortunate news of
the death of La Jemeraye. Another disaster soon followed, for his
eldest son, Jean Baptiste, having started to meet the supplies,
was attacked by Sioux and himself and his whole party massacred.
La Vérendrye's other two sons had, however, done some good work
in the exploration of Lake Winnipeg, and of the Assiniboine River
as far as the site of the future Portage la Prairie, where a new
post, Fort la Reine, was soon to serve as a starting point for
still more extended journeys. The future highway west of
Winnipeg, followed eventually by the Canadian Pacific Railway,
was thus already being opened up by slow degrees.</p>
<p>The year 1737 was partly occupied by a journey to Montreal,
and it was not until October, 1738, that La Vérendrye found
himself able to undertake further explorations, which now took a
direction well to the south of west. He then set out, with his
two sons and a party of Canadians and Assiniboines, for the
country of the Mandans who dwelt on the Upper Missouri, within
the modern state of North Dakota. Following an Indian trail
across the prairie, the explorers reached on December 3 one of
the Mandan villages, whose chief had met them on the way. The
100th meridian west of Greenwich had now been crossed for the
first time in this latitude, and considerably more than half the
distance between Montreal and the shores of the Pacific had been
traversed; but though some farther advance was shortly afterwards
made by this route, it was not by it that the Western Ocean was
first to be reached.</p>
<p>The desertion of the Assiniboine interpreters prevented the
explorers from making satisfactory enquiries of the Mandans, and
although it was the depth of winter, La Vérendrye decided to
return to his base. His own severe illness, and the freezing
winds encountered on the bleak and snow-covered prairie, made the
journey one of the most trying imaginable, but by dogged
determination the party at length reached Fort la Reine on
February 19, 1739. The state of the leader's health put it out of
the question for him to continue the task of exploration, which
now devolved on his sons. In the autumn of 1739, two men, who had
been left with the Mandans, returned with news of the arrival
among that tribe of strange Indians who told of bearded white men
living by the shores of the sea. La Vérendrye at once sent his
son Pierre to renew the attempt in that direction, but he was
unable to procure guides at the Mandan villages, and therefore
returned unsuccessful.</p>
<p>During the next two years nothing further was attempted, but
in 1742 La Vérendrye's two sons set out on what proved to be
their most important expedition. Reaching the Mandan villages
once more, they waited some time expecting the arrival of Indians
from the country in front (spoken of as "Gens des Chevaux"), but
being disappointed of this they set out with Mandan guides.
Passing the Little Missouri, and noticing the many-coloured
earths of that region, they reached the country of the "Beaux
Hommes", who seem to have been Indians of the Crow family.
Continuing on a south-west course they eventually reached a
village of the "Gens de l'Arc" or Bow Indians, and joined a
war-party proceeding westward against the dreaded "Snake"
Indians. In the company of this party the French explorers came
to the foot of a range of mountains with snow-clad peaks, and
sides covered with firs and pines. Here they found a deserted
camp of their enemies, and suspecting that its recent occupiers
were making a raid on their own villages, the "Bows" beat a hasty
retreat, much to the chagrin of the Frenchmen, who had hoped to
find the ocean on the other side of the mountains. It is not
certain how far west the La Vérendryes had penetrated, some
historians thinking that they pushed almost to the source of the
Missouri, at the foot of the main chain of the Rocky Mountains,
others that the Bighorn Mountains, further east and south, formed
the limit of the adventurous journey. In any case it was only an
isolated episode, and for a number of years no further advance in
the same direction took place.</p>
<p>The return journey was made by a somewhat different route. The
Missouri was struck either above or below the Mandan villages, to
which the travellers then followed its banks. They were once more
at their starting-point at Fort St Pierre on July 2, 1743.</p>
<p>Meanwhile some progress had also been made by a more northern
route. Before 1738, the La Vérendryes had discovered Lake
Manitoba (called on their maps Lac des Prairies), on the shore of
which Fort Dauphin was soon afterwards established. Before long
one of the sons seems to have reached the Saskatchewan, though no
particulars of the journey are known. Before 1749, it had been
explored to the junction of the two main branches, while a fort
(Fort Bourbon) had been built on its lower course, and another
(Fort Paskoia) at the point since known as Le Pas. These several
achievements mark the close of the exploring activity of La
Vérendrye and his sons. A tardy recognition of the value of their
work was forthcoming in the bestowal on the father of the rank of
Captain, and his decoration with the Cross of St Louis. But
though proposals for a new expedition were entertained and La
Vérendrye set about the necessary preparations, the final
break-down of his health frustrated his hopes, and he died at the
end of the same year (1749). With little outside help or
encouragement he had accomplished work which entitles him to be
regarded as one of the most meritorious of the pioneers of
Western discovery in North America.</p>
<p>After La Vérendrye's death an act of great injustice was
committed by the new governor. La Jonquière, who not only refused
permission to the explorer's sons to continue their father's
work, but made over all their posts and effects to one Jacques de
St Pierre, who was ordered to continue the search for a way to
the west. In 1750 he started for Fort la Reine, and sent on the
Chevalier de Niverville to continue the exploration of the
Saskatchewan. The journey was made in winter, and the upper fort
on the Saskatchewan was reached with great difficulty. In the
spring of 1751 De Niverville, being himself ill, sent on some of
his men to ascend the Saskatchewan beyond the La Vérendryes'
farthest, and they are said to have reached a spot not far from
the Rocky Mountains, and to have built a fort. Opinions differ as
to whether this was on the North or the South Saskatchewan, but
the probability seems slightly in favour of the latter. At this
fort, which was named after La Jonquière, accounts were given by
the Indians of white men living on an island near the west coast,
with whom trade was carried on, but it is doubtful whether these
had any real foundation.</p>
<p>This was the only exploring achievement effected during the
term of office of St Pierre, who seems to have been injudicious
in his dealings with the Indians, making them little disposed to
aid in the task. His successor, De la Corne, also did little or
nothing, and no further progress had been made when the cession
of Canada to Great Britain in 1763, as a result of Wolfe's
victorious campaign, changed the whole course of future
exploration in this region.</p>
<br>
<p>Before continuing the story of the advance by this southern
route, it will be necessary to consider briefly the progress made
by British explorers towards a better knowledge of the interior
from the base afforded by Hudson Bay, where, it will be
remembered, the agents of the Hudson Bay Company had been at work
since the sixties of the seventeenth century; suffering, however,
many checks from the aggressions of the French. The first
half-century of the Company's existence was marked by practically
no step forward from the point of view of exploration, the
Company's activity being almost entirely confined to the shores
of the bay. A single exception is formed by the journeys of Henry
Kellsey, a young man in the service of the Company, who
associated himself with the Indians, and in their company
ventured some distance into the interior, though much uncertainty
exists as to the extent and precise direction of his travels. The
most important journey seems to have been made in 1690-92, when
he is said to have reached the country of the Assiniboines
(whether on his own account or under orders from his superiors is
not quite certain), his object being to persuade the Indians of
the interior to trade. The probability is that he pushed
north-west to the borders of the "Barren Lands", though some have
supposed his route to have been rather west or south-west. An
interesting fact is his meeting with herds of "buffalo" (properly
bison). In any case he was the first to explore any part of the
interior from the Hudson Bay base, though the accounts he gave
were too vague to be of much practical value, and it was long
before this small beginning of exploration was followed up.</p>
<p>Some attempt to explore the coasts of Hudson Bay, with a view
to finally settling the question of a sea passage to the west,
were made in the first half of the next century, though they led
to little more than negative results. In 1719, Captain James
Knight, a veteran of nearly 80, had sailed with the <i>Albany</i>
and <i>Discovery</i>, in the hope of discovering the long talked
of strait of Anian. But he met with disaster at Marble Island,
where he wintered, and where the entire expedition died
eventually from disease and starvation. Captain Scroggs made a
vain search for the lost expedition in 1721-22, and not until
1767 was its fate ascertained by the discovery of relics at
Marble Island. While the Company appears to have been lukewarm in
its efforts to find a passage, an energetic advocate of more
vigorous action appeared in the person of Arthur Dobbs, a fierce
critic of the Company's methods, who, in 1741, after agitating
for some years, persuaded the British Admiralty to fit out an
expedition, which was placed under the command of Captain
Christopher Middleton. Sailing with the <i>Furnace</i> and
<i>Discovery</i>, Middleton reached Churchill in September, 1741,
and started for the north in July, 1742. He discovered Roe's
Welcome, Wager Bay, Repulse Bay, and Frozen Strait, but proved
that no passage to the west led out of this part of Hudson Bay.
He landed to the south of Cape Frigid, on an island which he took
to be part of Southampton Island, but which has since proved to
be separate. This voyage was valuable as bringing to light the
largest previously unknown portion of the western shores of the
bay, and so completing the work of Bylot, Foxe, and James, more
than a century earlier. A still later voyage, carried out by
Captain Charles Duncan in 1790, had no result of
importance.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> For Duncan's work on this coast in
1791-2 see Appendix.]</p>
<p>It was not until after the middle of the eighteenth century
that the first journey of real importance into the interior west
of Hudson Bay was made. It was carried out by Anthony Hendry, of
whose earlier history, as in the case of so many of the
successful adventurers of the time, little is now known. It
appears that he had been outlawed in 1748 for smuggling, but only
six years later we find him sufficiently trusted by the Hudson
Bay Company to be employed as leader of the important expedition
now to be described. In June, 1754, he left York Factory for the
interior with a party of Indians. His route has not been
ascertained with certainty, but in the opinion of the most
competent writers it was probably as follows. Ascending first the
Hayes, and then the Steel River, Hendry entered the woods, and
after effecting various portages necessitated by rapids and
shallows, reached a lake which he spoke of as Deer Lake, but
which seems to have been that now known as Oxford. Hence he
reached a lake which he called Christianaux, but which can hardly
be Winnipeg, to which the French had previously applied that
name; the route taken being probably that by Cross Lake, Pine
River, and Moose Lake to the Saskatchewan, which river Hendry was
the first Englishman to set eyes on. He ascended it to one of the
forts already established by the French, the officer in charge of
which, though polite, was inclined to oppose his advance. But he
did not venture to use force, and Hendry continued his journey to
the south-west, passing Saskeran Lake and Carrot River. Leaving
his canoe, he struck out across the plains&mdash;finding plenty
of game, and coming in touch with the Assiniboines&mdash;and for
the first time explored the country between the north and south
branches of the Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Going south-west across the Pasquia hills, on August 15,
Hendry came upon the first "buffalo." Touching first the South
and afterwards the North Saskatchewan, he advanced over a
pleasant country, abounding in game, and early in September met
with a party of Indians, whom he names Archithinue, but who
without doubt belonged to the tribe afterwards widely known as
the Blackfeet, with whom he was soon to form an intimate
acquaintance. On October 11 he crossed a river, which seems to
have been the Red Deer, and three days later came up with the
main body of the Blackfeet. On November 21 he reached his
farthest west, probably not far short of 114° W. and a little
south of 52° N. Hendry spent the winter in the Blackfeet country,
travelling in various directions, and pushing north as far as
Devil's Pine Lake. On April 28, 1755, he embarked on the Red Deer
river, and began his homeward journey. The French fort below the
forks of the Saskatchewan was passed, as well as that visited the
year before, and, keeping to the route followed in the outward
journey, Hendry reached York Fort in safety on June 20, 1755,
having performed a most creditable piece of work.</p>
<p>Thus even before the British conquest of Canada, an English
explorer had equalled, if not outdone, the French in western
discovery, and though for a few years the latter continued their
westward advance, it was under the new political <i>régime</i>
that the great object of ambition, the attainment of the western
ocean, was at last achieved. It was to the agents of the future
North-West Company, the great rival of the Hudson Bay Company,
that most of the honours subsequently fell, but some later
journeys by agents of the older company may here be spoken
of.</p>
<p>The first in point of time, that of Samuel Hearne in 1770,
covered a different field, far to the north, and before speaking
of this another journey in the basin of the Saskatchewan, carried
out by Matthew Cocking in 1772, must be mentioned, as it was in
many ways a counterpart of that of Hendry. Cocking was "second
factor" under the Hudson Bay Company at Fort York, and the object
of the journey was "to take a view of the inland country, and to
promote the Hudson Bay Company's interests, whose trade is
diminishing by the Canadians yearly intercepting natives on their
way to the settlements." (This refers to the activity of the
British traders from Montreal, to be spoken of later.) Cocking
started on June 27, 1772, and, ascending the Hayes River, made
his way by various other rivers and portages, including part of
the Nelson River, to the lower Saskatchewan; his route probably
differing somewhat, though to no great extent, from that of
Hendry. From a point near the French Fort à la Corne he went
south-west, again by a different route from Hendry's, into the
country between the north and south branches of the Saskatchewan.
His farthest was by no means so remote as Hendry's, for he seems
to have turned before reaching 110° W., making his way back to
Fort a la Corne by a route somewhat to the north of his outward
one. He added considerably to the knowledge of the country within
the two branches of the Saskatchewan (which he found already
being overrun by rival traders from Canada) and saw a good deal
of the Blackfeet Indians, of whom he has much to tell in his
journal. But he can hardly rank among the great explorers of
Canada, either French or English.</p>
<p>Samuel Hearne, the explorer of the north referred to in the
last paragraph, was perhaps the most meritorious, as he is the
best known, of all the agents of the Hudson Bay Company who
devoted themselves to the task of exploration before the
amalgamation of that company with its great rival, the North-West
Company, in the early part of the nineteenth century. Again we
have to be content with somewhat meagre details regarding his
earlier career, and we only know that, having been left an orphan
at an early age, he entered the navy as a midshipman under the
future Lord Hood, but after a few years left the service and
obtained employment under the Hudson Bay Company, serving as mate
in a schooner trading with the Eskimo on the shores of the bay.
It is in 1769 that he first comes on the scene as an explorer,
being then commissioned to go north-west in search of a river
spoken of by the natives as flowing through a country abounding
in copper ore, while he was also instructed to aim at a solution
of the question of a passage westward out of Hudson Bay. Attempts
in the same direction may possibly have been made before, for we
know that tales of rich copper mines had engaged the attention of
the Company's officers for some time, and the Indians of the
north-west are said to have been visited before Hearne's time,
both by Richard and by Moses Norton, the latter of whom, as
governor of Fort Prince of Wales, near the mouth of the
Churchill, was largely instrumental in sending Hearne on his
present quest.</p>
<p>The explorer started on his first journey on November 6, 1769,
with two Englishmen and a party of Indians, but before long the
latter began to give trouble, and eventually deserted, so that
Hearne was forced to return. He soon set out again (February 23,
1770), this time with five Indians only, going west up Seal River
to Lake Shethani, where he waited till the rigour of winter
should be past. Starting again, he turned north, and on June 30
reached the Kathawachaga or Kazan river, at a spot which he
placed in 63° 4' N., but which seems to have really been more
than a degree further south. By the end of July he seems to have
reached the north end of Dubawnt Lake, but, having the misfortune
to break his quadrant on August 11, decided to return. Travelling
by a somewhat different route, he once more reached Fort Prince
of Wales on November 25, the journey having been a failure as
regards its main objects, though a certain amount of new ground
had been covered.</p>

<br>
<small>The Great Slave Lake in Winter.<br>
(From Hearne's <i>Journey to the Northern Ocean</i>.)</small></p>
<br>
<p>During the return march Hearne had been joined by an Indian
chief, Matonabi, who gave as one cause of his failure the
omission to take the wives of the Indians to help with the
transport, etc. It was therefore arranged that this chief and his
followers, with their women, should accompany the explorer on a
third venture, and a renewed start was made on December 7, 1770.
A more southerly route than had been followed earlier in the year
brought the explorer to Nueltin or Bland Lake on December 31, and
on February 6, 1771, the Kazan was once more crossed. In May the
party was joined by a band of Chipewyans, bent on attacking the
Eskimo of the country to the north, and the rate of progress was
increased by leaving behind the women and the heavier baggage.
Journeying north, and crossing the Arctic circle, the party
encountered the Copper Indians towards the end of June, and
reached the Coppermine river on July 13, pushing on to its mouth
on the 18th, after a heartless massacre of the Eskimo had been
perpetrated&mdash;without Hearne's connivance&mdash;by the Indian
allies. The Arctic Ocean had for the first time been reached in
this quarter of the globe.</p>
<p>The position assigned by Hearne to the mouth of the river
(nearly 72° N.)is something like 4° too far north, and his
mapping generally seems to have been loose and inaccurate, but he
had performed a notable exploit in traversing so great an extent
of hitherto unknown country, some of which has hardly been
visited since his time. His examination of the copper deposits,
however, proved very disappointing.</p>
<p>On the return march Hearne adopted a new route, to the west of
south, which led him through more new country and resulted in the
discovery (December 24, 1771) of one of the great lakes of the
Canadian North-West. It is spoken of by him as the Great
Athapuscow, and has therefore naturally been identified with Lake
Athabasca, though from the general direction of Hearne's route it
is practically certain that it was really the Great Slave Lake.
After crossing the lake&mdash;to which he assigns the fairly
correct length of 120 leagues&mdash;he ascended the river which
enters it from the south for 40 leagues, and then went east,
through a country still little known, to the Kazan, and so to
Fort Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>It is on this adventurous journey that Hearne's fame mainly
rests, but he continued for some time to take an active part in
the affairs of the company. Two years later, being sent to form a
post inland, he chose a site on Cumberland Lake, just north of
the lower Saskatchewan, and there built Cumberland House, long
important as a rendezvous of the fur traders. In 1775 he was
governor of Fort Prince of Wales, and was in command of this at
the time of the hostile descent of La Pérouse in 1782 (see
Chapter XI), when, being quite unprepared for resistance, he
submitted to the unpleasant necessity of surrendering both the
fort and its contents to the French commander. La Pérouse
courteously allowed him to keep the journals of his northern
journeys, urging him to publish them, which he did after some
delay.</p>
<p>From this time onward exploration from the side of Hudson Bay
is so interwoven with that from Canada&mdash;the two series
overlapping both in time and place&mdash;that it is not always
easy to determine to which side the priority in any particular
discovery belongs. After Hearne's journey, the northern company
was content to rest on its laurels for some years, while the keen
British traders who had succeeded to the heritage of the French
in Canada pushed not only west, but north, into the field already
to some extent exploited by their rivals. It will therefore be
necessary, the better to preserve chronological sequence, to
speak of the doings of these southerners during the decades
immediately following the English conquest of Canada.</p>
<p>Before anything had yet been achieved by the Canadian traders,
an ambitious scheme of exploration had been proposed to himself
by an outsider, one Jonathan Carver, of Connecticut, whose idea
was to push west to the Pacific from the Upper Mississippi. He
started in 1766, and, according to his own statement, ascended
the St Pierre (Minnesota) river to the country of the Sioux; but,
finding it impossible to advance farther, returned to the
Mississippi and thence to Lake Superior, hoping to make his way
westward from that base. Unable to obtain supplies, he abandoned
the attempt and returned to Boston (October, 1768). He published
a volume of travels, illustrated by a map&mdash;neither entirely
trustworthy&mdash;and he cannot be said to have made any
important contribution to geographical knowledge.</p>
<p>Among the first British traders to push west from Canada into
the region of the Saskatchewan were, according to the scanty
indications we possess, James Finlay and Thomas Curry, who were
already in the country when Matthew Cocking, the agent of the
Hudson Bay Company, made the journey already spoken of. Other
traders were Peter Pond, a native of Connecticut, who seems to
have entered this country in 1768, and Thomas and Joseph
Frobisher, the last of whom pushed north to the Churchill in
1774. After them came Alexander Henry (the elder of that name),
who in 1775 reached Cumberland House, the post built by Hearne in
1774, by way of Grand Portage, Lake of the Woods, and Lake
Winnipeg. He was accompanied during the latter part of the way by
Pond and the Frobishers. Further journeys in various directions
were made by these men, either independently or in company. In
1776, Henry and the Frobishers went by Frog Portage to the
Churchill and Île à la Crosse Lake, in the country of the
Chipewyans, from whom Henry obtained some information regarding
the geography of the country, being told of Lake Athabasca, Slave
River and Lake, the Peace River, and the Rocky Mountains. A
fort&mdash;destined to be of great importance&mdash;was soon
afterwards built by Thomas Frobisher on Île a la Crosse Lake.</p>
<p>In 1778, Pond started on a more extended journey, which
resulted in the exploration of a good deal of new country. Having
reached Lake lie a la Crosse, he continued his route north-west
to Lakes Clear, Buffalo, and La Loche, and across the "Height of
Land" (as the water-parting was called) to the Clearwater river.
The portage across the divide, known as Portage La Loche or
Methye portage, was soon to become the universally frequented
route from the Saskatchewan to Lake Athabasca and the region
beyond. By the Clearwater he descended to the Athabasca, and, at
a point not far from its entry into the lake of the same name,
built a fort, in which he and his men spent the winter. Hence, in
course of time, he made his way to Lake Athabasca and possibly as
far as the Peace River, though much uncertainty has hitherto
prevailed as to his exact movements.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Pond's journals have lately been
brought to light and printed in America.]</p>
<p>It was about this time, namely in the winter of 1783-84, that
the various Montreal merchants, chief among whom was Simon
McTavish, decided to unite their forces and form a trading
company, which received the name of the "North-West Company."
Pond and some others, however, held aloof, forming themselves
into a rival association, the most energetic member of which was
Alexander Mackenzie, a young Scotsman destined to become the most
famous of all the adventurers in the far north-west. His cousin,
Roderick Mackenzie, was another partner, and likewise played an
important part in western enterprise. After three years of
rivalry the two bodies united in 1787, though dissensions arose
later and led once more to disruption.</p>

Continent of North America</i>.)</small></p>
<br>
<p>Pond&mdash;who, after leading the opposition for a time, seems
to have soon gone over to the North-West Company&mdash;continued
to be active in its behalf until 1788, when he retired, returning
to New England in 1790. He was of a somewhat intractable
disposition, and was implicated in more than one affray which
resulted in the death of a fellow-trader. He was the author of
several maps, in which his explorations were laid down, but, as
he was not an expert in surveying, his representation of the
geography is far from accurate as regards the positions assigned
to the various features. Lake Athabasca, for example, is placed
far too near the shores of the Pacific.</p>
<p>Alexander Mackenzie, who in 1785 had taken charge of the
Churchill River district on behalf of his partners, soon began to
look farther afield, and to make plans for an expedition to the
shores of the Arctic Ocean. His cousin Roderick having, in 1788,
founded Fort Chipewyan on Lake Athabasca for the purpose of trade
with the Chipewyan Indians, he proceeded thither and set about
the preparations for his proposed journey, which was to take him
north by way of the Great Slave Lake, to which region traders had
already begun to penetrate. One of the first to make his way
thither after Hearne's discovery of the lake in 1772 was Laurent
Leroux, who was now to accompany Mackenzie thus far on his
journey and build a fort on the lake shore. The party, which
included also a German named Steinbrück and several Canadian
voyageurs and Indians, left Fort Chipewyan on June 3, 1789, and
soon entered the Slave River at the western end of Athabasca.
Passing the mouth of the strongly-flowing Peace River, they
descended the broad stream, making portages past its dangerous
rapids to the Great Slave Lake, beyond which all was virtually
unknown ground. The weather was still very severe and the lake in
great part still covered with ice, so that the crossing was only
with difficulty effected, halts being several times necessary at
islands on the route. Approaching the northern shore, and
coasting to the westward, the voyagers proceeded up the North Arm
of the Great Slave Lake, where they met a number of Red Knife or
Copper Indians, with whom trade was opened. On June 25 Mackenzie
once more started onwards, leaving Leroux to establish a post
among the Copper Indians, while he returned down the western side
of the north arm to the main body of the lake. After some days
spent in coasting to the south-west, the wished-for outlet of the
lake was at last reached. This river, to which Mackenzie's own
name has fittingly been given, gradually narrowed, while its
current increased in rapidity. The Horn Mountains, on the right
bank, and the mouth of the Liard River, on the left, were passed
in succession. Indians were seen, but most of them fled at the
voyagers' approach, while others, by magnifying the dangers
ahead, terrified Mackenzie's Indians, and much firmness was
needed to prevent their deserting. On July 3, mountains were seen
near the left bank, and Mackenzie ascended a hill which rose
almost perpendicularly from the river, gaining an extensive
view.</p>
<p>Warm weather now gave place to great cold, but the explorer
pushed on with great determination, passing the mouth of the
clear-flowing Great Bear River (coming from Great Bear Lake), and
occasionally meeting Indians, who still preserved a shy and
suspicious attitude. After passing the rapids since known as Sans
Sault, which presented but trifling difficulties, the voyagers
entered the narrow defile in which the river passes for some
distance between perpendicular limestone cliffs, now known as the
Ramparts. Beyond these, on entering the lowland which borders the
Arctic coast of the continent, the river widened out and split
into many different channels. From a new tribe of Indians now met
with, intelligence of the Arctic Ocean was at last obtained.
Supplies were by this time almost exhausted, but though his
Indians became discontented at the continuance of the voyage,
Mackenzie was determined to persevere. At last, on July 12,
having passed the 69th parallel of north latitude, his little
flotilla reached a point where the river widened out into a
lake-like expanse, across which it proceeded to a high island,
whence a wide view was obtained. This was evidently at the mouth
of the river, and the object for which the leader had been
striving had thus been attained, but he seems to have been hardly
convinced that he had really reached the ocean. An observation
taken on the 13th gave the latitude as 69° 14' N. Numbers of
small whales were seen, and the island on which the party had
landed was named Whale Island. On it a post was erected with a
record of the visit, and, a search for Eskimos among the
neighbouring islands having proved fruitless, on July 16
Mackenzie reluctantly began his return voyage. He had traced the
great river which bears his name for a distance, by the windings
of its course, of over 1000 miles from its exit from Great Slave
Lake.</p>
<p>The re-ascent of the Mackenzie, above the apex of its delta,
involved severe labour owing to the strength of the current. From
the inhabitants of an Indian village Mackenzie heard some vague
accounts of the sea to the west, and of visits to it by white men
(probably the fur-traders on the coast of Alaska), as also of a
great river which seems to have been the Yukon. A little above
Bear River the right bank of the Mackenzie was noticed to be
burning, as it has by more recent explorers, this being due to
the seams of lignite which there crop out. On reaching Great
Slave Lake, August 22, Leroux was met, returning with Indians
from a hunting expedition, and at his house Mackenzie dismissed
his Indians. He was once more back at Fort Chipewyan on September
12, having been absent on his expedition some three months and a
half.</p>
<p>This journey, important as it was from a geographical point of
view, seems to have attracted but little notice at the time, but
Mackenzie's exploring ardour was not thus to be checked. For a
time he was content to wait, quietly maturing his plans for a new
venture, and in 1791-2 paid a visit to England for the purpose of
procuring instruments, and otherwise qualifying himself for the
task before him. This time his plan was to ascend the Peace River
(the main feeder of the Mackenzie, which it joins shortly after
the latter's exit from Lake Athabasca) towards the Rocky
Mountains, and push west across these until the Western Ocean
should be gained. Having made his final preparations at Fort
Chipewyan, he left that post in October 1792, and proceeded by
canoe across the western end of Lake Athabasca, and by its
emissary to the Peace River. Pushing rapidly up this, as winter
was now approaching, he passed the highest posts previously
established on its course, and, after reaching the mouth of the
Smoky River, decided to go into quarters for the winter. A fort
was built at a point between 17° and 18° W., and here he and his
men stopped until the spring was advanced enough to permit the
continuance of the journey. During the stay Mackenzie was visited
by Indians who told him of the lake (belonging to the basin of
the Athabasca River) now known as the Lesser Slave Lake, and also
of a river flowing west beyond the mountains. Having secured the
services of two Indians as guides, Mackenzie set out in a
newly-built canoe on May 9, 1793, accompanied, in addition to the
Indians, by Alexander Mackay and six French Canadians. Continuing
to ascend the Peace, through hitherto unexplored country
abounding in game and displaying much beautiful scenery, the
explorers found the river constantly broken by rapids during its
passage through the Rocky Mountains, and only with great
difficulty was the advance carried out, the canoe being often
within an ace of destruction in the foaming waters. The men grew
discontented, and urged a return, but Mackenzie would listen to
no such proposal, but decided to cut a road through the bush on
the mountain side so as to transport the canoe and goods to the
smoother water above the gorge. This was accomplished by heroic
efforts, and they at length reached the point of junction of the
two upper branches of the Peace, since known as the Parsnip and
the Finlay&mdash;the latter named after its first explorer some
years later.</p>

<br>
<p>Somewhat against his own inclination, Mackenzie decided to
follow the advice of the Indians and ascend the southern
branch&mdash;the Parsnip. This river was in flood and its violent
current could only be stemmed by immense exertion. Meeting at
last with Indians who had never before seen a white man,
Mackenzie obtained somewhat vague reports of the westward-flowing
river of which he was in search. He soon afterwards reached the
source of the Parsnip, and had thus in his two journeys followed
the whole course of the Mackenzie, from the source of one of its
principal head-streams to its mouth in the Arctic Ocean. Dragging
the canoe across the continental divide, Mackenzie was the first
white man to reach, by an overland route, a stream flowing west
to the Pacific in the northern half of North America. It was a
rapid mountain river, a tributary of the important stream
afterwards known as the Fraser, from its explorer a few years
later. Its descent nearly led to irretrievable disaster, the
canoe being almost dashed to pieces on the rocks of a cataract.
The men were ready to mutiny, but once more the leader, by sheer
force of character, prevailed on them to go on, and at length,
after incredible difficulties, the more easily navigable waters
of the Fraser&mdash;thought by Mackenzie to be identical with the
Columbia of Pacific navigators&mdash;were gained. The explorers'
struggles were still not over, for rapids again necessitated a
portage, and on meeting with Indians it was only by the exercise
of the utmost patience and tact that they could be induced to lay
aside their suspicions and open a friendly intercourse.</p>
<p>The accounts now received of the difficult navigation of the
Fraser, and the report of an easier route west across the
mountains, decided Mackenzie to abandon the attempt to trace the
river seawards. To find the Indian trail it was necessary to
re-ascend it some distance, and to build a new canoe. Meanwhile
the Indians again proved suspicious, and it was with great
difficulty that a guide could be induced to accompany the party.
The march was begun on July 4, the men being heavily laden, while
short rations and the inclemency of the weather added to their
troubles. They were cheered, however, by reports of the sea and
of white men frequenting the coast. The travellers ascended the
valley of the Blackwater, a right-bank tributary of the Fraser,
and after crossing a secondary divide, came upon a friendly tribe
of coast Indians, dwelling on the banks of the Bella Coola River.
From them canoes were obtained, and the descent of the Bella
Coola was continued until, on July 20, its mouth was reached, and
the western coast&mdash;the object of so many ardent
aspirations&mdash;was thus at last gained. The point at which it
was struck had been visited a little time before by Vancouver,
and the surveys of explorers from east and west were thus for the
first time linked together.</p>
<p>The Indians here proved unfriendly, so, after fixing his
position as about 52° 21' north latitude, and painting on a rock
the simple but pregnant inscription, "Alexander Mackenzie, from
Canada, by land, the twenty-second of July, one thousand seven
hundred and ninety-three," the traveller at once began his
homeward journey. The Indians on the Bella Coola caused some
trouble, but were overawed by Mackenzie's resolute attitude, and
the march was continued with all speed, the supplies being by
this time nearly exhausted. By August 14 the party had already
reached the Fraser, and by the 17th, the Parsnip. The descent of
the latter and of the Peace was effected at a very different rate
of progress from that maintained during their toilsome ascent,
and on August 24 the fort on the Peace River was gained and the
toils and dangers of the expedition were at an end. The return
from the Pacific had occupied little more than a month.</p>
<p>This second expedition of Mackenzie was one of the most
important ever carried out in this part of North America, and its
ultimate results were of a far-reaching character. The
determination with which he overcame the most serious obstacles
places him in the front rank of pioneer explorers. After he had
thus shown the way to the Western Ocean, others soon followed in
his footsteps, and it was not long before the general features of
the Rocky Mountain zone and Pacific slope in the modern province
of British Columbia were disclosed to the world. But the story of
the future exploration of this region&mdash;associated above all
with the names of David Thompson, Alexander Henry the younger,
and Simon Fraser&mdash;belongs almost entirely to the next
century and thus lies outside the limits of our period.</p>
<p>A new period of exploration in the far west was ushered in by
Mackenzie's epoch-making journey, but a good deal remained to be
done before even the pioneer work in the region east of the
mountains could be said to be finished. At the period at which we
have now arrived some tardy steps were taken by the Hudson Bay
Company to do its share in the exploration of the western
interior. At the instance of the Colonial Office in London, the
Company commissioned a surveyor, Philip Turner by name, who had
been for some time in its service, to explore the country between
Cumberland House and the Great Slave Lake. He travelled over this
country in 1790-92, and the resulting map gave for the first time
an approximately correct representation of Lake Athabasca, with
the river system of the southern part of the Mackenzie basin,
while other details were filled in from information collected. He
was succeeded by Peter Fidler, who seems to have assisted him in
a part of his work, and who executed important surveys for the
Company, though the full details of his explorations&mdash;which
appear to have begun in 1792&mdash;are not now known. From the
map which he constructed, and a few other indications, it appears
that his journeys covered a very wide area, both in the basin of
the Saskatchewan and, further north, in those of the Mackenzie,
Churchill, and other rivers emptying themselves into Hudson Bay.
In the west they extended to the Lesser Slave Lake and the lower
course of the Peace River, and in the east they resulted in the
first map of the lower Churchill, and in an improved
representation of various other rivers and lakes between
Athabasca and the shores of Hudson Bay. Fidler continued his
labours till well into the next century, and though a good deal
of the ground covered was not entirely new, his surveys were a
valuable contribution to the knowledge of the geography of this
region.</p>
<p>During the same period, equally extensive journeys, in part
over the same field, were made by David Thompson, one of the most
active and determined explorers produced either by the Hudson Bay
Company or its great rival. Few, in fact, of the world's
explorers by land have covered such a great extent of unknown or
imperfectly-known country, or continued their activity through so
long a period as did David Thompson. The first part of his career
was spent in the service of the Hudson Bay Company, and though
much of his time was necessarily given up to trading and the
founding of stations, he showed throughout the greatest zeal in
laying down his routes, and in fixing his positions by
astronomical observations. In 1797, after his wanderings had
taken him over the length and breadth of the region between
Hudson Bay and the Rocky Mountains, he left the Hudson Bay
Company's service, in which his passion for exploration no longer
found sufficient scope, and joined the North-West Company, which
was more ready to encourage such enterprise as Thompson had at
heart. In its service a wide field for exploration opened before
him in the almost unknown wildernesses stretching from the Rocky
Mountains to the Pacific, but, as has been said above, this part
of the history falls within the nineteenth century and cannot be
dealt with here.</p>
<p>By the close of the eighteenth century the broad outlines of
the geography of the vast region between Hudson Bay, the Great
Lakes, the Arctic Ocean, and the Rocky Mountains had thus been
sketched in, while the pioneer journey of Mackenzie to the
Pacific had already paved the way for the opening up of the
region still farther west. Political events had brought it about
that the work during the latter part of the century had fallen
entirely to British subjects, while British traders and
surveyors, working independently from the side of the Pacific,
had likewise secured an undisputed position on its more northern
coasts, and thus helped to lay the foundation of a British
Dominion from shore to shore of the continent.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">II. <i>The Mississippi Basin</i>.</p>
<p>While the latter part of the eighteenth century was thus a
period of rapid advance into the far north-west of Canada,
nothing at all comparable to these achievements took place in the
more southern region of the continent, now occupied by the United
States. As in the earlier period, when the French were rapidly
pushing outwards in Canada and on the Mississippi, the English
settlers on the Atlantic seaboard were long content with a more
gradual and steady expansion. The nearly continuous range of the
Alleghanies formed a natural barrier to the growth of the Eastern
colonies, and long marked the extreme limit of knowledge from the
east, though, as we have seen in an earlier chapter, the French,
as represented by La Salle and his coadjutors, had by their
descent of the Mississippi drawn a band of known ground round the
hinterland of the British colonies. No such unlimited field was
therefore open here to touch the imagination and fire the ardour
of explorers as in the Canadian West, though an important and
arduous task awaited them in the opening up of the rough
wilderness between the Alleghanies and the Mississippi. A few
figures stand out amid the host of nameless pioneers as having
contributed to a knowledge of this region. About the middle of
the eighteenth century many journeys to the region of the Ohio
were made by agents employed to negotiate with the Indians both
before and during the French wars.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Conrad
Wieser, a Würtemberger who had settled in Pennsylvania and became
a noted interpreter, was sent to negotiate with the Indians in
1748. George Croghan, an Irish settler in Pennsylvania, also
noted as an Indian agent, made a number of journeys to the Ohio
between 1747 and 1765, in which last year he carried out a rough
survey of the river during a tour down it towards Illinois. In
1758-59 a Moravian missionary, Christian Frederick Post,
undertook embassies to the Indians on the Ohio, whose neutrality
he secured at a critical juncture. He afterwards founded a
mission within the limits of the modern State of Ohio. Kentucky
also began to be systematically explored only about this time,
though it had been reached by individual adventurers much
earlier.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> The first to do much with a special
view to exploration was Dr Thomas Walker of Virginia, who in 1748
discovered the pass near the southern end of the Alleghany
system, destined to play so important a part in the future
history of the region, and ever since known by Walker's name of
Cumberland Gap. The Cumberland Mountains and River were also
named by Walker, who two years later made a more extended
exploration, with five companions, to the headwaters of the
Kentucky. Between 1751 and 1767 adventurers spread themselves in
increasing numbers over these great hunting grounds, names
deserving mention being those of Christopher Gist, Wallen, James
Smith, Harrod, and Finly. But among the host of "backwoodsmen",
who made their order famous for determination and hardihood, few
stood out as markedly more meritorious than their fellows, and
for a time little practical result ensued.</p>

<br>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The French on the Great Lakes had long
known the general course of the Ohio, at least in its upper
portions, the river being used as a line of approach to the
region beyond. But neither they nor the early English pioneers
had gone far into the wildernesses on the south side.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> Among these were Colonel Wood, who
penetrated into the country soon after the middle of the 17th
century; and, some years later, traders named Doherty and
Adair.]</p>
<p>It was to a farmer of North Carolina, Daniel Boon by name,
that the first real impetus towards the opening up of the great
central basin of the modern United States was due. A typical
backwoodsman, passionately devoted to the wandering life of the
hunter and explorer, Boon exhibited the daring, fortitude, and
self-reliance of his class in a peculiar degree, coupled with
other qualities which inspired confidence and enabled him to play
a leading part among his associates. Leaving his home, with five
others, on May 1, 1769, and crossing the mountains by difficult
paths. Boon descended westward into the fertile and forest-clad
plain of Kentucky. During his wanderings here he had the
misfortune to be captured by Indians, but, effecting his escape,
joined his brother, who had followed him across the mountains. In
1773, he decided to move with his family into this new and
promising region, and the first step towards the settlement of
Kentucky was thus taken. Various survey parties soon visited the
country. One of the most active leaders was John Floyd, who in
1774 led a party down the Kanawha and Ohio to the Kentucky River
and beyond, traversing the country in various directions as far
as the Falls of the Ohio. Floyd made his way back amid
considerable hardships by way of the Cumberland Gap. About the
same time settlements began to be made in the upper basin of the
Tennessee River, between the Cumberland Mountains on the
north-west and the Great Smoky Mountains on the south-east; the
most active pioneers in this direction being two young men named
John Sevier and James Robertson.</p>
<p>The war between the colonists and Indians which took place in
1774, and is known as Lord Dunmore's War from the English
Governor of Virginia who carried it through, led to a temporary
withdrawal from Kentucky, though by weakening the power of the
Indians it helped in no small degree to make possible the further
opening up of this central region. In 1775 settlement on a more
extended scale was inaugurated by an enterprising pioneer named
Nathaniel Henderson, who had raised himself by his personal
qualities from a low station. Securing the cooperation of Boon
and others, he obtained a concession from the Indians and for a
time formed a semi-independent republic in the wilderness. During
the troublous time of the revolution, from 1775 onwards,
operations were extended into the country north of the Ohio, then
occupied by scattered French settlements under British
suzerainty. The daring scheme of the conquest, for the revolted
colonies, of this important tract (lying between the Great Lakes,
the Ohio, and the Mississippi) was due to the enterprising
Kentucky pioneer George Rogers Clark, who in 1778 descended the
Ohio almost to its mouth with a small force of frontiersmen, and
made a bold march north into the heart of this region, taking
Vincennes on the Wabash by surprise, and even holding his own
against the English Governor Hamilton who marched against him
from Detroit. In this way an immense tract of territory, first
opened up from the side of Canada, passed eventually into the
possession of the United States. By the end of the century most
of the country east of the Mississippi had thus been brought
within the ken of civilisation. The lands beyond the Mississippi
had, for the most part, to wait their turn till the new century
had begun.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>
<h4>SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE AMERICA, 1700-1800</h4>
<p align="center">I. <i>North America</i>.</p>
<p><span class="a">Besides</span> the maritime efforts spoken of
in a previous chapter, a certain amount of land exploration was
effected during the eighteenth century on the western side of
North America from the base afforded by the Spanish settlements
in Northern Mexico. It will be remembered that, quite in the
early days of the Conquest, Spanish adventurers like Coronado had
pushed north into the basin of the Colorado, but their
achievements had to a large extent fallen into oblivion, and the
later explorers had virtually to begin afresh in this direction.
As in other parts of the Spanish dominions at this epoch, most of
the advance was due to the zeal of the missionaries, particularly
the Jesuits, who extended the bounds of knowledge either by
journeys with the special object of exploration, or incidentally
to the prosecution of their more special work. Some attempts were
also made on the part of the Spanish Government, but the want of
energy and settled plan with which they were prosecuted rendered
them in great part fruitless. It had long been a desired object
with the Mexican authorities to discover a harbour or harbours on
the coast of California at which the ships from the Philippines
might refresh on first striking the coast of North America, and
it was with this purpose that the voyages of Vizcaino in 1596 and
1602 had been undertaken. Somewhat later, a special object of
investigation was the ascertainment of the true character of the
peninsula of Lower California, for though in the early maps based
on Spanish voyages during the sixteenth century (among others,
that of Sebastian Cabot in 1544) it had been correctly shown as a
peninsula, an error was subsequently introduced and persisted
throughout the next century, by which California was held to be
an island.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> This was due to a false report that
ships had sailed out into the ocean from the northern end of the
Gulf of California.]</p>
<p>Among the Government expeditions during the latter part of the
seventeenth century the most important was that of Don Isidro
Otondo, in 1683-85, in which three Jesuits, Fathers Kühn (Kino in
Spanish), Copart, and Goni took part. In the person of the
first-named an actor appeared on the scene who was to play an
important part in the opening up of this region. Attempts were
made to found settlements on the eastern side of the peninsula,
and parties were also sent into the interior. But the barrenness
and rugged nature of the country stood in the way of success,
and, difficulties with the natives also arising, Otondo
eventually found it necessary to reembark the whole of the
intending settlers and sail back to Mexico. The work of nearly
three years was thus without any direct result. But the
expedition was not without its influence on future events. Kühn's
interest in California was not allowed to slumber. Having
obtained an appointment in the Sonora Missions on the opposite
mainland, he succeeded in communicating his own enthusiasm to
another Jesuit, Father Juan Salvatierra, during a visit of
inspection by the latter. After many rebuffs Salvatierra was
authorised to establish a mission in the peninsula, and he set
out for that purpose in October, 1697. In spite of many
difficulties, both from the nature of the country and the
fickleness of the natives, he succeeded in establishing the
mission on a more or less solid foundation, aided by Father
Piccolo and others. From the mission of Loreto, on the inner side
of the peninsula, expeditions were made into the interior, and on
one of these a sight of the Pacific was obtained. Meanwhile
Father Kühn had not been idle. With untiring energy he traversed
the length and breadth of Sonora, opening up new missions towards
the north, and using every opportunity of extending geographical
knowledge. On some of his journeys he was accompanied by an
officer, Juan Mateo Mange, whose diaries supply a detailed
account of their experiences. In 1694 Kühn went north as far as
the Gila (the last important tributary of the Colorado), and in
1697 accompanied a military expedition to that river. He again
made his way to the Gila in 1698, and thence reached the coast of
the gulf, where he found a good port with fresh water and wood.
Determined if possible to settle the question of the junction of
California with the mainland, he set out again in September,
1700, accompanied by Indians of various tribes. Reaching the Gila
once more, he descended it to its junction with the Colorado, in
the country of the Yuma Indians. Failing to reach the sea, he
turned back and, climbing a high mountain, obtained a distant
view of the mountains of California and the mouth of the
Colorado.</p>
<p>Kühn was now convinced of the peninsular character of
California, though he had not actually proved its connection with
the mainland. Before the end of 1700 Salvatierra paid a visit to
Sonora and in March, 1701, Kühn and he undertook a new journey in
concert. They at first tried to cross the wide expanse of sands
near the head of the gulf, but without success, though Kühn
climbed a hill and gained a view of the opposite coast and the
Californian mountains. Trying again by a more inland route they
obtained another distant view, but were then forced to retrace
their steps. In November of the same year Kühn went north again,
and, after crossing and recrossing the Gila, followed the
Colorado through the country of the Yumas and Quinquimas, and
crossed to its western bank on a "balsa" constructed of trees. He
found great numbers of Indians inhabiting a level and partially
wooded country, with a good soil, and learned that the South Sea
could be reached in ten days. But having no means of taking his
animals across the Colorado, there a stream 200 yards in width,
he had once more to retrace his steps. Finally in February, 1702,
he made a last attempt, accompanied by Father Gonzales. This time
he followed the Colorado to its mouth, but the serious illness of
his companion once more necessitated a return, the latter
succumbing to the fatigues of the journey on reaching the first
mission station.</p>
<p>By these journeys Kühn virtually solved the problem which had
so long exercised the minds of his contemporaries, though it was
left to another of the missionaries to finally set at rest all
doubts on the subject.</p>
<p>Other workers had now joined Father Salvatierra in the
peninsula, the most active among them being Father Ugarte, who
from his station on the mainland had already done much to help by
collecting and forwarding supplies to the advanced posts in
California. In 1703, among other journeys, Salvatierra made one
across the peninsula to its outer coast. Three years later
Ugarte, accompanied by Father Bravo, carried out a further
examination of that coast, but found it barren and unpromising.
His party was reduced to serious straits for want of water and
only made its way back to the gulf after suffering severe
hardships. In 1719 Father Guillen likewise made an attempt in the
same direction, but though he reached the Magdalena Bay of
Vizcaino, near the southern end of the outer coast, he too found
the scarcity of water an insuperable obstacle. A more successful
expedition on the gulf side of the peninsula was carried out in
1721 by Ugarte, who sailed from the port of Loreto in May of that
year to survey the coasts to the north. Besides a larger vessel,
he had at his disposal a pinnace and boat, which permitted the
survey of the shallower waters adjoining the coast. After
following the west coast of the gulf for some days, the
expedition crossed over to the mainland side and opened
communication with the mission of Caborca, one of those founded
by Kühn. Ugarte now became seriously ill, but resolutely stuck to
his task. Crossing to the west side of the gulf in three days,
the party experienced much difficulty on account of the violent
tidal currents. The sea also changed its colour, becoming
generally reddish from the effect of the Colorado water. The
vessels anchored at last near the eastern mouth of the river,
which was in flood and carried down large quantities of grass,
leaves, tree-trunks, etc. The junction of the peninsula with the
mainland was ascertained by a distant view, and the height of the
tides was also regarded as indicating that the gulf was
completely closed in to the north. On July 16 Ugarte turned
south, but the troubles of the expedition were not yet over.
Scurvy made its appearance, and with their reduced strength the
voyagers had to combat a succession of storms, which so impeded
their progress that it was not till September that they were once
more back at their starting point.</p>

<br>
<p>The general contours of the gulf were now ascertained with
more or less accuracy, and much credit is due to Ugarte for the
determined way in which he carried out his task in the face of
many obstacles. His work was somewhat improved upon a quarter of
a century later by Father Consag, who, in view of the
contemplated completion of the conquest of California, was
commissioned to make a survey of the coasts of the gulf as far as
the Colorado River. This he did in 1746, making besides a
fruitless effort to ascend the Colorado; the result being,
however, to confirm the general correctness of Ugarte's
statements. Consag afterwards (1751-53) made journeys on the
outer coast of the peninsula, towards the north, while in 1756
Father Wenzel (Wenceslaus) Link partially explored the northern
peninsula by land.</p>
<p>Further attempts had been made a little before this to extend
the Spanish influence northwards from the side of the mainland,
though little had been added to the knowledge previously
acquired. One of the objects in view was the establishment of
missions among the Moqui Indians, to the north-east of Sonora, in
a region towards which some advance had already been made by the
Franciscans. In 1743 Father Keler set out on a journey to the
north, but he had but an insufficient escort, and was forced to
turn back after proceeding some days' journey beyond the Gila. In
1744 Father Sedelmayer made an attempt in the same direction, but
though he visited the Yuma Indians, he shed no new light on the
geography of the region. A more important journey was made some
years later by Father Garcés, a Franciscan who had been in charge
of the mission of San Xavier del Bac in
Sonora;<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> for, since the expulsion of the
Jesuits from all the Spanish dominions in 1767, their place in
these missions had been taken by the Franciscans.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The province of Sonora then extended
beyond the limits of the modern Mexico, and San Xavier was in
what is now Arizona, a little south of Tucson.]</p>
<p>From 1768 onwards Garcés made various expeditions for
missionary purposes, partly to discover new routes between the
widely-scattered stations in Sonora and California. The first
two, in 1768 and 1770, were of no great importance. In 1771 he
descended the Rio Gila to the Colorado, and crossed the latter to
its western bank in the country of the Yumas. His wanderings are
not easy to trace, but he seems to have almost reached the mouth
of the Colorado before returning to the Gila, and so south to
Caborca. About this time more serious efforts were being made by
the Spanish authorities to extend their settlements along the
coast of Upper California, as has already been mentioned in the
chapter dealing with Pacific voyages; and it was felt to be
particularly desirable to open up an overland route to the port
of Monterey on that coast (occupied in 1770), while the extension
of the missions in this direction was also taken in hand. In 1774
Captain Juan Bautista de Anza was commissioned to find a way
overland from Mexico to Upper California, and Garcés accompanied
him as chaplain. The party made its way, by the Gila and
Colorado, to the mission of San Gabriel, which had been
established near the coast of Upper California in about 34° N.,
not far from the modern town of Los Angeles. The main body
returned by the same route, while Garcés turned aside to visit
one of the Yuma tribes on the Colorado. In 1775 Anza was sent on
a more important errand&mdash;for the establishment of a mission
and government station at San Francisco&mdash;and Garcés again
started with him. On arriving at the Yuma country, however, he
once more went exploring on his own account. From the Colorado
mouth he ascended the river to Mojave in lat. 35° N., proceeding
thence west by a new route across country to San Gabriel. Once
more setting out from this station, he made a trip north to the
Tulare valley, afterwards returning to Mojave, and continuing his
journey eastward to the Moqui country, which, it will be
remembered, had been an objective of several of the Jesuit
missionaries in the closing years of their regime. This was his
farthest towards the north-east, and he now retraced his steps by
Mojave to the Yuma country and returned by the Gila to his
station of Bac, which was reached on September 17, 1776.</p>
<p>This journey of Garcés had broken a certain amount of new
ground, and it was quite the most important of his
<i>entradas</i>, as these pioneer journeys of the missionaries
were styled at the time. Three years later it was decided to
found a mission among the Yumas, several coadjutors being
assigned to Garcés for the purpose. The attempt led to disaster,
the measures adopted being injudicious. Some of the best lands of
the Yumas were appropriated by the settlers, and the discontent
naturally fostered by this proceeding led to a wholesale massacre
of the Spaniards, Garcés and his fellow-workers falling victims
among the rest.</p>
<p>A still more important journey was made at this time by two
other Franciscan friars, Fathers Escalante and Dominguez, still
with the object of opening up an overland route from Northern
Mexico to the Pacific seaboard. The starting point was the city
of Santa Fe, long before established on the northern frontier of
the Spanish dominions, and as this lay far to the east of Sonora,
a correspondingly longer journey was involved than in the case of
attempts from the western province. The friars did not actually
accomplish their purpose, but they traversed a large extent of
new country, and their journey constituted the most important
exploration achieved before the beginning of the nineteenth
century in the south-west of the modern United States. Setting
out from Santa Fe in July, 1776, with two officers and five
soldiers, they took a north-westerly course, crossing the Upper
Rio Grande and entering the basin of the Colorado. On reaching
the head-waters of the San Juan, its eastern tributary, the party
seems for a time to have turned to the west, but again took a
more northerly course across the plateau region between the San
Juan and the Upper Colorado, following for a time the course of
the Rio Dolores. After visiting an encampment of Yuta (Utah)
Indians the travellers crossed the Grand River or Colorado early
in September, and continuing on a north-west course soon
afterwards came to the Green River, the second main head-stream
of the Colorado, before reaching which a buffalo was killed. On
crossing the Green River they were in the country raided by the
dreaded Comanche Indians, but they do not seem to have
encountered any of these. A difficult route across the mountains
brought them to a stream flowing south-west into a lake, known to
the natives as Timpanogos, but which has since received the name
Utah&mdash;the small lake which discharges north into the Great
Salt Lake, the hydrographical centre of the vast tract of inland
drainage now known as the Great Basin. The natives hereabout
(Yutas or Utahs) lived in primitive fashion, and the fathers
found no towns like those of the Moquis and Zuñis as they had
hoped. At first timid, these people soon became friendly and
expressed their willingness that a mission should be established
among them. They also gave a good deal of information on the
geography of the surrounding region, telling in particular of a
larger lake to the north (the Great Salt Lake of later days),
whose saline waters were very injurious to those who bathed in
them.</p>
<p>The fathers had now pushed considerably north of the direct
route to Monterey, whether from a desire to find out as much as
possible about this northern <i>terra incognita</i>, or because
the difficulty of crossing the region of canons about the middle
course of the Colorado had necessitated their making a circuit.
It was therefore necessary, in view of the advancing season, to
turn their steps southwards, a direction which led them by the
valley of the Sevier River (which they called Santa Isabel) and
past the lake of the same name. When in the valley now known as
Escalante they enquired in vain for the sea or the Spanish
settlements, and after a difference of opinion had been settled
by casting lots, they turned eastward for the Colorado, which was
reached on October 26. Some days were occupied in the search for
a ford, which was at last found in 37° N. The first settlements
of the Moquis were reached on November 16, but though these
people expressed a readiness to live in friendship with the
Spaniards, they declined to allow the establishment of a mission.
Zuni was passed towards the end of the month and on January 2,
1777, the party was once more back in Santa Fé. The fathers had
achieved an important piece of exploration, and Escalante's
narrative of the journey contains a good deal of information on
the features of the country, its climate, products, and
people.</p>
<p>This journey marks the farthest advance of the Spaniards in
the interior of North America. It was not followed up, and it was
half a century later that fur hunters and other adventurers from
the United States first made their way to the region of the Great
Salt Lake.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">II. <i>South America</i>.</p>
<p>Like the century which preceded it, the eighteenth century was
in South America a period of strong missionary activity, the
Jesuits and other orders continuing to push their posts farther
and farther afield, until, at the time of their greatest
extension, there were few parts of the continent in which their
influence was not to some extent felt. The quest of mineral
wealth and slaves was accountable, too, for a good deal of
exploring activity, especially in the Portuguese possessions.
Some of the first purely scientific work in South America was
also done during the century, but this was but a beginning,
though an important one, and it can hardly be said to affect the
general character of the century's output.</p>
<p>To begin with the part of the interior longest open to
European influence&mdash;that of the upper basin of the La
Plata&mdash;we have seen in a previous chapter how various
attempts were made in the seventeenth century to establish
missions among the tribes known by the general names of
Chiriguanas and Chiquitos, towards the frontiers of Bolivia, and
how the Spanish missions to the latter had begun, at the close of
the century, to feel the encroachments of Portuguese adventurers
from the side of Brazil. The Chiriguanas proved so intractable
that the attempt to convert them was soon abandoned, efforts
being concentrated on the more amenable Chiquitos. The desire to
open up a shorter and easier route from the more eastern missions
to the Chiquitos country led to various journeys which did
something to improve the knowledge of the upper basin of the
Paraguay. In 1702 Fathers Francisco Hervas and Miguel de Yegros
went east from the Chiquitos mission of San Rafael, reaching a
river which they thought to be the Paraguay or a branch of it,
and setting up a cross as a landmark. In 1703 Hervas, with Father
de Arce and several others, was sent up the Paraguay in order to
reach the same spot. In spite of the treacherous behaviour of the
Payaguas dwelling on the river's banks, they pushed on, but
searched in vain for the mark set up the year before. It became
necessary to turn back, and the return journey was only
accomplished with much hardship. In 1704-5 Yegros made a new
attempt from the Chiquitos country, and ascertained that the
river reached in 1702 had no connection with the Paraguay. In
1715 Fathers de Arce and Blende tried once more from the side of
the Paraguay, but failed to effect the desired junction, and on
their return were both murdered by the natives, in revenge for
wrongs done by Spanish adventurers. The attempt by the Paraguay
was now given up, and attention turned to the Pilcomayo, its most
important western tributary. In 1721 it was arranged that parties
should start from both sides simultaneously, Fathers Patiño and
Rodriguez ascending the river, while a party from Tucuman
endeavoured to meet them. The latter advanced no great distance
before turning back, but Patiño and his companion did a notable
piece of work, which no traveller improved upon for many years.
The labyrinth of channels and the extensive swamps which
characterise the middle course of the Pilcomayo make both its
navigation and travel along its banks a matter of great
difficulty&mdash;so much so that a portion remained imperfectly
known at the beginning of the twentieth century. Having ascended
the river for 60 leagues in a vessel of some size, the fathers
went on in boats a distance which they estimated at 1000 miles,
and their turning point was said to have been only some 60 miles
below Santa Barbara. A treacherous attack by the Toba Indians
necessitated a retreat, the return being accomplished in safety,
though the main object of the journey remained unfulfilled.
Twenty years later, in 1741, a renewed attempt to ascend the
Pilcomayo was made by Father Castañares, but he too was forced to
turn back. The next year he went to Bolivia, and, starting from
Tarija, began the descent of the Pilcomayo, hoping to find the
difficulties less in this direction. But on reaching the
neighbourhood of Santa Barbara he was attacked and murdered by
Indians&mdash;the Mataguayos&mdash;and this, like all previous
attempts to open the Pilcomayo route, thus ended in failure. The
explorations of the Jesuits in this region were finally brought
to a close by the expulsion of the order from all the Spanish
dominions by the decree of 1767. The extent of the Jesuit
knowledge of this part of South America is well shown by the maps
of Matthew Seutter, D'Anville and others. D'Anville's version,
prepared for the <i>Lettres Édifiantes et Curieuses</i>, is here
reproduced in outline.</p>

<br>
<p>The missions to the tribes known to the Spaniards by the
general designation Moxos were gradually extended farther afield
during this century, but with no great results from a
geographical standpoint. A greater extension of knowledge was due
to the Portuguese adventurers in Mato Grosso, that vast and
thinly peopled wilderness, most difficult of access of all the
Brazilian provinces. In 1734 mines were discovered in this region
by Antonio Fernandez de Abreu, and adventurers soon began to
flock in in the hope of making a speedy fortune. Among these was
Manoel Felix de Lima, one of the original companions of Abreu,
who, failing to make profit out of the mines, turned his energies
to an exploring venture still farther afield, in the direction of
the great Madeira tributary of the Amazon. Although the Moxo
missions had been long established on the head-waters of the
Madeira system, the middle course of the great river was still
but little known, though some attempts to push upwards from its
lower basin had been made from the side of Pará. Thus some twenty
years before the date of Manoel Felix's venture, an expedition
under Francisco de Mello, acting under the orders of the governor
of Pará, had ascended as far as the Mamore. The Spanish
authorities had put obstacles in his way and he had been forced
to return, no practical result being gained by his journey.</p>
<p>Manoel Felix was a native of Portugal, and, though
superstitious, of a somewhat higher class than many of the
adventurers of the time; but his companions were in great part
men of broken fortunes, who joined him with a view to escaping
their creditors. A start was made in 1742. After following down
the Sarare to the Guapore, and beginning the descent of the
latter, the party divided, some of the adventurers being dismayed
at the difficulties in store. Manoel and the rest continued the
voyage, and with some difficulty found their way to a mission on
the Baures, in charge of a German Jesuit who had adopted the
half-Spanish name of Gaspar de Prado. This was the most recent
establishment of the Moxo missions, and the Mura Indians among
whom the father was working were under very partial control. Both
here and at a settlement on the Ubay (under Joseph Reiter, a
Hungarian) the voyagers were well received until orders came from
the Provincial of the missions that they were to be dismissed.
Re-entering the Guapore, they soon reached its junction with the
Mamore, and continuing the voyage, passed the mouth of the Beni,
the third great head-stream of the Madeira. They now encountered
dangerous falls and rapids, while their troubles were increased
by the shortness of their food-supply and the constant plague of
flies. The canoe struck on a rock and was lost, but another was
providentially discovered caught between two rocks near an
island. The last fall having been passed, traces were seen of an
abandoned settlement of the Portuguese from Pará. Hunger began to
press severely on the party, but they at last obtained relief at
a Portuguese mission station, and, passing two others, eventually
entered the main stream of the Amazon, having traced down its
largest tributary from almost the very head of one of its main
branches.</p>
<p>On reaching Pará Manoel was sent to Lisbon to report on his
journey, which the authorities regarded as of considerable
importance. He had himself formed an inordinate idea of the value
of his services and made correspondingly excessive claims. He
frequented the court for some years in the vain hope of getting
them recognised, and died in extreme poverty. Some of his
comrades, after returning to Mato Grosso, made a second
expedition under Francisco Leme, but it was without important
result.</p>
<p>Somewhat further east, one João de Sousa e Azevedo made an
adventurous journey about this time in the borderlands between
the Paraguay and Amazon basins, through country that has remained
but imperfectly known down to our own times. From Cuyaba in
south-east Mato Grosso he descended the Cuyaba River to the
Paraguay, ascended the latter river and one of its tributaries to
the water-parting, and made his way across this to the basin of
the Tapajos, one of the great southern tributaries of the
Amazon.</p>
<p>The Portuguese and Spaniards had now come in contact in the
very centre of the continent, and efforts were made on both sides
to secure control of the debateable ground forming the frontier
zone. In 1749 an expedition was organised from Pará for the
purpose of repeating Manoel Felix's journey in the reverse
direction by ascending the Madeira to Mato Grosso; and it was
placed under the leadership of Francisco Leme and his brother.
Though the object in view was eventually attained, the expedition
underwent many dangers and hardships on the way. About three
weeks up the Madeira it was attacked by a band of Muras, but they
were repulsed. Light canoes were built for the passage of the
rapids, but these were surmounted only with great labour,
frequent portages being necessary. On reaching the first Spanish
mission near the mouth of the Mamore, the travellers were
agreeably surprised at receiving a friendly welcome, the
accession of Ferdinand VI to the throne of Spain having, through
the influence of his Portuguese queen, greatly improved the
relations between the two kingdoms. But their troubles were not
yet over. It was now the most unfavourable season of the year for
travel: all the rivers were rising, and the retreat of animal
life from the banks made it almost impossible to procure
food-supplies from the woods. Some help was obtained from Father
Gaspar at San Miguel, but difficulties in the shape of flooded
lands, disease, and want of food, still pursued the party. It
became necessary to send on the most fit in canoes, to bring
supplies from the nearest Portuguese settlements, and with this
aid they at last reached the Sarare, and three days later the
post of Pescaria, having spent nine months on the journey. The
water-route thus opened up now became fairly frequented.</p>
<p>Further south, exploration was carried on little by little in
the western parts of the La Plata basin, and on the coasts of
Northern Patagonia, though the wild region known as the Gran
Chaco long remained almost untraversed by white men, except on
its outer borders. Political events had much to do with the
increase of activity displayed during the second half of the
eighteenth century. It had become eminently desirable that the
possessions of Spain and Portugal should be more clearly
delimited in the centre of the continent than had hitherto been
the case, and the improved relations now prevailing between the
two crowns soon had their outcome in a treaty, concluded in 1750,
by which the entire mutual frontier in South America was defined
in detail, so far as geographical knowledge permitted. The
information recently gained made it possible to draw the line of
partition with some regard to geographical facts, though in
certain parts, especially along the extreme north-west borders of
Brazil, it was perforce left extremely vague pending further
examination of the country. This treaty is noteworthy for its
recognition of accomplished facts and the setting aside of old
claims based on the Pope's division of the newly-discovered lands
between Spain and Portugal at the time of the discovery of
America. But it was not destined to come into force, for the
threatened transfer to Portugal of some of the Spanish missions
among the Guaranis, and eviction of these from their homes, led
to a revolt of that people, and before this had been finally
quelled, both parties to the treaty had become dissatisfied with
its terms. By mutual consent it was allowed to lapse, to be
replaced nearly thirty years later (1777) by a new treaty, which
has ever since formed the basis of the political partition of
South America, though its ambiguities gave rise to many disputes
in after times.</p>

<p align="center"><a name="Image53" id="Image53"></a><img alt=""

<br>
<small>Don Felix de Azara.<br>
(From the portrait in the atlas to his
<i>Voyages</i>.)</small></p>
<br>
<p>This treaty was the means of bringing on the scene one of the
greatest travellers in South America during the eighteenth
century, whose activities in the southern half of the continent
were, however, soon to be matched and even surpassed by those of
Humboldt in the northern half. This was Don Felix de Azara, a
Spanish officer born in 1746, who, after receiving a severe wound
in the campaign against the Algerian pirates in 1775, was in 1780
appointed one of the Spanish commissioners for the delimitation
of the boundary between Brazil and the Spanish provinces in the
basin of the La Plata. Azara, who received the naval rank of
captain in connection with this appointment, was one of several
commissioners who set sail for South America in 1781. The
boundary to be laid down extended from the sea in the south-east,
to the Madeira below the junction of the Mamore and Guapore in
the north-west. It was divided into five sections, the second
pair of which, starting from the sea, were assigned to Azara as
his share of the work on hand.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Proceeding at
once to Asuncion, the capital of Paraguay, he began operations,
but soon found that the Portuguese commissioners, dissatisfied
with the course assigned by the treaty to the boundary, were in
no haste to complete their task, The delays thus occasioned were
utilised by Azara in extensive journeys on his own account
through various parts of Paraguay (which then extended much
beyond the limits of the modern state of that name), it being his
ambition to map the province for the first time in accordance
with the new standards of his day. From his description of the
methods he employed it is evident with what care and efficiency
his work was performed, and the result was the acquisition of a
knowledge of the Paraguay region far in advance of anything
previously available, though Azara was obliged to supplement his
own work with the most trustworthy of previous data. Not content
with a mere topographical survey, he devoted himself with
untiring energy to the investigation of the natural history of
the region&mdash;a task which he took up under serious
disadvantages as he had had no previous training in these
branches of study. But this want was in part at least made up for
by the extreme care with which his descriptions were written
down, so that his works on the natural history of Paraguay were
long drawn upon as standard authorities.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The two nearest the sea were assigned
to Azara's colleague Varela.]</p>
<p>After 13 years' work in the northern interior, Azara received
a new commission, being placed in charge of the whole southern
border, where the authorities were desirous of extending Spanish
influence in the regions of the Pampas Indians. The desert nature
of much of the country, and the risks of attack by the wild
inhabitants, rendered the task a difficult one, but here too a
greatly improved knowledge resulted from Azara's labours. After
completing this mission, he turned his attention to the region of
the lower Paraná (which was surveyed in conjunction with two
assistants, Cerviño and Ynciarte) and the district of Santa Fé.
After this he was sent to the eastern frontier, which he surveyed
and mapped, and his last service was the settlement of colonists
in this part of the country near the sources of the Ybicui. These
various labours occupied him till the beginning of the new
century, and it was only in 1801, after twenty years' arduous
work, that he received permission to return to Spain. He had
suffered much from the jealousy of the authorities in South
America&mdash;one viceroy even making the attempt to palm off
Azara's natural history memoirs as his own&mdash;and everything
had been done to prejudice him with the home government. That he
persevered with his (in part at least) self-imposed tasks in
spite of these drawbacks is one of his most cogent claims to our
admiration.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Owing to the obstacles put in his way
by his superiors, only a part of the voluminous results of
Azara's researches was published during his life-time, and at
least one important memoir did not see the light till our own
times.]</p>
<br>
<p>We must now go back somewhat in time, and consider the advance
effected during the eighteenth century in the northern half of
South America, where also some progress was made, though hardly
so much as further south, until a new era was opened by the
masterly labours of Humboldt begun in the last years of the
century. As mentioned in a previous chapter, the expeditions of
Teixeira and his colleagues on the main stream of the Amazon were
followed by inroads of Portuguese adventurers into the regions
watered by its various tributaries. Their main object was the
quest of slaves, which they procured by the detestable practice
of stirring up wars among the native tribes, and then "ransoming"
the captives taken by one side or the other. In this way, during
the first half of this century, they had begun to frequent the
region of the upper Rio Negro, and so to approach the Spanish
settlements pushed south from Venezuela by way of the Orinoco. As
usual, the most advanced posts were those established by the
missionaries, who had already settled in the region of the falls
on the middle course of the Orinoco. In order to gain a knowledge
of existing conditions in the frontier zone, Father Ramon set out
early in 1744 from the highest Spanish mission, and making his
way towards the upper river, encountered a party of Portuguese
slave-traders at the confluence of the two main upper
branches&mdash;the Guaviare from the west, and the shorter branch
conventionally known as the Upper Orinoco, from the east. He
accompanied them by way of the Cassiquiari&mdash;the stream which
connects the basins of the Orinoco and Amazon and of which, till
then, little precise information had been obtained&mdash;to the
Portuguese settlements on the Rio Negro, where, after waiting
some time, he met the Portuguese Jesuit Avogadro. He returned by
the same route, the existence of which he was thus the first to
make generally known, though its true character remained for some
time imperfectly understood by geographers in
Europe.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> Further work was done in the same
region 12 years later by a Government expedition under Iturriaga
and Solano&mdash;the latter acting as geographer&mdash;organised
a few years after the boundary treaty of 1750 spoken of above,
and generally known as the "expedition of the boundaries." Solano
founded a mission station at the confluence of the Guaviare and
Upper Orinoco, and this received the name San Fernando de
Atabapo, the Atabapo being a third stream which comes in from the
south at the same spot. The new settlement had many difficulties
to contend against and was forced to draw supplies from so
distant a base as Colombia, by way of the rivers Meta and
Vichada&mdash;a fact which is of interest as showing that a
certain amount of intercommunication across the still
little-known area east of the Andes of Colombia was possible even
at this date.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> A little later a renewal of
interest in the fabled El Dorado, with the city of Manoa and the
great lake Parime, then located by geographers to the south of
the Guianas, led to some journeys to the more easterly parts of
the borderland between the Orinoco and Amazon basins. The Spanish
governor of Angostura on the Lower Orinoco&mdash;Don
Centurion&mdash;was ambitious of effecting the long-dreamt-of
discovery, and various attempts were made, some by way of the
Caura and Paragua, but they either ended in disaster, or were at
least without practical result. The most important expeditions
were those of Nicolas Rodriguez and Antonio Santos (1775-1780),
the latter of whom is said to have made his way south by the
Caroni and Paragua Rivers and across the Pacaraima Mountains as
far as the Rio Branco in the north of the Amazon basin. But these
efforts were soon relaxed and no further light was thrown on this
part of South America until many years later.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Some information regarding Ramon's
journey was brought to Europe by the French scientific traveller
La Condamine, whose descent of the Amazon from Peru to the
Atlantic, to be spoken of shortly, took place about this
time.]</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> This region had been the scene of
several adventurous journeys in quest of El Dorado as early as
the 16th century (see introductory chapter), though these had not
been followed up.]</p>
<p>One other great undertaking in the northern half of South
America, of a character which places it in a category apart from
the pioneer work already dealt with, remains to be spoken of in
this chapter. This was the geodetic measurement for the
determination of the length of a degree of the meridian in the
equatorial region, carried out on the Andean tableland under the
auspices of the Paris Academy. It was the first great operation
of the kind ever undertaken, though carried out simultaneously
with a similar piece of work, taken up under the same auspices,
in the north of Europe; the object being to determine the figure
of the earth by a comparison of the length of the degree in
different latitudes.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The work near the
equator was entrusted to Bouguer, Godin, and La Condamine, who
sailed from La Rochelle in May, 1735, accompanied by the
physician Joseph de Jussieu and others. After some stay at the
island of San Domingo, the party went to Carthagena, where they
were met by the Spanish officers Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa,
who had been appointed by the King of Spain to aid the French
savants in their labours. The coast of Peru was sighted in March,
1736, and here Bouguer and La Condamine stayed behind for
scientific observations, all the party being once more reunited
at Quito by June of the same year. The geodetic operations were
carried out with the greatest precision then attainable, and
owing to the difficulties of the ground, the nature of the
climate, and other obstacles, occupied in all several years, much
valuable information on the nature and productions of the Andean
tableland being also collected. The final operations were
completed in March, 1743, Bouguer and La Condamine then returning
to Europe, while Godin, who had been joined in Peru by his wife,
remained some years longer. Bouguer, who returned by the sea
route, reached Europe first and presented the preliminary results
of the undertaking to the Academy, while La Condamine decided to
take the route of the Amazon across the entire breadth of South
America before embarking for France. His voyage down the great
river, though not actually opening up any unknown ground, was of
value as being the first descent of the Amazon by a trained man
of science, and his narrative did much to elucidate the geography
and ethnography of the region passed through <i>en route</i>.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The northern arc was measured in
Lapland, in the vicinity of the Arctic Circle. The French savants
in charge were Maupertuis, Clairaut, Camus, Monnier and the Abbé
Outhier, while they also had the cooperation of the Swedish
astronomer Celsius. These observers started in 1736, a year later
than the American party, but as the difficulties were
considerably less, the measurement was completed in a shorter
time than the other.]</p>
<p>Before finally returning to France Godin and his wife were
destined to experience the most distressing reverses of fortune.
Family affairs compelled the husband to proceed down the Amazon
in advance in 1749, and the war then in progress for years
frustrated all his efforts to return to fetch his wife. When
arrangements were at last made in 1766, his illness necessitated
the employment of an agent, who proved untrustworthy, and it was
not till 1769 that Madame Godin, accompanied by her two brothers,
at length set out by the route down the Pastaza for Loreto on the
Amazon, where a Portuguese vessel was awaiting her. The journey
was attended by the most harrowing experiences. Abandoned by
their native escort, and left destitute by the upsetting of their
canoe, the small party wandered through the pathless forests,
exposed to every kind of privation, to which all Madame Godin's
companions succumbed, leaving her to struggle on alone until
providentially succoured by Indians. Eventually she completed the
voyage to Pará, and thence rejoined her husband in Guiana after a
separation of over 20 years. Her experiences form one of the most
remarkable episodes in the whole history of travel.</p>
<p>It was in the closing year of the century that the most famous
scientific explorer of northern South America, Alexander von
Humboldt, began his epoch-making journeys, during the course of
which a flood of new light was thrown on the physical and human
geography of the Spanish territories now forming the Republics of
Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. But the story of these travels
belongs rather to the nineteenth than to the eighteenth
century&mdash;to the modern period of detailed scientific
research rather than to the pioneer stage with which we are here
mainly concerned.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>
<h4>ASIA, AFRICA, AND ARCTIC, 1700-1800</h4>
<p>We have seen in the last few chapters how, in the latter part
of the eighteenth century, vast tracts of land and sea had been
for the first time added to the known parts of the world,
particularly in the Pacific and Southern Oceans and in the
northern half of North America, in both of which regions a
beginning of scientific exploration and survey had been made. In
other parts of the world the progress was slower, and though some
important journeys are to be placed to the credit of this period,
they were rather of the nature of disconnected episodes than
stages in a continued course of progress, though to some extent
preparing the way for the more rapid advance which marked the
nineteenth century. This quickened activity set in in certain
regions, it is true, during the latter years of the previous
century, but as these first beginnings of methodical exploration,
particularly in Africa, belong more properly to the new period
then opening, which lies outside the scope of this volume, it
will be sufficient here to allude to them very briefly.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">I. <i>Asia</i>.</p>
<p>Beginning with Asia&mdash;the more eastern parts of which, as
explored by the Russians in the far north, and by Jesuit and
other missionaries within the limits of the Chinese Empire, have
been already dealt with in previous chapters&mdash;one or two
important journeys in the western and central parts, from the
side both of Russia and of India, remain to be mentioned. The
reign of Peter the Great, whose interest in the extension of
knowledge in the extreme east of his dominions has been spoken of
in the tenth chapter, saw the first beginnings of Russian
enterprise in the region to which the name Central Asia has been
more particularly applied&mdash;that of the vast steppes to the
east of the Caspian and the Khanates of Khiva and Bokhara along
the course of the Oxus. With a view to curbing the incursions of
the nomads of the steppes and opening up commercial intercourse
with the countries beyond, the Czar decided on steps for the
establishment of Russian influence in this region. In 1714 a
young Circassian, who had obtained a commission in the Russian
army and had taken the name Bekovich Cherkaski, was entrusted
with an embassy to the Khan of Khiva (who had offered to become a
vassal of the Czar) and was at the same time instructed to carry
out explorations in the country to be crossed <i>en route</i>. In
1715, Bekovich embarked on the Caspian, and followed its east
coast southward until he found a spot suitable for the erection
of a fort. Thence he went east into the desert and examined the
old bed of the Amu Darya or Oxus, the Czar being anxious to
ascertain whether it might be possible to bring back that river
into its ancient course towards the Caspian. Bekovich returned
from this expedition and made preparations for a renewal of the
enterprise with a stronger force. He set out again in 1717, with
a small army, numbering about 4000 in all, and this time
proceeded by land from the mouth of the Ural across the
inhospitable Ust Urt desert between the Caspian and the Sea of
Aral. At the lake known as Barsa Kilmas, near the south end of
Aral, he built a fort, the remains of which are still to be seen.
But he soon afterwards met with disaster at the hands of the new
Khan of Khiva, who viewed the Russian advance with suspicion, and
taking Bekovich's forces in detail, completely annihilated them.
Thus ended for a time the attempt to extend the Russian dominion
in this direction, though before the middle of the century a
portion of the Kirghiz hordes to the north had accepted the rule
of the then reigning empress, and the limits of the empire were
pushed forward to a line running roughly from the north end of
the Caspian to the head-waters of the Irtish.</p>
<p>In Siberia, the eighteenth century saw the first acquisition
of scientific knowledge, both in the field of geography, and in
those of ethnology and natural history. Between 1720 and 1726,
extensive journeys were made by the Prussian naturalist
Messerschmidt, who had taken service under the Russian Emperor.
Starting in 1720, and spending the first winter at Tobolsk, he
was joined by the Swedish prisoner Philipp Johann Tabbert, better
known by the name Strahlenberg which he adopted on being
subsequently ennobled by the King of Sweden.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup>
The two travellers set out in March, 1721, and explored portions
of the Obi and Yenesei systems. Strahlenberg then returned to
Sweden, where in 1730 he brought out a description of the whole
of Northern Asia, accompanied by a large map, which was long a
source of information on this part of the world. After his
departure, Messerschmidt descended the Yenesei almost to 66° N.,
but failed to reach the Arctic Ocean. Re-ascending the river he
started for Eastern Siberia, and having reached Nerchinsk by
water, crossed the steppes to the mines on the Argun and went
thence to the Dalai Nor. In 1725 he returned west and explored
portions of the Obi and Irtish, wintering on the latter river and
returning to St Petersburg in 1726. His labours meeting with
scant recognition, he sailed for his home at Danzig, but had the
misfortune to lose all his collections, and thereupon returned
once more to St Petersburg. But he still failed to secure due
recognition, and died in want in that city in 1735.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The various Swedes who went as
prisoners to Siberia at this time had been in the retinue of King
Charles XII in his ill-fated expedition to Russia.]</p>
<p>Another of the band of Swedes whom fortune carried to Siberia
after the disastrous campaign of Charles XII was Johann Gustaf
Renat, whose wanderings, according to documents brought to light
within recent years, seem to have extended to some of the inmost
recesses of Asia. He spent some years (1716-1733) among the
Kalmucks, and learnt much about the geography of those regions,
partly by enquiry and partly, it seems, by actual travel; some
supposing that he even visited Lop Nor. A map by his hand, based
no doubt to some extent on native information, represents the
general features of the central core of Asia&mdash;Dzungaria, the
Tarim basin and neighbouring districts&mdash;with considerable
accuracy, as is shown by the accompanying sketch of a
contemporary copy by Benzelstiern in
1738.<sup><b>[2]</b></sup></p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> A facsimile reproduction of the map was
published by the Russian Geographical Society in 1880; another,
on a smaller scale, in <i>Petermanns Mitteilungen</i> for
February, 1911.]</p>
<p>The labours of Müller, Gmelin the elder, and other savants
employed on land in connection with the great exploring projects
of Peter the Great have already been touched upon. Later in the
century, another series of important journeys was undertaken
under the orders of the Empress Catherine, and led to valuable
results. It having been decided to despatch a party of
astronomers to observe the transit of Venus in 1769&mdash;the
same which gave occasion for the first of Cook's great

<br>
<p>Among the savants thus named the best known for the extent of
his travels and the value of his observations was Peter Simon
Pallas, who left St Petersburg on June 21, 1768, on a series of
journeys which was to occupy fully six years. He devoted the
first two seasons to investigations in South European Russia and
the region of the Caspian, wintering first at Simbirsk and
secondly at Ufa. After the first winter he went south, in March,
1769, by Samara and Orenburg to Gurief at the mouth of the Ural,
whence he examined the shores of the Caspian to the south. The
summer of 1770 was spent in investigations of the geology and
mineralogy of the Ural range, especially in the mining districts
near Ekaterinburg. Towards the end of the year he turned his
steps eastward towards the remoter parts of Siberia, and after
wintering at Tobolsk made his way in 1771 to the then
little-known region of the Altai Mountains and the Upper Irtish,
where he again carried out fruitful researches concerning the
structure and conformation of the region. Continuing his eastward
progress he fixed his next winter quarters at Krasnoiarsk, and in
March, 1772, started for Irkhutsk, whence he crossed Lake Baikal
and visited the frontier town of Kiakhta and the region of the
Upper Amur. After another winter at Krasnoiarsk, where intense
cold was experienced, Pallas returned to Europe, devoting the
latter part of 1773 to further researches in the region of the
Lower Volga. Finally, after new journeys in the spring of 1774,
he once more reached St Petersburg on July 30 of that year.
Besides gathering much new information on the plants and animals
of the countries visited, he had made valuable observations in
regard to the origin of mountain ranges, and had carried out
careful enquiries into the conditions of commercial intercourse
between the Russian Empire and the territories adjoining it on
the south.</p>
<p>Another of the savants employed under the same scheme was
Samuel Gottlieb (or Theophilus) Gmelin, nephew of the elder
traveller of that name. He had made the acquaintance of Pallas
when studying at Leyden, and had subsequently, while at Paris,
secured the interest of the French botanist Adanson, eventually
becoming Professor of Botany at St Petersburg. Starting on his
travels, like Pallas, in June, 1768, he first visited the Valdai
hills and after wintering at Voronesh made his way south to the
shores of the Caspian. After a stay at Astrakhan, where he met
Guldenstaedt, another of the same band of investigators, he
embarked in June, 1770, on the waters of the Caspian. Touching at
Derbent and Baku he made his way to the Persian province of
Ghilan, on the south-western shore of the Caspian, where he
wintered at Enzeli. In 1771 he continued his journey in an
easterly direction, parallel to the southern coast of the
Caspian, and had reached the province of Mazandaran when he found
it impossible to advance further. Returning westward, he reached
Barfrush but was thrown into prison as a spy. Making his escape,
however, he once more reached Astrakhan in the spring of 1772,
and thence explored the steppes to the south. After a meeting
with Pallas, who had then completed his Siberian journeys, he
made a new start in 1773, this time taking the route to the east
of the Caspian, in the hope of continuing his researches in
Northern Persia. But the farthest point reached was Astrabad,
near the northern frontier of that kingdom, whence he found
himself compelled to retrace his steps to the Caspian. Crossing
that sea to Enzeli he went by land to Derbent (January, 1774),
but, difficulties arising with the native ruler, he was ordered
to leave and started north for the Terek. Even so, he failed to
elude his enemies, and was thrown into prison at Ahmetkent in the
Caucasus, where he died of disease in June of the same year. His
notes were afterwards published under Pallas's supervision, and
the results of his journeys were thus not entirely lost. They
consisted chiefly in an improved knowledge of the steppes on both
sides of the Caspian and of the wandering hordes inhabiting them,
as well as of the mountainous regions of Northern Persia, then
almost a <i>terra incognita</i> in Europe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the neighbouring and equally obscure region of the
Caucasus had been explored, apart from its snowy central
fastnesses, by a third member of the same association of
experts&mdash;Johann Anton Guldenstaedt&mdash;a native of Riga,
who after completing his education at Berlin and
Frankfort-on-Oder was summoned to St Petersburg to take his part
in the great exploration. Having wintered at Moscow, he set out
for the south in March, 1769. At Astrakhan, as already mentioned,
he met Gmelin, and in January, 1771, he reached the Terek, on the
threshold of the region assigned to him as his field of work.
During the next two years, he traversed the Caucasus in various
directions, making observations on the natural history, and on
the languages of the peoples inhabiting that region. During the
first season he attached himself to the suite of the Prince of
Georgia (south of the main chain), and thus visited Tiflis and
the districts to the south of that town. In 1772 he visited the
petty kingdom of Imeritia, still south of the range, but west of
Georgia, near the shores of the Black Sea. Thence he crossed the
range and devoted the next year to researches in the region to
the north of the Elburz group, including the district of Great
Kabarda and the country watered by the Kuma River. Turning his
steps homewards, he investigated the region of the Lower Don and
other parts of Southern Russia, and was on his way to the Crimea
when he was recalled to St Petersburg on the outbreak of war,
arriving there in March of 1773. The preparation of his material
for publication occupied some years, and he was carried off by
fever before any of the results of his journeys saw the light.
They were, however, eventually published, first by Pallas, and
subsequently in a corrected form by the Prussian savant Klaproth,
himself an explorer of the Caucasus early in the next
century.</p>
<p>Another of the same fraternity was the Swedish physician John
Peter Falk, who after taking his degree at the University of
Upsala, became Professor at St Petersburg, and received a
commission to travel in Siberia in 1768. In 1771-72 he studied
the countries watered by the Obi and Irtish, but suffering from
ever-increasing hypochondria, was forced to relinquish his task,
and in 1774 committed suicide. By these several explorations a
large amount of new information was gained on the detailed
geography of the Russian Empire in Asia, though as a general
knowledge of its outstanding features had been acquired
previously, no striking discovery on a large scale was
possible.</p>
<br>
<p>From the side of India some advance was also made into the
central core of the continent in the latter part of the
eighteenth century, though here too the field was not entirely
new, for the intercourse with Lhasa maintained by the various
missions in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries had
already spread some knowledge of Tibet among European nations.
But until the time we are speaking of no share in the work had
been claimed by Englishmen. It was under the enlightened
administration of Warren Hastings that the first British dealings
with Tibet took place. The immediate impulse to this intercourse
arose from the encroachments of the ruler of Bhutan&mdash;the
semi-independent state occupying the eastern part of the
Himalayan range&mdash;who in 1772 invaded the small state of Kuch
Behar to the north of Bengal. Military operations under Captain
John Jones, carried out in 1772-73, resulted in the expulsion of
the Bhutanese, followed by the intervention, as peacemaker, of
the Teshu (or Tashi) Lama&mdash;the head of one of the principal
sects in Tibet. This led to the organisation of a British
mission, which was instituted to carry on negotiations both with
the Deb Raja (the ruler of Bhutan) and with the Tashi Lama, whose
residence was at Tashi Lhunpo on the south side of the valley of
the Sanpo or upper Brahmaputra. The head of the mission was
George Bogle, an energetic and capable member of the Bengal civil
service, who was supported by Dr Alexander Hamilton, also a man
of considerable ability. The expedition set out in May, 1774,
proceeding through Kuch Behar and entering Bhutan by the Buxa
Duar route. At Tassisudon, the capital, negotiations with the new
Deb Raja were entered upon, and though difficulties were at first
put in the way of an advance into Tibet, permission was at last
given for the mission to proceed. The route led by Pari Jong
(near the head of the Chumbi valley between Bhutan and Sikkim)
and thence nearly due north until the valley of the Sanpo or
upper Brahmaputra was reached. The Tashi Lama was at the time at
a place called Desheripge to the north of that river, and thither
the mission proceeded. Bogle succeeded in establishing most
cordial relations with the Lama, who showed himself well disposed
to further the Governor-General's views of friendly intercourse
between India and Tibet.</p>
<p>A counter-influence was, however, at work at Lhasa, where the
Chinese agent did all he could to put obstacles in the way, and
this to some extent neutralised the efforts of the mission, a
firm refusal being given to the further entry of foreigners into
Tibet. Bogle returned with the Lama to his residence at Tashi
Lhunpo, on the southern side of the Sanpo valley, and, after some
stay there, set out on the return journey through Bhutan, where
further negotiations resulted in the Deb Raja's consenting to the
passage of merchandise through his country to and from India and
Tibet, though all efforts to obtain permission for English
merchants to enter the country proved unavailing.</p>
<p>In 1775 Bogle's companion, Dr Hamilton, was entrusted with a
second mission to Bhutan, for the purpose of discussing further
questions between the two countries, and, entering again by the
Buxa Duar route (as the shorter route by Lakhi Duar proved not
feasible), visited the Deb Raja at his winter residence at
Punakha. He returned in 1776 and was sent in 1777 on a third
mission to offer the Governor-General's compliments 10 a new Deb
Raja. In 1779, a new attempt to gain entrance into Tibet was
organised, and Bogle was again appointed to lead an expedition,
but this was abandoned on receipt of intelligence that the Tashi
Lama had undertaken a journey to Peking. He died there before the
close of 1780, Bogle himself also dying less than six months
later.</p>
<p>The Governor-General, however, still kept his object in view,
and in 1782 decided to send yet another mission to Tibet, the
occasion being offered by the supposed re-incarnation of the
Tashi Lama, who, according to the customary belief of the
Tibetans, was thought to have returned to this world in the
person of an infant. A young officer related to Warren
Hastings&mdash;Captain Samuel Turner&mdash;was placed in command,
two other Europeans, Lieutenant Samuel Davis and Dr Robert
Saunders, being appointed to accompany him. The mission, like
Bogle's, proceeded first to Bhutan, and the Raja's summer palace
at Tassisudon was reached in June, 1783. An insurrection against
the Raja caused some delay, but, this having been put down,
Turner and his companions paid a visit to the winter palace at
Punakha, as well as to the fort of Wandipore lower down the
valley in which Punakha is placed. Resuming their journey to
Tibet, they reached Tashi Lhunpo on Sept. 22 and stayed there
some time, holding intercourse with the Regent&mdash;a brother of
the late Tashi Lama. Early in December, Turner visited the infant
Tashi Lama at a monastery two days' journey to the south, and
then set out homewards, passing once more through Bhutan and
reaching Patna in March, 1784.</p>
<p>The observations made by Bogle and Turner during these
missions added much to the knowledge of Bhutan and Tibet
possessed by the English, although it was not till nearly a
century later that Bogle's journals and notes were made generally
available by being printed under the care of Sir Clements
Markham. The removal of Warren Hastings from the head of affairs
in India, in 1785, brought this intercourse to a close, and with
the exception of a single episode early in the nineteenth
century, when Thomas Manning&mdash;Charles Lamb's
friend&mdash;made his way to Lhasa in an unofficial capacity, no
further advance was made towards the opening of Central Tibet
till the beginning of the present century.</p>

<br>
<p>From one other corner of Asia we have to record the beginning
of scientific research before the close of the eighteenth
century, namely from Yemen in South-West Arabia&mdash;one of the
original homes of the coffee shrub, whence some trade in coffee
had already been developed by Dutch and English merchants trading
to the East. As the one productive portion of the vast peninsula
of Arabia, it was natural that it should early attract the
attention of investigators. The work to be done here was not
strictly of a pioneer character, for Yemen had several times
previously been visited by European travellers, from Varthema, in
the quite early days of European intercourse with the East, to
Englishmen like Sharpeigh, Middleton, and Jourdain, of the early
voyages of the English East India Company. The work now taken in
hand was therefore of a more detailed and scientific character,
attention being directed to such matters as the natural
resources&mdash;especially botanical&mdash;of the country, the
economic conditions of the people, and the fixing of positions
with the degree of accuracy attainable by the methods and
instruments of the time.</p>
<p>Like the Russian enterprises already spoken of, the scheme for
exploration in Arabia had the advantage of Royal patronage. The
enlightened monarch who supported it, and who himself drew up the
instructions for the participants, was Frederick V of Denmark, to
whom it seems to have been suggested by the learned Michaelis of
Göttingen, principally with a view to the elucidation of Biblical
questions. Five savants were appointed to take part in the
expedition, each an expert in some particular branch of
research&mdash;viz. Peter Forskall, a Swede (as botanist),
Frederick von Haven (linguist), Carsten Niebuhr (surveyor), C.C.
Cramer (zoologist), and W. Baurenfeind (artist)&mdash;no one of
these taking a decided precedence over the rest. A Danish ship of
war was placed at their disposal, and the party, having sailed
early in 1761, and having visited Constantinople and Egypt,
proceeded in the autumn of 1762 in a pilgrim ship to Jidda, on
the Arabian coast of the Red Sea. The fanatical hatred of
Europeans which has been as a rule one of the greatest obstacles
to the exploration of Arabia, was little in evidence at this
particular time, and the travellers found no great difficulties
placed in their way. From Jidda they coasted down to Loheia, and
there began their more special labours by carrying out excursions
through the Tehama, a lowland strip intervening between the Yemen
highlands and the Red Sea; touching also on the outer fringe of
the higher ground. Little by little they made their way south and
reached Mokha before the end of April, 1763. They had been
travelling in the hot weather and their health had suffered
seriously. Von Haven was the first to succumb, and was buried at
Mokha, the rest then deciding to move inland away from the
unhealthy coastlands. They went first to Tais, on the outer step
of the highlands, and were summoned thence by the Imam to Sana,
the capital of Yemen. Before reaching this a second of the party,
Forskall, fell a victim to the climate. At Sana, which was
reached about the middle of July, the three survivors were well
received, and during their short stay were
able&mdash;particularly Niebuhr&mdash;to make some useful
observations. They were now impatient to leave the country and
hastened back to Beit-el-Fakih (the chief coffee-mart) and thence
to Mokha, where they found a friend in an English merchant,
Francis Scott, who gave them a passage to Bombay. On the way
Baurenfeind died, and Cramer too succumbed after reaching India.
The one survivor, Niebuhr, returned home by the Persian Gulf,
Persia, and Asiatic Turkey, taking with him the copious notes and
observations secured by himself and his colleagues, all of which
were eventually utilised in the preparation of his great
Description of Arabia&mdash;one of the most important
geographical works produced during the eighteenth century,
embodying not only the results of actual observation in regard to
Yemen, but a fund of information which Niebuhr had been at pains
to gather from the natives of the country and others. It long
remained the standard authority on Arabia, and has not been
entirely superseded at the present day.</p>

<br>
<p>No further progress in the exploration of Arabia took place
until the next century.</p>
<br>
<p align="center">II. <i>Africa</i>.</p>
<p>In Africa the eighteenth century was, broadly speaking, a
period of stagnation as regards geographical discovery until its
closing years, when a new start, destined to lead to almost
uninterrupted progress down to our own times, was made. And
though the beginnings of this movement fell within the period now
under consideration, they were so closely interwoven with later
developments that they cannot suitably be described here. Less
closely connected with the modern period was the famous journey
of the Scottish traveller, James Bruce, through Abyssinia to the
source of the Blue Nile, but this forms a more or less isolated
episode, somewhat in advance of its time, and little in touch
with the work of the century as a whole. As a bold achievement,
marking the first important step towards the British exploration
of the African interior, Bruce's journey occupies a high place,
though its actual results from a geographical point of view have
sometimes been overrated&mdash;just as they were underrated by
many of the traveller's contemporaries. They were rather a
re-opening to European view of ground that had been temporarily
neglected than an actual unveiling of the unknown. As has been
narrated in an earlier chapter, the work of the Portuguese
Jesuits in the seventeenth century, and the relations sent home
by them to their superiors in Europe, had at the time made
Abyssinia almost the best known part of the African interior, and
the maps drawn in that century were not materially to be improved
upon until quite modern times. Bruce was himself aware of the
labours of the Jesuits, and, in particular, of the travels and
writings of Paez&mdash;the first white man to visit and describe
the source of the Blue Nile. But in his own narrative he somewhat
unfairly disparaged the work of his predecessors, with the
conscious or unconscious object of heightening the value of his
own achievements. He has been accused of actual dishonesty in
denying that the Jesuits had ever reached the sources, and it
seems almost certain that he might, had he taken the trouble,
have made himself better acquainted with what had previously been
accomplished. But considering the strenuous fight against
difficulties of all kinds that he maintained in his efforts to
grasp the coveted prize, there can hardly be a doubt that, at
least at the time of the journey, he honestly believed that he
was the first white man to have traced the Blue Nile to its
source. The far greater remoteness of the source of the White
Nile was then hardly suspected, the reaction against the earlier
hypothetic cartography of the African interior, encouraged by the
work of Delisle and D'Anville in France, having swept from the
map the representations of the Upper Nile lakes based on the
interpretation of Ptolemy's geographical account by the
cartographers of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>After engaging for a time in the wine trade, Bruce had
succeeded to his father's estate of Kinnaird, Stirlingshire, in
1758. He had a natural bent towards travel and adventure, and,
the problem of the Nile sources having been a subject of
discussion with his friends, became fired with the ambition of
solving it himself. As a step likely to open possibilities in the
desired direction he in 1763 accepted the post of Consul-General
at Algiers, and on leaving for that destination took with him
various scientific instruments, in the use of which he had
acquired some proficiency, for the purpose of observing the
transit of Venus then looked forward to by astronomers. He had
also acquired some slight knowledge of medicine&mdash;a
qualification which proved of much use during his travels. After
some residence in Algiers, he visited various parts of North
Africa, examining the antiquarian remains, and on one occasion
narrowly escaped with his life from a shipwreck on the coast of
Tripoli. Passing over to Crete and Asia Minor he eventually made
his way to Syria (where he visited the ruins at Palmyra and
Baalbek) and thence to Egypt, hoping there to find the means of
carrying his great design into execution, his correspondents in
Europe having now despatched to Alexandria the last of the
instruments necessary for the fixing of positions on his proposed
journey.</p>

<br>
<small>James Bruce. (From the Portrait in the National
Gallery.)</small></p>
<br>
<p>At Cairo, Bruce secured the countenance of Ali Bey, lately
restored to power after many vicissitudes of fortune, and
obtained letters of recommendation to the authorities in Upper
Egypt, as also from the Greek patriarch to the Greek Christians
in Abyssinia. Having completed his preparations he procured a
Nile boat of the kind known as <i>canja</i>, and set out to
ascend the river on December 12, 1768. A successful voyage,
during which he noted the various antiquities passed <i>en
route</i>, brought him to Syene (Assuan), whence, after fixing
the latitude and visiting the first cataract, he returned to
Keneh in order to take the desert route to the Red Sea at
Kosseir. This journey was made in company with a mixed and
disorderly caravan. At Kosseir, besides fixing the latitude, he
obtained a longitude by observations of Jupiter's satellites,
and, after a coasting trip to the "Mountain of Emeralds" (without
finding any trace of these gems), hired a vessel to convey him
down the Red Sea to Massaua, the final starting-point for the
journey into the interior.</p>
<p>The voyage in this native craft was by no means a luxurious
one. It began with a circuit of the northern end of the Red Sea,
and a visit to Tor on the south-west coast of the Sinai
peninsula, after which the vessel coasted down the Arabian side,
touching at various points <i>en route</i>. At Jidda Bruce found
a number of English merchantmen, and though his poverty-stricken
appearance secured him but a doubtful reception at first, the
merchants made up for the mistake, and on leaving he was honoured
with a salute from all the ships. During his stay he obtained
valuable letters of recommendation from the Sharif of Mecca, and
from his chief Minister, Metical Aga&mdash;himself a native of
Abyssinia, and a man of considerable influence on both sides of
the Red Sea. The support of this ally proved invaluable in the
sequel. From Loheia, further down the coast&mdash;after a trip to
the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb&mdash;the voyagers crossed over by
the Dhalak archipelago to Massaua on the African side of the Red
Sea, the passage being signalised by the supposed appearance of a
ghost on board, by which the crew were much terrified, and by the
running of the vessel on a reef, from which however it was
happily got off without serious damage. Massaua was reached on
September 19, 1769, and Bruce thus found himself on the threshold
of the most serious part of his enterprise.</p>
<p>In the further prosecution of his task Bruce was faced by many
obstacles. The rapacious and overbearing character of the petty
chief of Massaua more than once threatened a catastrophe, and the
difficulties were by no means over when he was at last fairly
started for Gondar. The steep ascents of the plateau escarpments,
first by the pass of Taranta to the highlands of Tigre, and
afterwards by that of Lamalmon to the still higher plateau on
which Gondar is placed, were exceedingly arduous, the transport
of the large quadrant for astronomical work proving especially
troublesome. As the strongest of the party the traveller took a
personal share in the labour. The country too was in a disturbed
state owing to the campaign then in progress between the old
General Ras Michael (acting on behalf of the young King Tecla
Haimanout, whom he had set up after deposing two others) and the
insurgent Fasil. Arrived in safety at the capital, Bruce was
favourably received by the Queen-mother, and his services as
physician were soon requisitioned, several members of the Royal
household being ill with small-pox. The success of his treatment
procured him her patronage throughout his stay in Abyssinia. On
the return of the King and Ras Michael, he was received in
audience, and, according to his own account, as a step towards
the execution of his task, was granted the governorship of the
province of Ras-el-Fil, containing the source of the Blue Nile of
which he was in quest. But a favourable opportunity for
travelling thither was long in coming. The traveller's health
declined, and he retired for a time to Emfras, on a hill
overlooking Lake Tsana, whence he paid a visit to the cataract of
Alata&mdash;on the Blue Nile below its exit from the
lake&mdash;which had already been described by the Jesuits. He
afterwards joined the King and Ras Michael during an expedition
across the Nile against Fasil, but this proved disastrous and
ended in a disorderly retreat. By a sudden <i>volte-face</i>,
however, Fasil made his peace with the King, and this gave the
traveller the chance he had been waiting for so long, as the
insurgent chief dominated the country about the Nile source.
After witnessing the retirement of the King and Michael to Tigre,
he set out once more from Gondar on October 28, 1770, proceeding
at once to Fasil's camp with letters of recommendation. His
reception was at first anything but satisfactory, but his bold
front impressed the chief, who became suddenly gracious, and gave
him the facilities he required, binding his Galla subordinates by
a solemn obligation to forward the traveller's wishes in every
possible way, and giving him his own horse as a token of his
protection.</p>
<p>Starting on November 2, and passing through a beautiful
country, Bruce once more crossed the Nile above its entrance into
Lake Tsana, finding it a rapid stream nearly 100 yards wide, and
four feet deep in the centre. It forms a cataract in this
neighbourhood, but this was found to have a height of barely 15
feet. The route now led towards a gently rising hill, near the
top of which was the church of St Michael of Geesh. From this
spot the traveller's eyes were at last gratified by the sight of
the fountains, whence, beside a hillock, of green sod, the Blue
Nile has its first small beginnings. Casting off his shoes in
deference to the feelings of the natives, who regarded the spot
as possessing a special sanctity, he rushed down the flowery
slope and, standing by the principal fountain, indulged the
feelings of rapture induced by the thought that he had at last
gained the prize for which he had laboured so long.</p>
<p>Bruce flattered himself that he had thus solved the ancient
mystery of the Nile sources, though on the one hand he was not
the first European to visit the fountains of the Blue Nile, and
on the other he had done nothing at all to unveil the far more
remote sources of the White Nile. But in once more describing to
the world the hydrography of a portion of the Nile system which
plays a part of prime importance in the general regime of the
river and its inundations, he had performed a service of distinct
value, if not of the unique importance he was inclined to claim
for it. Now that his task was accomplished his one wish was to
set out on his homeward journey, but on returning to Gondar he
found himself condemned to weary waiting owing to the continued
political disturbances. At last, in December, 1771, over a year
after his return from the Nile source, he was able to set out by
the land-route to Egypt through Sennar.</p>
<p>Descending the western escarpment of the Abyssinian highland,
through a thickly wooded country, the traveller joined in a grand
battue held by one of the royal princes, and was treated to a
display of the methods of elephant-hunting of the Arab swordsmen
known as Agagir. Reaching Sennar after some adventures, he found
himself surrounded by enemies, whose intrigues thwarted him at
every turn, and it was only by selling a good part of the gold
chain given him by the Abyssinian king that he at last procured
the means of continuing his journey. The passage of the dreaded
Nubian desert proved well-nigh disastrous, the small party coming
near suffocation by the parching simoom, being overwhelmed by
moving pillars of sand, or perishing of thirst after the
water-supply had given out. They struggled into Assuan (Syene)
after abandoning most of their impedimenta, but by sending back a
party Bruce was able to rescue the precious notes and
observations made during his extensive journeyings. The further
journey to Cairo was accomplished without serious difficulty, the
Egyptian capital being reached on January 10, 1773.</p>
<p>Although Bruce had made few if any positive geographical
discoveries, his journey was important, by reason of the general
attention it attracted in Europe, as a stimulus to further
interest in African exploration, to be seriously taken in hand
not many years later. And his narrative, published some time
after his return, in spite of occasional exaggerations and
embellishments, has remained one of the most striking pictures of
exploration that have come down to us. The strangeness of some of
the details caused the whole, quite undeservedly, to be viewed
with suspicion by his contemporaries, whose verdict has however
been reversed by later generations. The five bulky volumes in
which it originally appeared embody, if in somewhat undigested
form, a large amount of information on the history and manners of
the Abyssinians, as well as on the geography of their
country.</p>
<br>
<p>The only other part of Africa where exploration made any great
headway during the eighteenth century was the extreme south.
Here, after long forming merely a port of call for Portuguese,
English, and Dutch ships <i>en route</i> for the East Indies, the
Cape had at last begun to be settled by the Dutch about the
middle of the previous century, farms being established for the
supply of provisions to the ships. The arrival of the French
Huguenots in 1688 had an important effect in necessitating the
occupation of new land, while the desire to escape the exactions
of the Dutch East India Company's officials led the "burghers"
(as the settlers were termed in distinction from the officials)
to push farther afield than at first. Even in the seventeenth
century some attention had been paid to exploration pure and
simple. In 1655 Jan Wintervogel had carried out an expedition to
the north, and the work was continued by Gabbema and others in
1657-8. In 1660 the governor Van Riebeck sent out a party to seek
for the empire of Monomotapa, which previous maps had so
misplaced as to encourage the belief that it lay at no great
distance from the Cape. The expedition, which was headed by Jan
Danckert, passed the Olifants River, but returned without
advancing any great distance beyond. A somewhat greater advance
northward was made in 1661 by two parties under Pieter Cruythof
and Pieter van Meerhof, and both of these went on a second
expedition in 1662, during the course of which they came upon
representatives of the Bushmen&mdash;that wandering race from
whose treacherous attacks the colonists had afterwards to suffer
so much. Another noteworthy expedition was that of Lieutenant
Hieronymus Cruse, eastward to Mossel Bay, in 1668. But the most
famous journey was that of the governor Simon van der Stell in
1685. It occupied five months and the European personnel amounted
to over 50, with native followers in proportion. The principal
object was the discovery of the copper district of Little
Namaqualand, which it succeeded in reaching, returning by a
different route along the west coast.</p>
<p>In spite of these efforts, the greater part of the South
African interior, even south of the Orange River, remained
virtually unknown at the opening of the new century, during the
course of which a more decided advance was to be made.</p>
<p>Quite early in the eighteenth century some attention was
turned to the south-east coast, as offering a possible field for
settlement, and especially for the supply of timber to the more
sparsely-wooded west. An expedition was sent to Natal by sea in
1705 in the <i>Postlooper</i>, with Theunis van der Schelling as
master, but it accomplished little. In 1720 a Dutch fort was
established on the coast of Delagoa Bay, which had been abandoned
by the Portuguese some years before. The bay was sounded and
charted, and some attempt made to explore the neighbourhood, but
the settlers had to encounter many obstacles. In the hope of
finding a way to the reported gold fields of the interior, an
expedition under one Jan Mona started inland in 1725, but it was
attacked by the natives and forced to return without penetrating
any great distance. Of land expeditions from the Cape during the
early part of the century one deserving mention is that of
Hermanus Hubner, who in 1736 led a strong party of
elephant-hunters eastward towards the Kafir country on the
south-east coast. It was important as one of the first which
brought the Dutch into contact with the Bantu tribes of the east,
their previous intercourse having been almost entirely with the
Hottentots. The party seems to have reached the lands of the
Xosas, Tembus, and Pondos,<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> by whom they were
at first received with friendliness, but on reaching the Xosas on
the return journey a treacherous attack was made on Hubner's
section of the expedition, and he and all with him were
massacred, and the waggons burnt. The rest, though pursued,
succeeded in making their escape, and on reaching Cape Town gave
the authorities an account of their journey.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> The last are spoken of as "Nomotis."
Among them three Englishmen were found living like natives.]</p>
<p>Although this expedition had advanced farther east than any
previous one, it was of an unofficial character, and the
geographical information it brought back was far from precise.
But under the energetic administration of Governor Tulbagh, which
began in 1651, exploration was more actively supported by the
government, and some important results were gained. An
elaborately organised expedition was despatched eastward early in
1752 under August Frederik Beutler, supported by an escort of
soldiers, as well as by two surveyors, a botanist, various
artificers, and others. It was in all respects the best-equipped
expedition that had left the Cape down to that time. The Gouritz
River was crossed, Mossel Bay passed, and on April 5 the last
settlement towards the east, a short distance beyond the Little
Brak River, was reached. Crossing the mountains, the expedition
traversed the valley known as the Long Kloof, running east
between two ranges, and reached the sea at the present St Francis
Bay. The party now kept more or less close to the sea, examining
the shores of Algoa Bay and crossing the Great Fish and other
rivers. Early in June, the boundary between the Hottentots and
Bantu, at the Keiskama River, was passed, and the country became
more thickly peopled. The scene of Hubner's massacre was passed,
but the force was sufficiently strong to command respect. The Kei
was crossed on July 3, and friendly intercourse established with
the Tembu chief Tzeba. The fatigues experienced now began to
tell, both on the men and the oxen, so after advancing a few days
longer in a north-easterly direction, it was decided, on July 10,
to turn back.</p>
<p>During the return journey, a somewhat more inland route was
adopted, for a part of the way, than on the outward march, and
some new country, inhabited by Bushmen, was passed through. The
Fish River valley was ascended for some distance, but the country
here was suffering from a severe drought, and both grass and
trees were burnt up. The explorers therefore turned once more
towards the sea, and while some took a direct route to the Cape,
the leader, according to instructions, endeavoured to find a bay
reported to exist in the neighbourhood where Knysna lagoon has
since been found. He did not reach its shores, but gave up the
attempt and was back in Cape Town early in November.</p>
<p>This achievement marks the farthest advance eastward for many
years, and subsequent efforts were for some time directed rather
to the north and north-east. It is not certain when the largest
South African river&mdash;the Orange&mdash;was first reached, but
at any rate it seems to have been first crossed in 1760, by a
settler named Jacobus Coetsee, who went north with a party of
Hottentots to hunt elephants, and gained intelligence of the
black-skinned Damaras ("Damroquas", as he heard them called) some
distance beyond his turning-point. This adventure led the way to
further advance in the same direction, for, Coetsee's story
having come to the ears of a militia officer, Hendrik Hop, the
latter made a successful application for the command of an
exploring expedition, which included the surveyor Brink, the
botanist Auge and the surgeon Rykvoet, the last also taking
charge of the mineralogical work. A start was made on August 16,
1761, from a point near the mouth of the Olifants River, the
whole caravan numbering over 80 persons, including 13 who
accompanied the party as settlers. Passing the Copper Mountains,
visited by the great expedition of Van der Stell in 1685, the
expedition reached the Orange River at the end of September, and,
crossing it, held on a northerly course between 18° and 19° E.
long, and reached a point probably in about S. lat. 26°. The heat
and scarcity of water then made it necessary to turn back, and
some time was spent on the banks of the Orange, where a sudden
flood during the night of January 11, 1762, placed the party in
some danger. While among the "Great" Namaquas north of the river
enquiries were made as to the peoples of the region beyond, and
intelligence seems to have been gained, under the name "Briquas",
of a section of the great Bechuana tribe. Giraffes were seen to
the north of the Orange, and the skin of one was brought
back.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The expedition was back in April,
having achieved a considerable measure of success.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> It was sent to the Museum at Leyden by
the Governor, and was the first to find its way to Europe.]</p>
<p>The expedition of Governor Van Plettenberg to the north-east
and east in 1778 had political rather than geographical aims,
though it led through some of the less-known border districts in
the directions specified. The next important contributions to
geographical knowledge were due to British
travellers&mdash;Captain (afterwards Colonel) Robert J. Gordon, a
Scottish officer who had taken service with the Dutch, and
Lieutenant William Paterson, who came to the Cape in order to
satisfy his bent for travel and natural history studies in a new
country. Their journeys were made partly in company, though some
of the more important results were due to Gordon alone. Both
arrived at the Cape during 1777&mdash;Gordon (who, according to
Paterson, had already travelled a good deal in the interior) as
second in command of the Cape garrison. They left Cape Town in
company on October 6, and went somewhat north of east up the
valley of the (eastern) Olifants River&mdash;the upper course of
the Gouritz. Arrived near its source, Paterson, who was suffering
from ill-health, decided to stay behind, while Gordon proceeded
north-east, through the Bushmen's country, towards the
Sneeuwberg. In this, as in his subsequent journeys, Paterson paid
especial attention to the botany, getting together a valuable
collection of South African plants, but also securing specimens
of the birds, etc. Gordon crossed the Sneeuwberg and reached the
Orange River near the junction of its upper course with the
second main branch&mdash;the Vaal&mdash;which he seems to have
been the first to locate on the map. He was unable, however, to
find a ford, and so returned without crossing to the northern
bank.</p>

etc.)</small></p>
<br>
<p>Paterson set out again in May, 1778, and this time had the
company of a young Dutch gentleman, Mr Van Reenen, member of a
family which owned several farms in the interior, and which
subsequently showed considerable enterprise in the way of
exploration. The two travellers experienced some difficulty from
the snow-covering of the mountains, but by making a circuit to
the east across the Karroo reached the Roggeveld, and then went
somewhat west of north till they struck the Orange in its lower
course, after experiencing a trying time in crossing the sandy
desert south of it. They crossed the river by swimming, and
Paterson, besides engaging in his usual botanical researches,
secured a number of beautiful birds, while Mr Van Reenen shot a
giraffe. The return was in a generally southward direction
through the copper district already well known to the Dutch, Cape
Town being reached on November 20. A month later Paterson again
set out, intending now to visit the Kafir country on the extreme
eastern borders of the Colony. He was again accompanied by Van
Reenen, and succeeded in advancing some distance beyond the Great
Fish River, though the waggon could not be taken on during the
last stages owing to the thickness of the bush. Paterson claims
to have been the first European to have penetrated into the Kafir
country, meaning, no doubt, the first of European birth, as the
colonists had already gone a good deal beyond his
turning-point.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The return journey calls for
no special remark.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Dr Andrew Sparrman, the Swedish
naturalist who accompanied Capt. Cook during the first voyage of
the <i>Resolution</i>, had also visited the borders of
Kafir-land, and his general account of his South African travels,
before and after that voyage (1772 and 1775-6), forms one of the
most important items in the literature of South African travel in
the eighteenth century, though he did little actual
exploration.]</p>
<p>After three months, <i>i.e</i>. towards the end of June, 1779,
Paterson was ready to set out again accompanied by Sebastiaan Van
Reenen,<sup><b>[2]</b></sup> a brother of whom, Jacobus by name,
subsequently joined the party too. This fourth journey led nearly
due north and was made for the most part in company with Colonel
Gordon (as he now was), whom Paterson joined on the banks of the
Green River, near the Kamisberg. The usual difficulties from want
of water and grass were encountered, and various members of the
party had unpleasant experiences through losing their way in the
desert, but they came safely through in the end. The Orange River
was at last reached on August 17, the unwonted greenery and
abundant water-supply making it seem to the travellers a new
creation after their nine days' transit across an arid and sultry
desert. Colonel Gordon had brought a boat, which he launched the
same evening at the river's mouth, hoisting Dutch colours and
giving the river the name which it has since generally borne in
Europe, in honour of the Prince of Orange. Excursions were made
in the neighbourhood, and on the 25th the party set out
eastwards, ascending the valley of the Orange for some distance
through a barren hilly country. On the 29th they left the river,
returning southward to recruit at a Dutch homestead, but again
going north to examine a part of the river above that previously
visited. Paterson and Gordon soon separated, the latter going
east, while Paterson and Van Reenen crossed the Orange and went
north-east, through a country still barren and hilly, in which a
specimen of the giraffe was secured. On October 21 they
re-crossed the river, and Paterson made the homeward journey in
leisurely fashion, investigating the botany of the country. He
was back at Cape Town on December 21.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>2</b> It does not appear from Paterson's
narrative whether this was the same member of the family as had
been his companion previously.]</p>
<p>By these several journeys a fair general knowledge of the
lower course of the Orange, for a considerable distance from the
sea, had been gained.</p>
<p>Another traveller from Europe&mdash;the French naturalist Le
Vaillant&mdash;visited the Cape the year after the journey just
described, and travelled extensively in the interior. He made a
first journey in 1780-82, visiting the borders of the Kafir
country and returning from the Sneeuwberg across the Great
Karroo; and a second in 1783-85, during which he went north
across the Lower Orange.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> His graphic
narratives are perhaps the best known of all the similar works on
South Africa which appeared during the eighteenth century, but
they have been generally regarded as not entirely trustworthy in
matters of detail. The Dutch, whose exploring activity (if we
except the work of Colonel Gordon, a Scotsman by birth) had been
somewhat in abeyance during the 'seventies and 'eighties, again
showed some enterprise during the last decade of the century. One
of the Van Reenens, Willem by name, who owned a farm on the
Olifants River, came forward in 1791 and undertook an expedition
to the north with a view of testing the truth of the idea that
gold was to be found in the desert region north of the Orange
River. With several Dutch companions, including one Pieter Brand,
he started in September, 1791, crossed the Orange in November,
and pushed on beyond the farthest point reached by Hop 30 years
earlier. At a mountain occupied by Namaqua Hottentots, with whom
a collision took place, a camp was formed, and exploring trips in
the surrounding country were undertaken. The mountain, which Van
Reenen named Rhenius after the then Governor at the Cape, seems
to have been somewhere near the latitude of Walvisch Bay. Brand
went 15 days farther north, through country occupied by a branch
of the Damaras (dark-skinned Bantu people) who had been subjected
by the Namaquas, and seems to have met with representatives of
the wild tribe since known as Hill Damaras. The camp at Mount
Rhenius was shifted in March, 1792, but a further halt of some
weeks was made not far off, in a locality where game was
abundant. The waggons having been loaded with ore&mdash;in
reality copper, but thought at the time to contain gold&mdash;the
return march was begun, and, further investigations having been
made on the way, Van Reenen's farm was safely reached in June,
1792.</p>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> In the map accompanying Le Vaillant's
narrative of his travels, the distances traversed were greatly
exaggerated. Thus the route followed on the first journey is
extended to the neighbourhood of Natal, and that on the second to
the tropic of Capricorn, though Barrow (see below) showed reason
for believing that he had not advanced beyond the Orange River.
Not content with finding many new species of birds, Le Vaillant
brought back a number of "faked" species&mdash;tail of one kind,
wings of another, etc. Many of these were found out long after
his death on being remounted.]</p>
<p>This expedition had done more than any previous one to throw
light on the country and peoples north of the Orange River, but,
not content with what they had accomplished, the Van Reenens
applied to the authorities for aid in a new venture. Two of the
family, Sebastiaan and Dirk Gijsbert van Reenen, obtained a
passage in the government vessel <i>Meermin</i>, commissioned to
take possession, on behalf of the Dutch East India Company, of
various points on the coast of Great Namaqualand, north of the
Orange&mdash;a coast hitherto unclaimed, though for some time
frequented by whalers. Before the <i>Meermin</i> sailed, a land
party had been despatched under Barend Freyn, who had taken part
in Willem van Reenen's expedition, and had heard of the existence
of a friendly Hottentot chief named Ynemand. He set out before
the end of 1792 with orders to try to reach this chief's
residence; the Van Reenens' plan being to land on the south-west
coast, and, pushing inland, to effect a junction with Freyn. The
first point touched at by the <i>Meermin</i> was the island since
known as Possession. Here the Company's flag was hoisted, and the
ship proceeded to the neighbourhood of Angra Pequeña (a locality
which came into prominence a century later in connection with the
German occupation of this coast). where explorations were carried
out without any trace of Freyn being met with. The voyage was
therefore continued to Walvisch Bay, where Pieter Pienaar, a
member of the Van Reenens' party, was sent to explore inland. He
returned after three weeks with no tidings of the land
expedition, which, as it afterwards turned out, had found the
excessive drought an insuperable obstacle to an advance. It was
therefore decided to return, and beyond a partial examination of
this inhospitable strip of coast, whose moving dunes have stood
in the way of thorough exploration down to our own day, no very
important geographical results were gained.</p>
<p>This was the last serious attempt at northern exploration
under the Dutch regime, for the political events at the close of
the century, which ended in the British occupation of the colony,
engrossed the attention of the government. After the surrender to
the British, a journey of considerable extent through the
interior was made by Mr (afterwards Sir John) Barrow, who had
been sent out officially in connection with the establishment of
the new government. Barrow's narrative, published in two parts in
1801 and 1804, long remained one of the most used sources of
information on South Africa, though the ground traversed by him
had already, for the most part, been made known by previous
travellers. His farthest in the interior was at a point on the
Upper Orange River, beyond the Sneeuwberg, and above the junction
with the northern tributary, the Vaal. This was the only portion
of his route which led him much beyond the limits of the country
settled by the Dutch.</p>
<p>The journeys described in this chapter had resulted in a fair
general knowledge of the interior up to the line of the Orange
River, and had shed some light on the tracts immediately north of
its lower course. They constituted a stage in the progress of
exploration in South Africa, and it was not until well on in the
next century that a further decided step forward was made,
leading to the unveiling of the more distant interior up to and
beyond the Zambezi.<br></p>
<p align="center">III. <i>Arctic</i>.</p>
<p>In the first chapter of this book we spoke of the great period
of Arctic Exploration which began about 1550 and was
characterised, firstly by the search for a northern passage to
the East Indies, and secondly by the whaling enterprise in the
northern seas, chiefly around Spitsbergen. During the whole
subsequent period, between the first quarter of the seventeenth
and the last quarter of the eighteenth century&mdash;<i>i.e</i>.
for about a century and a half&mdash;a pause in Arctic discovery
ensued, and so little had been effected that material for a
continuance of the story has been almost entirely lacking. The
early activity had been called into play by practical
considerations, and when it had been virtually established that
no feasible route for trade purposes existed in the far north,
the inducement to continue the struggle was in great measure
removed. Two or three voyages from this intermediate period must,
however, be referred to before touching upon the Arctic
occurrences of later date.</p>
<p>Among the voyages of the Dutch whalers and walrus hunters
subsequent to 1625, the one which has attained most celebrity is
that of Willem de Vlamingh in 1664. According to the statement of
Witsen, this bold seaman, during a voyage to Novaya Zemlya,
rounded the northern extremity of the group, and passing near the
scene of Heemskerk's and Barents's distressful wintering on the
east coast, sailed E.S.E. to a point in 74°, where he saw nothing
but open water. It is sometimes stated that De Vlamingh visited
the winter quarters of the earlier Dutch voyagers, but as no
mention is made of the house there erected (which was still
standing in the latter half of the nineteenth century), it is
probable that no landing was made on this side of Novaya Zemlya.
Another statement of Witsen, on which implicit trust cannot be
placed, is to the effect that in 1700 Captain Cornelius Roule had
sailed north in the longitude of Novaya Zemlya and had sighted a
previously undiscovered land. As has been so often the case in
Polar voyages, it is probable that a bank of fog had been
mistaken for land. Various rumours were also current at this
time, in Holland and elsewhere, that ships had either sailed
right up to the Pole itself, or had made the voyage from Japan to
Europe across the Polar basin, reaching a latitude of 84°. But
all such statements, like the similar claim said to have been
made by Mandeville three centuries earlier, are obviously purely
imaginative.</p>
<p>Partly through trust in these statements, and partly from a
study of the voyages of Barents and other early navigators, and
from theoretic considerations, an Englishman, Captain John Wood,
put forward a scheme for a voyage through the polar sea in search
of a passage to Japan and Tartary, which he thought would most
probably be found midway between Spitsbergen and Novaya Zemlya,
as the ice, in his view, would cause most obstruction near a
coast-line. Having obtained the support of the King, the Duke of
York, and other influential persons, he sailed in 1676 with two
ships&mdash;H.M.S. <i>Speedwell</i> and the <i>Prosperous</i>
pink&mdash;the latter in command of Captain William Flawes. But
the voyage was unfortunate. Unbroken ice was found to bar the way
wherever a passage was attempted, and the ships could not advance
beyond 76° N. Encountering stormy weather and thick fog in the
ice off the coast of Novaya Zemlya, the <i>Speedwell</i> ran on a
rock on June 29 and was lost, the <i>Prosperous</i> narrowly
escaping a like fate thanks to her smaller size. Wood and his men
got to land with great difficulty, and found themselves in almost
hopeless case until providentially rescued by Captain Flawes. The
result was entirely to shatter Wood's belief in the chances of a
passage, and to make him brand as intentionally misleading the
reports which had seemed to favour such a possibility. Naturally,
nothing further was done to prosecute the search.</p>
<p>Another voyage of this period deserving mention is that of the
German surgeon Frederik Martens, who in 1671 visited Spitsbergen,
and wrote an excellent account of that ice-bound land, on which
it long remained the standard authority.</p>
<p>From the early part of the 18th century the only voyage to
this part of the Arctic regions which calls for notice is that of
the Dutch whaling captain, Cornelis Gillis or Giles, to the
north-east of Spitsbergen in 1707. In this year the sea appears
to have been particularly free from ice in these parts, for
Gillis was able to pass the latitude of 81° to the north of the
Seven Islands, and then sailed east in an open sea until, bending
his course to the south-east and south, he came, in 80°, to new
land that was not again sighted for over a century and a half. It
must have been the White Island of modern navigators, lying
between Spitsbergen and Franz Josef Land, which forms an
inaccessible mass of snow-covered land. Gillis is said to have
returned through Hinlopen Strait, and did not therefore complete
the circumnavigation of the Spitsbergen group. He seems to have
made accurate surveys of its coasts, though little was known of
his voyage until, nearly 70 years later, his papers fell into the
hands of the English writer, the Hon. Daines Barrington, and so
attained publicity.</p>
<p>Of the Arctic voyages during the eighteenth century some have
already been spoken of in chapters dealing primarily with other
parts of the world. The Russian surveys on the north coast of
Siberia have been described in Chapter x, while in dealing with
Captain Cook's voyages it was necessary to pass from the Pacific
to the Arctic Ocean in telling of the attempt to push north
through Bering Strait which formed one of the main tasks laid
down in the programme of the third voyage. Again, certain
attempts from the side of Hudson Bay have fallen naturally into
place when speaking of the exploration of Northern Canada. One or
two other efforts at northern discovery during our period remain
to be mentioned here. None was in itself of great importance, but
one at least&mdash;that of Captain Phipps in 1773&mdash;marks a
new start in Arctic enterprise, and may be regarded as
constituting to some extent a preliminary stage of the great
Arctic campaign of the nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries.</p>
<p>It was once more to the initiative of a private individual
that the impulse in this direction was due. The Hon. Daines
Barrington, a son of Viscount Barrington and brother of a
distinguished admiral and also of a bishop, having turned his
attention to the subject of Arctic voyages, collected all the
information thereon that he could lay hands on, and placed it
before the Royal Society with a view to showing that the
attainment of the North Pole itself was quite a feasible project.
This was perhaps the first time that this object was held out as
something to be striven for in itself, the earlier Arctic
ventures having almost invariably been undertaken with some
practical and commercial aim in view. The age of scientific
exploration was now beginning, and the scheme set on foot by
Barrington was but one out of many manifestations of the spirit
of enquiry now abroad, which, as we have seen already, found its
opportunity during the period of peace ushered in by the Treaty
of Paris in 1763. As a matter of fact Barrington's information
was far from trustworthy, but he succeeded in interesting the
Royal Society in the matter, and, this body having approached the
King through the Earl of Sandwich, the despatch of a Government
expedition was resolved upon.</p>
<p>The command was entrusted to Captain Constantine Phipps
(afterwards Lord Mulgrave), who sailed in the <i>Racehorse</i>,
while a second ship, the <i>Carcass</i>, was placed under the
command of Commander Lutwidge. Both vessels were of the kind
technically known as bombs, and were therefore unusually strong
and specially suited for ice-navigation. They were fitted out
with great completeness, and, among other appliances, their
equipment included the apparatus for distilling water invented by
Dr Irving, who sailed in the <i>Racehorse</i> as
surgeon.<sup><b>[1]</b></sup> The ships left Deptford towards the
end of May, 1773, finally sailing from the Nore on June 10. After
some delay from unfavourable winds and fogs, the expedition was
off the south part of Spitsbergen before the end of the month,
the weather remaining mild. The land was sighted on the 29th in
about 77° 59' N., being composed of high black rocks, with
snow-filled valleys. Continuing their northerly course past
Magdalena Hoek, the navigators reached the ice-field on July 5,
and now began a vain attempt to find a passage through it. At
first they pushed through the looser ice towards the north-west,
but on the 9th, having reached by their reckoning Long. 2° 2' E.
in about Latitude 80° 36' N., found the main field to form a
compact impenetrable body, and therefore turned eastward once
more. After anchoring on the 13th at Vogelsang near the rocky
point called the Cloven Cliff, they made successive attempts to
push east or north, but in vain. In the former direction the ice
joined the land, while to the north, in about Lat. 80° 37' N., it
ran in an unbroken line from east to west. Passing in sight of
the Seven Islands, the ships reached the mouth of Vaigatz Strait,
where one of the boats had an adventure with a number of
walruses. The weather was delightful and the sea smooth, but the
ice soon began to close round the ships. It was feared that they
would not get clear, and preparations were made for abandoning
them, but thanks to a favouring wind they were forced through on
August 10, and once more reached open water. In view of the
lateness of the season, Captain Phipps now decided to return, and
after a favourable passage reached the Nore on September 25. The
results of the voyage were purely negative the ice having
apparently offered an unusually solid barrier, though the weather
conditions had been favourable. Little encouragement was
therefore forthcoming for a renewal of the attempt, and no
further effort to push north by this route was made for some
years.</p>

<br>
<p class="foot">[<b>1</b> Apart from its geographical
significance, the expedition is noteworthy from the fact that the
future hero, Horatio Nelson, served in it as a midshipman.]</p>
<p>Somewhat farther west, on the south-east coast of Greenland,
an isolated attempt at exploration was made before the end of the
century by a Danish expedition&mdash;one of the many about this
time which enjoyed Royal patronage, King Christian VII of Denmark
taking a personal interest in it. In spite of this advantage the
expedition met with but little success. It was despatched in 1786
under Captain Lowenorn and Lieutenant Egede, with the object,
besides other exploration, of searching for the old colony
supposed to have existed in Eastern Greenland many years before,
but long lost sight of. The voyagers encountered great obstacles
in the masses of ice which beset the Greenland coast and which
entirely barred access to it in the latitudes within which the
attempt was made&mdash;roughly between 65° and 67° N. The ships
returned to Iceland, whence Egede made a second, equally
fruitless, effort to reach the land later in the same summer. He
wintered in Iceland and returned to the task, accompanied by
Lieutenant Rothe, in May 1787, but was forced to turn back. In
June he started once more, but the obstacles still proved too
formidable, and he was obliged to abandon the attempt, without
accomplishing anything in the way of actual exploration. It was
not until well on in the nineteenth century that any real
progress towards a knowledge of Eastern Greenland was made. Its
coast is perhaps more persistently ice-bound than any other part
of the Arctic regions, rendering its exploration a matter of
exceptional difficulty.</p>
<p>From the American side of the Arctic regions an abortive
attempt at further exploration had been made a few years before
this (1776-77) in connection with Cook's third voyage, the
intention being to prepare the way for the return of that
navigator, should he have been successful in finding a passage
from the Pacific to the Atlantic by the far north. In 1776
Lieutenant Richard Pickersgill was sent by the British Admiralty
in the armed brig <i>Lion</i>, primarily for the protection of
British whalers in Davis Strait, but, this task accomplished, he
was instructed to make a survey of Baffin Bay in view of a
proposed repetition of the voyage in the following year. The
<i>Lion</i> left Deptford on May 25. On June 29 soundings of
320&mdash;330 fathoms were struck in the North Atlantic in 57°
N., 24° 24' W.&mdash;a position roughly corresponding to that in
which the imaginary Busse Island of Frobisher had been placed on
the charts, and this submarine bank was taken by Pickersgill to
represent the remains of that island. On July 7 Cape Farewell was
passed, and on the 8th the <i>Lion</i> became entangled in the
ice-field off the south-west coast of Greenland. The commander
now made the mistake of clinging too closely to this coast, and
the ice drifting along it made progress slow. By August 3 he had
only reached 65' 37' N., though by moving out into the central
channel between the two ice-fields he was able to make much
better progress the next day, and reached 68° 37' N. But he now
lost heart and decided to turn back, though practically nothing
had been done towards carrying out the intended survey.</p>
<p>The <i>Lion</i> was sent out again the next year in command of
Lieutenant Walter Young, who was instructed to explore the
western coasts of Baffin Bay, searching for inlets which might
offer hopes of a passage westward. If any such were found, an
attempt was to be made to push on in that direction. Nothing of
the kind, however, was accomplished. Cape Farewell was reached
early in June, but on entering the ice-pack stormy weather was
encountered. In spite of this, the latitude of 72° 42'
N.&mdash;considerably higher than had been attained the previous
year&mdash;was reached on June 8, but, the channel between the
ice-fields on either side having then become extremely narrow.
Young gave up all attempts to prosecute the objects of the
expedition, and returned homewards, reaching the Nore on August
26. Thus ended the last serious attempt for many years to push
northward by the Baffin Bay route.</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>A rapid view may now be taken of the main characteristics and
phases of exploration during the period dealt with in this
volume. Opening with the retirement of Spain and Portugal from
the position of chief actors in the drama, its early stages were
marked by the rising activity of the Dutch and English in the
maritime struggle for the eastern trade; of the French in the
exploitation and partial settlement of northern North America;
and of the Russians in the conquest of the wide plains of
Siberia. In none of these cases did exploration for its own sake
form the ruling motive of the pioneers by whom these conquests
were achieved, but incidentally to the quest for commercial
advantages much was done to extend the bounds of geographical
knowledge. From the point of view of general world-knowledge the
most notable achievements during the first half of our period
were the voyages of Tasman, which did more than any others to
draw back the veil from the previously unknown Australasian area;
and the various Arctic voyages of the Dutch and English in search
of the north-east and north-west passages.</p>
<p>After about the middle of the seventeenth century maritime
discovery entered, temporarily, upon a less active phase, though
the doings of the Buccaneers helped to extend acquaintance with
the South Seas, though mainly confined to certain definite
routes. The name of Dampier stands out among the rest as most
meritorious from our point of view. Land exploration owed much at
this time to the energy of the Jesuit and other missionaries in
various parts of the world, especially in Spanish, Portuguese,
and French America, in all of which they showed themselves active
as pioneers in the wilds beyond the limits of regular
settlement.</p>
<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century may be said to have
begun the modern period, <i>par excellence</i>, of geographical
discovery, which has continued with no decided break to our own
times. Exploration was now first definitely undertaken with
scientific, rather than commercial aims. After the conclusion of
the Treaty of Paris in 1763, expeditions for research purposes
were inaugurated on all hands, investigations into the natural
history of the regions visited being combined with survey-work of
a more precise character than had previously been undertaken. The
transit of Venus in 1769 supplied the incentive for some of the
most important exploring work of the century, being the immediate
cause of the despatch of the first of Cook's famous expeditions,
as well as of the series of research expeditions carried out by
Russian savants in Siberia. Elsewhere, too, exploration began to
take on a more scientific character, as evidenced in the work of
men like David Thompson in the west of Canada.</p>
<p>Glancing now at the regional extension of exploring work
during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, it may be said
that the most marked characteristic of the whole period was the
unveiling of the great Pacific Ocean, which down to the end of
the sixteenth century had been traversed by one or two routes
only, the greater part of the area remaining entirely unknown. By
the close of the eighteenth century its waters had been covered
with a complete network of routes, and all the important island
groups had been laid down on the charts with an approach to
accuracy, while the last of the unknown continental coast-lines
bounding the same ocean had been surveyed&mdash;in some cases, as
by the work of Vancouver in North-West America, with a high
degree of precision. Land exploration during our period had shown
the most decidedly new departures in the case of northern North
America and Northern Asia, which, practically unknown to
civilised man at its opening, had before its close taken their
place among the regions of the world of which at least the major
features had been laid down on the maps. In other parts of these
continents some extension of previous knowledge had been brought
about, though the central core of Asia still remained to a great
extent a <i>terra incognita</i>. In Africa only the fringe of the
vast interior had been touched before the close of the eighteenth
century, while in the case of Australia all but the coast-line
remained absolutely unknown. The North and South Polar Regions
had also been touched only on their outskirts. The exploration of
these, and of the interior of Africa and Australia (and to a
smaller extent of Asia), remained as the special tasks of the
nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Although, as we have said, the contemporary period may be
considered to stretch back, in its opening stages, to
considerably before the end of the eighteenth century, yet that
point of time, which has been taken as the limit of this volume,
does mark a real epoch in the history of geographical
exploration. The general distribution of sea and land, and the
contours of the great land masses within the habitable portion of
the globe, had then first become matters of definitely
established knowledge.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX</h3>
<h4>SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES</h4>
<p><span class="a">Chapter I</span>. <i>Dutch North-East
Voyages</i> (pp. 25, 30). The fame of Barents has so
over-shadowed that of his associates in the quest for the
North-East Passage that there is perhaps a risk of giving these
less than their due of the credit for the results gained. The
reputation of Rijp in particular has, in the opinion of some,
suffered somewhat unjustly for this reason. While Barents held to
the route by Novaya Zemlya, Rijp saw more chance of success by
keeping to the open sea, and it was with this idea that he made
his determined effort to push north through the Barents Sea east
of Spitsbergen. Some, even of Barents' companions, seem to have
doubted the wisdom of his course of action, as has been pointed
out by the Dutch historian, Dr S. Muller. Rijp's experiences were
of some importance in connection with the renewed attempts in
1611-12, under Jan Cornelisz. May, of which mention should have
been made in the text. Like so many Arctic voyagers, Rijp had
been misled into thinking that he had sighted land (named by him
Fish Island) at his farthest north, and it was the verification
of this supposed discovery that formedone of the special tasks
assigned to May.</p>
<p>This voyager, known to his contemporaries by the sobriquet
"Menscheter" (man-eater), has remained less known than he
deserves to be, no doubt from the fact that his Arctic journal
has only lately been made generally accessible. He had already
commanded a ship in Van Neck's voyage to the East Indies in 1598,
and was afterwards captain of Spilbergen's ship on his voyage of
circumnavigation in 1614-17. The idea that a course through the
open Polar sea might meet with less obstruction from ice than one
which hugged the land held its ground even after Hudson's
failures to find a passage, and it had the influential support of
Plancius, among others. It also received some encouragement from
a book brought out in 1610 by a German doctor, Helisaeus Röslin,
under the title <i>Mitternächtige Schiffarth</i>. The actual
project for a new voyage was put forward by two private
adventurers, Ernest van de Wall and Pieter Aertsz. de Jonge, who
after one or two vain attempts persuaded the States
General&mdash;urged thereto largely by the representations of
Plancius&mdash;to fit out two ships for the venture (January
1611). In order to avoid the drift-ice it was urged that the
voyage should be made as early in the year as possible, and
preparations were therefore hurried forward. The commander was to
sail in the <i>Vos</i>, while his colleague, Symon Willemsz. Cat,
was appointed to the <i>Craen</i>. The pilots were Pieter Fransz.
and Cornelis Jansz. Mes, and the two projectors sailed as
factors&mdash;Van de Wall in the <i>Vos</i>, De Jonge in the
<i>Craen</i>. May's nephew Jan Jacobsz. May also sailed with him.
The ships left the Texel on March 28, 1611, passed the North Cape
on April 14, and began their search for a passage between
Spitsbergen and the supposed Fish Island of Rijp. But the ice
offered an insuperable barrier, as was also the case on a second
attempt between the supposed Fish Island and Novaya Zemlya. Nor
were they more successful on once more trying Barents's old route
along the coast of Novaya Zemlya. It was therefore resolved to
pass to the second part of the programme, the examination of the
coast of North America (Nova Francia). Sighting Newfoundland on
October 29 they sailed south along the coast, searching for
harbours and entering into some traffic with the natives, though
this was marred by a fatal affray. The most southerly point
reached seems to have been south of the Hudson, in 40° 35' N.,
and some of the names given to features on this coast held their
ground in later maps.</p>
<p>Early in 1612 it was resolved that the <i>Craen</i> should
remain on this coast while May in the <i>Vos</i> renewed the
attack on the ice-fields. Conditions were even worse than in 1611
and though on two successive attempts to sail N.W. from Novaya
Zemlya latitudes of 77° and over were attained, the voyagers had
again to own themselves beaten. The <i>Vos</i> was back in
Holland early in October, the <i>Craen</i> having already arrived
in July.</p>
<p>A geographical result of the voyage was the elimination from
the map of the various lands placed conjecturally in the space
between Spitsbergen and Novaya Zemlya&mdash;"Willoughby's land",
"Matsyn", and "Fish Island." An indirect result was the further
prosecution of enterprise by companions of May, both in the
Arctic sea and on the American coast. On one of the voyages,
carried out in 1614 by the younger May with Joris Carolus (see p.
44) as pilot, the island of Jan Mayen was visited, and it is to
the commander on this occasion that the island appears to owe its
name, and not, as was once thought, to his uncle. It has been
held by some that it was then first discovered, though the belief
in the identity of the island with "Hudson's Tutches" (see p. 28)
seems a reasonable one, while the island may also have been
visited by others before 1614. The voyages to the American coast
had an important result in the founding of the Dutch "Compagnie
van Nieuw Nederland", the forerunner of the Dutch West India
Company.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="a">Chapter V.</span> <i>Early Jesuit Journeys to
Tibet</i> (p. 131). A good deal of misconception has hitherto
prevailed on the subject of Andrade's journey to Tibet, but the
actual facts have been clearly stated by Mr C. Wessels in an
article in <i>De Studien</i> (Nijmegen), 1912. Misled by the
identity of name between the chief place in Garhwal and Srinagar
in Kashmir, some have supposed that the journey led through the
latter country, which is quite a mistake. It has also been held
that the traveller made his way to Lake Manasarowar, but this
seems equally erroneous. The only body of water spoken of by him
is a <i>tanque</i> or pool at the source of the Ganges, which,
according to the latest information, does actually exist. There
is also no foundation for the statement that Andrade continued
his journey across Northern Tibet to China. After reaching
Chaprang for the second time he spent several years in missionary
work there, and after he left his labours were continued by other
missionaries. Another Jesuit, father Cacella, appears to have
reached Shigatze in south central Tibet in 1627, and to have been
succeeded on his death in 1630 by Father Cabral. After 1650, the
Jesuit missions in Tibet ceased for over 60 years. Except the
above missionaries, no traveller is known to have visited the
source of the Ganges or to have crossed the western Himalayas
until the nineteenth century.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="a">Chapter VIII</span>. <i>Spanish Discovery of
the Caroline Islands</i>, 1686-1733. While, as has been seen in
Chapter viii, the English circumnavigators usually held to a more
or less definite track across the Pacific, passing one or other
of the Ladrone Islands, something was done during the same period
by the Spanish authorities to bring to light the small scattered
islands to the south of that group, since known as the Carolines.
The first discovery is said to have been made in 1686, when a
Spanish ship commanded by Don Francisco Lazeano lighted upon a
"large island" which he named Carolina in honour of the reigning
king of Spain, Carlos 11. The Ladrones had by this time been
occupied by Spain, and about 1688 the governor Quiroga sent an
expedition to search for this island, but without result. In 1696
the island Faroilep is said to have been discovered by a pilot,
Juan Rodriguez, between 10° and 11° N.&mdash;a latitude which
corresponds better with that of Falalep, considerably further
west. Further information was gradually acquired&mdash;in part
from the reports of natives carried from their homes by
storms&mdash;and the idea of establishing a mission in the
islands took shape among the Jesuits of the Philippines, who gave
the name New Philippines to the new discoveries, and sent to
Europe information about them which was printed in the <i>Lettres
Édifiantes</i>. The first attempts, including one in 1710, under
Don Francisco Padilla, accompanied by Fathers Duberron and
Cortil, led to no result; but eventually Father Juan Antonio
Cantova, a missionary who had previously been stationed at Guam
and had thence collected more definite information than had been
before available, made his way to the Carolines in 1722;
visiting, so far as can be made out, the group east of Yap known
as Garbanzos. He returned with a colleague in 1731, but two years
later was murdered by the inhabitants of Mogmog, near
Falalep.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="a">Chapter IX.</span> <i>French and Spanish
Voyages in the Pacific</i>, 1769-74. The English enterprise in
the Pacific from 1764 onwards, and the reports of discoveries
resulting therefrom, led indirectly to several voyages by
navigators of other nations, in addition to those mentioned
earlier in this book. One of these, under Jean François de
Surville, was organised in 1769 by the French in Bengal in the
hope of exploiting for purposes of trade the reported English
discovery of a large rich island in the Central Pacific&mdash;a
report probably based on a distorted version of Byron's or
Wallis's discoveries. The voyage, made in the <i>Saint Jean
Baptiste</i>, was disastrous. Contrary winds made it impossible
to advance far in the required southerly direction, and the
voyagers were reduced to great straits by attacks of scurvy and
the lack of fresh water. After sighting Juan Fernandez, and at
length reaching the coast of Peru, their misfortunes culminated
in the loss of their commander by the capsizing of a boat. Just
at this time the Spanish authorities were viewing with jealous
eye the British doings in the Pacific, and the Viceroy of Peru,
Don Manuel de Amat y Junient, had obtained permission to fit out
an expedition to search for and occupy the long reported Davis's
Land, by some identified with Easter Island, visited by Roggeveen
in 1722. Two ships of war were fitted out and placed under the
command of Don Felipe Gonzalez, who sailed in the <i>San
Lorenzo</i>, while the frigate <i>Santa Rosalia</i> had as
captain Don Antonio Domonte. The expedition sailed from Callao on
October 10, 1770, reaching Easter Island on November 15, The
island was formally annexed to the Crown of Spain under the name
San Carlos, and a survey carried out; while, on leaving, a search
for other land to the west was made. Only in 1908 was this voyage
rescued from oblivion by the care of Dr Bolton Corney, by whose
researches several imprinted documents bearing on it had been
unearthed.</p>
<p>The Spanish authorities followed up this voyage by others, all
with Tahiti as their destination; but little information about
them has yet been made public. During Cook's visit to Tahiti in
the course of the second voyage, news was obtained of the visit
of a Spanish vessel early in 1773, which has been wrongly thought
to have been that commanded by Don Cayetano de Langara y Huarto
(who did not sail till 1775). In reality the first two voyages
were made by Don Domingo Bonechea, who sailed on the first in
1772. Having returned to Peru, he again left Callao in the
frigate <i>Santa Maria Magdalena</i> (or <i>Aguila</i>),
accompanied by the despatch vessel <i>San Miguel</i>, on
September 20, 1774; Tahiti being reached on November 15 of the
same year. A considerable stay was made there, and a good deal of
information on the island is contained in a journal kept by the
interpreter Maximo Rodriguez, of which a MS. copy is in the
possession of the Royal Geographical Society. This too Dr Corney
hopes shortly to publish for the first time, like that of
Gonzalez, under the auspices of the Hakluyt Society. Bonechea
died at Tahiti.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="a">Chapter XIII.</span> <i>Exploration on
North-West Coast of Hudson Bay</i>, 18<i>th century</i> (pp.
329-330). Some additional details on this subject may here be
given. The voyage of Christopher Middleton in search of a western
passage by this route has been spoken of on p. 329. Its results
were not considered satisfactory by Dobbs, who in a heated
controversy with Middleton maintained that the desired passage
was still probable. Funds were raised for a new expedition, which
sailed in 1746 in the ships <i>Dobbs</i> and <i>California</i>,
Captains William Moore and Francis Smith respectively, the former
of whom had taken part in Middleton's expedition as Captain of
the <i>Discovery</i>. Mr Henry Ellis also sailed with the
commission to chart the anticipated discoveries, and he
eventually wrote the narrative of the expedition. Having wintered
near York Factory, the ships sailed north in 1747 and explored
the coast. Moore and Ellis in the <i>Dobbs</i>'s long-boat
discovered Corbett's Inlet, while Smith in the <i>California</i>
attempted to enter Rankin's Inlet (discovered by Lieut. John
Rankin of the <i>Furnace</i> in 1742). Subsequently the two
long-boats continued the exploration in company and discovered
the most important inlet of the whole coast&mdash;Chesterfield
Inlet&mdash;which received its name on this occasion. It was
ascended for a long distance, its width fluctuating between three
or four and six or seven leagues. But though it seemed to open
out at the farthest point reached, the explorers "were
discouraged from proceeding farther, because that the water from
being salt, transparent, and deep; with steep shores, and strong
currents, grew fresher, thicker, and shallower, at that height."
After this the ships went north again to examine the so-called
Wager Strait; but finding it to be a bay only, they gave up the
task and sailed for England.</p>
<p>The main chance of finding a westward passage now lay in the
further exploration of Chesterfield and Corbett's Inlets, and for
this purpose Captain Christopher was sent north in 1761 in the
<i>Churchill</i>. He is said to have ascended Chesterfield Inlet
for about 100 miles, but then turned back as the water had become
almost fresh. Returning next year accompanied by Mr Norton he
pushed on to the freshwater lake into which the Dubawnt river
debouches; but without seeing this. The lake received its name.
Baker Lake, on this occasion. In 1764 Rankin Inlet was explored
by Captain Johnson, whose surveys, like those of Christopher, are
embodied in a MS. chart preserved at the Admiralty.</p>
<p>The despatch in 1790 of Captain Charles Duncan&mdash;the same
whose voyage to N.W. America is referred to on p. 281&mdash;was
due to the solicitations of Alexander Dalrymple, who urged on the
Hudson Bay Company the possibility of still finding a passage by
way of Roe's Welcome. Reaching Hudson Bay in 1790 Duncan found so
much obstruction put in his way that he returned without doing
anything. In 1791 he was sent again in a new ship, the
<i>Beaver</i>, but was so delayed by ice in Hudson Strait that he
could do nothing beyond carrying out an examination of Corbett's
Inlet to its head. In 1792 he went in the <i>Beaver</i> to
Chesterfield Inlet, which he then ascended by boat, proceeding on
through Baker Lake to the river which enters at its head. It had
been part of his commission to trace the supposed connection
between this river and the outlet of Dubawnt Lake discovered by
Hearne; but finding the river to come for some distance rather
from the north than the west, he gave up the attempt after
tracing it upwards some 30 miles. With this voyage all efforts to
prosecute the search ceased for the time.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="a">Chapter XIV.</span> <i>Dutch Exploration in
Guiana</i>, 18<i>th century</i>. During this century much
enterprise was shown by Dutch traders and prospectors in pushing
into the interior of their colony of Guiana, especially during
the vigorous administration of the Governor Storm van 's
Gravesande, whose despatches were first printed in 1911 by the
Hakluyt Society under the editorship of Messrs Harris and De
Villiers. They show that a considerable knowledge of the
geography and peoples of the interior, up to and beyond the
borders of Brazil, was possessed by the authorities. From about
1740 onwards miners pushed up into the Upper Essequibo region in
search of ores, while a Treatise on the Posts, written by Storm
in 1764, shows that traders regularly made their way by the
Essequibo and Rupununi to the interior savannahs, and that some
had advanced down the Takutu and Rio Branco as far as the
Portuguese Missions. Documentary evidence has lately been brought
to light showing that the journey to the Rio Branco had been made
as early as 1718 by a Jew named Gerrit Jacobs. The claim of a
mining prospector, Salomon Sanders, to have ascended the Corentyn
to its source in 1720, seems not to be trustworthy, though he
probably advanced some distance up that river.<br></p>
<p><span class="a">Chapter XV.</span> <i>The French in
Madagascar</i>, 18<i>th century</i>. A renewal of French activity
in this great island during the latter part of the 18th century
brought about some additions to knowledge. In 1750 a concession
of the island of Ste Marie off the north-east coast was obtained
on behalf of the Compagnie des Indes, and in 1768 Fort Dauphin
was re-occupied by M. de Modave for the French government. Among
scientific travellers who visited Madagascar about this time,
besides Commerçon and Sonnerat (see p. 224), were M. Poivre and
the Abbé Rochon. In 1774 the Hungarian adventurer Benyowski, who
had gained the countenance of the authorities, established a
settlement on Antongil Bay, but, being eventually disavowed, he
entered upon a career of lawlessness which ended in his death in
1786. The most important travels in the interior were those of
one Mayeur, interpreter at the French establishments, who between
1774 and 1785 traversed the northern part of the island to the
Sakalava country, visited the northern extremity, and made two
journeys to the Hova province of Imerina. His accounts were not
entirely superseded until the end of the nineteenth century.</p>
