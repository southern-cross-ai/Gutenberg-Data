  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1">I. &mdash; THE MONSTER OF WEST CLIFF!</a></h2>

<p class="first">THE house was full of whispers. Leila Monroy,
pathetically small in the huge, wing-sided easy chair, fumbled at
her throat. A sob was trying to rise there, knotting her muscles
with a sort of physical pain.</p>

<p>The house was full of whispers. The ancient farmhouse that
always had been her home was an abode of brooding dread, a place
of dark despair. The groaning of the old timbers' drying fibers
seemed terribly loud in the oppressive silence. They came from
the very walls about Leila; from the age-darkened rafters
overhead; from the ominous gloom of the entrance hallway that
somehow repelled the living-room light; from the broad staircase
twisting upward out of that foyer to appallingly empty obscurity
above.</p>

<p>The house was full of whispers, shredding Leila's frayed
nerves with terrible reminders of her day's long agony. Just such
a place of muted, ominous sounds had the courtroom been. Unshed
tears, through the anguished hours, had blurred its crowded
benches; and the only reality had been the gaunt, suffering
figure of her grey-faced father in the prisoner's dock. But the
whispers had been inescapable. All day they had hissed at her, as
they were hissing now: mutterings of horror as witness after
witness had damned Justin Monroy with hushed tales of brutal,
unutterably savage killing; gasps of outrage when Leila herself
gave halting testimony that she had been with her father, here in
this room, all the fatal hour between the time when Shean Rourke
had last been seen alive and the time when Foster Corbett had
found his hacked and mangled corpse beneath the poplars dividing
the two farms.</p>

<p>Whispers had met the exhausted girl&mdash;whispers of tight-
lipped condemnation&mdash;when at last she had stumbled down from
the witness chair; and the farmer-women's Sunday silks had
rustled, self-righteously, drawing away from the defiling touch
of the girl who, hostile eyes said, had lied desperately to save
a blood-guilty slayer.</p>

<p>Whispers, whispers, whispers&mdash;seething out of the
pulsating silence as the stony-faced jury marched back into their
box.</p>

<p>And then the whispers had become a soundless scream searing
Leila's breast as the dreadful verdict soughed from the foreman's
tight throat.</p>

<p>"Murder! While insane!"</p>

<p>Insane! The recollection flung Leila Monroy up out of her
chair, held her rigid in distress. Insane! The word hissed within
her skull, hissed from the stark vacancy in which she was so
utterly alone with terror and despair. Slithering foliage,
stirred by a swiftly rising wind, hissed it at her from the
terrible outer night. Insane!</p>

<p>Insane! The kindly, tender old man to whose gnarled hand she
had clung as the brown clods thudded on the drab wood of her
mother's coffin; the hard-working, weather-beaten oldster who had
been father and mother to her through so many years&mdash;a
madman! Her father! From whose veins came the blood surging now
so darkly in her veins.</p>

<p>Leila quivered. Tremors ran through the long, delicate curves
of her slim form. The tiny oval of her small-featured countenance
blanched with a new dismay. <i>His blood in her veins!</i> What
if that blood were tainted with a foul lust to kill, with an
atavistic urge to tear with fang and claw, to rend human flesh
and taste the warm, salt-sweet tang of human life-fluid on
smacking, gory lips? What if she had not really drowsed that
half-hour whose lapse fatally had invalidated her testimony? Had
she run, instead, ravening by his side while a fearful heritage
of homicidal madness blotted memory from her soul as the
alienists said it had blotted recollection from Justin
Monroy's?</p>

<p>Abruptly the light within was paled by a blue blaze glaring in
through the window on which her unseeing stare was fixed, by
lightning that split the sky's black vault with a jagged and
blazing fracture. Thunder blast became to the shocked girl the
devastating roar of an enormous beast that leaped on the house,
that battered it, that shook it in huge jaws whose slaver was
driving rain. Storm tumult howled about the old walls, crashed
through the empty rooms, drowned out the whispers that had
tortured Leila, drowned out the whispers in her harried brain.
Almost, after the first terrific onslaught, she was grateful for
the fury that would no longer let her hear those whispers.</p>

<p>But it could not drown her dreadful thoughts.</p>

<p>"No," she moaned. "Merciful Lord, no!" as she had moaned when
Justin Monroy's suave attorney had elicited from the bald-pated
alienist glib testimony that had saved his client from the death-
chair&mdash;and condemned him to a living hell. "No! It can't be
true."</p>

<p>"I could have done nothing else," the lawyer had answered her
reproaches afterward. "It was your father's axe Foster Corbett
found buried in the dead man's chest. Your father's footprints
were traced out of the trampled mess around the corpse and across
the meadow to your back porch. There was the old boundary line
feud between your father and his neighbor, his threats that if
Foster Corbett or his son Stanley or his farm hand, Shean Rourke,
stepped on Monroy land they would regret it. Against that we had
only your word that he was seated in the room with you all
evening. And on cross-examination you admitted that you had
fallen asleep."</p>

<p>The wind pounded against the door as their fists had pounded,
coming to accuse Dad of the awful deed. Foster Corbett,
triumphant at last over his ancient adversary. Stan
Corbett&mdash;</p>

<p>Leila's pale lips writhed. Stan! In his arms she had known
happiness, against her lips his lips had thrilled. Defiant of the
enmity between their fathers they had loved. If State Trooper
Stanley Corbett had fired his gun into her heart, he could no
more cruelly have slain that love than he had by saying to her
father, "You're under arrest, Mr. Monroy."</p>

<p>Rain lashed against the window in a spasm of new fury. The
world was ablaze with a flickering electric flare that spilled
bluely on the tossing poplars marching along the tree-marked
boundary between the two farms. It was just there that Shean
Rourke's corpse&mdash;Something moved stealthily&mdash;vague and
black&mdash;among the wind-bent trunks!</p>

<p>Darkness smashed down again! Who was it? Who prowled the
storm-drenched night. The demoniac slayer who had made a ghastly
horror of what once had been a man? The real killer, stalking a
new prey? Stalking her? Icy fingers clutched Leila Monroy's
throat, chill prickles tickled her spine. His blood-thirst still
unslaked, inflamed by his terrible crime for which Dad unjustly
had been condemned to terrible expiation, the murderer was
creeping up on her. On her!</p>

<p>An ancient legend of whispered terror trailed a slimy
speculation across her fear. A name breathed with shudders of
apprehension by the gaffers clustering around the cherry-bellied
stove in the village. The Monster of West Cliff! The traditional
phantom that was reputed to haunt the stony precipice whose sheer
rampart rose behind the fertile plain along which, from north to
south, lay the three neighboring farms of the Corbetts, the
Monroys and the Stars! Often of late he had been seen stalking
the dark belt of primeval forest cloaking the base of that cliff,
the elusive, appalling wraith, it was said, of an Indian chief
whose tribe had been massacred by the plain's first settlers.
Stalking the ages, waiting for a chance at gruesome revenge.
Every accident, every unexplained disaster of the countryside was
ascribed to him. Was it he who&mdash;</p>

<p>Storm-blaze arched the heavens once more, exploding into
momentary existence the tempest-tormented trees, the downpour-
beaten pasture between. They were deserted, vacant as the house
itself. Nothing&mdash;no one was anywhere in sight. The prowling
shadow had been an illusion, a figment of her anguished
brain.</p>

<p>Wait! Wait! The imagined sight had recalled something to
Leila. An incident of the fateful night that she had utterly
forgotten till now, till it was too late. The girl groaned, beat
her breast in bitter self-condemnation.</p>

<p>Stepping to this very window, that evening, to pull down its
shade, she had seen, or thought she had seen, Foster Corbert
dodging behind the tool shed just visible left of the house. She
had said nothing to her father, fearing to excite him, fearing to
jeopardize the reconciliation for which she and Stan plotted. The
terrible events following had obliterated the matter from her
memory. Utterly, till now. How could she have forgotten it, its
astounding implication? The murder-axe, whose blood-smeared helve
had shown no fingerprints, had come from that very shed!</p>

<p>Perhaps it was not yet too late. Perhaps if she told her
story&mdash;</p>

<p>Shrill sound sliced across the thought. It stopped, spurted
again. <i>Rrrring</i>&mdash;<i>rrrring</i>&mdash;<i>rrring.</i>
It whirled Leila around to it.
<i>Rrrring</i>&mdash;<i>rrring</i>&mdash;<i>rrring.</i> The
telephone! Three rings, the Monroy signal! Who could be phoning
her. Stan? Incredible! Eve Starr, perhaps? Eve, her neighbor and
closest female friend, calling to extend sympathy, consolation.
Like Eve to remain loyal when every one else shunned her.</p>

<p><i>Rrrring</i>&mdash;<i>rrring</i>&mdash;Leila, flinging
across the room, into the hallway's dimness, jerked the receiver
from its hook.</p>

<p>"Hello."</p>

<p>"Lock your doors," a hoarse, unrecognizable voice grated
without preamble. "Lock your windows." A voice choked, coarsened
by some inexplicable terror. "Don't let any one in. Not
any&mdash;"</p>

<p>The telephone was suddenly dead, with the flat, inanimate
deadness of a line from which the humming life of its current has
gone. Dead! Had the storm blown down a frail wire or had some
human hand cut it? Some human hand, just too late to stop the
husked warning?</p>

<p>Some human hand! Icy terror once more struck at Leila Monroy.
The hand of some one who even now crept up on the house. Then she
was moving, had flung herself to the great front door, was
thrusting into its socket the heavy bolt clamped to its sturdy
oak.</p>

<p>The back door was already locked, she remembered. The windows!
Old-fashioned shutters creaked out of recesses in their
embrasured sides to the frantic pull of her trembling hands, were
also bolted. She rushed in frenzied haste through dining room,
through kitchen, clicking on light as she went, light from which
shadows fled that were black, sinister silhouettes waiting around
corners, behind doors, to spring upon her. The lower floor was at
last a blaze of light, was a locked and barred fortress against
whatever menace threatened. The lower floor&mdash;</p>

<p>But there was the upstairs yet, the upstairs that was blacker,
as Leila's dilated pupils stared up into its mystery, because of
the luminescence about her. No longer was it the warm, familiar
bedroom floor of the old house but a precinct of stygian gloom
haunted by some darkness-shrouded threat.</p>

<p>The girl's small fingers&mdash;tightened on the newel post to
which she clung, tightened till the blood was driven from them
and they were grey, trembling splotches against the lustrous
patina of the wood. It was only the dark, up there, of which she
was afraid. Over and over she told it to herself. It was only
because of the dark that she had that hint of evil lurking just
beyond the stair head, of monstrous evil crouched just beyond the
range of her vision, haunched and waiting to pounce upon her.
There was nothing more in the corridor above, Leila assured
herself, than shadows like the eerie phantoms that had fled from
the lights she had turned on.</p>

<p>Nothing? A shriek sliced down to her, the high, shrill scream
of a woman in deadly terror.</p>

<p>It checked off, faded into vague thumpings as of a fierce
struggle, into the thud of a storm-tossed branch against the
building wall. <i>It came again!</i></p>

<p>Tiny muscles twitched in Leila's cheeks. Insensate, humorless
laughter sounded in her fluttering throat. It was the wind that
had screamed from up there, tightening her scalp with fear. It
must have been the wind. No one could possibly be up there.</p>

<p>But she was afraid. Afraid to go up there and look. Afraid of
the storm and the dark.</p>

<p>A sharp crackle jerked her around. She stared wide-eyed at the
entrance door. Fool! That had been only the splintering of a
gale-riven branch&mdash;It came again. Unmistakable this time.
The crunch of a heel on the gravel pathway outside!</p>

<p>A foot thudded on the porch just beyond the door and unseen
fingers rattled the door knob. Through a crashing peal of thunder
the terrified girl heard a threatening, hoarse bellow. Someone
was just the other side of the sturdy portal. Some one&mdash;The
killer! The mad killer, seeking her!</p>

<p>He bellowed again, pounded wild fists on the wood. The great
panel shuddered under the berserk attack. Its hinges creaked. The
furious pounding piled a frenzied terror on her fear of the storm
and the dark. Realization pierced her that only five feet of air,
two inches of wood, separated her from the monstrous creature
that had made of Shean Rourke a mangled horror. It twisted her
about, sent her hurtling headlong up the stairs that a moment
before dread had barred to her, sent her dashing through the
lightless corridor in instinctive flight to the fancied sanctuary
of her own bedroom.</p>

<p>Her hand clutched the knob of its door, swung her to it.
Frantically she thrust open the panel, slammed it shut behind
her, leaned back against it, gasping, quivering.</p>

<p>Rain lashed against the window pane, threshed on the roof
above her. Dulled by distance, the savage pounding on the door
below beat about Leila as though tangible blows buffeted her.
Momentarily the lightning had ceased. The chamber was obliterated
by tar-barrel darkness. A feeling grew on Leila that she was not
alone here.</p>

<p>Leila Monroy whimpered, stabbed blindly at the light-switch
she knew jutted from the wall to her right. The small room sprang
into sight. A disheveled apparition stared at her from her
dresser mirror, russet wealth of hair tumbling about her now
pallid face, mouth twisting and livid, grey eyes dark with the
frenzy of her terror. She pulled her gaze from it, saw the
bed&mdash;</p>

<p>Crumpled on its scarlet-flecked counterpane lay the contorted
body of a girl. Blue-black hair veiled her face, but where a pink
frock had been cruelly torn away, lurid finger-marks on a white
throat showed the manner of her death. Her death&mdash;there was
no motion, no movement at all in the awful stillness of the
pathetic figure. The exposed, blanched breast stirred with not
the slightest breath.</p>

<p>"Eve," Leila whimpered, unable to do no more than stare and
whimper. "Eve..."</p>

<p>Forgotten the tumult of the storm, the battering at the
entrance door. Forgotten everything but the horror that burst
within her skull. But she had no memory of Eve's arrival. No
memory...</p>

<p>Time must have dropped out of her consciousness. Time enough
for her to have summoned the girl, to have lured her up here!
Time enough&mdash;for her own hands to have clenched on her
friend's throat, to have pressed, pressed, until life no longer
throbbed beneath her throttling fingers!</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch2" name="ch2">II. &mdash; THE PHANTOM IN THE
TREES</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT seemed to Leila Monroy that she could feel,
in her icy palms, memory of the soft flesh's slow crumple beneath
their lethal construction. Once she had hated Eve, when the girl
quite openly had tried to win Stan Corbett away from her. That
jealous hatred had passed away with her own triumph and they had
been friends again. Had it passed? Had it not rather sprung to
sinister existence with the blood madness inherited from the
father they had led away to a padded cell?</p>

<p>Darkness smashed down as the light went out. The window was
momentarily a blue oblong, flickering with the electric radiance
of lightning.</p>

<p>"Leila!" A voice came up to her. "Open up. It's Stan, Leila.
Stan!"</p>

<p>Stan! He had come for her as he had come for her father. He
had come to drag her, shrieking, to the same chamber of horrors
where Justin Moore had agonized.</p>

<p>He would have to catch her first! If she were mad she would
avail herself of a lunatic's cunning. From a window at the end of
the passage rain-spout clamps made an easy ladder to the ground.
The storm would hide her, she would bury herself in the
woods&mdash;Leila got the door open behind her, flung out into
the hall.</p>

<p>Thunderous crash of the portal below met her, and the
tempest's howl, blasting in through the house. The sound whirled
her startled glance in its direction. The stairs were in
darkness.</p>

<p>Stan's feet thudded on the steps, coming up.</p>

<p>Lightning glimmer threw Stan's climbing shadow against the
wall, made visible the face of a crouching figure. It was the
grizzled, distorted face of Foster Corbett! Of Stan's own father!
Waiting for his son with a revolver uplifted in his hand!</p>

<p>"Stan!" Leila screamed. "Look out He's&mdash;"</p>

<p>A shout drowned her out, a blast of bestial fury. Somewhere a
shot blazed, and then the world crashed in on her. She fell
headlong into a limbo of whirling, coruscating sparks. She felt
herself lifted in powerful arms, felt herself thrown over a
heaving shoulder. Shouts, shots, echoed about her, a gibbering
chatter of apelike defiance. Rain drenched her, an icy gale
pounded at her. Oblivion claimed her.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">AT last Leila dared to lift her lids, bit by
slow bit. She blinked. Darkness was about her, strangely mottled
with glancing fragments of silvery light. Darkness, and
glistening, dank rock above her. The earthy smell of a tomb in
her nostrils.</p>

<p>She was, it dawned on her, in a shallow cave. The luminous
flecks dancing about her were splotches of moonlight shifting
through the leaves of high trees. A cave! Trees! This must be
West Cliff, then.</p>

<p>Leila thrust herself up to a sitting posture as terror sliced
her. Was this the cave of the Monster? But there wasn't any
Monster, she thought. There was only the crazed slayer who had
hacked Shean Rourke with an ax, who had throttled Eve Starr, who
had crouched with lethal gun to shoot down Stan Corbett. Not any
phantom Monster! Not Justin Monroy either, nor Leila herself.
Foster Corbett!</p>

<p>For a moment Leila forgot her pain, her danger, in the
jubilance of that revelation. Dad was no maniac killer,
nor&mdash;was she. It was Foster Corbett who had schemed with the
cunning of the insane to slay and place the blame for his crime
on the man he hated. Foster Corbett who had dragged a second
victim to Leila Monroy's bed so that the daughter should be
doomed to the same terrible fate to which he had condemned the
father. Foster Corbett who, losing all hold on reason, had
haunched in the storm-battered corridor, waiting to kill his own
son!</p>

<p>Had he? Had he added filicide to the role of his crimes? A
shot had blazed across her scream of warning just before the
madman had whirled to attack her! If Stan had fired it, the
maniac could not have moved so swiftly. It had been fired at
Stan, then, had buried itself in his breast? In the breast of the
man she loved?</p>

<p>Loved. Leila Monroy, springing to her feet knew terribly that
her love for Stan was not dead. A sob tore at her throat. She
must go to him. Reckless of the agony that seared through her she
started forward to the cave's entrance.</p>

<p>Then she froze as a rattle of rolling pebbles came up to her
from below the cavern mouth! Of stones dislodged by some one
climbing the face of the cliff.</p>

<p>He was coming for her. He had borne her here, left her here
while he pursued some other dreadful mission of his murder-
lusting brain, and now he was returning to work his mad will upon
her.</p>

<p>Helpless? Leila Monroy's lip snarled up from her tiny teeth.
She was suddenly a creature of the wilds. The desperate courage
of hopelessness entered into her, the feral cunning of
wildernesses small beasts who will fight, must fight, when escape
from their persecutors has become no longer possible. She
stooped, snatched handfuls of jagged stones from the cave floor,
flitted to its entrance, silent as a cloud.</p>

<p>Leila peered out and down, slyly cautious. There he was! Like
a huge, black spider clinging to the splattered, bare precipice.
Working his way up, indomitably, slowly by the necessity of
finding handholds, footholds, in the bare, sheer rock face.
Hidden now by a pool of stygian shadow, revealed now by fragments
of leaf-splintered moonlight. Inexorably climbing to add her to
the dreadful list of his victims.</p>

<p>Distorted by the eerie light he was somehow unhuman, somehow a
monster of primitive evil, spewed out of the past. And Leila
Monroy, the weak thing he hunted, was primitive, too. Primitive
and pitiless. Her hand flew back, arced forward. A stone left
it&mdash;and struck fair on the skull of the maniac! The crunch
of its landing came up to her, sickened her, but she flung
another stone and another. A dark splotch appeared on his
forehead, and then the man let go his holds, plunged down, a
black, sprawling figure, crashed terribly in the underbrush
below.</p>

<p>A thrill of triumph ran through Leila, a hot thrill of triumph
that was a torrid flame boiling in her blood. Her laugh, bubbled
up in the dark silence of the forest. A shrill, thin cachinnation
of black laughter, spilling from her gaping throat, rioting out
in the rain-washed night.</p>

<p>It was horrifying! Her throat clamped on it. She checked it,
icy with loathing of the savagery that had inspired it, quivering
with revulsion at the thing she had become. She had killed a man
and laughed with joy at the deed. She, Leila Monroy! Cliff and
forest whirled about her in a sudden vertigo. The hot flush of
joy at Corbett's thumping fall, the jubilant laughter, were these
the reactions of sanity? Soaring glee at killing&mdash;only a
lunatic could feel it, only a homicidal maniac.</p>

<p>"Murder! While insane!" What if the incredible acts she had
ascribed to Foster Corbett were fetid illusions of her own
darkened mind? What if she were, in deed, the lunatic slayer and
he a good neighbor trying to save her from herself, the victim of
her mania? What if her hand, that had slain him, was gory already
with the blood of Eve Starr and of Stan!</p>

<p>No! Not Stan! That, at least, was clear to her even in her
bewilderment. If Stan were slain she could not have slain him.
There was the test. Only a madman would kill his own son. Corbett
or she. She or Corbett. If Stan were alive, she was the maniac.
If he were dead&mdash;</p>

<p>If he were dead&mdash;the thought slashed at her like a sword.
That she should hope for his death&mdash;her Stan! Broad-
shouldered, upstanding, frank-eyed. No! Rather that she be
condemned to the eternal perdition of raving madness, rather that
she take a knife and slice it across her own throat... Bullets do
not always kill! Was he lying there, wounded, desperately
wounded, suffering? Not dead but bleeding to death while she
dallied here, delaying the aid that might save him?</p>

<p>Leila licked dry lips with a trembling tongue. She was down on
her knees on the narrow ledge that made a sort of porch to the
cave. She swung over it, was scrambling for footing against the
sheer wall of the rock, was inching down that perilous descent,
while weakness was like water in her limbs, while pain was a
network of agony meshing her frail form.</p>

<p>"Stan!"</p>

<p>His name was a prayer on her lips as she attained the cliff's
foot at last, as she sent one shuddering glance at the still
mound, blacker against black, that her missiles had flung there.
"Stan!"</p>

<p>She plunged into the thicket.</p>

<p>A twisted root caught Leila's foot, pounded her headlong into
the mire. She lay as she fell, heaving in great breaths of the
dank air to her tortured lungs, fighting for strength to rise, to
go on. The forest silence closed in on her, a black pall of
soundlessness.</p>

<p>Not altogether soundless. A vague, ominous slither threaded
it. It lifted Leila's head with a jerk, despite the darts of
agony shooting through her at even that slight effort. It pulled
her burning stare through the tree-boles that were grotesque
giants reaching writhing arms down to pluck her from her miry
bed.</p>

<p>And then her scalp suddenly tightened.</p>

<p>It drifted almost silently toward her; wraithlike,
phantasmal... A vagrant beam caught it full&mdash;and a scream
formed in Leila's breast, tore her constricted throat, died at
her lips.</p>

<p>The phantom of Eve Starr was gliding toward her between the
ebon trees. Eve Starr, whose corpse Leila had seen contorted in
awful death on the gore-stained counterpane of her own bed!</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch3" name="ch3">III. &mdash; A DREAMLAND OF
DREAD</a></h2>

<p class="first">LEILA MONROY'S blood jelled within her veins.
Supernal terror squeezed her heart as the apparition's ghastly
approach held her eyes with the appalled but helpless stare of a
reptile-fascinated bird.</p>

<p>And a twig snapped beneath Eve Starr's feet!</p>

<p>The sharp crackle of dried wood breaking beneath the pressure
of a careless foot, so little a thing to save one from blithering
madness! It forced reason into Leila's shuddering terror, stung
her to sanity with the realization that this was not a
disembodied ghost advancing toward her through the obscurity of
the fear-filled wood, that it was flesh and blood, that it
was&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eve!" Leila moaned, finding strength somehow to stand up.
"Eve!"</p>

<p>Startled, the dusky-haired girl swung around to her, fright
distorting her bloodless countenance.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" she gasped. "Who is it?" Her eyes were burned-
out coals, dark horror pitting the blanched whiteness of her
visage. "Who&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It's Leila, hon. Leila Monroy."</p>

<p>"Leila!" Stark terror in that gusted exclamation. "Leila!"</p>

<p>Her hand went up to her throat&mdash;to the blue bruises that
splotched its whiteness, the marks of throttling fingers. Of
whose fingers? Leila Monroy knew that she must ask the terrible
question, though she was terrified of what the answer might
be.</p>

<p>"Eve," she blurted. "Eve! Who did that to you? Who? Was it I?
Was it I, Eve?"</p>

<p>"Leila!" Eve hadn't heard her. "Don't touch me." Or had she
heard and was this the awful answer to the momentous question?
"Keep away."</p>

<p>The girl whirled, dashed away.</p>

<p><i>Started</i> to dash away. She stumbled, went to her knees,
snatched for support at the rattling withes of a low bush, swayed
there in pitiful weakness. She was feeble, so feeble. The cold
and the damp of the woods would kill her before morning if she
were left here alone.</p>

<p>"Eve," Leila said, not moving, not daring to move. "I won't
hurt you." Almost without volition her arms went out, appealing,
to her friend. "Let me help you. Let me help you get home."</p>

<p>Eve's free hand fumbled at the grisly marks above the pallid
round of her voluptuous breasts as though the very sight of Leila
reawakened their agony.</p>

<p>"No," she whimpered. "Haven't you done enough to me
already?"</p>

<p>She pulled herself to her feet, staggeringly, painfully,
started to fall again.</p>

<p>Leila jumped forward to catch her. Eve screamed, somehow found
footing, lurched away from her grasp. Leila stopped, tried
again.</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Eve. I may have&mdash;I may have been mad
before, but I'm sane now. You'll have to believe that I'm sane.
Because you can't get home alone. You can't. You'll die out here
in the woods. Please believe me. Please let me help you." And all
the time an inner voice was saying, "If she dies, you have
killed her."</p>

<p>"Help me!" Eve's husked tones were bitter, accusing. "You help
me! Murderess!"</p>

<p>She screamed that last expletive, and then she had whirled and
was running, stumbling, dazedly, impelled only by the false
strength of a terrible fear.</p>

<p>"Eve!" She couldn't last long. "Eve!" She would drop far in
the tangled depths of the woods. "Eve!" Leila reeled after
her.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, Eve managed to keep just ahead of her, just
beyond reach. She was a flitting, staggering form just ahead of
Leila, always just ahead, always just about to drop, but somehow
keeping on her feet, somehow maintaining a little space between
them. The reason for her chase slid away from Leila. She knew
only that she must catch the luminous wraith she pursued, knew
only that she must keep going through the nightmare blackness of
the impeding forest. Knew only that the uncanny compulsion was
upon her&mdash;</p>

<p>A denser grouping of stygian tree-trunks swallowed Eve for an
instant. Leila plunged through them&mdash;stopped. Eve had
disappeared. She wasn't anywhere in sight, and there was no sound
to tell where she had gone.</p>

<p>Had she, after all, been pursuing a phantom created by her own mad brain? Was she doomed forever to wander in a dreamland of dread in which she would be unable to distinguish the real from the unreal? Doomed forever&mdash;see, these very trees seemed
instinct with a baleful life. They seemed to be closing in on
her.</p>

<p>One of them <i>was</i> moving, was coming toward her with a
slow, infinitely evil deliberation. It couldn't be moving! She
was imagining it. How could a tree move?</p>

<p>It wasn't a tree. It was a bent, massive figure of a man;
huge, browless head set neckless on gargantuan shoulders;
bronzed, naked torso gleaming eerily in the moonlight; little,
pig-like eyes glowing redly out of an imbecilic, drooling
countenance. It was the Monster of the Cliff!</p>

<p>But she had killed the Monster. No, that was Foster Corbett
she had killed. This Monster didn't exist. It was a figment of
her imagination, this bestial thing that crept inexorably toward
her. It wasn't there at all and she wouldn't run from it. If she
didn't run from it it would vanish and she would be sane again.
She must not be afraid of it. She must not be afraid of the big-
muscled arms that seemed to reach out for her, of the stubbed and
fearful talons.</p>

<p>That closed on her arms with a sudden, fearful pain that told
her the thing was real. That told her too late that it was
real.</p>

<p>Leila screamed, but the shrill cry of her terror and her agony
was drowned by the ferocious, overwhelming roar of the Monster.
Towering over her, he slammed her against the shaggy, unyielding
bark of a giant tree behind her, trying to crush her, it seemed,
into the very heart of the quivering timber, driving breath from
her so that she could scream no longer.</p>

<p>She could not scream, but she could flail desperate fists
against the steel-hard thews of his giant arms. The beast laughed
at her puny efforts&mdash;chatteringly, gibberingly. His black-
lipped mouth opened to display yellow, rotted fangs, a cavity in
which the flesh was not red but a hideous black.</p>

<p>Leila writhed, jerked free. Almost jerked free. The Monster's
knee came up, thrust excruciatingly into the softness of her
abdomen, pinned her helpless against the rough tree-bark behind
that cut through her flimsy dress and stabbed her with countless
tiny points. Pinned her helpless, so that one of his bestial paws
released its grip and flew to the neckline of her frock. It tore
downward, as the seamed, hairless countenance mowed with
insensate, obscene glee.</p>

<p>"Pretty," the thing chattered. "Pretty," and his leathery palm
fumbled at Leila's breast, rasped it with a lewd caress. "Calban
likes."</p>

<p>The girl's hand spatted against the indurated cheek, her toes
banged at the Monster's shins. He squealed like a stuck pig and
his fingers flew to her throat, clutched it, constricted.</p>

<p>Leila's lungs pumped unavailingly, fighting for air they could
not find. The brutal digits tightened still more, till the girl
thought they must cut right through the flesh, must squeeze clear
through her neck. Knives stabbed and twisted within her chest,
invisible fingers gouged at her eyes. The glaring, ferocious
visage of her tormentor vanished in a great, roaring
blackness.</p>

<p>Through which she seemed to hear a high, piercing whistle. The
roaring in her skull was drowned in the blast of Calban's feral
roar. The whistle came again, and Leila crashed to the ground as
the terrible grip on her throat, the pinning thrust of the
bestial knee, were released.</p>

<p>Leila wallowed in her distress, while somewhere above her a
tumultuous sound crashed momentarily and died away. She pulled
air into the sore agony of her lungs.</p>

<p>"Leila," Stan cried, somewhere above her.</p>

<p>It wasn't Stan. It couldn't be Stan. Stan was lying dead in
the old house that had suddenly become an abode of horror. Stan
had bled to death there because she had not been able to get to
him in time to save him.</p>

<p>"Leila, darling!"</p>

<p>Hands were tugging at her, were rolling her over. Stan's
hands. His dear face was looking down at her, anxiety clouding
his eyes. Stan's face...</p>

<p>"Leila! Speak to me. Leila!"</p>

<p>The girl sat up. He was disheveled. His trooper's uniform was
gashed, torn by the tearing brambles of the forest, and there was
a livid weal across his tanned cheek that a lashing tendril had
made. But he was alive. It was Stan who had saved her, at the
last possible moment, from an awful death.</p>

<p>"Stan! What&mdash;how did you get here? How...?"</p>

<p>"I was knocked out, there in your house, I came to, heard the
back door close. I rushed out there and saw you vanishing into
the woods. I've been hunting for you..."</p>

<p>"Then wasn't..."</p>

<p>"Don't talk now," Stan silenced her. "You're hurt, exhausted.
When I get you home, get you warm, you can tell me all about
it."</p>

<p>He was tender, solicitous. He loved her still. Leila nestled
in his arms, thrilling to his strength, thrilling to the feel of
his heart beating against her own. She would obey him, she would
keep quiet for a few minutes. If she started to talk, if she told
him that it had been Eve he had seen, not her, she would have to
tell him the rest.</p>

<p>She would have to tell him that the girl in his arms had
killed his father. How could she tell him that? How could
she?</p>

<p>The black trees of the forest slid by, rustling in the night.
Leila whimpered. "Hush, darling," Stan murmured. "We'll soon be
out of this. We'll soon be where it's warm and light."</p>

<p>Light. Would there ever be light again in her dark soul?
Darker than ever now. Thought burred through Leila's aching
brain. Stan had been attacked in the house, had been knocked
unconscious. That was evident. Foster Corbett must have done
that, lying in ambush. Then Leila must be sane.</p>

<p>But Eve Starr's actions had confirmed the awful speculation
that it was Leila who had attacked her. Leila, in whose mind no
memory remained of the terrible deed. That proved her insane.</p>

<p>There wasn't any answer. There couldn't be any answer, because
she didn't know how much of her experiences was real, how much
she had forgotten, how much she had imagined. The Monster, for
instance. Stan's coming had saved her from him, but Stan didn't
seem to know anything about him. Had that lecherous attack been
only her own madness? Had her own maniac fingers torn the clothes
from her shoulders; clamped, tightening, about her own
throat?</p>

<p>Or had Stan's call, his threshing approach, frightened the
brute away before the trooper could see him?</p>

<p>Over Stan's shoulder Leila saw a shadow move, high up on the
bough of a tree. It haunched, came sprawling down; great arms
flailing; spread, spatulate talons clawing for Stan's throat!</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch4" name="ch4">IV. &mdash; MASTER OF THE
MONSTER</a></h2>

<p class="first">"STAN!" Leila Monroy shrieked and contorted in
his arms, driving her forehead against his chest. This
instantaneous inspiration of her terror was the only thing that
could have saved her lover. It unbalanced him, sent him reeling
backward, and the down-dropping monster missed his mark.</p>

<p>The brute crashed down into the underbrush, was momentarily
tangled in the whipping leaves. In that instant Leila slipped
from Stan's hold as the trooper recovered his footing and reached
for his holstered gun. Calban bellowed, soared from the ground.
His shaggy arm lashed ahead of him with a cobra's lightning-like
lash, struck Stan's gun-wrist, pounded the weapon from it. Its
metallic gleam sliced into the underbrush and the antagonists
came together with a thud of flesh against flesh that was
thunderous to the terrified girl.</p>

<p>Stan's fists pumped, two flashing pistons, into Calban's taut
belly. The monster's muscle-bulging arms clamped around the
trooper in a rib-cracking clinch. They swayed, black and gigantic
in the eerie forest light and from the taut, straining agony of
that clinch burst an appalling cacophony of bestial sounds, of
growls and vicious snarls.</p>

<p>A shrill, piercing squeal forced by unendurable pain from a
strong man's lips galvanized Leila into action. She dropped to
her knees, searching frantically in the meshed, baffling
underbrush for Stan's gun. The tumult of that eerie battle
increased, behind her. A chattering, mindless scream signaled
that Stan had got home a telling blow.</p>

<p>"Run, Leila," the man yelled. "Get away. I can't&mdash;hold
him."</p>

<p>The girl twisted, saw Calban, momentarily driven away from
Stan, closing in again. Her lover met the renewed attack by a
ferocious uppercut exploding from a crouch. His fist landed on
the monster's jaw with the blast of a rifle shot, his other fist
crashed against the brute's chest. The devastating blows might
have been flicks of a fly's wings for all the effect they had.
Calban was not even staggered. His huge paw closed on Corbett's
neck, engulfing it with its vast span. His swarthy other hand
drove for the man's groin.</p>

<p>Somehow a thick stick was in Leila's hand and she was hurling
herself, shrilling primitive fury, at the monster. Her improvised
club pounded against Calban's forehead. He roared, with anger
rather than pain, and the hand that was reaching for Stan's groin
flicked sidewise instead.</p>

<p>It struck Leila in midair, catapulted her backward, crashing
her into the threshing cushion of a bush. Jarred and half-
stunned, she saw Calban's attack focus again on Stan, saw her
lover swept from his feet, saw him lifted high above the grisly
creature's head by straining arms shaggy with a beast's black
hair.</p>

<p>The terrible tableau etched itself on Leila's mind. The
gorilla-like brute; his bestial ferocity the more horrible for
the fact that he was no beast but a man degraded, obscenely
decadent; poised momentarily motionless as he gathered his forces
for the throw that would smash Stan to a pulp. Above his head
Stan was as motionless&mdash;rigid and helpless in the gigantic
grip of Calban's leathery hands at armpit and crotch, his face
contorted and pallid, his eyes staring in agony.</p>

<p>For an eternal moment that awful pause persisted. And then the
lurid gleam of Calban's beady, savage eyes flared more redly and
the muscles in his huge arms writhed snakelike beneath their
hairy skin, and Leila knew that in the next instant they would
sweep downward.</p>

<p>From somewhere a whistle shrilled high and piercing, through
the quivering terror of the woods. It came again, the strange
high sound that once before Leila had heard through black clouds
of death swirling about herself. It froze Calban to an astounding
paralysis, leashed him as though it were a chain writhing about
his savage limbs. Leila could almost see the death-thought seep
unwilling from the black and terrible frame.</p>

<p>Calban's protest was a grisly roar blasting through the black
forest aisles. The huge arms bent, slowly, reluctantly, letting
Stan down.</p>

<p>The trooper twisted abruptly, freed himself from Calban's
loosening grip. He thudded to the ground, sprang erect,
snarling...</p>

<p>But the monster was gone, had plunged away into the veiling
thickets. For minutes the lovers heard the threshing of his huge,
evil body moving away, and then a sinister silence close about
them. A silence sinister because it cloaked not only the ravening
man-beast, but another mysterious entity, a lurking, invisible
being who was master of the Monster, whose whistling command the
brute obeyed even in the height of his frenzy. Twice Leila had
heard the weird whistle, twice it had saved her.</p>

<p><i>Not her, but Stan!</i> It had been at Stan's approach that
the ravening human hound had been called away that first time, it
had been Stan whose deadly peril had just now been averted. If it
were not for Stan&mdash;</p>

<p>"God!" the youth groaned. "Who is he? Where did he come from?"
He pulled a trembling hand across his bruised forehead above his
glazed, unseeing eyes, swayed with exhaustion. "Why did he quit,
just when he was about to slam me down and break every bone in my
body?"</p>

<p>Leila struggled out of the tangling bush into which Calban had
flung her. "I don't know, Stan." She was cold, icy cold with
foreboding, with realization of a terrible enmity focused upon
herself. "I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her throat damped as Stan pitched forward, pounded limply
down, lay sodden and unconscious in spongy, water-soaked
loam.</p>

<p>Leila lurched to him. Her hand flew to a dark, spreading stain
on his shirt, found warm, viscid wetness. It was blood! His
blood! But Calban had no knife...</p>

<p>Moaning, the girl tore the shirt-stuff away with trembling
fingers. The angling wound across his ribs from which the gory,
angry fluid gushed was no knife-slash. It was the jagged-edged
path of a bullet, and under the fresh, scarlet pour was the mass
of an old clot.</p>

<p>Leila ripped a hasty bandage from the tatters to which her own
frock had been reduced, worked frantically to stanch that grisly
flow. And as she worked a vague explanation of what had happened
formed in her mind.</p>

<p>His mad father's bullet had ploughed across Stan's ribs, had
flung him down, unconscious at the foot of the stairs. The slow
seepage had stopped itself. He had come awake. Hearing what he
thought was Leila running out of the house he had followed. His
exertions, the battle with the ape-faced monster, had opened the
wound afresh. Weakened by the new loss of blood he had fainted
once more.</p>

<p>Now he lay here, unconscious, in the black depths of the
forest. He lay here, and she with him, and somewhere in the
glimmering, ominous shadows Calban still roved and...</p>

<p>Leila's neck prickled abruptly, with the sense of eyes upon
her, of glaring, hostile eyes. Leaves rustled, stealthily. She
crouched low over Stan's senseless form, throwing the frail
protection of her slight body athwart him, and quivered with the
knowledge that out of the murk her enemy was creeping silently to
leap upon her and destroy her.</p>

<p>To leap upon her! It was she, Leila Monroy, the unseen
adversary threatened, not Stan! Stan's danger lay only in that
she was with him. Twice that had been proved. If she could lead
the chase away from Stan...</p>

<p>She leaped from her lover's recumbent form.</p>

<p>"Come and get me," she cried, and was hurtling once more
through the lashing, tearing brambles of the woods. Was running
headlong and blindly through the shadowed aisles, not knowing
where she ran, not caring so long as it was away from Stan, so
long as she led the destroyer away from the man she loved.</p>

<p>The forest crashed into sudden life behind her. Some one was
following her, was flinging after her a hollow, echoing shout.
Its threat spurred her to renewed efforts.</p>

<p>Despairing, frantic, the gasping, fear-goaded girl catapulted
through the tearing brambles, crashed into stunning tree-trunks,
caromed off and ran on.</p>

<p>And then, quite suddenly, Leila was out of the forest. She was
running down a wet but grass-soft slope, and before her, across
the familiar pasture, was the yellow-windowed bulk of her own
house, black against a sky tinted by the haunting gray of false
dawn.</p>

<p>Almost at once she was in her own back yard, was leaping up
the back-porch steps, was tugging at the knob of a friendly
kitchen door. It resisted her efforts. It would not open. She
gasped, remembering that she had herself locked it from the
inside.</p>

<p>Unhoped for safety, tantalizingly offered at the last moment,
was snatched away. Leila whirled to meet the fate from which she
had fled.</p>

<p>Silver of the setting moon sluiced an empty field. No one,
nothing, was there. She had outdistanced her invisible pursuer,
had left him behind in the forest.</p>

<p>Or had he fooled her as she had thought to fool him? Had he
left her fleeing blindly through the woods while he turned back
to pounce upon and destroy the lover she had planned to save by
her rejected sacrifice?</p>

<p>Something moved, there in the ribbon of darkness that was the
forest-edge across the fields. Something moved and came lumbering
out into the brooding lunar luminance. A two-headed, grotesque
monster, it came slowly, inexorably out of the shadows. Gelid
fingers clutched Leila's throat. What nightmare thing was this,
what awful spawn of the dark forest?</p>

<p>The porch floor heaved beneath her feet, threw her back
against the paint-peeled door. It wasn't there! She fell backward
through it, fell against a warm, feminine figure.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" Eve Starr exclaimed. "Where have you
been?"</p>

<p>"Close the door," Leila screamed. "Close it." Somehow she was
on her feet again, had her hand on the wood of the portal. She
threw a single terrified glance through the opening&mdash;</p>

<p>And checked the closing panel. Nearer and distinct now in the
silvery light, she saw what it was that had come out of the
woods. Saw Stan's lolling, pallid face. Saw that he was leaning
heavily on the shoulder of another man. Of&mdash;her blood was a
black flood in her veins&mdash;of Foster Corbett! Of his grizzled
father who she thought lay dead at the foot of West Cliff's high
parapet!</p>

<p>She knew now who was Calban's master. She knew now whose high,
shrill whistle it was that had twice driven the monster from his
prey&mdash;to save Stan Corbett&mdash;</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch5" name="ch5">V. &mdash; INTO THE GRISLY
NIGHT</a></h2>

<p class="first">"LEILA," Eve cried. "Why is your door broken
down and the place upset? What's scared you so?"</p>

<p>Leila Monroy twisted to her, fell back in astonishment. The
girl whom last she had seen with a few shreds of torn clothing
fluttering from her lacerated, almost naked form was fully
dressed, her hair carefully arranged, no signs of the wild night
about her.</p>

<p>"I saw your lights come on, after the storm and I came over to
see if anything was the matter. I found&mdash;"</p>

<p>Eve cut off as stumbling feet pounded on the boards outside
the door, as Foster Corbett staggered in with his grey-faced,
limp burden.</p>

<p>"Stan! Mr. Corbett! In the name of all that's holy what's been
going on here?"</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;mind&mdash;now," the older man grunted. "Help
me."</p>

<p>Leila jumped to his side. Together the three lifted Stan from
his wavering legs, carried him in to the living room where, hours
ago, Leila had cringed from the whispered lash of fancied voices
and laid the youth on the couch there. Stan groaned, his lids
flickered open.</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;where&mdash;Dad!" His eyes lighted up. "Leila!
You&mdash;you're both here. Both all right?"</p>

<p>"Fairly all right, son," the old man answered.</p>

<p>There was a black bruise on his brow, another on his check.
His clothing was smeared with the brown loam into which he had
fallen, his shoes were packed with it. Otherwise he seemed
unhurt. His bleared, brooding gaze fastened on Leila, slid to
Eve, went back to Stan.</p>

<p>"We'll do. But you need a doctor. I'll call&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No." Stan shoved himself up to a sitting position and Leila
winced as his face twitched with the pain of the effort. "No. I'm
kind of frayed at the edges, but I'll last. I'm like Eve. I want
to know what this is all about."</p>

<p>Leila started to speak, but the old man beat her to it.</p>

<p>"We'd all like to know that, Stan. Suppose you give us your
story first."</p>

<p>He was starting wrong end to, Leila thought. There was a
reason for that. He was concealing something. Of course he was
concealing something. He was Calban's master. He was the moving
force behind all the terrible events of the night and he wanted
first to hear how much the others knew before he concocted his
own story to fit. She wouldn't interfere. She'd keep quiet and
give him rope enough to hang himself, and then...</p>

<p>But Stan was talking. "I tried to get to Leila, after the
trial, but she was gone by the time I managed to shove through
the crowd. I saw Eve though, told her to tell Leila I'd come to
her as soon as my tour of duty was over.</p>

<p>"The storm caught me as I came up the road. Leila's lights
were all on. I heard a scream from the house, and she didn't
answer when I knocked on the door. That scared me. I went frantic
started to batter down the door. The lights went out just as it
gave way. I ploughed in, yelling for her. The lightning showed me
she wasn't on the lower floor. I started up the stairs. I heard
her scream again. A shot jabbed me. It seared across my ribs,
jolted me off balance.</p>

<p>"I guess I must have gone down on my head and knocked myself
out, because the next thing I knew, it seemed a long time after,
I heard the door close and saw her running into the woods."</p>

<p>Leila's eyes flicked to Eve. The girl was listening open-
mouthed, did not interrupt to correct Stan's misapprehension.
That was queer. Queer as her evident ignorance of all that had
happened to her, or had <i>seemed</i> to have happened to her. If
she had lain, apparently dead, on the bed above, if she had run,
screaming in terror of Leila herself, through the woods, how
could she be so neatly dressed, so undisturbed? The awful doubt
of her own reason closed in once more on Leila with its nameless
fear.</p>

<p>"Unaccountably the brute dropped me, and&mdash;and I fainted
again from loss of blood," Stan finished. "Then you were bending
over me, Dad, were helping me up."</p>

<p>"How about you, Leila?" Foster Corbett turned to her. "What's
your end of the story?"</p>

<p>His eyes bored into her, and in their rheumy depths she saw
little lights of triumph crawl. If she answered, she must convict
herself&mdash;of sheer, incredible madness. Of madness! How could
she tell of finding Eve apparently dead, of the strange scene of
her terror in the woods, when the girl herself was so calm, so
unperturbed, so evidently ignorant of all that? How could she
confess to the attack on Stan's father?</p>

<p>Her mouth opened, closed again. She swayed, put out a groping
hand to the arm of a chair to keep herself from falling. And Eve
came to her rescue!</p>

<p>"Can't you see how weak she is, Mr. Corbett?" the dark-haired
girl indignantly exclaimed as she jumped to Leila's side and
helped her into the chair. "She can't talk!"</p>

<p>"But we've got to get at the bottom of this thing," Corbett
insisted. "There's something damned queer going on!"</p>

<p>"Seems to me you've got a story, too," Eve countered. "Why
don't you tell it?" Had the same thought occurred to her, too,
Leila wondered, that the old man had taken charge of the
situation in order to cover up his own guilt? "How come you were
out there in the woods at this time of the morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Dad," Stan put in. "That's puzzling me, too."</p>

<p>Corbett made a peculiar little gesture with his gnarled hands,
as of defeat.</p>

<p>"I can't help much," he said. "But I'll tell what I know. When
the storm broke I thought of Leila and looked out of my window to
try and see if she were alone over here. The lightning struck
into that line of poplars between our farms. I saw some one among
them just at the spot where we found Shean Rourke&mdash;a dark,
crouching figure watching the Monroy house. There was something
indescribably menacing in his pose, and it flashed on me that
perhaps we had been all wrong about Justin's being Rourke's
murderer, that perhaps this was the real killer, and that now he
was after Leila.</p>

<p>"He started moving in the moment I glimpsed him, dodging low
in the high grass of the pasture. I lost sight of him. I ran to
the phone to warn Leila. I just had time to tell her to lock her
doors and windows when the wire went dead. I snatched up my gun,
ran out to come to her aid.</p>

<p>"Her lights were going on, I saw her shadow going from window
to window, pulling the screens across them. And then I saw the
fellow I'd spotted before. He had climbed to the little roof over
the kitchen porch, was sliding into a window up there.</p>

<p>"I knew that because of my own warning Leila would not open
the door to me. By the time I got her to understand, the prowler
would catch her, would kill her. My only course was to go after
him the way he had entered, try to catch him before he did any
damage.</p>

<p>"The storm redoubled in violence and I am an old man. It took
me hours, it seemed, before I managed to get to the house, before
I managed to climb up to that small, slanting roof. I heard a
muffled scream from inside as I got into the room up there, heard
a damnable pandemonium going on. The room was pitch black and a
minute passed before I found the door and got out into the
hall.</p>

<p>"Just as I did so, the door crashed in below. I twisted to the
stairway, heard some one shout down there as he came in, could
not make out the words. Then I recognized Stan's voice, and in
the same instant some one screamed behind me.</p>

<p>"Some one screamed and a black form surged at me from
somewhere behind, struck me. The blow jolted my finger that was
pressing the trigger of the gun and fired the shot. I whipped
around, in time to see that same dark, grotesque form pounce on
Leila and carry her off. I shouted, did not dare shoot for fear
of hitting her.</p>

<p>"The invader hurtled along the corridor, dived into a room at
the very end. I went after him, yelling for Stan."</p>

<p>"I was out, dad, and didn't hear you."</p>

<p>"So I know now. That room door was jammed, and by the time I
opened it the chamber was empty. But the window was open and
through it I saw the kidnaper vanishing into the wood, Leila
still on his shoulder. I saw that he must have climbed down a
rainspout that passed the window, but I didn't dare follow that
way.</p>

<p>"The head of the back stairs, however, was at this end of the
corridor. I ran down them, out through the back door again,
across the fields and into the forest where I had seen the fellow
vanish.</p>

<p>"In the storm I couldn't trail him. I shouted, fired off my
gun in the hope Leila would respond. In vain. Then the storm was
over, as suddenly as it had begun. The clouds started to break.
Moonlight, sifting through, showed me trampled bushes, shreds of
a girl's clothing caught on briars. I followed that trail,
reached the face of West Cliff. Just above where the spoor ended
I saw the mouth of a cave, thought I sensed movement within it.
Possibly, I thought, my shots had scared the kidnaper away and
Leila was alone up there. I started to climb up to it. Suddenly
rocks started to fly down at me. One struck me on the head. I
felt myself falling, struck the ground and lost consciousness."</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">IT fitted, Leila thought, his story fitted. Was
it the truth or a tissue of lies? Somehow it explained everything
too patly, everything except who the Monster was and where he had
come from, except the mystery of Eve Starr's weird part in the
dreadful night. Eve's face was an expressionless mask, her
unfathomable eyes fixed on Corbett's seamed, horribly tired
countenance.</p>

<p>"When I came to I heard the sounds of struggle, far-off. A
pile of dead leaves had cushioned my fall, I wasn't badly hurt. I
staggered to my feet, ploughed through the woods, and found Stan,
knocked out."</p>

<p>Or had he come on that scene just a little earlier, in time to
whistle off Calban, in time to send the Monster ravening after
her through the woods. Was he playing still for a chance to get
her alone, to finish her? The speculation wrenched a groan from
the bemused girl.</p>

<p>"Leila!" Eve exclaimed. "You're white. You look as though you
were going to faint. I'll get you some water."</p>

<p>She was out of the room as her sentence ended. The kitchen
door swung closed behind her.</p>

<p>"Leila," Foster Corbett spun to her. "What do you know of
Eve's actions tonight? Had you seen her?"</p>

<p>A scream sliced across his amazing question, a scream from
behind the kitchen door. Corbett slewed around. Gun in hand, he
hurled himself across the room, pounded that door open. The
brick-walled room beyond was starkly, gruesomely vacant, but the
back door was just slamming shut and from beyond it a thin, high
wail of infinite terror told where Eve had vanished.</p>

<p>"He's got her, now," the old man yelled. "I was wrong. Come
on, Stan!" And then he, too, was gone into the grisly night.</p>
<hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch6" name="ch6">VI. &mdash; MONSTER AT PLAY</a></h2>

<p class="first">LEILA MONROY came up out of her chair, fighting
the intangible but cloying threads of her weakness, fighting a
giddy nausea that whirled within her skull and tweaked at the pit
of her stomach. Through that dizzy whirlpool she saw Stan's vague
form dart past her, lurched to follow it. The room seemed to
whirl about her as she moved, there was a wall where the door
should be, a wall into which she jolted.</p>

<p>Half-stunned, she pawed at the partition, found the door away
from which she had reeled in her vertigo, reeled through. The
kitchen, a place of black, threatening shadows, danced about her.
She staggered across it, stabbed at the outer door, missed it,
pulled in an agonizing breath and tried again.</p>

<p>This time Leila contrived to grab the doorknob as it went by
and steadied herself by it. Gripping the jamb with her other
hand, she fought to get the portal open, succeeded.</p>

<p>Something lay, a black, unmoving bulk, on the porch outside.
Stan! It must be Stan, her bewildered fear jabbed at her and she
went to her knees beside it. She pawed at it, her blurred vision
still refusing to clear...</p>

<p>The body came suddenly alive. Rolled over. The apelike,
ferocious visage of the Monster glared at her, black lips curling
away from yellow fangs in a strange, jabbering laugh of bestial
triumph.</p>

<p>A scream sliced her throat and then Calban's gigantic arms
flailed around her, crushing her to him, crushing her ribs,
damping that scream to silence in her breathless lungs. He surged
to his feet, bringing her up with him as though she had no weight
at all. He lurched back into the house with her.</p>

<p>Through the kitchen, the living room, he ploughed, chuckling
lewd glee. Into the foyer hall he shouldered, the piggish little
eyes under his beetling brows lurid with an obscene light, his
calloused, rasping fingers writhing as though with some vile life
of their own on her shrinking, quivering flesh. Leila's larynx
swelled once more with a shriek, but Calban caught her intention
by some unhuman second-sight and gagged her&mdash;gagged her
horribly with the pressure of his slobbering, evil lips on hers
in a kiss of ultimate horror.</p>

<p>Crushed thus in the viselike cradle of the beast-man's arms,
gagged thus by his insufferable caress, Leila knew that he was
carrying her up the broad stairs to the passage above. To the
passage where her own room was, <i>her own bed</i>&mdash;</p>

<p>No doubt now, no doubt at all, of what the brute-man
intended.</p>

<p>No doubt of what he intended or of what had happened. He had
been waiting outside, had grabbed Eve and&mdash;killed her,
probably. Foster Corbett had taken advantage of the girl's one
cry to get out of the way himself, to get Stan out of the
way&mdash;and had sent back his creature to finish off Leila.
Stan's unlooked for presence time and time again had interfered
with his macabre plans, but Stan was out of the way now and Leila
was in Calban's power, being carried up to the room where the
night's horror had begun and now would be consummated.</p>

<p>Calban was in the room, thrusting the door shut with a
dexterous foot as he passed through it, twisting to the bed with
a swift surety that told of curious familiarity with its
location. Even in that terrible moment Leila noted
that her white spread was rumpled and blood-flecked, that the
indentation of a contorted figure was still visible on it. Then
Calban had flung her stunningly down on the bed, had pinned her
to it with a digging, cruel knee as he tore avidly at what was
left of her clothing.</p>

<p>"Pretty," he jabbered, as he had jabbered before in the
forest, "Pretty. Calban likes."</p>

<p>He paused to gloat over the quivering beauty his violating
paws had revealed. "Calban likes very much."</p>

<p>Leila's tortured eyes fled from the evil anticipation of his
thick-lipped, drooling mouth, slid past the muscles of his
terrible arms. Her hopeless gaze slid along the walls of her
familiar room that now was a cell of madness and despair, reached
the door. It was opening! Slowly, silently, it was opening and
white fingers jogged its edge.</p>

<p>The girl's heart leaped.</p>

<p>"Please," she whimpered pulling her gaze back to her
tormentor. "Please, Calban, let me go." At all costs she must
distract his attention, keep him from noticing the advent of her
rescuer. "I'll pay you. I'll give you lots of money,
jewels..."</p>

<p>The Monster gibbered his mindless laugh. "Calban no want
money, jewels. Calban want pretty woman, white, soft flesh of
pretty woman. Like this&mdash;"</p>

<p>And suddenly he leaped away from her, leaped to the center of
the room and whirled to the opening door. Some sixth sense had
warned him of danger...</p>

<p>Stan jumped into the room, a long carving knife in his hand
that must have come from the kitchen below.</p>

<p>"Leila!" he yelled. "Run, jump out of the window. I can hold
him long enough!"</p>

<p>Calban roared, plunged at him. Stan met the attack with a
darting slash of the knife, caught the Monster across the
knuckles. The beast-man's other fist crashed against the
trooper's shoulder, slammed him against the wall. Leila screamed,
started up from the bed.</p>

<p>Calban twisted to her. A flick of his long arm pounded her
back to the creaking mattress. Stan rebounded from the wall,
sliced at Calban. The giant sprang backward, avoiding the rush,
dropped to the floor and rolled toward the trooper.</p>

<p>Leila was out of the bed, was darting once more toward the
window. Black digits closed on Stan's ankles, heaved upward. The
trooper was flung high into the air. He twisted lithely, came
down on his feet, crouched to meet his snarling adversary's
lunge. Calban's juggernaut rush swerved at the last instant and
the girl felt the impact of his fists once more, blasting her
headlong away from attempted escape. She sprawled, brought up
thumping against the wall.</p>

<p>Stan ducked forward, slashed a long cut across the other's
leathery cheek. Calban squealed, more in rage than pain, and
exploded into a swift blur of action which Leila's eyes could not
follow nor Stan avoid. Suddenly that whirling battle was static,
terribly static.</p>

<p>Stan hung from the giant's tight clutch on his wrists, hung
from arms stretched horizontally out from his shoulders in that
terrific grip. Crucified on an invisible cross, the trooper's
body was a taut arc of suffering, his face a fish-belly white,
sweat-wet mask of hideous torture.</p>

<p>A low moan squealed from his rigid throat, squealed into
sound. "Get out&mdash;Leila&mdash;your chance..." gurgled into a
nondescript gust of agony as Calban's gargantuan span of whipcord
muscle widened to crack the bone-jointures in his shoulders with
the gruesome power of its living torture-rack.</p>

<p>Leila's way to the door was clear as long as Calban held the
straddle-legged pose he must to continue his grisly torment of
her lover. This was her chance to escape.</p>

<p>She shoved away from the wall to which that last fierce buffet
had flung her, came up to her feet. Came up to her feet with the
light bedroom chair in her hands, leaped toward Calban and
pounded the improvised weapon down on his head.</p>

<p>The chair splintered, smashed. Calban let Stan drop and
whirled to Leila. He was laughing, he was actually laughing!</p>

<p>"She-devil," his twitching lips spewed. "Calban like you that
way." His hands lashed out, his fingers dug into the girl's
shoulder, sent fiery agony darting through her twisting, almost
nude body. "Calban like woman that can fight, but can't play now.
Must finish with man first. Tear arms out, legs, like fly's
wings."</p>

<p>"No," Leila screamed. "No. Leave him alone. Do what you want
with me, but leave him alone."</p>

<p>Calban's simian visage was distorted by his yellow-toothed,
imbecilic grin. "Calban do what he like with both." She was
helpless, infantile in his great hands as he flung her once more
on the bed, as he ripped the sheets into strips and lashed her
ankles, her wrists; lashed them tightly, cruelly, pulling the
knots with sadistic violence. The rough edges of the torn linen
cut into her shrieking flesh, were scarlet-edged with oozing
blood.</p>

<p>On the floor behind the savage giant a long shudder ran
through Stan Corbett's crumpled frame, and he was crawling,
crawling as a stepped-upon beetle&mdash;might in whom life was
not yet quite extinct. But unlike that beetle the man moved with
a definite purpose. A yard beyond his shaking, bloodless hand lay
the knife he had dropped. A yard&mdash;to his anguish enfeebled
body that yard was an infinite distance. But if he could reach
that knife...</p>

<p>Leila, seeing, stoppered in her throat the moans of her own
agony sought to wrench from her and contrived a question to hold
Calban long enough for Stan to succeed.</p>

<p>"What will your master say if you harm him? Your master
doesn't want you to..."</p>

<p>"Calban have no master," the brute roared, rage flaring into
his little eyes. "No one tell Calban what must or must not do."
Dismay pierced Leila as he twisted away from her, as he lurched
toward Stan, whose scrabbling fingers were still inches away from
the knife. "No one..."</p>

<p>The whistle shrilled in, the whistle that twice before had
saved Stan. A vague figure blotted the window's dim
rectangle.</p>

<p>"Mr. Corbett," Leila screamed. "He's killing Stan. Calban's
killing..."</p> <hr> <br>

<h2><a id="ch7" name="ch7">VII. &mdash; A BARGAIN WITH THE
FIEND</a></h2>

<p class="first">IT wasn't Foster Corbett who came surging in
through the aperture. It was Eve! Astoundingly it was Eve.
"Calban!" she yelled.</p>

<p>The whistle hadn't stopped the monster this time. He was
lifting the lacerated, almost unconscious man from the floor by
one hand, and his other was at Stan's throat!</p>

<p>"Calban!" Eve cried again. "Stop it!"</p>

<p>The giant paused. Over the limp, lolling frame of his victim
he glared at the dark-haired girl, his face a gargoylesque,
demoniac visage.</p>

<p>"No," he chattered. "Calban will not be cheated any more.
Calban will kill the man, and take the woman, and your lies will
not stop him again."</p>

<p>"Calban! I did not lie to you." Grotesque, hideous, this
colloquy between the slim, darkly-beautiful girl whom Leila
Monroy had known all her life, and the beetle-browed, barrel-
chested savage who was an atavism from the very dawn of time. "It
was you who forgot our bargain and tried to force from me what I
promised would be yours when you finished the task I set you. If
you hadn't attacked me, choked me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Oh God! It was blasphemous even to think his name in the
presence of that woman!</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you fiend," Leila burst out. "You brought him here
to kill me. You&mdash;"</p>

<p>Eve's glance flicked to her, and it stung Leila as if the evil
in it were a barbed whiplash of frozen steel.</p>

<p>"Shut up!" she hissed. "You don't count, now."</p>

<p>Then she was concentrating on the giant.</p>

<p>"Calban," she pleaded, "let him go. Let him live."</p>

<p>Lurid light-worms crawled sinisterly in the brute's small
eyes. "No," he grunted, and his throttling fingers started again
to close, bit by cruel bit, on Stan's throat. "No. You want him,
and you'll never give yourself to Calban while he lives."</p>

<p>"That's it, is it?" Eve's cry was abruptly a hollow whisper of
defeat. "That's what I must pay to save him? Here, then, Calban.
Here!"</p>

<p>Her hands flew to her throat, her fingers fumbled at the high,
lacy collar that veiled it. Then the flimsy silk was ripping; as
those white hands tore down through it; ripping away from her
chest, the creamy, heaving rounds of her desirous breasts, the
taut, quivering hollow of her abdomen. The shredded fabric slid
down the long line of her thighs, reached the floor, and she
threw out her arms to the beast-man in an abandon of seduction
noisome as the uttermost depths of Hell, and glorious as Heaven
itself. Glorious because, whatever the woman was, whatever evil
had driven her, she descended now into Hades to save the man she
loved!</p>

<p>The man she loved! In that moment the whole story was clear to
Leila. Eve loved Stan and&mdash;</p>

<p>Calban whimpered. He let his victim fall. He lumbered;
uncouth, shaken by the tempest she had aroused within him; to the
naked, alluring form of the temptress, luminous-seeming in the
moonlight glow. His black arms slid around that voluptuous
form...</p>

<p>By some accident of the inscrutable fates, Stan had dropped
right atop the knife he so futilely had struggled to reach. His
twitching, bloodless hand closed on its hilt...</p>

<p>Eve moaned, shudderingly, as Calban's shaggy arms enfolded
her&mdash;That moan seemed to explode in Stan with a sudden,
spasmodic strength. He lifted to his knees, flung the
knife...</p>

<p>Point first, it was a silver flash streaking the moonlight,
and then it was a black excrescence, quivering from the middle of
Calban's back. Blood spurted...</p>

<p>The monster squealed with the sudden pain. His great hands
gripped the woman they had been fondling, flung her from him in a
paroxysm of rage. She catapulted into the wall. The crackling
thud of crushing bone sickened Leila...</p>

<p>And then the bound girl was screaming in terror for her lover
as the wounded beast-man whirled and plunged ferociously at the
trooper, who was swaying on his knees, was toppling over from the
effort alone of throwing that knife. Calban's writhing fingers
closed on Stan...</p>

<p>Thunder crashed in the room. It was the thunder of Foster
Corbett's gun, blazing from the doorway. Long, orange-red jets of
flame seared across the room. Calban's great form jolted to the
impacts of the lethal lead, once, twice. He collapsed like a
ripped meal sack, rolled over near his intended victim, quivered
and was still.</p>

<p>Foster Corbett came in. He was mud-covered, from head to foot.
A blue bruise blotched the seamed gray of his face and one
trouser leg flapped, grotesquely somehow in two disjointed
halves.</p>

<p>But the man's old, tired eyes glowed with a strange
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"You gals sure can play hell," he growled, "when you get to
fighting over a boy." He picked up the knife and sliced Leila's
lashings, then bent to his son's flaccid form.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is he&mdash;?" Leila dared not finish the question,
but Corbett understood and answered it. "No. He's just knocked
out and he's coming out of it now. He'll be all right by noon, I
imagine, right enough to stand up with you in front of the parson
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He wouldn't marry me, now," Leila moaned. "He wouldn't marry
the daughter of a madman."</p>

<p>"Madman, hell," Corbett grunted, swinging around to Eve's
crumpled, moaning body. His gnarled fingers probed the girl's
hurts with a curious tenderness. Then, "I'm afraid you're
through, Eve," he said. "Maybe things will be a little better for
your soul, where it's going, if you tell Leila yourself..."</p>

<p>White lips moved in face that was agony incarnate.</p>

<p>"Yes... I... swore you... never would have... Stan. Calban...
imbecile living caves... West Cliff... everybody thought...
monster. I... made friends with him... got him kill... Rourke...
throw blame your father... kill Stan's love for you. It's...
killed me instead." A gush of blood burbled from her lips, she
writhed to a sitting position, threw out her arms. "Forgive me,
Stan."</p>

<p>And then there wasn't an Eve Starr any more. Only a pitiful,
nude corpse, slumped in a corner of the dreadful room.</p>

<h3>* * * * *</h3>

<p class="first">THEY pieced it together afterward, the tale of
that dreadful night. How, learning of Stan's message that her
plot had failed, the love-maddened girl must have determined to
have her mindless dupe kill Leila. How she must have sneaked into
Leila's bedroom, either up the ram-spout ladder or through the
same window that Calban had entered. How the imbecile must have
attacked her, choked her to insensibility on the bed, been scared
away by Leila's rush, by Stan's pounding on the doorway below...
Had been scared away, and then had attacked Foster Corbett,
kidnapped Leila.</p>

<p>Eve had recovered, had gone out into the woods to make certain
Calban had gone for Leila. The frightened girl's questions had
given her the clue to Leila's fear of her own madness. She had
played on that to torture her, to lure her deeper into the woods,
into Calban's clutches. But Stan's appearance had once more
disrupted her plan.</p>

<p>Because she loved him she had saved him then. She had saved
him again later, when the imbecile took matters into his own
hands. But she had been able only at terrible cost to herself to
save him the third time...</p>

<p>"It was horrible," Leila shuddered, shrinking into Stan's
arms. "It was a nightmare out of hell's vilest depths."</p>

<p>"But it ended happily, my darling." Stan's lips were warm,
under her ear. "Like the fairy stories. 'And so they were married
and lived happily ever after.'"</p>

<p>"Ever after," Leila murmured. "But the ending of our fairy
story is even better. Look!"</p>

<p>Under the poplars that till now had divided the Monroy and the
Corbett farms, that till now had made a line of ancient enmity,
two old men stood. The taller one, Justin Monroy, pointed to the
ground, made a gesture with his forefinger as though he were
drawing a boundary. Foster Corbett nodded. The two shook hands
gravely.</p>

<p>"They've got it settled at last, that old fight."</p>

<p>"Doesn't make much difference any more, does it, Leila? The
two farms will belong to one little fellow pretty
soon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Leila Corbett cried, blushing. But she
knew. Even if they had only been wedded a short hour before, she
knew what her husband meant.</p>
